The corresponding deﬁnition for integrals that are improper at the left endpoint only is easy to write down. Convergence tests for improper integrals are similar to some of those for series. The important results are the following, which we state without proof. Absolute convergence test. If ∫ b a |f (t)| dt converges, then so does ∫ b a f (t) dt. Comparison test. If |f (t)| ≤ g(t) for a < t < b, and if ∫ b a g(t) dt converges, then ∫ b a f (t) dt also converges. Tutorial questions — Improper integrals 1. Write down the deﬁnition of ∫ b a f (t) dt if the integral is improper at t = a only. 2. If σ > a, prove from the deﬁnition of convergence that ∫ ∞ T0 Ke −(σ−a)t dt converges. 3. (a) Using the deﬁnition of convergence, show that ∫ ∞ 1 x−p dx converges for p > 1. Evaluate the integral in terms of p, and indicate the region whose area is represented by the integral on the sketch below. (b) Similarly, show that ∫ 1 0 x−q dx converges for 0 < q < 1, evaluate the integral in terms of q, and indicate the corresponding region on the sketch.

The Laplace transform of f (t) exists provided (i) ∫ T 0 f (t) dt exists for all T > 0, and (ii) f (t) is of exponential order, i.e., |f (t)| does not grow faster than exponentially as t → ∞. (We shall assume that all functions we deal with satisfy these two properties.) Proof. Condition (ii) says that |f (t)| < Ke at for t > T0 say, where K, a, and T0 are positive constants. From (i) it follows that ∫ T0 0 e −stf (t) dt exists for all s. Let σ = Re(s); if t > T0, then |e −stf (t)| = e −σt|f (t)| < e −σtKe at = Ke −(σ−a)t. By direct integration (see Question 2) it is easy to see that if σ > a, then ∫ ∞ T0 Ke −(σ−a)t dt converges, so by the Comparison Test ∫ ∞ T0 e −stf (t) dt also converges. Thus both ∫ T0 0 e −stf (t) dt and ∫ ∞ T0 e −stf (t) dt exist for Re(s) > a, and their sum is L(f (t)) . TSF Chapter 1 5 Corollary. If α, a, b are constants, and a and b are real, then L(e αt) = 1 6 7. Find the Laplace transforms of cosh bt and sinh bt, and compare them with those of cos bt and sin bt. 8. (a) Take Laplace transforms of the terms in the Maclaurin series for e t, using sigma notation and the formula for L(tn). Sum the resulting (geometric) series in s, and hence conﬁrm the formula for L(e t). (b) Repeat (a) with sin t in place of e t. (c)* Similarly, ﬁnd L( sin t TSF Chapter 1 7 in the null space of L. It can be shown that, with minor restrictions on the allowable functions in the t-domain, the null space of L consists only of functions that are zero except at isolated points. Thus the inverse transform is essentially unique, and we denote it by L−1(F (s)) . (More precisely, L−1(L(f (t))) may diﬀer from f (t) at isolated values of t, but we shall ignore this diﬀerence.)

Use Heaviside’s inversion formula to ﬁnd L−1( 1 10 The values f (0), f ′(0), . . . , f (n−1)(0) are just constants, which may be given explicitly, or treated as arbitrary constants, or evaluated from other information supplied. Thus this corollary says that if n is a positive integer, then L(f (n)(t)) = snL(f (t)) plus an arbitrary polynomial of degree < n. If f (t) and its ﬁrst n − 1 derivatives are all zero at t = 0 (the zero-state initial condition), then the formula simpliﬁes to L( f (n)(t)) = snL( f (t)) . *More generally, it follows easily by linearity that for an n-th order D-operator Q(D) we have L( Q(D)f (t)) = Q(s)F (s) plus an arbitrary polynomial in s of degree < n, simplifying to L( Q(D)f (t)) = Q(s)F (s) in the zero-state situation.

If f (t) = tn, where n is a natural number, show that f (0) = f ′(0) = · · · = f (n−1)(0) = 0 and that f (n)(t) = n!. (Hint: d r TSF Chapter 1 11 Theorem.

By deﬁnition L( (f ∗ g)(t)) = ∫ ∞ 0 e −st(f ∗ g)(t) dt = ∫ ∞ 0 e −st ∫ t 0 f (u)g(t − u) du dt. t u u=0 u=t t=u t=¥ Figure 1.2. Region of integration when transforming a convolution In the repeated integral, the region of integration (0 < t < ∞ and 0 < u < t) is the triangle between the lines u = 0 and u = t in the (t, u) plane, as shown in Figure 1.2. By interchanging the order of integration this becomes 0 < u < ∞ and u < t < ∞, and we obtain ∫ ∞ 0 e −st ∫ t 0 f (u)g(t − u) du dt = ∫ ∞ 0 ∫ ∞ u e −stf (u)g(t − u) dt du. In the inner integral u is constant, and we can substitute w = t − u, so dw = dt and 0 < w < ∞, giving ∫ ∞ 0 (∫ ∞ u e −stf (u)g(t − u) dt) du = ∫ ∞ 0 (∫ ∞ 0 e −s(u+w)f (u)g(w) dw) du = ∫ ∞ 0 e −suf (u) ∫ ∞ 0 e −swg(w) dw du = L( f (t)) L( g(t)) , which is the required result. 14 *This result shows that, ignoring transients, a stable D-operator system Q(D)y = f (t), can be represented in the s-domain as Y (s) = 1 TSF Chapter 1 15 References The following table lists the relevant sections in the recommended text books. 16 10.
