bile duct, hepatic artery & portal vein) between porta hepatis & duodenum ▪ Hepatogastric ligament between the groove for ligamentum venosum and lesser curve of the stomach 8 ▪ Gastric & pyloric (for right, anterior stomach) ▪ Duodenal (superior, 1st part of duodenum) ▪ Fossa for gallbladder (gallbladder) ▪ Colic (right colic/hepatic flexure & transverse colon) ▪ Renal (right kidney) ▪ Suprarenal (right suprarenal gland) 9 ▪ Portal vein ▪ ≈75-80% of blood ▪ Carries nutrient rich blood to sinusoids of liver (partially oxygenated) ▪ Formed by superior mesenteric vein & splenic vein ▪ Hepatic artery ▪ ≈20-25% of blood ▪ Supplies blood to primarily non- parenchymal structures (intrahepatic bile ducts) ▪ Hepatic artery proper  common hepatic artery  coeliac trunk ▪ Central veins → collecting veins → left, intermediate and right hepatic veins, between segments (intersegmental) → IVC (inferior to diaphragm) 10 ▪ Right lobe ▪ Left lobe ▪ Quadrate lobe ▪ Caudate lobe 11 Accessory lobes, part of right lobe ▪ Secondary divisions supply medial and lateral hepatic divisions & posterior (caudate) segment ▪ Tertiary divisions (3 of 4 secondary) supply 7 of 8 hepatic segments ▪ Left lobe – left anterior & posterior lateral segments ▪ Right lobe – left medial segment, right anterior & posterior medial segments and right anterior & posterior lateral segments ▪ Caudate lobe – posterior segment 12 ▪ Major lymph producing organ (1/4 to 1/2 lymph to thoracic duct) ▪ Superficial lymphatics in subperitoneal fibrous capsule of the liver ▪ Deep lymphatics in connective tissue around vessels (portal triad & hepatic veins) ▪ Superficially anterior → hepatic nodes → coeliac nodes → cisterna chyli 13 ▪ Superficially posterior of both diaphragmatic and visceral surfaces → bare area of liver → phrenic lymph nodes → through diaphragm → posterior mediastinal lymph nodes ▪ Other: ▪ Posterior surface of left lobe → left gastric lymph nodes ▪ Anterior central diaphragmatic surface, along falciform ligament → parasternal lymph nodes ▪ Round ligament of liver → umbilicus → lymphatics of anterior abdominal wall 14 ▪ Sympathetic – coeliac ganglion (greater splanchnic) ▪ Parasympathetic – anterior & posterior vagal trunks ▪ Coeliac plexus → hepatic plexus → liver via hepatic a & portal veins ▪ Vasoconstriction (only known function) 15 ▪ Carry bile from liver to duodenum ▪ Hepatocytes → bile canaliculi → interlobular biliary ducts → collecting bile ducts → left & right hepatic ducts → porta hepatis → common hepatic duct → (joined by cystic duct) bile duct 16 ▪ Bile duct ▪ 5-15cm ▪ Descends posterior to 1st part of duodenum ▪ In groove on posterior surface on head of pancreas ▪ Left of descending duodenum, within C, bile duct approaches main pancreatic duct ▪ Main pancreatic and bile ducts unite in wall of duodenum, form hepatopancreatic ampulla in major duodenal papilla ▪ Sphincter of bile duct (circular smooth muscle) - close, blocks, backs up bile so stored & concentrated in gallbladder 17 ▪ 7-10 cm long pear-shaped organ ▪ Lies in fossa for gallbladder (visceral surface of liver) attached by connective tissue of fibrous capsule of liver ▪ 3 parts: ▪ Fundus – wide end, projects below inferior border of liver (right 9th costal cartilage @ MCL) ▪ Body – in contact with visceral surface of liver, transverse colon & superior part of duodenum ▪ Neck – narrow, tapered part toward porta hepatis, makes S-shaped bend to join cystic duct 18 ▪ Cystic duct: ▪ 3-4 cm long ▪ Joins gallbladder to common hepatic duct ▪ Mucosa of neck forms spiral fold, acts as valve to keep cystic duct open 19 Blood supply: ▪ Cystic artery  right hepatic artery Venous drainage: ▪ Neck and cystic duct → cystic veins → join veins from hepatic duct & upper bile duct → portal vein or enter liver directly ▪ Fundus & body → visceral surface of liver → hepatic sinusoids Lymphatic drainage: ▪ Cystic lymph nodes (near neck) → hepatic lymph nodes → coeliac lymph nodes 20 ▪ Innervation: ▪ Coeliac ganglia (greater splanchnic) – sympathetic & visceral afferent fibres (pain) ▪ Vagus nerve – parasympathetic (contract gallbladder & relax sphincters at hepatopancreatic ampulla) ▪ Right phrenic nerve – somatic afferent fibres (pain referred) 2122 ▪ Liver tissue replaced by fibrotic, scar tissue and regenerative nodules ▪ Consequence of liver disease → e.g. alcoholism, hepatitis B & C ▪ Generally irreversible ▪ Scar tissue blocks portal flow of blood through liver ▪ Portal hypertension → most severe complications https://img.medscape.com/thumbnail_library/ps_200904_liver_cirrhosis_800x450.jpg 23 ▪ Concretion of cholesterol crystal ▪ More common in women (and at higher ages) ▪ 50% asymptomatic ▪ Symptoms only caused by large stones ▪ Injury of gallbladder ▪ Pain referred to epigastric region and right hypochondrium (later) ▪ Obstruction of ducts→ Biliary colic → cholecystitis ▪ Pain to posterior thoracic wall and right shoulder (diaphragm) https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/cms/attachment/bd866710-1710-4748-9bc3-2e38c8d0700a/gr1.jpg","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
