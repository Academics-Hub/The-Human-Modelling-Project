An increase in dietary protein improves the blood glucose response in persons with type 2 diabetes1–3 Mary C Gannon, Frank Q Nuttall, Asad Saeed, Kelly Jordan, and Heidi Hoover ABSTRACT Background: In single-meal studies, dietary protein does not result in an increase in glucose concentrations in persons with or without type 2 diabetes, even though the resulting amino acids can be used for gluconeogenesis. Objective: The metabolic effects of a high-protein diet were com- pared with those of the prototypical healthy (control) diet, which is currently recommended by several scientific organizations. Design: The metabolic effects of both diets, consumed for 5 wk each (separated by a 2–5-wk washout period), were studied in 12 subjects with untreated type 2 diabetes. The ratio of protein to car- bohydrate to fat was 30:40:30 in the high-protein diet and 15:55:30 in the control diet. The subjects remained weight-stable during the study. Results: With the fasting glucose concentration used as a base- line from which to determine the area under the curve, the high- protein diet resulted in a 40% decrease in the mean 24-h integrated glucose area response. Glycated hemoglobin decreased 0.8% and 0.3% after 5 wk of the high-protein and control diets, respectively; the difference was significant (P < 0.05). The rate of change over time was also significantly greater after the high-protein diet than after the control diet (P < 0.001). Fasting triacylglycerol was significantly lower after the high-protein diet than after the con- trol diet. Insulin, C-peptide, and free fatty acid concentrations were not significantly different after the 2 diets. Conclusion: A high-protein diet lowers blood glucose postpran- dially in persons with type 2 diabetes and improves overall glu- cose control. However, longer-term studies are necessary to deter- mine the total magnitude of response, possible adverse effects, and the long-term acceptability of the diet. Am J Clin Nutr 2003;78:734–41. KEY WORDS Dietary protein, diabetes, diet, insulin, glucagon, glycemic index, triacylglycerol, glycated hemoglobin, Hb A1c INTRODUCTION When dietary recommendations for the general population or for persons with diabetes are considered, the focus has been on the relative amounts and types of carbohydrates and fat to include in the diet (1–4). Both the type and amount of protein in the diet has largely been ignored. Generally, protein has only been con- sidered in the context of that necessary for maintenance of lean body mass, ie, that needed to maintain nitrogen balance, whether people have diabetes or not. A role for dietary protein in the 1 From the Metabolic Research Laboratory and the Section of Endocrinol- ogy, Metabolism, and Nutrition, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Cen- ter, Minneapolis (MCG, FQN, AS, KJ, and HH), and the Departments of Food Science and Nutrition (MCG) and Medicine (MCG, FQN, and AS), University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. 2 Supported by grants from the American Diabetes Association, the Min- nesota Beef Council, and the Colorado and Nebraska Beef Councils and by Merit Review Funds from the Medical Research Service, Department of Vet- erans Affairs, Minneapolis. 3 Address reprint requests to MC Gannon, Metabolic Research Laboratory (111G) Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN 55417.

However, as early as 1913 (5), it was reported that the ingestion of egg white protein in a single-meal study did not result in an increase in the blood glucose concen- tration in healthy persons. Subsequently, data from several labo- ratories (6, 7; reviewed in reference 8)—including our own (9–13)—indicated that the peripheral glucose concentration does not increase after protein ingestion in healthy persons or in per- sons with type 2 diabetes. In persons with type 2 diabetes, protein ingestion actually results in a small decrease in postprandial glu- cose concentrations (8, 14). In a single-day study in which mixed meals of various composition were fed to healthy young subjects, the protein content of the meals was calculated to also lower the blood glucose concentration (15). To our knowledge, the effect on glucose metabolism of a high-protein, weight-maintenance diet ingested over a longer period of time has not been reported. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that a 5-wk period of increased dietary protein results in a lower plasma glucose con- centration in persons with mild, untreated type 2 diabetes. The responses of glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, triacylglycerol, and nonesterified fatty acids to a high- protein diet are included in this report. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Twelve subjects (10 men and 2 women) with mild, untreated type 2 diabetes were studied in a Special Diagnostic and Treat- ment Unit (SDTU), similar to a Clinical Research Center. All sub- jects met the National Diabetes Data Group criteria for the diag- nosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (16).
