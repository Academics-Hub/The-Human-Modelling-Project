SPINAL (DORSAL ROOT) GANGLIA Cell Bodies Processes (Axons and Dendrites) SPINAL (DORSAL ROOT) GANGLIA Cell Bodies Processes (Axons and Dendrites) NOTE: The neuronal cell bodies of the dorsal root ganglia are “clumped” together, and one cannot see any processes entering or leaving the cell bodies. The processes (axons and dendrites) are seen towards the edge/periphery of the group of cell bodies.
