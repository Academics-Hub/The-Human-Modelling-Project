Excess secretion of thyroid hormones a) results from a dietary deficiency of iodine. b) is caused by autoantibodies against the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor. c) causes higher than normal plasma TSH concentration. d) causes exophthalmos (protruding eyes). e) increases metabolic rate. 3. Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease) is associated with a) a low blood glucose concentration. b) a high plasma ACTH concentration. c) a decreased blood volume. d) a metabolic alkalosis. e) an increased plasma sodium concentration. 4. Aldosterone receptor antagonists a) increase Na+ reabsorption by the kidney. b) increase blood volume. c) decrease blood pressure. d) cause a metabolic alkalosis. e) increase plasma K+ concentration.
