Subdivisions are:  Pre- and post- chiasmatic  Cistern of lamina terminalis  Supracallosal cistern 4) Cistern Ambiens  Between splenium of corpus callosum and superior surface of cerebellum  contains great cerebral vein and pineal gland 13 Hydrocephalus Definition: • Excess accumulation of CSF which produces an elevated intracranial pressure and in infants can cause swelling of the ventricles. • Also known as ‘Water in the brain’ • It could be Congenital or Acquired Possible causes of congenital Hydrocephalus: • Overproduction of CSF • Obstruction at some point within ventricular system • Problems with CSF absorption 14 Congenital Hydrocephalus Anatomy of Lumbar puncture (Spinal Tap) • Withdrawal of CSF from lumbar cistern. • Based on absence of spinal cord below L2 with large space to S2 • Preferred Site;  Level of vertebra between L3 & L4 or L4 & L5 • Slight damage or injury to nerve roots of cauda equina present at this level • Introduction of the troca between vertebral lamina is rather difficult except at lumbar levels 15 Questions • Review the locations of the ventricles • Describe the Formation, Circulation and Absorption of the Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) • What are the functions of the CSF • List the sites of the cerebrospinal cisterns and contents • Define hydrocephalus and list three likely causes. 16","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
