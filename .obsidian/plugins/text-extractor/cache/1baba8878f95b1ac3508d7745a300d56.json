Westerhoft, Jean-Jacques Meister*, and Nico WesterhofS Abstracr-In earlier studies we found that the three- element windkessel, although an almost perfect load for isolated heart studies, does not lead to correct esti- mates of the total arterid paranieters such as the aortic characteristic impedance and total arterial compliance. To overcome this problem we add a fourth element, the total arterial inertance, to the three-element wind- kessel. The three- and four-element windkessels were tested against an extended model of the systemic cir- culation. The four-element windkessel described arte- rial pressure and flow most accurately and the estimated lumped parameters were typically within 10% of the actual values of the arterial system. The three- and four element windkessel model were also fit to in vivo human aortic pressure and flow waves. Again, the four-element windkessel fitted better and the estimated arterial parameter values were closer to values obtained with standard methods. INTRODUCTION The purpose of this study was to resolve the limitations of the thra-clement windkessel model [ll. We hypothesized that an inertial term is missing from the three-element windkessel model. We have thus reconsidered the four-element windkes- se1 model that was first proposed by Burathi and Gnudi in 1982 121. This model is shown schematically in Figure 1 and includes an inertial element, L, in parallel with the character- istic impedance. This arrangement offers the advantages that we have previewed: it can account for the inertia of the whole arterial system at low frequencies and at medium/high fre- quencies permits the characteristic impedance to come into play. To be entirely convinced, however, that the inertial ele- ment is correct and justified, we have to show that: 1. The inertia term has a physical meaning. In other words, show that L corresponds. indeed, to the total in- ertia of the arterial system (sum of all mass terms in the arterial system), and it is not a simple fudge factor. The introduction of the inertia term leads to a signifi- cant improvement over the three-element windkessel. This will be judged by statistical means (quality of the fit to pressure and flow data) as well as by the accuracy of the estimates of the lumped parameters values. 2. ~ ~~ *Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, PSE-Ecublens, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland, E-mail: stergiopulos@eldp.epfl.ch; ?Dept.

On the basis of an extensive distributed model of the sys- temic circulation we obtained ascending aortic pressure and flow. The model was used in three situations: control, doubled peripheral resistance and halved total arterial compliance. The three-element and the four-element windkessel were then fit- ted in the time domain using aortic flow as input. Peripheral resistance (ratio of mean pressure and mean flow) was given so that only two parameters of the threeelement windkessel (R,, C) and 3 parameters of the four-element windkessel (L, R,, C) had to be estimated. The three-element and the four-element windkessel mod- els were subsequently fitted to in vivo human aortic pressure and flow waves. We have analyzed a type A and a type C beat. The type A beat is characteristic of a subject with augmented wave reflections whereas the type C is typical of a subject with small or late reflections. Lacking an absolute reference for their actual parameter values, the estimates of the total compliance and characteristic impedance were compared to the ones obtained by other standard methods. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We fitted the windkessel-predicted pressure to the aortic pressure, and compared the so estimated parameter values to the actual lumped parameter values of the arterial systcm. Both the three-element windkessel and the four-element wind- kessel predict pressure wave shapes that are close to the mea- sured pressure waves. Similar estimations were performed during increased peripheral resistance and decreased total arterial compliance. The estimated parameters are given in Table 1.

The parameter estimates of the four-element windkessel are much closer to the actual values than the parameters esti- mated from the three element windkessel (Table 1). The rela- tive errors in total arterial compliance estimated from the three-element windkessel and the four-element windkessel, are, when averaged over all three conditions (Table 1): 15% and 8%, respectively. The estimates of characteristic imped- ance are in general low for both the three-element and four- element windkessel. However, the four-element windkessel estimations are much better (average error 10%) than those of the three-element windkessel which consistently underesti- mated the characteristic impedance by 40-50%. Total arterial inertance is estimated very accurately by the four-element windkessel, with errors in the order of 5% or less (Table 1). in vivo human data The estimated lumped model parameters together with the RMS values of residual sum of squares are given in Table 2. In the Same Table are given the “actual” parameters of the sys- temic arterial tree (peripheral resistance, total arterial compli- ance and characteristic impedance) estimated by standard techniques. The in vivo results show that the fourelement windkessel fits the data better than the three element-windkessel. The dicrotic notch is better represented by the four-element wind- ..

Also, in diastole the four-element windkessel predicts a pressure decay that stays close to the actual pressure than is found for the three- element windkessel. The predicted diastolic decay of the three-element windkessel crosses the actual pressure decay and has a markedly different slope. This reflects a large over- estimation in compliance by the three-element windkessel . The estimates of the lumped parameter values given by the four-element windkessel model are closer to the “actual” ones as compared LO the esiimates of the three-element windkessel. For the total arterial compliance the deviations were less than 4% for the four-element windkessel compared to 36% (typc A) and 108% (type C) for the threeelement windkessel. The four-element windkessel underestimated characteristic imped- ance by 22% while the three-element by approximately 50%. The estimates of total inertance are similar for the type A (L = 0.00548 mm Hg s2/ml) and type C beats (L = 0.00527 mm Hg s2/ml). REFERENCES [I] N. Stergiopulos, J.-J. Meister, and N. Westerhof.
