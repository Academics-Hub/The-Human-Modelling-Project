{"path":"Physiology/Physiology Practicals/Blood - practical.pdf","text":"BLOOD PRACTICAL The present practical focuses on measurements that relate to blood and blood function. Blood has many functions, but some major functions include the provision of nutrients such as oxygen to tissue, the removal waste products, and the provision of protection through immune responses. The importance of blood to survival is exemplified by the elaborate physiological systems that have developed to prevent blood loss through coagulation pathways and other mechanisms. In the present practical you will perform measurements that relate to these blood functions. In this regard, you will assess functions related to the cellular components of blood including red and white cell, as well as platelet function. You will also perform measurements that test the capacity of blood to coagulate that depends on coagulation pathways. These measurements provide important information regarding abnormalities that occur in a number of disease processes and many of these measurements are used to guide the management of clients or patients with blood disorders. It is therefore important that you are able to perform and interpret these measurements that provide insights into the causes or consequences of alterations in blood function. In the present practical you will get the opportunity to assess the function of a blood sample. Clinical cases are provided in this practical session against which you should compare your findings and answer the questions given. Practical 2 stations: Each practical station has its own demonstration video. Double click on the video icon to download and save, or scan the QR code where hard copies are provided. STATION A: Erythrocytes A-1: Blood groups. A-2: Haemoglobin concentration. A-3: Haematocrit. STATION B: Coagulation B-1: International normalized ratio (INR) test for coagulation. B-2: Whole blood clotting time. Bleeding time (theory only) STATION C: Inflammation (online only) C-1: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate C-2: C-reactive protein A: Erythrocytes STATIONS A 1-3 For blood to achieve the function of oxygen transport, the number of red blood cells (RBC) and the haemoglobin (Hb) content (to which oxygen binds) of these cells needs to be within a range that enables adequate oxygen delivery under varying conditions of oxygen demand by cells. As you will learn during the course of the year, there are a number of clinical conditions that lead to reductions in these components of the blood. A decrease in RBC number and Hb content in the blood results in anaemia, and the consequent decrease in the capacity of blood to carry oxygen is called anaemic hypoxia (decreased oxygen supply). There are a range of measurements performed on red blood cells to identify the presence and cause of anaemias and this practical is designed to give you insight into some of these assessments. Although the RBC number or the Hb content of the blood may not be diminished; because of a decreased overall volume of the blood, a reduction in the water content of blood may limit the ability of blood to maintain oxygen transport. This is called stagnant hypoxia. The water content of blood is decreased in disturbances of body fluid balance such as diarrhoea or excessive sweating. Importantly, by studying the proportion of blood that consists of largely RBCs relative to that which consists of plasma (the so-called haematocrit), vital clues to the presence of disturbances of body fluid balance may be gained. In this regard, instead of observing a decreased proportion of cells relative to plasma, as one would expect to occur in anaemia; when water is lost from blood, the consequence may be an increased proportion of cells relative to plasma. In the present practical you will also have the opportunity to consider the factors that influence the haematocrit. When large volumes of water are lost from the body, this lost fluid in many circumstances may be replaced by giving patient’s water that contains electrolytes or nutrients, but not the cellular component of blood, either orally (e.g. the oral rehydration fluid described in practical 1), or intravenously. However, a critical clinical intervention required when patients lose large volumes of blood, rather than water, is to replace this lost blood with all of the components of blood including the cellular components. The vital cellular constituent in these circumstances is the RBCs, without which blood cannot provide sufficient oxygen to tissue. However, replacing blood in a patient who has lost blood is not a simple matter of giving the recipient blood taken from any random donor. This is because all cells, including RBCs, contain proteins in the cell membrane that differ from individual to individual depending on their genetic make-up. If RBCs from a donor are given to a recipient who does not normally have those proteins on the RBC membrane, the consequence is the recipient’s immune system will recognize the RBCs given to them as foreign and will mount a response that will destroy the “foreign” RBCs (incompatibility reaction). To prevent incompatibility reactions when blood transfusions are performed, the proteins on RBCs of both the recipient and the donor blood are first identified by typing the RBC membrane proteins. This is to ensure that the RBCs of the recipient are compatible with those RBCs of the donor. These proteins are called blood groups. The present practical will also give you an opportunity to type your blood (identify the blood groups that you have) and to understand the physiological principles that underlie blood typing, blood groups and incompatibility reactions. STATION A-1 Blood groups In order to identify your blood group you should perform the following at STATION A-1: - Place 2-3 drops of your blood into the saline provided. If you can see through the suspension add 1 or 2 more drops of blood. - Mark 3 circular areas on a white tile with the wax pencils provided and label them “A”, “B”, and “D”. - Place 1 drop of blood suspension in each marked circle and add ONE DROP of relevant antiserum (A, B or D). - Rock the tile gently to mix. - Do not allow the drops to dry out (add a drop of saline to rehydrate if necessary). - If you note very fine, but distinct red granules, then agglutination has occurred. - Agglutination with Ant-D may take longer than with ant-A or Ant-B. Interpretation If agglutination: 1) occurs in circle A only, then your blood group is A. 2) occurs in circle B only, then your blood group is B. 3) occurs in both circles, then your blood group is AB. 4) does not occur in either circle, then you are blood group O. 5) occurs in circle D, then you are Rhesus positive. 6) occurs not occur in circle D, then you are Rhesus negative. Record your blood group Blood group……………….…………………………………………………………… Notes: A negative test in circle D does not necessarily indicate the absence of the D antigen. In some individuals, the RBCs may contain the DU antigen which is the quantitatively weaker form of the D antigen. Detection of the DU antigen requires a more sensitive technique. The blood group test works best if the ratio of antibody-to-antigen is optimal (the maximum number of binding sites on each red cell is occupied by the least number of antibodies). If you obtain a negative result repeat the test using a suspension containing more RBCs. Questions 1) Explaining your answer, indicate the blood group from a person who is a: i) universal donor. ii) universal recipient. 2) A mother is pregnant with her second child. Discuss the implications of this for both the foetus and the mother if the mother is: i) Rh negative and the foetus is Rh positive. ii) Rh positive and the foetus is Rh negative. iii) O positive and the foetus is AB positive. STATION A-2 Haemoglobin concentration In order to assess your blood haemoglobin concentration, you should perform the following two methods at STATION A-2: Method 1: - Using the glass pipette provided, place a few drops of blood from your blood tube onto the chamber surface of the haemoglobinometer. - Haemolyse your blood by gently agitating it with a haemolysis applicator (small stick). - Push the chamber into the clip provided. - Insert the chamber into the chamber compartment of the haemoglobinometer. - Hold the instrument to your eye and with one hand, depress the button on the bottom of the haemoglobinometer, which activates the light. - Use your other hand to manipulate the indicator button on the right side of the instrument until the fields appear as one with no difference in the colour intensity. - DO NOT THROW AWAY THE GLASS CHAMBER Haemoglobin concentration………………………………………………………… Method 2: - Using the haemoglobinometer provided, measure your blood haemoglobin concentrations as follows: - Turn on the haemoglobinometer by pressing the centre button. - Insert a strip into the haemoglobinometer as shown on the haemoglobinometer (i.e. the side with two circles on the strip facing up). - Using the pipette provided, place a drop of blood from your blood tube onto the larger circle (there will be a green flashing light behind the circle). - Once the blood is on the strip, the haemoglobinometer will start counting down. Once the haemoglobinometer reaches 0 the strip is automatically read by the haemoglobinometer and your haemoglobin concertation value will display (the haemoglobinometer will also give you an estimated haematocrit value). - Discard the used strips in the designated container. Record your Hb concentration displayed by the haemoglobinometer. Haemoglobin concentration………………………………………………………… Questions Two patients (A and B) with nutritional deficiencies complained of tiredness and an inability to walk far without having to frequently stop and rest. On examination they were noted to have the signs indicated in the following photographs which can be better observed by studying the photographs provided in the laboratory. The following blood results were obtained on the patientsPatient’s hand Patient A Patient B Haemoglobin (g/dl) 6.0 7.6 Haematocrit (%) 32 36 Mean cell volume Decreased Increased Mean cell haemoglobin concentration Decreased Increased Question 1: Compare your haemoglobin concentration with that given for patients A and B above with nutritional deficiencies. Based on these differences provide a physiological explanation for the symptoms and signs noted in the two patients. Question 2 Using the data given for patient’s A and B (above), and explaining your choice, decide whether patient A or B has either: i) a deficiency of iron, ii) or a folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. STATION A-3 Haematocrit In order to assess your blood haematocrit, you should perform the following at STATION A-3: - Fill a capillary tube with blood your blood. - Once the tube is full, seal ONE end of the tube with Hct clay. - Place the tube in the centrifuge as directed by the demonstrator. - Once the centrifuge is full the tubes will be spun at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. - Take your tube out of the centrifuge and determine your haematocrit using a haematocrit gauge. Record your haemocrit in the space provided: Haematocrit…………………………………………………………………………… Questions Two patients (A and B) with nutritional deficiencies complained of tiredness and an inability to walk far without having to frequently stop and rest. On examination they were noted to have the signs indicated in the following photographs which can be better observed by studying the photographs provided in the laboratory. The following blood results were obtained from the patientsPatient’s hand Patient A Patient B Haemoglobin (g/dl) 6.0 7.6 Haematocrit (%) 32 36 Mean cell volume Decreased Increased Mean cell haemoglobin concentration Decreased Increased Question 1 Provide a physiological explanation for the differences noted between your haematocrit and the haematocrit values given for patient’s A and B (appendix). Question 2 The data for patient A, who you had the opportunity to evaluate in practical 1, are provided below. The 14 month old dehydrated boy shown in the photograph had diarrhoea at the time of presentation. You should study the photograph provided in the laboratory to better observe the clinical signs (indicated on the photograph in the laboratory). The child’s body weight is indicated in the photograph provided and his legs were mildly oedematous. The following blood and urine results were obtained in the child: Plasma Na + (mmol/l) 150 (Normal value=135-148) K+ (mmol/l) 3.1 (Normal value=3.3-5.0) Glucose (mmol/l) 3.2 (Normal value=3.4-6.1) Urea (mmol/l) 9.4 (Normal value=2.5-6.6) Albumin (g/l) 26 (Normal value=35-55) Urine Specific gravity 1.045 (Normal value=1.005-1.045) Volume (l/24 hours) 0.5 (Normal value=0.9-4.0) Assuming that this patient had a haematocrit value of 62 %, explain the differences noted between your haematocrit and this patient’s haematocrit. B: Coagulation To prevent blood loss when tissue trauma results in vessel damage, a number of physiological changes occur. However, a critical function of blood to prevent blood loss is normal coagulation, which is controlled by coagulation (clotting) pathways and a normal platelet number and function. STATION B-1 International normalized ratio and prothrombin time. A routine laboratory test that is regularly employed to assess the propensity to reduced coagulation is the prothrombin time (PT) from which the International normalized ratio (INR) is derived using the formula: Patient PT Normal PT (15 seconds for our laboratories) Normal values are 1.0-1.25. Values greater than 2.0 are considered abnormal in patients not receiving anticoagulant therapy. In order that you may calculate INR, you should measure PT using the following procedure at STATION B-1: - A fresh blood sample has already been obtained in an anticoagulant which removes Ca2+ from the blood (Ca2+ is required for coagulation). - The blood sample has been centrifuged for 5 minutes. - 0.2 ml of pre-warmed innovan (recombinant thromboplastin which also contains Ca2+) has been pipetted into a tube. - You should add 0.1 ml of the plasma to the innovan and start a stopwatch at the same time. Record the time taken for clot formation as: Prothrombin time…………………………………………..seconds Questions Question 1 Calculate the INR…………………………………………………………… Question 2 Explaining your answer, indicate the coagulation pathway that the INR tests the function of. Question 3 Abnormalities of coagulation result in a range of clinical presentations, including excessive bruising (haematomas-clinical case C), bleeding into joints (clinical case D) and the formation of large (purpura) or small pinpoint (petechiae) haemorrhages throughout the body including the skin (cases E and F). These bleeding disorders may cause extensive tissue damage and lead to death. Thus, the detection of the causes of abnormalities of coagulation is an important aspect of clinical assessment. The clinical abnormalities for cases C-to-F given below. Explaining your answer in each case, indicate whether INR would be altered in these patients. STATION B-2 Whole blood clotting time and bleeding time Additional measures of the ability of blood to coagulate are the whole blood clotting time, which is the time taken for whole blood to coagulate and the bleeding time which is the time taken for bleeding to stop once a wound occurs (i.e. from a practical perspective, the time taken for cessation of bleeding after producing a small skin puncture). In the present practical you will be given the opportunity to measure whole blood clotting time, consider the factors that determine the values obtained, and also consider whether abnormalities in these coagulation indices would be observed in cases C-to-F provided. Whole blood clotting time In order to assess your whole blood clotting time, you should perform the following at STATION B-2: - Approximately 4 ml of a fresh sample of your own blood will be obtained (from your cubital vein) in a red topped tube by an experienced nursing sister. Record the time at which your blood is taken. - Gently tilt this tube every 15 seconds until the consistency of the blood changes and record the time again. Record the time taken for the change in the consistency of your blood to occur: Whole blood clotting time…………………………………………………………… Questions Question 1 Explaining your answer, indicate the coagulation mechanisms that are being activated to produce a change in the consistency of your blood. Question 2 Explaining your answer in each case, indicate whether patients B-to-E shown on the next page (from practical 1) would have abnormalities of whole blood clotting time. Bleeding time Although we will not ask you to assess bleeding time because of the potential hazards related to needle-sticks, you should nevertheless know how to perform the measurement. In order to assess bleeding time, rub the patient’s finger until it is warm, clean the finger with an alcohol swab, allowing the alcohol to dry and then puncture the cleaned area of the finger to the depth of about 2-3 mm using a sterile lancet. At 15 second intervals remove a drop of blood exuding from the wound with the edge of a piece of filter paper, taking care NOT to touch the surface of the skin with the paper (Use a fresh edge of the paper for each drop). Count the time taken for the bleeding to stop and record this time. Questions Question 1 Describe the pathways activated to stop the bleeding when assessing bleeding time. Question 2 Explain the differences in the mechanisms responsible for the whole blood clotting time and the bleeding time. Question 3 Explaining your answer in each case, indicate whether patients B-to-E given on the previous page (from practical 1) would have abnormalities in the bleeding time. C: Inflammation: Please note that stations C 1 and 2 will only be offered online (i.e you will not be expected to perform the experiments during your practical). Please note those will be examined in your test and exams. STATIONS C 1-2 Part of normal blood function is to generate protection against invading organisms or foreign bodies (including tumours) and to remove dead tissue that has been generated by trauma, infections, lack of blood supply or other causes. This is the major function of white blood cells and immunoglobulins (synthesized largely from white blood cells) as part of normal immune responses. Sometimes an immune response is also generated against a patient’s normal tissue, changes which occur in auto (self)-immune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and a number of other similar diseases. In other instances, the immune response that is generated in response to a foreign body may be so aggressive that it is toxic to the body, such as may occur in allergies. In all of these instances, the immune response generates inflammatory reactions which are designed to destroy foreign organisms and substances or to destroy dead tissue. The degree of inflammation is a good index as to the severity of these disease processes and can be routinely measured in blood samples. The presence and extent of inflammatory reactions can be detected using blood markers, such as an increase in the number of white cells in the blood, or alternatively through measurements that reflect changes that occur in response to inflammation. Two such changes that occur in the blood are increases in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and in plasma concentrations of C- reactive protein. The following demonstrations will assist you with understanding changes in these blood variables. STATION C-1 The erythrocyte sedimentation rate The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) assesses the rate of gravitational settling of anticoagulated red blood cells in one hour from a fixed point in a calibrated tube of a defined length and diameter held in an upright position. Although the ESR utilizes erythrocytes in the assessment, it is important for you to understand that the ESR is not a measure of red blood cell function in the body, but rather an index of inflammatory changes in the body. The following discussion will explain this apparent conundrum. The rate of sedimentation of red blood cells is determined by “rouleau” formation, where red cells clump together and hence are subject to greater gravitational effects. Normally red cells carry a negative charge and hence repel each other, thus opposing the formation of a rouleau of cells. High molecular weight proteins, such as the coagulation factor, fibrinogen, are positively charged and hence tend to attract red cells and encourage rouleau formation. In inflammatory processes, substances like fibrinogen are increased in concentration in the plasma, and hence encourage red cell rouleau formation. Thus, in inflammation, the ESR will increase. However, ESR is not a very specific marker of inflammation as it may also increase with temperature changes, pregnancy, the use of corticosteroids, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and with smoking. Watch the video above and record the ESRs observed in the two samples. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate………………………………………………mm Normal ESR: Males: 3-5 mm in 1 hour 7-15 mm in 2 hours Females and children: 4-5 mm in 1 hour 12-17 mm in 2 hours Questions Question 1 Describe the physiological mechanisms that explain changes in the ESR in inflammatory states. Question 2 Compare the ESRs obtained from the two samples (provided in the video), indicating possible reasons for the differences. Question 3 Giving reasons for your answer indicate a possible diagnosis in patient 1. STATION C-2 C-reactive protein concentrations C-reactive protein (CRP) is a substance synthesized in the liver in response to inflammatory substances in the blood (particularly the cytokine substance released from white blood cells, interleukin-6). Hence, in infections, auto-immune diseases, allergies, trauma, injury to tissue, and malignancies, where immunological responses occur, CRP is synthesized and released from the liver into the blood. The function of CRP is to act as an opsonin (a substance that renders bacteria and other cells susceptible to phagocytosis) by activating the complement pathway. Because plasma CRP concentrations are closely associated with the degree of inflammatory changes, plasma CRP concentrations are commonly measured in inflammatory conditions to monitor responses to therapy or to assess the presence, severity or risk of a disease. The name CRP is derived from CRP’s ability to react with the C-polysaccharide isolated from pneumococcal (a bacteria) cell walls.
