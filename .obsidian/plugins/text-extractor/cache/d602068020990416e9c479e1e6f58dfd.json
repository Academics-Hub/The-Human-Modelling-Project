Along metazoan evolution, an exquisite control developed because although oxy- gen is required as the final acceptor of electron respiratory chain, an excessive level could be potentially harmful. Understanding the role of the main factors affecting oxygen availability, such as the gradient of pressure of oxygen during normal conditions, and during hypoxia is an important point. Several factors such as anaesthesia, hypoxia, and stress affect the regulation of the atmospheric, alveolar, arterial, capillary and tissue partial pressure of oxygen (PO2). Our objective is to offer to the reader a summarized and practical appraisal of the mechanisms related to the oxygen’s supply within the human body, including a facilitated description of the gradient of pressure from the atmosphere to the cells. This review also included the most relevant measuring methods of PO2 as well as a practi- cal overview of its reference values in several tissues. Keywords: Hypoxia, gradient of pressure, pressure of oxygen, altitude acclimation, barometric pressure Introduction The human body is a highly aerobic organism that consumes oxygen according to its meta- bolic demand [1]. During aerobic respiration the presence of oxygen in addition to pyruvate, produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), thus yielding energy to the entire organism [2]. To maintain homeostasis, the amount of oxygen within the tissues should respond to a gradient of pressure that pushes oxygen by diffusion throughout the membranes into the tissues [3]. The amount of dissolved oxygen within the tis- sues and the cells depends on several factors including: barometric pressure (BP), climato- logical conditions (temperature, relative humid- ity, latitude, altitude), as well as physiological, pathological, and physical-chemical processes within the organism itself [4, 5]. The composition of gases within the tropo- sphere is constant at approximately the follow- ing ratio: 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon and finally less than 0.038% for carbon dioxide and other gases [6]. Dalton’s law establishes that within a combina- tion of any given gases, the total pressure is the same as the sum of the partial pressures of each individual gas present in that mixture [7]. Thus, the partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2) depends mainly on the atmosphere’s baromet- ric pressure (BP) and its fractional concentra- tion [8]. Geographical altitude is an important factor affecting BP, because as altitude increases, the amount of gas molecules in the air decreases, so the air becomes less dense than at sea level. At sea level BP is about 760 mmHg, although can be affected not only by altitude: latitude, humidity, temperature and even the season of the year may also affect BP [9, 10]. This changes are normally local, conse- quently, short-term temporal (time scale of min- utes, hours, days and weeks) variations in BP in a same location usually range around 5-15 mmHg [9]. Partial pressure of oxygen Within the troposphere (lowest region of the atmosphere), PO 2 depends on several vari- Partial pressure of oxygen in humans 2 Am J Blood Res 2019;9(1):1-14 ables, but mainly on barometric pressure (Figure 1) [4]. Under physiological conditions, this relationship will be affected by any change in elevation or by modifying the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) under controlled circum- stances [3, 11, 12]. Atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen (AtmPO 2) Humans depend on oxygen for survival, and this gas is acquired from the atmosphere where the partial pressure of oxygen ( AtmPO 2) within (37°C), and it is strongly temperature depen- dent [11]. This results in an effective reduction at the alveolar level in the partial pressure of oxygen (PAO 2) from 159 to 149 mmHg that is not likely to be physiologically relevant at sea level, because only represents about 6% of the total AtmPO 2 [16]. However, when the BP is already low, such as at the summit of Mount Everest (altitude 8,848 m), a reduction of 47 mmHg (the water vapour pressure) represents almost 20% of the available AtmPO 2, making this reduction life threatening [17, 18]. Figure 1. Relationship between elevation and Barometric Pressure (filled cir- cles) and Atmospheric Partial Pressure of Oxygen (hollow circles). *Calculations were based on the standard atmosphere and were done by the authors. Figure 2. Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) at different altitudes in humans accord- ing to the values given in several reports [3, 4, 12, 17]. the troposphere depends on BP according to the Dalton’s Law [13]: AtmPO 2 = 0.21 · 760 mmHg = 159 mmHg Humans are constantly exposed to changes in BP, either artificially or natural- ly, thus, pressure of ins- pired oxygen (as well as the other gasses) its inver- sely proportional reduced among those exposed to hypobaric or normobaric hypoxia [3, 14] (Figure 1). Alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO 2) Once air is warmed and humidified in the nose and upper respiratory tract, the pressure of oxygen decrea- ses while concentration of H 2O increases, thus alter- ing effective PO 2 in this gas mixture. Therefore, oxygen partial pressure within the upper airway is noted in- spired PO 2 (PiO 2) [15]. The reduction of pressure of oxygen is caused by the addition of water vapour (humidification) to the en- tire mixture of gases, thus reducing the pressure of the other gases [4]. The pressure of water vapour is constant at 47 mmHg at normal body temperature Partial pressure of oxygen in humans 3 Am J Blood Res 2019;9(1):1-14 Moreover, once the inspired air has been humidified, there is an additional reduction in PO 2 from the trachea to the alveolus, due to the dead space and the mixing of inspired and expired gases [19]. This fall in the pressure of oxygen from the upper airways to the alveolus is almost all accounted for by the alveolar pres- sure of carbon dioxide (PACO 2) [10, 20]. Since inspired PCO 2 is zero and the PACO 2 is usually in the range of 40 mmHg, the partial pressure of oxygen must fall [21]. When oxygen is transported into the venous pulmonary capillary, an important gradient of pressure from the upcoming arterial blood pushes the CO 2 out to the alveoli [22]. The alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO 2) in the alveoli-capillary barrier at sea level is cal- culated based on the fraction of inspired oxy- gen (FiO 2). At least in the troposphere, air con- tains a standard 20.95% of oxygen, thus the in order to estimate the alveolar PO 2 the following equation is used: PAO 2 = FiO 2 (PB-47) - 1/R (PACO 2) Where R is the respiratory exchange ratio and equals 0.8 most of the time and the 47 corre- spond to the water vapour pressure at normal body temperature (37°) [4]. Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) Once in the lungs, oxygen diffuses across the alveolar-capillary barrier from the alveoli into the arterial circulation. The initial diffusion gra- dient of pressures in the microcirculation aris- es when arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) with a higher pressure is mixed with the pressure of oxygen within the veins (PVO 2) [23]. The rate of oxygen diffusion across the alveoli- capillary membrane in addition to a faster and easier elimination of CO 2, assures that capillary PaO 2 is almost equal to the alveolar PAO 2 and during normal conditions (at sea level) it corre- spond to 75 to 100 mmHg [24]. At sea level, during normal conditions, the par- tial pressure of oxygen in the arteries is high enough to satisfy the oxygen demands for the entire organism [10]. However, during high alti- tude exposure (hypobaric hypoxia), as baromet- ric pressure descends, the pressure of oxygen in the arterial circulation is inversely proportion reduced [25, 26]. This reduction attributes to the significant reduction in AtmPO 2 and deter- mines the actual pressure of oxygen available for tissue and cellular requirements [27, 28] (Figure 2). Tissue partial pressure of oxygen (PtO 2) Once oxygen has reached the arteries, the dif- ference in pressures (gradient of pressure) between the capillary to the cytosol of sur- rounding cells results in a steep diffusion gradi- ent, the greatest in the body reaching more than 42% [4]. The average partial pressure in the tissue is called the tissue partial pressure of oxygen (PtO 2) [10]. The transport of oxygen from the atmosphere into the entire body is mediated by the rate dif- fusion as well as the rate of consumption between physiological barriers [29]. Diffusion is based on the kinetic theory that encompass- es the rapid movement of molecules, causing a self-generated energy source to rapidly cross membranes [30]. Whereas convective trans- port refers to the heat transferred and energy- consuming combination of molecules to cause the movement of oxygen in the trachea and the bronchial tree with the surrounding alveoli-cap- illary circulation [31]. The diffusive transport is the passive movement of oxygen across sever- al barriers, such as the endothelium, the alveo- lus and the mitochondrial membrane [32]. The amount of diffusive oxygen movement depends on the gradient of partial pressure of oxygen, the available surface area to diffusion, the per- meability and thickness of diffusion barriers and the local metabolic demand [33, 34]. Tissue partial pressure of oxygen (PtO 2) is regu- lated by the blood flow, the availability of oxy- gen and the consumption rate from one region to another [3, 24, 35, 36]. The Bohr effect allows that hemoglobin releases more oxygen in response to the metabolic rate of that tissue in highly aerobic tissues [37]. For instance, neu- rons and cardiac myocytes are largely aerobic and depend on the presence of oxygen for their survival, although some lactate can be pro- duced within the brain, most of them depended on the metabolic rate of oxygen consumption [36, 38]. Other cells, such as the bladder myo- cytes or the skeletal myocytes are more toler- ant to hypoxia, and are able to obtain energy without the presence of oxygen for longer peri- ods of time than can neurons in the brain [10].

The gradient of partial pressure of oxygen, from the extracellu- lar space into the cell determines the availabil- ity of oxygen to the mitochondria [39, 40]. In highly aerobic cells, such as the neurons, energy production depends largely on the avail- ability of oxygen supplied to the mitochondria [41]. Inside this organelle, a series of enzyme- catalysed chemical reactions occur, converting metabolites into carbon dioxide and water to generate a form of usable energy in the form of high energy phosphates [42]. Although it has long been reported that the intracellular partial pressure of oxygen (iPO 2) drops around the oxygen-consuming organelle, the mitochondrion PO 2 must be very small [39]. Various attempts to determine the gradient of oxygen between the mitochondria and the extracellular fluids have led to some incongru- ous results [40, 43, 44]. Reported values range from one type of cell to another and ranges from below 1 mmHg measured by indirect methods to 1 to 10 mmHg by intracellular direct methods [45]. The classic insensitivity of mito- chondrial respiration to local PO 2 has been challenged recently by in vivo [46] and in vitro [47] studies, in which mitochondrial oxygen consumption is dependent on PO 2 over the full physiological range. Partial pressure of oxygen in different tissues Once the arteries bring O 2 to the cells, the dif- ference in pressure between the arterial vascu- lar lumen and the tissue will cause that gases that are at higher pressures diffuse to those tissues with lower pressure, exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO 2) in both directions [29]. The average partial pressure in the tissue along this diffusion gradient is called the tissue partial pressure of oxygen (PtO 2) and varies according with oxygen consumption, capillary density, metabolic rate and blood flow [10, 48]. While under normal circumstances alveolar PO 2 is equal to 104 mmHg, the lungs will trans- fer this oxygen through the alveolar-capillary barrier, reaching the same PO 2 (104 mmHg), however, before reaching the left atria, the pul- monary shunt blood coming from the bronchial veins (40 mmHg) will mix with blood from pul- monary veins, reaching the atria with an arterial PO 2 of 95 mmHg. This is known as “pulmonary venous admixture” [10, 49]. From the aorta, the amount of oxygen that is released from the hemoglobin will depend upon the metabolic demands from that specific organ, that are usually matched to the arterial oxygen supply and vasomotor sensitivity [50]. In the following section we summarized the range of PO 2 according to the type of tissue, describing in more depth those which have more available data in humans. It is important to point out that due to the lack of studies in controlled environments, an specific range mean value is hard to be provided, therefore, we state the reference value according to the lowest-highest range described (Table 1). Partial pressure of oxygen in the brain The brain is an organ with one of the highest oxygen and glucose requirements, although it is not able to store metabolic products for fur- ther use, its blood supply is highly dependent of vasoactive substances, arterial blood gases and metabolic demand allowing the availability of these nutrients [3, 65, 66]. Changes in tissue brain Partial Pressure of Oxygen depends on the cerebral metabolic rate (CMR), the local cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the systemic exposure of hypoxia [3, 36, 67, 68]. Brain PtO 2 can change due to several fac- tors like CMR, hypoxia, exercise, angiogenesis, stress and Anesthesia [3]. In general and con- sidering that humans are in constant activity and many cofounders cannot be controlled, the available evidence suggest that cortical PtO 2 ranges from 20-25 mmHg in rest and low alti- tude and reach up to 48 mmHg in high altitudes or intense physical activity [51, 52, 69]. Partial pressure of oxygen in the liver The liver receives more than 6% of the cardiac output per minute and more than 26% of the cardiac output when considering the portal venous system [10]. This organ seems to be highly oxygenated, however, during sympathet- ic vascular tone changes, anesthesia, restrain- ing and also depending of the method of mea- surement, liver tissue PO 2 fluctuates [56].

Partial pressure of oxygen in humans 7 Am J Blood Res 2019;9(1):1-14 liver can survive with less than 60% of the total liver blood supply due to sympathetic electric nerve stimulation, resulting in an important reduction of tissue PO 2, however under normal conditions the very few reports available in humans refer that PO 2 ranges from 50-55 mmHg [56, 70]. Partial pressure of oxygen in skeletal muscle The muscle is a highly effective oxygen con- suming tissue that responds to blood flow requirements and oxygen availability [71]. The local tissue oxygenation of the skeletal muscle is highly variable, being skeletal muscle one of the most tolerant tissues to hypoxia and meta- bolic acidosis [72]. Tissue oxygenation level depends on the rate of oxygen supply and the rate of oxygen consumption per tissue [73]. The critical level in which the muscle will suffer isch- emia has not been explored, however, muscle PO 2 and its relationship with systemic factors such as sepsis and infections have been report- ed several times [58, 74]. Considering the reports available, skeletal muscle oxygenation ranges from 7.5 to 31 mmHg [74]. Partial pressure of oxygen in the skin The skin is one of the most vasoactive tissue within the body, reacting strongly to sympathet- ic, thermic and metabolic changes [10]. At rest and in neutral thermal conditions, less than 2% of the total cardiac output goes to the skin [75], however, fluctuations in skin blood flow are always occurring due to sympathomimetic vari- ability [76]. The oxygen availability measured locally depends on the influence of the microcir- culation and the skin PtO 2 ranges according to the skin layers. The more external layer ranges from 3.2 to 8 mmHg, the papillary dermis from 6.4 to 24 mmHg and below the subcutaneous fat, the skin PtO 2 ranges from 8 to 38 mmHg [53, 75]. Methods to measure tissue partial pressure of oxygen Several methods have been used to measure the availability of oxygen within the tissues (PtO 2). In Table 2 we summarize the methods that are available nowadays with some techni- cal specifications such as the mechanism of measurement, the site of data collection and minimum sample volume needed (Table 2). Qualitative methods to measure tissue PtO 2 The most common qualitative methods avail- able to measure brain PtO 2 include, but are not limited, to positron emission tomography (PET), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [77, 78]. Positron emission tomography (PET) Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imag- ing technique that uses positron emitting iso- topes which are injected into the tissue to pro- vide a three-dimensional image or picture of functional processes in the body [79]. The parameters used to measure brain oxygenation are based on the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) or the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO 2). The use of PET in brain oxygenation studies has been reported several times, although its use is reduced in the clinical set- ting due to its high cost and technical complex- ity [77, 80]. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) Near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) is a technolo- gy based on light absorption in the near infra- red spectrum (700-1000 nm) [81]. It is charac- terized for its ability to scatter through skin, bone and other tissues, thus detecting low resolution but real time changes in regional hemoglobin content and rarely with brain cere- bral perfusion [82, 83]. Blood oxygenation level dependent MRI (BOLD MRI) Oxyhemoglobin has diamagnetic properties whereas deoxyhemoglobin is a paramagnetic molecule [84]. These magnetic properties can be used as an endogenous source of contrast to visualize tissue oxygenation [85-87]. This technology can be used to measure brain oxy- genation based on the concept that changes in deoxyhemoglobin modulate the MRI signal intensity. For example, an increase in regional cerebral blood flow caused by neural activity is accompanied by a local reduction in deoxyhe- moglobin content [88]. Quantitative methods to measure brain PtO 2 The physical and chemical characteristics of oxygen can be measured according to its spe- Partial pressure of oxygen in humans 8 Am J Blood Res 2019;9(1):1-14 cific interaction with determined oxygen-reac- tive molecules [89]. The measurement of tissue partial pressure of oxygen (PtO 2) is expressed in mmHg, kPa or Torr and is one of the main “direct” measurements of oxygen- ation in the tissue [77]. Polarographic microelectrodes Molecules of oxygen are electron acceptors and this oxidative reaction can be measured using microelectrodes [90]. This oxygen reduc- tion reaction allows a signal that creates a potential difference which is recorded by the electrode [91]. The use of this type of elec- trodes has allowed the measurement of brain PtO 2 during various conditions, including head trauma, brain surgery, hypothermia and hiber- nation [92-96]. Electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry Electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry (EPR) is a spectroscopic technique that detects chemical species that have unpaired electrons [97]. EPR oximetry is a relatively non-invasive method for monitoring tissue partial pressure of oxygen (PtO 2) using paramagnetic oxygen sensitive materials including perchlorotriphe- nylmethyl molecules or lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc) crystals [85, 97-100]. The fundamental mechanism of this technique is the detection of unpaired electron species which react with the implanted materials (i.e. LiPc crystals) [101]. The identification of these chemical species co-existing in the determined paramagnetic spectrum can be observed and interpreted as oxygen tensions [100, 102- 104]. The use of EPR oximetry for the study of tissue oxygenation allows multiple measurements to be performed through the use of crystals that are highly sensitive to low PtO 2 [98]. The advan- tages of this method are stable calibration and relative unresponsiveness to changes in pH or redox reactions [104, 105]. Mass spectrometry and brain PtO 2 measure- ments Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique that make it possible to obtain analytical informa- tion of the molecular mass and its elemental composition of a sample or molecule [106]. For this it is necessary to ionize molecules using different techniques such as chromatographic separation in order to measure the mass to charge ratio caused by external electric and magnetic fields [83, 106]. Mass spectrometry is a complicated technolo- gy to use, Atoms are very reactive and they have a short live, thus, manipulation must be performed in a vacuum environment, with very low barometric pressures that ranges from ~10-5 to 10-8 Torr [106]. These factors, plus the greater degree of invasively, and the response time and delay of mass spectrometers, make mass spectrometry less favourable as a meth- od [83]. Fluorescence and phosphorescence-based probes The optical methods of oxygen detection are based on the recognition of an atom or mole- cule which has been electronically excited by the absorption of a photon [3]. This excitation facilitates the transitions of a species from high excitation state or activation, to a ground or low excitation state, this molecular reaction involves the emission of a photon of light [3]. Fiber optic optodes can be used to measure brain PtO 2 in awake and unanesthetized sub- jects, however its availability in human studies is limited. This technology is based on short pulses of light that are transmitted along a fiber optic sensor, exciting the platinum (new ver- sion) or ruthenium (older version) based tip, producing a photon-molecular reaction that is quenched by the presence of oxygen [3, 45, 107, 108]. One of the most important physiological advan- tages of this optical technique is that it is very sensitive during hypoxia [3]. This feature is clini- cally relevant when studying tumour growth which depends on oxygenation as well as when studying ischemia or brain injuries [109]. Ano- ther important feature of this technology is its insensitivity to magnetic fields. This technology allows us to measure brain PtO 2 while applying simultaneously other exploration or imaging techniques, such as MRI or EPR. This feature can be used to validate two or more methods [110]. Partial pressure of oxygen in humans 9 Am J Blood Res 2019;9(1):1-14 The effects of acute and chronic hypoxia on Tissue PO 2 The effects of hypoxia (acute or chronic) and the presence of oxygen deprivation in different tissues have been reported as early as the 1950’s [111]. The hypoxic environment was simulated using different fractions of inspired oxygen (normobaric hypoxia) or by exposing the subject to lower barometric pressure (hypobar- ic hypoxia), either by using low pressure cham- bers, or taking the subject to high altitude [8, 112]. Although oxygen levels are critical parameters in order to asses tissue survival, monitoring the level of oxygen at a tisular level remains a chal- lenge [3, 52, 68, 110]. Real time, in vivo mea- surements during acute inflammation, hypoxia or hyperoxia have been done very few times and is not widely available [80]. Measuring tissue oxygenation during acute or chronic is a difficult task, especially due to the presence of cofounders like exercise, anesthe- sia, time of exposure or restraining the animal model [113, 114]. In humans, acclimation to high altitude exposure or controlled normobaric hypoxia will cause different readings in terms of PtO 2 [68]. Adaption on the other hand will cause differences between populations, mak- ing extrapolation a difficult task [115]. Obtaining reference values in such conditions is very dif- ficult due to the implications of such a chal- lenge and the ethical limitations of these type of technologies in humans. Discussion This practical review of the available literature about the gradient of pressure of oxygen revealed complex, varied and often not conclu- sive results. We tried to summarize the most relevant information to present it as friendly as possible for educational purposes. A more pro- found analysis of cellular and molecular hypox- ia and normoxia signalling we recommend Keeley and Mann review [116]. The usefulness of understanding the gradient of PO 2 among healthcare providers is essential. Understanding how the gradient of pressure works and how oxygen is delivered is related to an entire spectrum of clinical uses. Some of the most important results come from athletes per- formance [117], forecasting mortality due to prevalent diseases [118], wound healing evalu- ation [119], treatment effectiveness in ulcers, burns, cancer or cerebral and cardio vascular disease [120-125]. In this sense, we have exposed the physiologi- cal mechanisms, the methods for measuring and the pressures values reported in different organs from the atmosphere to the mitochon- dria. Tissue partial pressure of oxygen reflects a balance between arterial blood flow and tissue oxygen consumption rate [92]. Due to technical limitations and confounding factors such as anesthesia, inflammation, restraint and hypoxia, an appraisal of partial pressure of oxygen during normal conditions is very diffi- cult. However, in vivo and clinical data available have been included to offer the reader a better perspective of how partial pressure of oxygen behaves within the human body. Conclusions The human body is a complex living organism, which has developed mechanisms to keep oxy- gen levels in a suitable level as to cover the metabolic demand, while avoiding excessive oxygen pressure. The partial pressure of oxygen varies in the dif- ferent structures of the organism. Each organ and tissue have its own requirements in order to correctly function. For example, the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs for carrying out the gas exchange is different from the partial pressure of oxygen within the pulmonary tis- sue. We have emphasized that the organism has been able to develop physiological mecha- nisms that allow it to respond to short-term and long-term changes not only of the oxygen par- tial pressure, but also of the different gases in the atmosphere. This fascinating response capacity is responsible of how the human body manages to function correctly when it finds itself in different climates and altitudes.
