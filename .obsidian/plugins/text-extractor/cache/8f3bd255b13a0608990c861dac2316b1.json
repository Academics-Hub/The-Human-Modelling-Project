Genetic engineering / genetic modification: •Direct manipulation of an organism's genome using biotechnology •Set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells (including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries) to produce improved or novel organisms Machine: •A tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action •Machines are powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means Genetically Engineered Machine = synthetic functional cell iGEM Competition The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition: •Annual, worldwide synthetic biology event •aimed at undergraduate university students (like you!) •has expanded to include divisions for high school students / entrepreneurs / “overgraduates” Director of the iGEM competition: Randy Rettberg - engineer who has worked for technology companies such as Apple Synthetic Biology Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary branch of biology and engineering: \"Synthetic biology is an emerging discipline that uses engineering principles to artificially design and assemble biological components, systems, and living organisms for purposes of improving applications for industry or biological research.\" Combines: biotechnology | evolutionary biology molecular biology | systems biology | biophysics computer engineering | genetic engineering iGEM Competition “Synthetic Biology based on standard parts” • Multidisciplinary student teams are given a kit of biological parts called BioBricks from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts • Consists of various genetic (DNA based) components – promoters, terminators, reporter elements, plasmid backbones • Use these parts and new parts of their own design to build genetically engineered biological systems and operate them in living cells - making genetic machines! • Successful projects produce cells that exhibit new and unusual properties by engineering sets of multiple genes together, with mechanisms to regulate their expression. Aim: build simple yet sophisticated biological systems – from standard, interchangeable parts –that strive to create a positive contribution to their communities and the world. iGEM Competition Competition details: Multidisciplinary student teams • The competition might seem exclusive to biology or engineering disciplines, but teams will often have students from very diverse fields to complement the project • Examples: computer science, art and design, physics, marketing, law, mathematics, and social sciences iGEM Competition Beyond just building biological systems, broader goals of iGEM include: • To enable the systematic engineering of biology • To promote the open and transparent development of tools for engineering biology • And to help construct a society that can productively and safely apply biological technology iGEM Competition iGEM is a truly international event Teams include: United States, Canada, Chile, Kazakhstan, Japan, South Korea, Egypt, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, France, Australia, South Africa iGEM Competition Registry of Standard Biological Parts •Growing collection of genetic parts (user-tested and characterised) used for building biological devices and systems as part of the synthetic biology community's efforts to make biology easier to engineer •Philosophy: Get & Give & Share (open community) •Can be mixed and matched to build synthetic biology devices and systems •One of the expectations for participating iGEM teams is that they will submit any new biological parts they create to the Registry in order to help the Registry grow •The iGEM registry has over 20,000 parts and growing Biological Parts –BioBricks •Sequence of DNA that encodes for a biological function •A basic biological part is a single functional unit that cannot be divided further into smaller functional units. •Examples: promoters, ribosomal binding sites (RBS), protein coding sequences, terminators etc. Basic parts can be assembled together to make longer, more complex composite parts, which in turn can be assembled together to make devices that will operate in living cells. Synthetic Biology Biological Parts –BioBricks Promoters: A promoter is a DNA sequence that tends to recruit transcriptional machinery and leads to transcription of the downstream DNA sequence. Ribosome Binding Sites: A ribosome binding site (RBS) is an RNA sequence found in mRNA to which ribosomes can bind and initiate translation. Protein coding sequences: Protein coding sequences encode the amino acid sequence of a particular protein. Synthetic Biology Biological Parts –BioBricks Terminators: A terminator is an RNA sequence that usually occurs at the end of a gene or operon mRNA and causes transcription to stop. DNA: DNA parts provide functionality to the DNA itself. DNA parts include cloning sites, scars, primer binding sites, spacers, recombination sites, conjugative transfer elements, transposons, and aptamers. Plasmid backbones: A plasmid is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecules typically containing a few thousand base pairs that replicate within the cell independently of the chromosomal DNA. Synthetic Biology Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) standard visual symbols The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) can be used to represent genetic designs through a standardized vocabulary of schematic glyphs Synthetic BiologyiGEM Competition DNA Distribution Kit: Each team receives a copy of the DNA Distribution Kit. This kit has a curated selection of the best parts teams have built and resources to help iGEMers test efficiency and quality. iGEM 2017 DNA Distribution Kit contained: • DNA Distribution Kit Plates 1-5 • Linearized Plasmid Backbones • Transformation Efficiency Kit • 2016 Part Submission Kit • iGEM Stickers and Pins! iGEM Competition DNA Distribution Kit: With this kit, teams design, build and submit their own parts. Their new BioBricks are sent and added to the iGEM Registry in the spirit of the \"Get & Give\" philosophy. Every year, the number of parts contributed by associated groups increases the collection of parts that can be used by groups in future years. iGEM Competition DNA Distribution Kit: >1000 high-quality part samples as dried DNA (384-well plate) Biological Parts –BioBricks •Used by applying engineering principles of abstraction and modularization Synthetic Biology Biological Parts –BioBricks •Used by applying engineering principles of abstraction and modularization •BioBricks form the base of the hierarchical system on which synthetic biology is based Device System Parts Synthetic Biology •3 levels to Synthetic Biology hierarchy: –Parts: Pieces of DNA that form a functional unit (promoter, RBS, etc.) –Device: Collection of parts with defined function (a set of complementary BioBrick parts) –System: Combination of devices that performs high-level tasks. • standardized biological parts allows for rapid assembly of sequences Device System Part Synthetic BiologyiGEM Competition Open Community The Registry is an open community where information and experience is shared. Since the Registry uses the wiki format, users can easily make or add changes, including more information on a part's characteristics, writing about their experience with a device, etc. The Registry also has a forum and comments system, which is used as a place for discussion. • How do we manipulate the DNA in Synthetic Biology? Restriction Enzymes! • Enzymes used to assist insertion of genes into plasmid vectors during gene cloning and protein production experiments • Cuts DNA at or near specific recognition nucleotide sequences known as restriction sites Synthetic Biology “Molecular Scissors” Restriction enzyme (restriction endonuclease) • To cut DNA, all restriction enzymes make two incisions, once through each sugar-phosphate backbone (i.e. each strand) of the DNA double helix • Found in bacteria - defence mechanism against invading viruses − selectively cut up foreign DNA in a process called restriction − host DNA is protected by a modification enzyme (a methyltransferase) that modifies the prokaryotic DNA and blocks cleavage • > 3000 restriction enzymes have been studied in detail • > 600 of these are available commercially − routinely used for DNA modification in laboratories − vital tool in molecular cloning (and thus synthetic biology) Restriction Enzymes Recognises a specific sequence of nucleotides and produce a double-stranded cut in the DNA • Recognition site = 4 –8 bases • Many sites are Palindromic − the base sequence reads the same forwards and backwards Two types of palindromic sequences in DNA • mirror-like palindrome (similar to those found in ordinary text) − sequence reads the same forward and backward on a single strand of DNA − E.g. GTAATG • inverted repeat palindrome − forward and backward sequences are found in complementary DNA strands (of double-stranded DNA) − E.g. GTATAC (GTATAC being complementary to CATATG) Restriction Enzymes • DNA recognition sequences differ for each restriction enzyme • Different enzymes produce differences in the length, sequence, and strand orientation (5' end or 3' end) of a sticky-end \"overhang\" of an enzyme restriction EcoRI cleavage produces \"sticky\" ends: HaeIII cleavage produces \"blunt\" ends: • Neoschizomers - Different restriction enzymes that recognize the same sequence (cleave in different locales of the sequence) • Isoschizomers - Different enzymes that recognize and cleave in the same location Restriction Enzymes Structure of the homodimeric restriction enzyme EcoRI (cyan and green cartoon diagram) bound to double stranded DNA. Two catalytic magnesium ions (one from each monomer) are shown as magenta spheres and are adjacent to the cleaved sites in the DNA made by the enzyme (depicted as gaps in the DNA backbone) Restriction Enzymes BioBrick assembly Every BioBrick part is a DNA sequence which is carried by a circular DNA plasmid, which acts a vector (i.e. transport system to carry the part) Standardising assembly - introduction of standard sequences • Prefix and Suffix sequences − Prefix sequence (flank the 5′ end) encodes EcoRI (E) and Xbal (X) sites − Suffix sequence (flank the 3′ end) encodes SpeI (S) and PstI (P) sites Synthetic Biology Ab resistance E X S P prefix suffixpart plasmid 5′ end… …3′ end GAATTC CTTAAG EcoRI ACTAGT TGATCA SpeI TCTAGA AGATCT XbaI CTGCAG GACGTC PstI Ab resistance E X S P E X S Ab resistance S PE X Ab resistance E X M S P mix & ligate Ab resistance E X S P prefix suffixpart Cut with EcoRI + SpeI Cut with EcoRI + XbaI E X S AATTC G A TGATC E X M S P GAATTC CTTAAG EcoRI ACTAGA TGATCT M -“scar” (S+X = M) mix & ligate Cut with EcoRI + SpeI Cut with EcoRI + XbaI S PE X G CTTAA CTAGA T TCTAGA AGATCT XbaI ACTAGT TGATCA SpeI GAATTC CTTAAG EcoRI E X S PE X S P Assembly of two different BioBrick parts • One of the plasmids is digested with EcoRI and SpeI. • The plasmid carrying the other BioBrick parts is digested with EcoRI and Xbal. • Leaves both plasmids with 4 base pair overhangs at the 5′ and 3′ ends. • The EcoRI sites will ligate since they are complementary to each other. • The Xbal and SpeI sites will also ligate as the digestion produces compatible ends. • Now, both the DNA parts are in one plasmid. • The ligation produces an ‘scar’site between the two BioBrick parts. Since the scar site is a hybrid of the Xbal and SpeI sites, it is not recognized by either restriction enzyme. • The prefix and suffix sequences remain unchanged by this digestion and ligation process, which allows for subsequent assembly steps with more BioBrick parts. iGEM Competition Project examples •Cellulose –uses in water purification, tissue scaffolds, wound dressings etc. •Until now, cellulose-based materials have been created using chemical processing, not genetic engineering. •Plant cellulose = contaminated by other cell wall components (lignin and hemicelluloses) •Bacterial cellulose = purer and requires less processing •Highest producing species is Gluconacetobacter xylinus •Difficult to produce bacterial cellulose from G. xylinus –lack of well-developed tools and methods for Gluconacetobacter genetic engineering •E. coli = organism of choice for synthetic biology –thoroughly characterised, easy to engineer and has numerous parts, control circuits, and complex constructs tested in this host •But E. coli strains produce only low amounts of cellulose •Aqualose = transferred the high output cellulose production machinery of G. xylinus into E. coli •Functionalised the cellulose with binding proteins to trap specific contaminants DNA constructs for producing cellulose E. coli expression of cellulose, detected by Congo Red functionalisation of the cellulose water filtration by the cellulose membranes iGEM Competition Project examples •> 65% of extra virgin olive oil = defective –poor handling or deliberate adulteration with extraneous, non-beneficial oils •identifying defect in olive oil = rancidity –absence of expected health benefits such as antioxidants and polyunsaturated fats •The profile of a single group of chemicals, aldehydes, serves as an excellent identifier for rancidity •OliView - engineered a functional electrochemical biosensor capable of quickly and cheaply distinguishing rancid olive oil from fresh by detecting aldehydes in the chemical profile of the oil Enzyme based electrochemical biosensor • Engineered NAD+ dependent Aldehyde Dehydrogenases to have specificity for aldehydes commonly found in rancid oils • Optimized an electrochemical system to detect the enzymes' activity • Mathematics and software suite to connect measured aldehyde profiles to the degree of rancidity in an olive oil iGEM Competition Example from South Africa Lactoguard • Whole-cell biosensor for the immediate, in vivo detection of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), and thus cervical cancer, in the form of an engineered commensal vaginal bacterium. • Safe, low-cost, and easy-to-administer machine intended primarily for women in resource-poor settings. • Chassis of machine - Lactobacillus gasseri – a predominant commensal vaginal microbe ideally situated to detect HPV • Interbacterial communication is achieved by quorum sensing – Means of propagating the response signal throughout the population. – Each bacterium will produce a visible reporter on receipt of the signal which the infected woman would be able to detect without medical assistance shortly after infection. Lactoguard •HPV invades the vaginal mucosa, which is where commensal Lactobacillus gasseri and various other Lactic Acid Bacteria can be found in high numbers in healthy females •The commensal bacterial chassis would contain either of two machines, existing as a mixed population –One machine would detect the presence of the viral infection and use quorum sensing peptides to signal to the other machine that a virus has been spotted. –This machine would then produce a coloured reporter which would be detectable by the host","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
