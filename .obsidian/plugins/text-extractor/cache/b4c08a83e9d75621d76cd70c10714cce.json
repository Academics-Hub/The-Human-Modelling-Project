Themain question we are aiming to address is the relative effect of gastric empting time and luminal viscosity on the rate of glucoseabsorption. The results indicate that all factors have a significant effect on the amount of glucose absorbed. For low luminalviscosities (e.g. lower than 0.1 Pas) the rate of absorption is controlled by the gastric emptying time. For viscosities higher than0.1 Pas a 10 fold increase in viscosity can result in a 4 fold decrease of glucose absorbed. Our model, with the simplifications used todevelop it, indicate that for high viscosity luminal phases, gastric emptying rate is not the controlling mechanism for nutrientavailability. Developing a mechanistic model could help elucidate the rate limiting steps that control the digestion process.1. In silico modeling can revolutionize pharmaceutical research and development.2.
