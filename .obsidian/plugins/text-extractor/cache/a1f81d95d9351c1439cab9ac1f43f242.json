Terminology • Function: Provide a main function/s of the connective tissue/cells being studied and other associated functions • Location: Know at least two locations where the connective tissue being studied may be found • Identify/name: Give a specific name for the connective tissue being studied (if applicable) • Classify: Know the appropriate criteria to classify connective tissue and apply it • Describe: Explain the histological structure of connective tissue (i.e. staining reaction of cytoplasm and nuclei, position and shape of nuclei) Levels of organisation Cell basic unit of life Tissue aggregate or group of cells organised to perform one or more specific functions Organ combination of different tissues that form a structural and functional unit Organ systems groups of organs that cooperate to perform the major functions of the body Primary tissues Epithelium Lining & glandular Connective tissue Supports other tissues structurally and functionally Muscle Allows for movement Nervous tissue Receives and transmits signals Connective Tissue Overview Connective tissue (CT) Extracellular matrix (ECM) Composed of fibers and ground substance Solid matrix e.g. Bone and cartilage Fluid matrix e.g. Blood Cells chondroblasts, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts Semi-solid matrix e.g. CT proper Bone overview • Provides support and protection, and regulates blood calcium levels • Constituents; – Bone tissue (structural component) » Compact bone (dense layer) » Spongy bone (thin, anastomosing spicules) – Hemopoietic tissue – Fat tissue – Blood vessels – Nerves – Hyaline cartilage at synovial joints Bone as Ct • Extra cellular Matrix: – Mineralised matrix=hard tissue – Calcium phosphate forming hydroxyapatite crystals – Storage site for calcium and phosphate – Collagen proteins (mainly Type I collagen)=90% bone matrix – Ground substance (~10% bone matrix) containing non-collagenous proteins (proteoglycan macromolecules, multi adhesive glycoproteins, bone-specific, vitamin K- dependent proteins, growth factors and cytokines) – Lacunae connected by canaliculi • Cells: – Osteoprogenitor cells – Osteoblasts – Bone-lining cells – Osteocytes in lacunae – Osteoclasts Ross MH & Pawlina W..eds. Histology: A Text & Atlas, 5e. Baltimore, MD: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2006. Bone: Cell types Notice the location of each cell type in relation to the bone Osteoprogenitor cell • Precursors for osteoblasts • Derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the bone marrow • Differentiate into bone-forming cells in response to molecular stimuli – Mainly core binding factor alpha-1 (CBFA1) • Location: – Innermost layer of periosteum as periosteal cells – Lining of marrow cavity, osteonal cavity and Volkman’s canal as endosteal cells – Can also be found in microvascular supplying bone MSC Osteoblasts • Cuboidal or polygonal cells with basophilic cytoplasm. • Functions: – Synthesize and secrete type I collagen fibers (constitute 90% of protein in bone) – Synthesize bone matrix proteins (BMPs) which form the unmineralized bone matrix called OSTEOID – Responsible for calcification of bone matrix • Location: at the surface of newly synthesized bone • Osteoblast is eventually surrounded by osteoid and is trapped in its matrix thus becoming an osteocyte Bone lining cells • Derived from osteoblasts • Flat cells with few organelles in cytoplasm (beyond the perinuclear region) • Cover non-remodelling bone surfaces, also known as; • Periosteal cells: lining outer surfaces of bone • Endosteal cells: lining internal bone surfaces • Functions; • Maintenance and nutritional support of underlying osteocytes • Regulate influx/efflux of calcium and phosphate ions Osteocytes • Derived from osteoblasts • Mature bone cells enclosed by bone matrix • Functions; – Maintain bone matrix – Mechanotransduction – Can synthesize and degrade bone matrix (also facilitates calcium homeostasis) • Each osteocyte occupies a space called lacuna • Extend cytoplasmic processes through canaliculi for communication with neighbouring osteocytes and bone lining cells Osteoclasts • Large, multinucleated cells derived from mononuclear hemopoietic progenitor cells called granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells • Found at the site of active bone resorption within Howship’s lacuna • Active osteoclast contains three distinct regions; • Ruffled border: direct contact with bone formed by numerous deep infoldings of plasma membrane. Increases surface area for the exocytosis of hydrolytic enzymes and protonsand endocytosis of degradation products and bone debris • Clear (Sealing) zone: ringlike perimeter of cytoplasm adjacent to the ruffled border that dermacates the bone area being resorbed • Basolateral region: exocytoses digested material endocytosed at the ruffled border • Functions; • Resorption of the bone matrix by releasing protons and lysosomal hydrolases • Phagocytoses degrading bone Howship’s lacuna General structure of bones Outer surface, inner surface and cavities Bone structure: Outer surface • Outer surfaces of bones covers by a periosteum (sheath of dense fibrous Ct. containing osteoprogenitor cells) • In active growing bone: – Outer fibrous layer: composed of dense Ct. arranged parallel to bone surface. In ligaments and tendon, where fibers attach to bone at an angle perforating fibers (Sharpey’s fibers) present – Inner cellular layer: containing osteoprogenitors and periosteal cells • Bone formation not in progress: – fibrous layer predominant Bone structure: Inner surface & cavities • Bone cavities lined by endosteum – Endosteum: single layer of osteoprogenitor cells that can differentiate into bone-secreting cells (osteoblasts or bone-lining cells) often termed endosteal cells. • Bone marrow – Red bone marrow; • consist of developing blood cells • Supporting network of reticular cells and fibers • In adults this space can be filled with fat cells= yellow marrow Fun fact In response to appropriate stimuli, such as extreme blood loss, yellow marrow can revert to red marrow. In the adult, red marrow is normally restricted to the spaces of spongy bone in a few locations such as the sternum and the iliac crest. Diagnostic bone marrow samples and marrow for transplantation are obtained from these sites. Periosteum Endosteum Endosteal cells Marrow cavity Outer fibrous layer Inner cellular layer Classification • Cancellous (spongy) bone • Trabeculae • Forms medullary cavity • Compact bone • Also called cortical bone Pearson Education Inc. 2000 Mature compact bone • Composed of structural units called osteons (Haversian systems) • Also called lamellar bone due to organization of lamellar in the ECM; • Concentric lamellae; located within each osteon • Interstitial lamellae; • Found between osteons • Remnants of previous concentric lamellae • Circumferential lamellae; follows the entire inner of outer circumference of the shaft of long bone • Volkman’s canals; • Also known as perforating canals • Channels in lamellar bone through which blood vessels and nerves travel between osteonal canals Ross MH & Pawlina W..eds. Histology: A Text & Atlas, 5e. Baltimore, MD: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2006. Haversian system/Osteon • Central Haversian/osteonic canal; – Concentric lamellae of bone matrix surrounding a central canal (osteonal/Harvesian canal) • Contains blood vessels and nerves • Lined by endosteal cells – osteocytes in lacunae – Canaliculi containing processes of osteocytes. Opens to the central canal and facilitates passage of substances between osteocytes and blood vessels • Note cement line Ross MH & Pawlina W..eds. Histology: A Text & Atlas, 5e. Baltimore, MD: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2006. Haversian system/Osteon: Cement line • Dark ring around the circumference of the osteons • Region of collagen-poor matrix that defines the borders between neighbouring osteons Haversian system/Osteon Exercise Identify the following features of compact bone in the photomicrograph below; Osteon, osteonic canal, Volkmans’ canal, concentric lamellae, Interstitial lamellae, cement line, canaliculi, lacunae.Mature cancellous bone • Tissue arranged as trabeculae and spicules • Numerous interconnecting marrow spaces of various sizes between bone tissue lined by endosteum • No Harvesian systems • The matrix is lamellated Exercise Identify the region labelled A, Identify the structure labelled B (be specific), Is there lamellae in the bone matrix? (Yes/No) A B Immature bone • Bone initially forms in a developing fetus called immature bone • Immature bone characteristics; – No lamellar =woven / bundle bone – Interlacing arrangement of collagen fibers – Is more cellular than mature bone – Contains more ground substance and less minerals than mature bones Mature vs. immature bonePreparation for practical • Complete the exercises in this lecture • Study road maps on connective tissue with a solid matrix (Bone) • Examine slides and answer corresponding questions from the Histology practical manual (II.
