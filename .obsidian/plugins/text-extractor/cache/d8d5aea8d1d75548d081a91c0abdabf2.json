Xulu Room: 2P13, School of Anatomical Science Office no. 011 717 2208 Email: kutlwano.xulu@wits.ac.za Specific outcomes 1. Classify connective tissue with a fluid matrix (blood) 2. Classify leukocytes 3. Explain the histology and function of erythrocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and thrombocytes Disclaimer Please note that the purpose of this lecture is to provide an overview of the work. Lecture notes alone are not sufficient to prepare for tests and examinations. Students are advised to supplement with readings from the prescribed textbook, completion of exercises from the histology practical manual and other relevant resources. Levels of organisation Cell basic unit of life Tissue aggregate or group of cells organised to perform one or more specific functions Organ combination of different tissues that form a structural and functional unit Organ systems groups of organs that cooperate to perform the major functions of the body Primary tissues overview • Epithelium: covers body surfaces, lines body cavities and forms glands. • Connective tissue: underlies or supports the other three basic tissues, both structurally and functionally. • Muscle tissue: is made up of contractile cells and is responsible for movement. • Nerve tissue: transmits nerve impulses. Connective Tissue Overview Connective tissue (CT) Extracellular matrix (ECM) Composed of fibers and ground substance Solid matrix e.g. Bone and cartilage Fluid matrix e.g. Blood Cells Fibroblasts, adipocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, mast cells, leukocytes Semi-solid matrix e.g. CT proper Blood • Consists of Cells suspended in fluid ECM called Plasma • Total volume of blood in normal adults is ~6L • Circulates through the cardiovascular system • Functions; - Transport (nutrients,O2,wastes,CO2 ) - Delivery of hormones - Maintenance of homeostasis by coagulation and thermoregulation - Transport of humoral agents and cells of the immune system Blood components The volume of packed erythrocytes in a blood sample Normal Hematocrit 39% - 50% Male 35% - 45% Female 1% Plasma • Liquid, protein rich ECM - imparts fluid properties to blood • Difference between plasma and serum? • Plasma components; - Water (90%) = solvent - Proteins (albumin, globulins and fibrinogen) (7-8%) - Other solutes (1-2%); -Electrolytes -Waste material (urea, uric acid, ammonium salts) -Nutrients (glucose, lipids and amino acids) -Blood gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen) -Regulatory substances (hormones and enzymes) Blood preparation • Blood smear • The modified Romanovsky- type stain; ➢ methylene blue (basic dye) ➢ related azures (basic dye) ➢ Metachromatic (imparts a violet to red colour) ➢ eosin (acidic dye) Blood cell formation (Hemopoiesis)Erythrocytes • Anucleate, biconcave discs • 7.8µm in diameter • Lack organelles • Function within the bloodstream • Contain protein haemoglobin Images: OlyVIA Leukocytes • White blood cells • Immune responses • Not permanent members of blood = migrate • Spherical in shape, but flatten when motile • Leave capillaries & enter CT (transient cells in CT) Image: www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/histology_mh/blood.html Leukocyte migration Leukocytes: Classification Granulocytes Cytoplasm Primary granules (azurophilic/lysosomes) Secondary granules (specific) Tertiary granules Nucleus 2 or more lobes Agranulocytes Cytoplasm Non-specific granules (azurophilic/lysosomes) Nucleus No lobes Leukocytes: Classification • Granulocytes – Specific granules – Azurophilic granules – Nucleus = 2/more lobes – Includes: • Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils • Agranulocytes – Lack specific granules – Azurophilic granules – Nucleus = round/indented – Includes: – Lymphocytes and monocytes Neutrophils • Most common (50-70%) • 10-12µm in diameter • Nuclei have 2-5 lobes • In females=barr body (inactive X chromosome) • Granules (3 types); – specific, azurophilic and tertiary • Active phagocytes at the site of inflammation Images: OlyVIA and www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/histology_mh/blood.html Barr body Eosinophil • Constitute ~ 1-3% of circulating leukocytes • 10-12µm in diameter • Bilobed nucleus • Cytoplasm abundant with large, round, eosinophilic specific granules • Azurophilic granules • Normally found in CT • Associated with allergic reactions, parasitic infections and chronic inflammation Junqueira, Basic Histology; Ross & Pawlina, Histology Basophils • Least numerous (<1%) • 10-12µm in diameter • Nucleus has two irregular lobes (often obscured by granules!) • Cytoplasm is filled with large basophilic specific granules • Azurophilic granules • Release vasoactive agents which are involved in inflammation and hypersensitivity reactions Junqueira, Basic Histology; Ross & Pawlina, Histology Lymphocytes • Constitutes about 30% of circulating leukocytes • Small, medium, large (6-30µm in diameter) • Slightly indented spherical nucleus with scant cytoplasm • Effector and regulatory cell of the immune system • Functionally divided (CD markers); • T lymphocytes • B lymphocytes • NK cells • Immune response (innate/adaptive) Junqueira, Basic Histology; Ross & Pawlina, Histology Monocytes • Largest (diameter=18µm) • Have a distinct indented (or kidney shaped) nucleus • Azurophilic granules • Precursors of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system • Differentiates into macrophages (phagocytes and antigen presenting cells) Image: OlyVIA; Junqueira, Basic Histology; Ross & Pawlina, Histology Platelets • Anucleate cytoplasmic fragments • Very small (2-3µm in diameter) • Originates from megakaryocytes in bone marrow • Appear in small clumps • Function in clot formation Image: OlyVIA; Junqueira, Basic Histology; Ross & Pawlina, Histology Preparation for practical • Draw each leukocyte and label defining features • Answer questions on the histology practical manual “Recapitulation, Ct with a fluid matrix” • Examine slide 70 on Olyvia and answer corresponding questions from the Histology practical manual (II.
