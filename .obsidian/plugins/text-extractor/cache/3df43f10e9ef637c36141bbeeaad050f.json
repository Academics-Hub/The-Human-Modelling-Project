Blood exits the liver through the hepatic vein, while bile exits into the bile duct. www.halstedsurgery.org https://doi.org/10.20546/ijcmas.2018.706.348 Blood supply to the liver ❖ Hepatic portal vein- 75% of blood supply to the liver is oxygen poor blood with ❖ Nutrient and toxic materials from the intestine. ❖ Blood cells and breakdown products of blood cells from spleen. ❖ Endocrine secretions of pancreas and entero-endocrine cells of git. ❖ Hepatic artery- 25% of liver blood supply. caries oxygenated blood from the heart. ❖ Blood from the hepatic portal vein and hepatic artery mix as they enter sinusoids and supply hepatocytes. www. steemit.com/steemstem/@damzxyno/liver-anatomy-physiology-pathology-and-care Functions of hepatocyte ❖ Synthesis and secretion of plasma proteins (albumin, prothrombin, fibrinogen) ❖ Uptake, storage, distribution of nutrients and vitamins ❖ Maintains blood glucose level ❖ Degradation and elimination of toxic substances and drugs (detoxification) ❖ Stores and converts vitamins and iron ❖ Endocrine-like functions - modify structure/function of many hormones ❖ Amino acid deamination that results in production of urea. ❖ Detoxification & inactivation - various drugs and toxic substances can be inactivated by hepatocytes ❖ Exocrine function - bile production STRUCTURE OF THE Classic liver lobule The classic liver lobule is used to describe the intricate structure of the liver which consists of; Six-sided mass of tissue with portal triad at each corner surrounded b; ❖ Connective tissue stroma- continuous with the fibrous capsule of Glisson. Blood vessels, nerves, lymphatic vessels, and bile ducts travel within the connective tissue ❖ Portal triad consists of ❖ An arteriole from hepatic artery ❖ A venule from portal vein ❖ A bile duct ❖Liver parenchyma- with stacks of anastomosing plates (one cell thick) of hepatocytes, extending from the central vein to the periphery of lobule. ❖Sinusoids – anastomosing sinusoidal capillaries, between cords connected to each other through the pores in the plates begin at the surface of the liver lobule and open into the central vein. Hepatic vein- after exchange of substances between blood and hepatocytes in sinusoids, blood empties into the central vein - sub(inter) lobular veins - hepatic veins inferior vena cava. Bile duct- bile canaliculi are grooves in neighbouring hepatocytes, bile produced in these cells drain into bile canaliculi bile ducts Central vein Sinusoids Hepatocyte Branch of hepatic artery Simple cuboidal epithelium bile duct Hetatic portal vein Connective tissue stroma surrounding portal tract Sinusoids Sinusoids consist of • Endothelium – discontinuous capillaries with fenestrated endothelium • Kupffer cells • Part of endothelial lining (macrophages) • Breakdown of aged/ damaged red blood cells • Basal lamina – incomplete or absent Perisinusoidal Space of Disse ❖ The space between the wall of sinusoid and liver cell ❖ Filled with blood plasma ❖ Microvilli extend from liver cells into the space of disse ❖ Reticular fibres form a network in this space ❖ Storage (stellate)cells for lipids and vitamin A are found in this spaces Hepatocytes ❖ Are polygonal cells with centrally placed round nucleus. ❖ Apical microvilli and supportive reticular fibres ❖ As blood passes through the sinusoids, nutrients, toxins, wastes are transferred to the hepatocytes where they are processed. www.auburn.edu/academic/classes/zy/hist0509/html/Lec12 CDigestivesystem Sinusoids Kuffer cells Endothelial cells Microvilli border Hepatocytes with particles of haemosiderinin their cytoplasm Bile secretion ❖ Where adjacent hepatocytes join, small canals (bile canaliculi) form, from invaginations of the cell membrane of adjacent cells. ❖ Bile is produced in the hepatocytes and contains; ❖ Bile salts/acids- for digestion and absorption of lipids from the gut. lipids and cholesterol in bile is recycled back and forth between liver and gut. ❖ Bile pigments- to detoxify metabolites of haemoglobin and carry to gut for disposal ❖ Electrolytes- to maintain an isotonic condition, to be reabsorbed in the gut. LIVER LOBULES; Functional UNIT • Liver is subdivided into lobules. Different types of lobules are identified functionally • Classic liver lobules - lobules characterized by the connective tissue septa that surround them • Portal lobule - lobules characterized by the glandular tissue that is drained by a specific interlobular bile duct; exocrine function. • Liver acinus - lobules characterized by the glandular tissue that provides the best correlation between blood perfusion and metabolic support in liver pathology. http://www.lf3.cuni.cz/cs/index.html © 2014 StudyBlue Inc.
