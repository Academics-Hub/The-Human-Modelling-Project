Tshabalala Room 2P22 Second floor, Medical School Thabiso.Tshabalala@wits.ac.za Objectives •The organization of the vertebral column • Specialization of intraembryonic mesoderm • Stages of development of the vertebral column:  Mesenchymal stage  Chondrification stage  Ossification stage • Fate of the Notochord • Fate of the costal process • Abnormalities Vertebral column Vertebral column Vertebrae Structure of vertebrae Cervical vertebra Primary and secondary curves Vertebral column curves The embryonic development of the vertebral column The vertebral column develops during the 4 th week of intra-uterine life from the sclerotome of somites. Paraxial Mesoderm Paraxial Mesoderm Somite differentiationSomite SomiteMigration of sclerotome cells Vertebral column development Cranial part – less condensed Caudal part- more condensed Vertebral column development Cranial part – less condensed Caudal part- more condensed Vertebral column development Vertebral column development Vertebral column development Intervertebral discIntervertebral discIntervertebral disc  The development of the neural arches  Transverse processes  Costal processes Neural tube Neural arches Neural arches Neural spine Neural spine Transverse process Costal process Neural arches Centrum Notochord Transverse and Costal processes Fate of costal process •In the cervical region the costal process forms the anterior and lateral boundary of the transverse foramen. •In the thoracic region it elongates to forms the ribs •In the lumbar region it fuses with the transverse process to form its anterior part •In the upper sacral region it forms the anterior portion of the ala of sacrum Chondrification centres Primary ossification centres Primary ossification centres Three primary ossifications centres form during the 8th week of development: •One forms in the centrum •Two in each of the neural arches Secondary Ossification centres Five secondary ossification centres will form after puberty: •Superior rim of vertebral body (anular epiphysis) •Inferior rim of vertebral body (anular epiphysis) •Tip of spinous process •Tip of each tranverse process Secondary ossification centres Congenital Abnormalities Abnormal Number Sacralization Lumbarization Klippel-Feil Syndrome Scoliosis Lordosis Kyphosis Abnormal Curve Abnormal Fusion Spina Bifida Congenital abnormalities of the vertebral column Lumbarization and Sacralization Lumbarization and Sacralization Klippel-Feil Syndrome •The main features of this syndrome are shortness of the neck, low hairline, and restricted neck movements. • In most cases, the number of cervical vertebral bodies is fewer than normal. • In some cases, there is a lack of segmentation of several elements of the cervical region of the vertebral column. •The number of cervical nerve roots may be normal but they are small, as are the intervertebral foramina.
