The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) (1) and U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) (2) showed that treatment pro- grams resulting in improved glycemic control, as measured by HbA1c, reduced the microvascular complications of diabe- tes. The effect of these treatment pro- grams on reducing CVD was less clear. However, some epidemiological studies suggest that there may be a relationship between glycemic levels and CVD. In the management of diabetes, health care providers usually assess glyce- mic control with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and premeal glucose measure- ments, as well as by measuring HbA1c. Therapeutic goals for HbA1c and prepran- dial glucose levels have been established based on the results of controlled clinical trials. Unfortunately, the majority of pa- tients with diabetes fail to achieve their glycemic goals. Elevated postprandial glucose (PPG) concentrations may con- tribute to suboptimal glycemic control. Postprandial hyperglycemia is also one of the earliest abnormalities of glucose ho- meostasis associated with type 2 diabetes and is markedly exaggerated in diabetic patients with fasting hyperglycemia. Several therapies targeted toward lowering PPG excursions are now avail- able and have been shown to improve gly- cemic control as measured by HbA1c. However, many questions remain unan- swered regarding the de®nition of PPG and, perhaps most importantly, whether postprandial hyperglycemia has a unique role in the pathogenesis of diabetic com- plications and should be a speci®c target of therapy. To address these issues and to provide guidance to health care provid- ers, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) convened a consensus develop- ment conference on 24 ±26 January 2001 in Atlanta, Georgia. A seven-member panel of experts in diabetes, endocrinology, and metabolism heard selected abstracts and presenta- tions from invited speakers. The panel was then asked to develop a consensus position on the following questions: 1. How is PPG de®ned? 2. What is the relationship among PPG, FPG, and HbA1c? 3. What is the contribution of PPG to the long-term complications of diabetes? 4. Under what circumstances should people with diabetes be tested for PPG? 5. What are the bene®ts and risks of spe- ci®cally lowering PPG in an effort to achieve better glycemic control? 6. What additional research needs to be performed to clarify the role of PPG in the medical management of diabetes? QUESTION 1: HOW IS PPG DEFINED? The word postprandial means after a meal; therefore, PPG concentrations refer to plasma glucose concentrations after eating. Many factors determine the PPG pro®le. In nondiabetic individuals, fast- ing plasma glucose concentrations (i.e., following an overnight 8- to 10-h fast) generally range from 70 to 110 mg/dl. Glucose concentrations begin to rise ;10 min after the start of a meal as a result of the absorption of dietary carbohydrates. The PPG pro®le is determined by carbo- hydrate absorption, insulin and glucagon secretion, and their coordinated effects on glucose metabolism in the liver and pe- ripheral tissues. The magnitude and time of the peak plasma glucose concentration depend on a variety of factors, including the timing, quantity, and composition of the meal. In nondiabetic individuals, plasma glucose concentrations peak ;60 min after the start of a meal, rarely exceed 140 mg/dl, and return to preprandial levels within 2±3 h. Even though glucose concentra- tions have returned to preprandial levels by 3 h, absorption of the ingested carbo- hydrate continues for at least 5± 6 h after a meal. Since people with type 1 diabetes have no endogenous insulin secretion, the time and height of peak insulin concen- trations, and resultant glucose levels, are dependent on the amount, type, and route of insulin administration. In type 2 diabetic patients, peak insulin levels are delayed and are insuf®cient to control PPG excursions adequately. In type 1 and type 2 diabetic individuals, abnormalities in insulin and glucagon secretion, hepatic glucose uptake, suppression of hepatic glucose production, and peripheral glu- cose uptake contribute to higher and more prolonged PPG excursions than in nondiabetic individuals. Because the absorption of food per- sists for 5± 6 h after a meal in both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals, the optimal time to measure postprandial glucose concentration must be determined. Prac- tical considerations limit the number of blood samples that can be obtained. In general, a measurement of plasma glucose 2 h after the start of a meal is practical, generally approximates the peak value in patients with diabetes, and provides a rea- sonable assessment of postprandial hy- perglycemia. Speci®c clinical conditions, such as gestational diabetes or pregnancy complicated by diabetes, may bene®t from testing at 1 h after the meal. QUESTION 2: WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG PPG, FPG, AND HbA1c?

HbA1c levels provide an indication of the average blood glucose concentration during the preceding 2±3 months, incor- porating both pre- and postprandial gly- cemia. Because blood glucose concentra- tions vary widely during a 24-h period and from day to day in diabetes, the mea- surement of HbA1c is the most accepted indicator of long-term glycemic control. However, the HbA1c level does not pro- vide a measure of the magnitude or fre- quency of short-term ¯uctuations of blood glucose, which are particularly great in type 1 diabetes. The relative contributions of FPG and PPG to HbA1c have been studied only re- cently. Data from several large cohorts with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes were presented at the conference. In general, FPG, PPG, and especially mean plasma glucose (MPG) concentrations, de®ned by the average of multiple measurements of glucose taken throughout the day, are highly correlated with HbA1c. In contrast, postprandial glucose excursions (PPGEs), de®ned as the change in glucose concen- tration from before to after a meal, and the incremental glucose area, de®ned as the area under the glucose curve that is above the premeal (or pre± oral glucose toler- ance test [OGTT]) value, are poorly cor- related with HbA1c. Several analyses have shown a strong correlation between HbA1c and MPG (r ' 0.81± 0.95), with each 1% change in HbA1c corresponding to a change in MPG of ;35 mg/dl. The relationship between timed blood glucose measurements and HbA1c in type 1 diabetic patients was ex- amined in recent analyses of DCCT data presented at the conference. Small differ- ences were detected in the relationship between HbA1c and plasma glucose at dif- ferent times during the day (r ' 0.66 ± 0.76), with bedtime and postlunch plasma glucose correlating most strongly with HbA1c, and fasting and postbreakfast plasma glucose correlating less well. No speci®c time point or combination of time points, including mean preprandial or mean postprandial glucose levels, corre- lated as well with HbA1c as the MPG. In type 2 diabetes, a study performed in Pima Indians showed that correlations of HbA1c with FPG and PPG measured 1 and 2 h after an oral glucose load or a test meal were indistinguishable (r ' 0.6 ± 0.7). Similar results from a European population were presented at the confer- ence. In another study in type 2 diabetic patients, the effects of different glucose lowering therapies on the relationship among HbA1c, FPG, and PPG were ana- lyzed in a 24-week randomized clinical trial involving three treatment groups (a rapid-acting insulin secretagogue, an insu- lin sensitizer, and a combination of both agents) and a placebo group. FPG was found to correlate best with HbA1c (r ' 0.62± 0.67); the correlation with PPG was weaker (r ' 0.22± 0.56) and was incon- sistent across the three treatment and pla- cebo groups. There was no signi®cant correlation between HbA1c and PPGE. In summary, there are insuf®cient data to determine accurately the relative contribution of the FPG and PPG to HbA1c. It appears that FPG is somewhat better than PPG in predicting HbA1c,es- pecially in type 2 diabetes. QUESTION 3: WHAT IS THE CONTRIBUTION OF PPG TO THE LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES? Controlled clinical trials, such as the DCCT (1) and the Stockholm Diabetes Study (3) in type 1 diabetes and the Ku- mamoto Study (4) and UKPDS (2) in type 2 diabetes, have established that therapies directed at achieving normal glycemia are effective in reducing the development and delaying the progression of long-term mi- crovascular diabetic complications. Even before these clinical trials were completed, observational studies demon- strated a positive association between ret- inopathy and hyperglycemia. The epide- miological studies relied predominantly on measures of chronic glycemia, such as HbA1c. In the relatively few studies in which HbA1c, FPG, and 2-h OGTT value were measured, all were similarly associated with the risk for retinopathy. Considering the interrelationships among these glyce- mic measures (described in the previous section), these results are not surprising. The interventional studies in type 1 diabetes aimed to lower glucose levels with the goal of maintaining HbA1c as close to the nondiabetic range as safely possible. In the DCCT, the primary focus of intensive therapy was to lower prepran- dial (up to 1 h before meals) and bedtime self-monitored blood glucose levels. If HbA1c goals were not achieved, further attention was focused on lowering the 90- to 120-min postprandial levels. In type 2 diabetes, the UKPDS adjusted glucose- lowering therapy to attain fasting glucose goals. Epidemiological analyses of the DCCT (5) and UKPDS (6) results rein- force the relationship between chronic gly- cemia, as measured by HbA1c, and risk for developing long-term complications. No clinical trial data address whether PPG, independent of other measures of glyce- mia, plays a unique role in the pathogen- esis of diabetes-speci®c complications. Similarly, no clinical trial data outside of studies in gestational diabetes have exam- ined the need to treat postprandial glucose levels speci®cally to prevent complications. Interventional studies have not dem- onstrated a convincing bene®cial effect of glucose lowering on CVD outcomes (1,2), and no clinical trials have examined whether treatments that primarily lower PPG decrease cardiovascular events. As- sociations of CVD and CVD risk factors with glycemia have been demonstrated over a broad range of glucose tolerance, from normal to diabetic, in several epide- miological studies. Whether the FPG or a postchallenge (OGTT) glucose level is an independent risk factor for CVD in these studies is controversial and requires fur- ther study. QUESTION 4: UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD PEOPLE WITH DIABETES BE TESTED FOR PPG? The only setting in which PPG monitoring has been shown to improve outcomes is gestational diabetes. In one study, women with gestational diabetes were randomly assigned either to a treatment program in which therapy was adjusted to achieve prede®ned FPG and PPG levels or to one targeting premeal and bedtime glucose levels (7). The women assigned to post- prandial monitoring achieved a lower HbA1c and required fewer Caesarian sec- tions for cephalopelvic disproportion, and their babies suffered less frequently from macrosomia and neonatal hypogly- cemia. Whether similar outcomes could have been achieved with premeal moni- toring if lower premeal targets had been selected is unknown. There are no com- parable randomized clinical studies in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes ex- amining whether PPG monitoring im- proves outcomes. Are there other clinical situations in Postprandial blood glucose 776 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 24, NUMBER 4, APRIL 2001Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/24/4/775/587863/775.pdf by guest on 09 November 2023 which PPG monitoring should be consid- ered part of the overall treatment plan? There are no adequate randomized clini- cal trial data to answer this question, but the following are clinical situations in which PPG monitoring could be considered: A. Suspected postprandial hyperglyce- mia. In patients who achieve their pre- meal glucose targets, but whose over- all glycemic control as determined by HbA1c is inappropriately high, PPG monitoring and therapy to minimize PPGEs may be bene®cial. B. Monitoring treatment aimed speci®- cally at lowering PPG. In patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who are treat- ed with glucose-lowering agents ex- pected primarily to reduce PPG, mon- itoring may be useful in titrating these treatments or in con®rming that pa- tients have responded to the interven- tion. It is also possible that PPG monitoring may be bene®cial to eval- uate the effect of changes in nutrition or exercise patterns. C. Hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia in the postprandial period is rare except in response to exercise or rapid-acting in- sulin analogs. There are insuf®cient data either to support or to refute the need for extensive or routine PPG monitoring in diabetes, ex- cept in the setting of pregnancy. Since self- monitoring of blood glucose represents a signi®cant ®nancial and personal burden for patients, decisions regarding PPG monitoring should be based on the needs and responses of individual patients. The decision to recommend a glucose moni- toring plan should be made judiciously, accompanied with speci®c patient educa- tion, and reviewed and modi®ed regularly by the health care team. QUESTION 5: WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF SPECIFICALLY LOWERING PPG IN AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE BETTER GLYCEMIC CONTROL? Randomized clinical trials have demon- strated that a reduction in the long-term complications of diabetes is proportional to average glycemia as determined by HbA1c. However, it is unclear whether re- ducing PPG provides additional improve- ments in HbA1c. What, if any, are the documented bene®ts of speci®cally lowering PPG? The de®nitive answer to this question can only come from well-designed, randomized, controlled clinical trials. The availability of oral agents and insulin analogs that speci®cally target postprandial glucose levels has provided tools to perform such studies. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, rapid- acting oral insulin secretagogues, and rap- id-acting insulin analogs predominantly lower PPG. They also reduce HbA1c.Itis unclear, however, to what extent HbA1c is lowered by these drugs because of their effects on PPG as compared with their ef- fects on FPG. Furthermore, it is not clear whether therapies that target PPG provide unique bene®ts relative to other pharma- cological therapies that lower HbA1c com- parably. Performing such studies will be important. It has been suggested that agents that speci®cally lower PPG may decrease the risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. These claims have not been consistently supported by randomized, controlled studies. There appear to be no unique risks associated with the speci®c lowering of PPG to achieve HbA1c goals. QUESTION 6: WHAT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE PERFORMED TO CLARIFY THE ROLE OF PPG IN THE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES? There are several issues that should be considered when designing studies to ex- amine PPG. Studies should be performed in well-de®ned patient groups; at a mini- mum, separation of patients by type of diabetes is necessary. It is also quite likely that results of studies in patients with im- paired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance may be different from those in patients with type 2 diabetes and different degrees of fasting hypergly- cemia. In particular, elderly patients, in whom postprandial hyperglycemia may be the most prevalent abnormality in glu- cose homeostasis, may warrant special at- tention. In studies of the impact of PPG on diabetic complications, it is important to differentiate between microangiopa- thy and macroangiopathy as end points. Finally, attention must be paid to differ- ences in therapeutic programs (e.g., nutri- tion therapy versus oral antihyperglyce- mic agents versus insulin) and type of oral glucose-lowering drugs used. Given these general principles, the following speci®c questions should be addressed: A. How do we best assess postprandial hyperglycemia and the relationships among FPG, PPG, and HbA1c? The term postprandial hyperglycemia is used very loosely because its assess- ment has not been standardized. Some of the most obvious unresolved issues related to the de®nition of PPG in- clude: 1) use of a carefully de®ned meal test versus the OGTT; 2) varia- tions in size and macronutrient con- tent of test meals; 3) timing of blood sampling after standard meals or glu- cose challenge; and 4) how often any of these measurements should be made in order to provide meaningful information. Resolving these issues, in the appropriate experimental setting, will provide information to de®ne more precisely the nature of the rela- tionships among FPG, PPG, and HbA1c. This information is also neces- sary to address broader issues, such as the relative importance of PPG and FPG in assessing glycemic control and/or predicting the risk for diabetic complications. B. What is the clinical utility of using measurements of PPG to improve gly- cemic control? At present, HbA1c mea- surements are the ªgold standardº for assessing long-term glycemic control. The fundamental question to be an- swered is whether measuring premeal glucose, FPG, or PPG, alone or in com- bination, will be most helpful in ad- justing treatment to achieve HbA1c goals while minimizing hypoglycemia. Although useful insights concerning these issues have been gained from ret- rospective analyses, de®nitive answers require intervention studies. These studies should determine whether treatments aimed at controlling FPG and PPG result in lower HbA1c than do treatments that predominantly affect FPG and/or premeal glucose levels. C. In the presence of equivalent HbA1c values, does an excessive rise in PPG uniquely affect chronic diabetic com- plications? It is unclear whether exces- sive excursions of PPG have a signi®- cant impact on the development of diabetic microvascular or macrovas- cular complications independent of American Diabetes Association DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 24, NUMBER 4, APRIL 2001 777Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/24/4/775/587863/775.pdf by guest on 09 November 2023 HbA1c levels. To address this funda- mental question, studies must be de- signed to control FPG versus PPG levels while aiming to achieve similar and acceptable HbA1c levels. Because CVD is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes, and in type 2 diabetes in partic- ular, understanding the impact on CVD events of treatments directed at speci®- cally lowering PPG is crucial. Further- more, the relationship between PPG excursions and both the well-established risk factors and the more recently identi- ®ed putative mechanisms for CVD should be examined.
