The tubuli recti are lined by Sertoli cells only. RETE TESTIS BV The rete testis is an anastomosing set of channels within the highly vascular mediastinum testes. Do not confuse these tubules with blood vessels. Blood vessels are lined by endothelium, whereas the rete testis are lined by a simple cuboidal to low columnar epithelium with a single apical cilium and few short microvilli.

EPIDIDYMIS * The smooth muscle layer of the epididymis will thicken as it nears the vas deferens, resulting in an inner an outer longitudinal and middle circular layer of smooth muscle.
