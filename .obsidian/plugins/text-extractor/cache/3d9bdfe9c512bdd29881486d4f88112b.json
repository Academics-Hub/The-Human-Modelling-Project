The highly vascularizedlamina propria juxtaposed to an anaerobic lumen containing trillions of metabolically active microbes results in one of the mostaustere tissue microenvironments in the body. Studies to date have determined that a healthy mucosa contains a steep oxygengradient along the length of the intestine and from the lumen to the serosa. Advances in technology have allowed multipleindependent measures and indicate that, in the healthy mucosa of the small and large intestine, the lumen-apposed epitheliaexperience Po2 conditions of <10 mmHg, so-called physiologic hypoxia. This unique physiology results from a combination offactors, including countercurrent exchange blood flow, fluctuating oxygen demands, epithelial metabolism, and oxygen diffusion intothe lumen. Such conditions result in the activation of a number of hypoxia-related signaling processes, including stabilization of thetranscription factor hypoxia-inducible factor. Here, we review the principles of mucosal oxygen delivery, metabolism, and end-pointfunctional responses that result from this unique oxygenation profile.a.

Upregulation of antioxidant defense systems to counteract ROS productiond. Alterations in cellular ion transport and pH regulatione. Modulation of immune responses and microbiota composition in response to hypoxiaConclusiona. Physiologic hypoxia is a normal condition in the healthy intestineb. Oxygen homeostasis is maintained through cellular adaptation strategies and oxygen sensing mechanismsc. Intestinal hypoxia can lead to various pathological conditions if not properly regulatedd. Further research needed on the role of enterocytes, immune cells, and microbiota in intestinal oxygen homeostasise. Understanding physiologic hypoxia may help develop targeted therapeutics for intestinal disordersKey Takeaways:1. Physiologic hypoxia is a normal condition in the healthy intestine, and oxygen homeostasis is crucial for its function.2. Oxygen sensing mechanisms such as HIF, PHDs, FIH, NRF2, PGC-1α, and ROS play essential roles in maintaining oxygen balance.3. Cellular adaptation strategies like angiogenesis, altered metabolism, antioxidant defense systems, and immune responses help theintestine cope with physiologic hypoxia.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
