Xulu School of Anatomical Sciences Office no. 2P13 Kutlwano.xulu@wits.ac.za Outline • Overview of endocrine system • Histological structure of the following organs; • Pituitary gland • Thyroid gland • Suprarenal gland • Endocrine pancreas Disclaimer Please note that the purpose of a lecture is to give an overview of the work. Lecture notes alone are not adequate to cover the work, students need to supplement with readings from the prescribed textbook and completion of the practical exercises. Endocrine system • Produces various secretions known as hormones • Hormones are effectors that regulate various cells, tissues and organs • Nervous sys vs endocrine sys? • Hypothalamus coordinates most endocrine functions of the body • Hormones secreted onto vascular system and Ct spaces Hormones Steroids Small peptides , proteins and glycoproteins Amino acid analogues and derivatives Location Ovaries, testes, adrenal cortex Hypothalamus, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid, pancreas, enteroendocrine cells Neurons and cells of adrenal medulla, iodinated amino acids form thyroid gland Mode of release Secreted into blood and transported to target cells via plasma proteins Secreted into blood and dissolve readily Secreted into blood; -catecholamines dissolve readily -thyroid hormones require specialised proteins Hormones mechanism of action e.g.Catecholamines Regulation of hormone secretion • Negative feedback – Occurs when the response diminishes the original stimulus • Positive feedback - Occurs when the response enhances the original stimulus Pituitary gland (Hypophysis) • Attached to the hypothalamus • Pituitary gland+ hypothalamus often called “master organs”? • Pea sized (0.5g in males/ 1.5g in multiparous women) Pituitary gland: functional components • Anterior lobe (adenohypophysis) - glandular epithelial tissue - Derived from an evagination of the ectoderm of the oropharynx • Posterior lobe (neurohypophysis) - neural secretory tissue - derived from a down-growth of neuro ectoderm of the 3rd ventricle (diencephalon) A P Adenohypophysis • Pars distalis • Pars tuberalis • Pars intermedia Neurohypophysis • Infindibulum • Pars nervosa Pituitary gland Pituitary gland Anterior lobe Posterior lobe Anterior lobe • Regulates other endocrine glands and some non endocrine tissue • Cells organised in clumps and cords separated by fenestrated sinusoidal capillaries of relatively large diameter • Secrete various hormones; - trophic hormones (ACTH, TSH, FSH, LH) - non-trophic hormones (GH and prolactin) Pars distalis Chromophils Have distinctly stained cytoplasmic granules Acidophils Mammotrope/lactotrope (e.g. PRL) Somatotrope (e.g. GH) Basophils Adrenocorticolipotrope (e.g. ACTH) Gonadotropes (e.g. FSH and LH) Thyrotrope (e.g. TSH) Chromophobes lack stainable cytoplasmic granules Represent undifferentiated or resting chromophobes Staining properties Functional classification Pars distalis Chromophobe Acidophil Basophil Chromophils Chromophils Pars distalis Chromophobes Basophil Acidophil Pars intermedia • Surrounds series of small cystic cavities • Parenchymal cells surround colloid filled follicles • Nature of the follicular colloid unknown, but debris is often found within it • Contains basophils and chromophobes Pars nervosa overview Pars nervosa • Stores and releases secretory products from the hypothalamus • neural lobe • Consists of non-myelinated axon and nerve endings -cell bodies lie in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus -nerve endings terminate in close proximity to fenestrated capillaries -secretory vesicles found throughout the neuron • Herring bodies (contain oxytocin and ADH) • Contains pituicytes =glial cells associated with fenestrated capillaries Herring bodiesPituicytes nuclei Thyroid gland • Located in the anterior neck region adjecent to the larynx and trachea • Surrounded by Ct capsule – Trabeculae – Lobes and lobules Ct capsule Trabeculae Thyroid follicles • Functional and structural units • Spherical cyst like compartments • Lines by simple cuboidal or low columnar epithelia (follicular epithelium) • Contain gel-like mass called colloid – Thyroglobulin source: http://www.lab.anhb.uwa.edu.au Follicular epithelium: Cell types • Follicular (principal) cell – Produce and secrete thyroid hormones (T4+T3) • Parafollicular (C cells) – Pale staining cells located in the periphery or within the follicle basal lamina – Produce and secrete calcitonin source: Intechopen.com source: www.britannica.com Thyroid follicle overview C-cells C-cells Thyroid follicle Follicular cells Colloid Suprarenal glands • Regulates metabolism and maintains normal electrolyte balance • Covered by a thick Ct capsule • Cortex; – ~90% of the gland – Steroid secreting – Originates from the mesodermal mesenchyme • Medulla; – Smaller region – Catecholamine secreting – Originates from neural crest cells Zonation of the suprarenal gland cortex Zona glomerulosa (ZG), Z. fasciculata (ZF) and Z. reticularis (ZR) ZG ZF ZR Zona glomerulosa • Cells arranged in ovoid clusters • Pyramidal cells whose spherical nuclei appear closely packed and stain densely • Secretes mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) – Regulation of water and electrolyte balance Zona fasciculata • The cells are large and polyhedral • Arranged in long straight cords • Have a spherical nucleus, some cells are usually binucleated • The cytoplasm contains numerous lipid droplets but usually appears vacuolated • Secrete glucocorticoids (cortisol) -Regulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism Zona reticularis • The cells in this region are smaller than those of the fasciculata • They are arranged in anastamosing cords • The cells have relatively few lipid droplets • Nuclei appear closely packed • Secretions weak androgens and small amounts of glucocorticoids Medulla • Consists of large pale staining chromaffin cells • Arranged in ovoid clusters • Modified postsynaptic neurons – Lack axonal processes • Produce and secrete epinephrine and norepinephrine Ovoid clusters of chromaffin cells Endocrine pancreas • Secretes hormones that regulate glucose levels • Clusters of pale staining cells • Consists of three principal cell types; – Distinguished immunohistochemically Principal cells of endocrine pancreas • A (alpha) cells; – ~15-20% – Peripherally located – Secrete glucagon • B (beta) cells; – ~70% – Centrally located – Secret insulin • D (delta) cells; – ~5-10% – Peripherally located – Secrete somatostatin B cells A cells References Histology: A text and Atlas, Ross and Pawlina","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
