The gastrointestinal (GI) circulation accounts for over 25% of cardiac output under resting conditions. Blood ¯ow to the GI tract is dynamic, however, with tissue- speci®c increases caused by the ingestion of a meal and profound reductions in ¯ow elicited by stresses that threaten to deprive the vital organs (e.g., brain, heart) of their normal blood supply. Although the different organs perfused by the GI circulation share common stimuli and mechanisms of blood ¯ow regulation, sig- ni®cant differences related to tissue function have been described. As seen in most other vascular beds, im- paired blood perfusion of GI organs can lead to profound organ dysfunction and tissue injury. The stomach, liver, intestine, and pancreas provide excellent examples of the unique and diverse anatomical features and regulatory mechanisms that distinguish the GI circulation from other regional vascular beds. GASTRIC CIRCULATION Introduction Gastric blood ¯ow plays an important role in sustaining the normal physiologic functions of the stomach and it helps to protect the gastric mucosa against ulcer formation. Intrinsic regulatory mecha- nisms ensure that blood ¯ow is adjusted to meet the energy-demanding processes of gastric secretion and motility. Gastric blood ¯ow also helps to maintain a barrier against back-diffusion of lumenal acid, thereby preventing mucosal damage and ulceration. Impairment of gastric blood ¯ow renders the mucosa vulnerable to the damaging actions of gastric juice as well as ingested agents, such as ethanol, aspirin, and bacteria (e.g., Helicobacter pylori). Anatomy Oxygenated blood is provided to the stomach via the celiac artery, with deoxygenated blood drained by the portal vein. Small branches of the celiac artery give rise to arterioles in the external muscle layers and the sub- mucosa. Some of the submucosal arterioles pierce the muscularis mucosae to produce the capillary network that supplies the mucosa. Hence, the tone of the sub- mucosal arterioles determines the magnitude of muco- sal blood ¯ow. The mucosal capillaries drain into a central vein that begins just beneath the surface epithel- ial cells. These venules coalesce to form a dense venous plexus in the submucosa. The submucosal venous drainage penetrates the external muscle layers where additional venous blood is provided by the muscle microvasculature. Hemodynamics The parallel-coupled capillary networks of the gas- tric muscular layer and the mucosa are under separate control, responding independently to tissue metabo- lism, other local factors, and extrinsic neural input. Between meals, blood ¯ow in the mucosal layer is approximately six times higher than that of the muscle layer, and approximately 75% of total gastric blood ¯ow is distributed to the mucosa, with 25% directed to the muscle layer. This intramural distribution of blood ¯ow is altered when either of the two layers becomes functionally active; i.e., when the mucosa is stimulated to produce acid, mucosal blood ¯ow (and its percent- age of total ¯ow) preferentially increases. Blood Flow Regulation Gastric blood ¯ow is controlled by neural, humoral, and metabolic factors. Sympathetic activation elicits re- ductions in total gastric blood ¯ow and mucosal ¯ow through arteriolar constriction.
