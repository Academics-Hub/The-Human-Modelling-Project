Question How do we simplify Fourier transforms of real valued functions? A: Tool - e ±iωt = cos ωt ± i sin ωt. Hence if f (t) is real, we write F (ω) = 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞ e −iωtf (t)dt = 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞(cos ωt − i sin ωt)f (t)dt = 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞(cos ωt)f (t)dt − i 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞(sin ωt)f (t)dt. TSF - SINE AND COSINE TRANSFORMS MATH2014 : MATHEMATICS II (Engineering) Remark For the function f (t), each of the above terms is very important. Deﬁnition Let f (t) be a real valued function. Then (a) the Fourier cosine transform Fc(ω) of f (t) is deﬁned as Fc(ω) := 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞(cos ωt)f (t)dt and (b) the Fourier sine transform Fs(ω) of f (t) is deﬁned as Fs(ω) := 1 √ 2π ∫ ∞ −∞(sin ωt)f (t)dt. TSF - SINE AND COSINE TRANSFORMS MATH2014 : MATHEMATICS II (Engineering) Observation F (ω) = Fc(ω) − iFs(ω). We can simplify Fourier transforms of even or odd functions easily. Proposition Let f (t) be a real-valued function. If f (t) is even, then F (ω) = Fc (ω) = √2 √π ∫ ∞ 0 (cos ωt)f (t)dt and f (t) = √ 2 √π ∫ ∞ 0 (cos ωt)Fc (ω)dω. If f (t) is odd, then F (ω) = −iFs (ω) = −i √ 2 √π ∫ ∞ 0 (sin ωt)f (t)dt and f (t) = √2 √ π ∫ ∞ 0 (sin ωt)Fs (ω)dω. TSF - SINE AND COSINE TRANSFORMS MATH2014 : MATHEMATICS II (Engineering) Proof We prove result for f (t) even. The case when f (t) is odd is proved similarly and is left as an exercise. From the observation F (ω) = Fc(ω) − iFs(ω). Consider Fs(ω) = 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞(sin ωt)f (t)dt. Since sin ωt is odd and f (t) is even, (sin ωt)f (t) is odd. Therefore, Fs(ω) = 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞(sin ωt)f (t)dt = 0. Thus, F (ω) = Fc(ω) − i · 0 = Fc(ω). TSF - SINE AND COSINE TRANSFORMS MATH2014 : MATHEMATICS II (Engineering) Proof (continued ...) Now Fc(ω) = 1√2π ∫ ∞ −∞(cos ωt)f (t)dt. Since cos ωt and f (t) are even, their product is even so that Fc(ω) = 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞(cos ωt)f (t)dt = 2 √2π ∫ ∞ 0 (cos ωt)f (t)dt. It follows that F (ω) = Fc(ω) = √ 2 √ π ∫ ∞ 0 (cos ωt)f (t)dt, as required. TSF - SINE AND COSINE TRANSFORMS MATH2014 : MATHEMATICS II (Engineering) Proof (continued ...) We now apply the inverse Fourier transform formula: at all points of continuity, f (t) = 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞ e iωtF (ω)dω = 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞ e iωtFc(ω)dω = 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞(cos ωt + i sin ωt)Fc(ω)dω = 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞(cos ωt)Fc(ω) + i(sin ωt)Fc(ω)dω. TSF - SINE AND COSINE TRANSFORMS MATH2014 : MATHEMATICS II (Engineering) Proof (continued ...) Note that since cos ωt and Fc(ω) are even and sin ωt is odd, we have (cos ωt)Fc(ω) is even and (sin ωt)Fc(ω) is odd. Therefore, f (t) = 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞(cos ωt)Fc(ω)dω + 0 = √ 2 √π ∫ ∞ 0 (cos ωt)Fc(ω)dω, as desired TSF - SINE AND COSINE TRANSFORMS MATH2014 : MATHEMATICS II (Engineering) Deﬁnition At points where f (t) is continuous and even, the expression f (t) = √2 √π ∫ ∞ 0 (cos ωt)Fc(ω)dω is called the inverse cosine transform expression for f (t). Similarly, if f (t) is continuous and odd, the expression f (t) = √2 √π ∫ ∞ 0 (sin ωt)Fs(ω)dω is called the inverse sine transform expression for f (t). TSF - SINE AND COSINE TRANSFORMS MATH2014 : MATHEMATICS II (Engineering) Example Express f (t) = te −t (t ≥ 0) as an inverse sine transform. (Assume that f (t) is odd over (−∞, ∞)). Solution Noting that the required form is f (t) = √ 2 π ∫ ∞ 0 (sin ωt)Fs(ω)dω, we ﬁrst obtain Fs(ω). Now by deﬁnition, Fs(ω) = 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞(sin ωt)f (t)dt. Since sin ωt and f (t) are odd, their product is even, so that TSF - SINE AND COSINE TRANSFORMS MATH2014 : MATHEMATICS II (Engineering) Solution (continued...) Fs(ω) = 2 √2π ∫ ∞ 0 (sin ωt)f (t)dt. Therefore, Fs(ω) = √ 2 π ∫ ∞ 0 te −t sin ωtdt = √ 2 π ∫ ∞ 0 te −tIm(e iωt)dt = √ 2 π Im {∫ ∞ 0 te t(−1+iω)dt} . TSF - SINE AND COSINE TRANSFORMS MATH2014 : MATHEMATICS II (Engineering) Solution (continued...) That is, Fs(ω) = √ 2 π Im { t[e t(−1+iω)] −1 + iω − (1) [e t(−1+iω)] (−1 + iω)2 }∞ 0 . Now lim t−→∞ e t(−1+iω) = lim t−→∞ e −t · e iωt = lim t−→∞ e −t · (cos ωt + i sin ωt) = 0. Therefore, TSF - SINE AND COSINE TRANSFORMS MATH2014 : MATHEMATICS II (Engineering) Solution (continued...) Fs(ω) = √ 2 π Im {0 − 0 − 0 + 1 (−1 + iω)2 } = √ 2 π Im(−1 − iω)2 (1 + ω2)2 = √ 2 π 2ω (1 + ω2)2 . Hence, f (t) = √ 2 π ∫ ∞ 0 (sin ωt)Fs(ω)dω = 4 π ∫ ∞ 0 ω (1 + ω2)2 sin ωtdω. We can leave the answer like this. TSF - SINE AND COSINE TRANSFORMS MATH2014 : MATHEMATICS II (Engineering) Example Express (t − t 2)[H(t) − H(t − 1)] as an inverse cosine transform. Solution Let f (t) = (t − t 2)[H(t) − H(t − 1)] = { t − t 2, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 0, otherwise Noting that the required form is f (t) = √ 2 √π ∫ ∞ 0 (cos ωt)Fc(ω)dω, we ﬁrst ﬁnd TSF - SINE AND COSINE TRANSFORMS MATH2014 : MATHEMATICS II (Engineering) Solution (continued...) Fc (ω) = 1 √2π ∫ ∞ −∞(cos ωt)f (t)dt = 1 √2π ∫ 1 0 (t − t2) cos ωtdt = 1 √2π [(t − t2) sin ωt ω − (1 − 2t) (− cos ωt ω2 ) + (−2) − sin ωt ω3 ]1 0 That is, Fc(ω) = 1 √2π [0 − 0 − cos ω + 1 ω2 + 2 sin ω ω3 ] = 1 √2π [ 2 sin ω − ω(1 + cos ω) ω3 ] .
