This stain consists of three dyes, namely, acid fuchsin, aniline blue and orange G. In this section collagen will stain blue, while the erythrocytes take up the orange colour. The nuclei belonging to the secretory cells of the hypophysis stain a red colour. The pituitary gland consists of two functional units namely, the adenohypophysis and the neurohypophysis. The adenohypophysis consists of three (3) parts; these are the pars tuberalis, pars distalis and the pars intermedia. Pars nervosa and the infundibulum make up the neurohypophysis PD PN PI PD- Pars distalis PI- Pars intermedia PN- Pars nervosa Basophils Acidophils Chromophobes Note the red staing acidophils, blue staining basophils and the unstained chromophobes in the pars distalis Basophil BV Colloid PN PN-Pars Nervosa BV-Blood vessel E-Erythrocytes Collagen E BV E HB C C-Collagen HB- Herring bodies E-Erythrocytes BV-Blood vessels Pars nervosa HB BV Pars nervosa BV-Blood vessel HB-Herring bodies Fibroblast Erythrocytes The pars nervosa consists of pituicytes, fibroblasts and mast cells (not shown in the photomicrograph) Pars nervosa Pars tuberalis The pars tuberalis is an extension of the anterior pituitary, partially surrounding the infundibulum (ID). Pars tuberalis is a highly vascular region as shown by blood vessels (BV) in abundance ID PT BV PD PT PD-Pars distalis PT-Pars tuberalis The thyroid gland Slide 44 This section has been obtained from one lobe of the thyroid gland The thyroid gland is lined by a thin connective tissue capsule (CT) CT The connective tissue capsule sends septa (trabeculae, Tr) into the gland to divide it into lobes and lobules CT Tr Tr The connective tissue capsule sends septa (trabeculae, Tr) into the gland to divide it into lobes and lobules Tr The connective tissue capsule sends septa (trabeculae, Tr) into the gland to divide it into lobes and lobules Follicle The functional unit of the thyroid gland is a roughly rounded follicle Each follicle consists of a core of colloid (C), and lined by a simple cuboidal follicular cells (FC) C FC Thyroid gland Parafollicular cells (arrow) are found within the follicle in the simple cuboidal epithelium and between the follicles Thyroid gland The suprarenal gland Slide 92 CT The suprarenal gland is lined by a connective tissue capsule (CT) which send trabeculae into the parenchyma of the gland Cortex Medulla The suprarenal gland is divided into the outer cortex and a vascular inner medulla The cortex is divided into three (3) zones: Zona glomerulosa, fasciculata and reticularis ZG ZONA GLOMERULOSA (the parenchyma is arranged in ovoid clusters) Zona Fasciculata (long straight chords separated by fenestrated capillaries) Capillary Zona reticularis (the parenchyma is arranged in anastamosing chords) This photomicrograpg shows the medulla of the suprarenal gland which consists of Chromaffin cells The endocrine pancreas Slide 17 The endocrine part of the pancreas consists of the palely stained ilets of Langerhan (encircled). The cells are arranged in short irregular cords, which are separated by fenestrated sinusoidal capillaries (C). C Endocrine pancreas","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
