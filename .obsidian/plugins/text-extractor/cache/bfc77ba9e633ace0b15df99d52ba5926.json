Cervical constriction – pharyngoesophageal junction caused by cricopharyngeus muscle = upper oesophageal sphincter 2. Thoracic (broncho-aortic) constriction - crossed by arch of aorta & left main bronchus 3. Diaphragmatic constriction - oesophageal hiatus of diaphragm  NB! passing instruments through oesophagus into stomach & radiographs 8 Phrenicoesophageal ligament:  Extension of inferior diaphragmatic fascia  Attaches oesophagus to margins hiatus  Allows independent movement of diaphragm & oesophagus during respiration & swallowing 9  Short ≈ 1.25 cm long  Cone-shaped - widening as it approaches stomach  From oesophageal hiatus in right crus of diaphragm, left of midline, level of T10  Grooves posterior (visceral) surface of left lobe of liver  Passes anteriorly, curving left as it descends to cardiac orifice of stomach  Right border continuous  lesser curvature of stomach  Left border  cardiac notch  Anterior surface  peritoneum of greater sac  Posterior surface  peritoneum of omental bursa 10  Left of T11  tip of xiphoid process  Internally the Z-line = junction (mucosa changes from oesophageal to gastric)  Reflux prevented by:  Oesophageal hiatus acts as inferior oesophageal sphincter  Normal anteroposterior flattening of oesophageal lumen when empty 11  Cervical – inferior thyroid artery  Thoracic – bronchial & 4-5 oesophageal arteries from aorta  Abdominal – left gastric artery, from coeliac trunk, & left inferior phrenic artery 12  Submucosal veins  peri- oesophageal venous plexus  oesophageal veins   Cervical – inferior thyroid vein  Thoracic – azygous vein (and hemiazygous & intercostal veins)  Abdominal – oesophageal veins drain into left gastric vein (portal) & azygous system (systemic - IVC) 13  Cervical – deep cervical nodes (directly or via para-tracheal nodes)  Thoracic – posterior mediastinal nodes  Abdominal – left gastric lymph nodes  (mainly) coeliac lymph nodes https://i1.wp.com/basicmedicalkey.com/wp- content/uploads/2017/06/A311788_1_En_11_Fig5_HTML.jpg?fit=732%2C964&ssl=1 14  Upper  Recurrent laryngeal & postganglionic sympathetic fibres from cervical sympathetic trunks  Lower  Encircled by oesophageal nerve plexus  formed by:  Vagal trunks (parasympathetic)  Greater splanchnic nerve (sympathetic)  Periarterial plexuses of left gastric & inferior phrenic arteries 15  Expanded part of GIT between oesophagus & small intestine  Mechanical & chemical processing of food  Enzymatic digestion: food (bolus)  chime  to duodenum  Commonly J-shaped  Shape and position varies according to body types, position of diaphragm, contents (can expand), position of the person etc. 16  4 parts:  Cardia - around cardiac orifice  Fundus - superior part  left diaphragm, horizontal plane of cardiac orifice  Body - between fundus & pyloric antrum  Pyloric region - funnel shaped region:  Pyloric antrum  Pyloric canal  Pyloric sphincter  thickening of smooth muscle  2 curvatures:  Lesser curvature: short concave along body and pyloric region  Greater curvature: longer convex border 17  Gastric mucosa is smooth reddish-brown (pink in the pyloric part)  Mucous layer protects stomach from gastric acid  Contracted mucosa form longitudinal gastric folds or rugae 18  Covered by peritoneum, except small area posterior to cardiac orifice  The two layers of lesser omentum envelope stomach and leave greater curvature as greater omentum  Anteriorly – diaphragm, left lobe of liver, anterior abdominal wall  Posteriorly – omental bursa & pancreas  Stomach bed 19  Mostly from gastric & gastro-omental artery  Fundus & upper body supplied by short & posterior gastric artery (from splenic artery) 20  Gastric v’s  portal v. (left sometimes via splenic)  Short gastric & left gastro-omental v’s.  splenic v.  portal v.  Right gastro-omental v.  (gastroduodenal)  superior mesenteric v.  portal v.  Prepyloric v.  right gastric v.  portal v. 21 Anterior & posterior surfaces  gastric lymph vessels  gastric & gastro-omental nodes  celiac nodes Superior 2/3  Gastric vessels  gastric nodes  Fundus & superior part  short gastric & left gastro-omental vessels  pancreatico-splenic nodes Inferior 1/3  Right 2/3  right gastro-omental vessels  pyloric lymph nodes  Left 1/3  left gastro-omental vessels  pancreatico-splenic nodes 22  Anterior vagal trunk  Mainly from left vagus nerve (CNX)  Single branch on anterior surface  Hepatic & duodenal branches  Lesser curvature of stomach  Anterior gastric branches  Posterior vagal trunk  Larger & mainly from right vagus nerve  Posterior surface of oesophagus  Gives of celiac branch, to celiac plexus  Branches to anterior & posterior surfaces  Lesser curvature of stomach  Posterior gastric branches  Sympathetic supply from T6 – T9 passes to celiac plexus via greater splanchnic n.  Distributed along gastric & gastro-omental artery 2324  Herniation of part of the stomach through the oesophageal hiatus of the diaphragm  May cause pain and discomfort and predispose to reflux of gastric contents  Sliding hernias involve the cardia of the stomach sliding superiorly  Rolling hernias (less common) involve part of the fundus extending through the hiatus  Primary absorption site  Origin: pylorus  Termination: ileocecal junction  Admission into small intestine controlled by pylorus  3 parts:  Duodenum  Jejunum  Ileum 25  1st and shortest (25 cm) part of small intestine  C-shaped course around head of pancreas  Mostly fixed by peritoneum to posterior abdominal wall  Begins at pylorus and terminates at duodenojejunal junction (level of L2)  4 parts:  Superior (1st) part – short (~5 cm), anterolateral to L1  Descending (2nd) part – longer (7-10 cm), descends along right of L1-L3  Horizontal (inferior; 3rd) part – crosses L3 (6-8 cm)  Ascending (4th) part – short, begins left of L3 & ascends to superior border of L2 26  Superior part  Ascends from pylorus, overlapped by liver & gallbladder  Anterior covered by peritoneum and posterior of ampulla  Proximal part has hepatoduodenal lig of lesser omentum attached superiorly, and greater omentum attached inferiorly 27  Descending part  Runs inferiorly, curving around head of pancreas  Initially lying to right & parallel to IVC  Bile & main pancreatic ducts unite forming hepatopancreatic ampulla and open on posteromedial wall at the major duodenal papilla  Entirely retroperitoneal  Anterio surface of proximal 1/3 and distal 1/3 covered by peritoneum  Peritoneum of middle 1/3 reflected as the transverse mesocolon 28  Horizontal part  Runs transversely to left  Passing over IVC, aorta and L3  Covered by peritoneum except where crossed by superior mesenteric artery & vein, root of mesentery of the jejunum & ileum  Posteriorly – right psoas major m, IVC, aorta, and the right gonadal vessels  Head & uncinate process of pancreas lies superiorly 29  Ascending part  Runs superiorly along left side of aorta to inferior border of pancreatic body  Curves anteriorly to join jejunum  Suspensory muscle of the duodenum – functions to widen angle of duodenojejunal flexure, facilitating movement of contents 30  Proximal to opening of bile duct (foregut): Celiac trunk  common hepatic a  gastroduodenal a  anterior & posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal a  Distal to opening of bile duct (midgut): Superior mesenteric a  anterior & posterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal a  Veins follow arterial supply but drain either directly or indirectly into portal vein 31  Anterior lymphatic vessels  pancreaticoduodenal nodes  pyloric nodes  Posterior lymphatic vessels superior mesenteric nodes 32  Vagus + greater & lesser abdominopelvic splanchnic nerves via:  Celiac plexus  Superior mesenteric plexus  Periarterial plexuses  pancreaticoduodenal arteries 3334  Gastric most common  Duodenum second most common  Helicobacter pylori infection  Chronic anxiety predisposes  Acid secretion  weaken mucosa  H. pylori erodes into wall  Eroding into arteries  life threatening bleeds  Vagus nerves controls acid secretion  Vagotomy = old treatment  Prevention mostly today","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
