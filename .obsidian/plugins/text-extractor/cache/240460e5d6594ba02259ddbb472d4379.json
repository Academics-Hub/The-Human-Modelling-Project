As a result, the entire central part of the face, including the hard palate and alveolar processes, is separated from the rest of the cranium •LE FORT III FRACTURE –Horizontal fracture that passes through the superior orbital fissures and the ethmoid and nasal bones and extends laterally through the greater wings of the sphenoid and frontozygomatic sutures. –Concurrent fracturing of the zygomatic arches causes the maxillae and zygomatic bones to separate from the rest of the cranium AXIS – SUPERIOR VIEW AXIS – LATERAL VIEW ATLAS– SUPERIOR VIEW 1.
