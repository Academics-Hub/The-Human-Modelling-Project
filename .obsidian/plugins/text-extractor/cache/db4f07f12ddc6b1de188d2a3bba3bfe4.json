Junction of ureters and renal pelves 2. At pelvic brim 3. In the wall of urinary bladder 11 ▪ Arterial supply ▪ Ureteric branches from: ▪ Renal arteries ▪ Gonadal arteries ▪ Common iliac arteries ▪ Internal iliac arteries ▪ Venous drainage ▪ Abdominal part → renal & gonadal veins ▪ Lymphatic drainage ▪ Right/left (caval/aortic) lymphatic nodes ▪ Common iliac lymph nodes ▪ Pelvic part → common, external & internal iliac lymph nodes 12 Abdominal part ▪ ≈4cm long ▪ Right is close to IVC, left is away from aorta ▪ Each gland has a hilum → veins and lymphatics ▪ Two parts: ▪ Cortex ▪ Medulla ▪ Different origin and functions 13 ▪ Related to superior pole of kidneys ▪ Lower part of left gland is covered by pancreas, upper is related to stomach ▪ Greater part of right gland related to caudate lobe of liver (superior recess of omental bursa) 14 ▪ Arterial Supply: ▪ Superior suprarenal artery (from inferior phrenic artery) ▪ Middle suprarenal artery (from aorta @ L1) ▪ Inferior suprarenal artery (from renal artery) ▪ Venous drainage: ▪ Right → IVC ▪ Left → left renal vein → IVC 151617 ▪ “Pebbles” formed in kidney or ureter ▪ Salts of inorganic or organic acids ▪ Calices, pelvis, bladder ▪ Once in ureter, can cause irritation → intermittent pain (ureteric colic) ▪ Slowly forced down → can cause blockage ▪ Pain referred based on level (T11 - L2) → infero-anteriorly ▪ Can extend to scrotum or labia majora (genitofemoral nerve) ▪ Treatment: nephroscopy or lithotripsy https://amandiagnostic.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kidney-stones-diagnostic-aman-diagnostic-rewari.png 18https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/10249.jpg","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
