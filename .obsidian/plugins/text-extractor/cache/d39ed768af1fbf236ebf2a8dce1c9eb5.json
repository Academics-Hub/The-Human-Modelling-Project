Hutchinson 2B09 School of Anatomical Sciences OBJECTIVES • Describe the parts and innervation of the external ear • Describe the basic organization of the external, middle and inner ear and their contents • Describe the features of the tympanic membrane • Relate the structure of the middle ear to common pathologies and the spread of infection • Describe the conduction of sound through the ear by relating it to the anatomical features of the external, middle and inner ear • Describe the membranous labyrinths of the inner ear and relate their structure to their function of both balance and hearing EAR EAR: EXTERNAL EAR EAR: EXTERNAL EAREAR: MIDDLE EAR EAR: MIDDLE EAR EAR: INNER EAREAR: INNER EAR EAR: INNER EAREAR: INNER EAR EAR: INNER EAR Otitis media • An earache and a bulging red tympanic membrane may indicate pus or fluid in the middle ear, a sign of otitis media • Infection of the middle ear is often secondary to upper respiratory infections • Inflammation and swelling of the mucous membrane lining the tympanic cavity may cause partial or complete blockage of the pharyngotympanic tube • The tympanic membrane becomes red and bluges, and a person may complain of “ear popping” • An amber coloured bloody fluid may be observed through the tympanic membrane • If untreated otitis media may produce impaired hearing as the result of scarring of the auditory ossicles effectively limiting their ability to move in response to sound. Mastoiditis • Infections of the mastoid antrum and mastoid cells result from a middle ear infection that causes inflammation of the mastoid process • Infections may spread superiorly into the middle cranial fossa through the petrosquamous fissure in children and cause osteomyelitis (bone infection) of the tegmen tympani • Since the advent of antibiotics, mastoiditis is uncommon • During operations for mastoiditis, surgeons are conscious of the course of the facial nerve to avoid injuring it • One point of access to the tympanic cavity is through the mastoid antrum","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
