Hutchinson 2B09 School of Anatomical Sciences Objectives • Identify the muscles of mastication, describe their origins, insertions, actions and innervations • Fully classify and describe the temporomandibular joint • Describe the movements possible at the temporomandibular joint and the muscles that elicit these actionsTEMPORALIS •ORIGIN: •Floor or temporal fossa & deep surface of temporal fascia •INSERTION: •Tip and medial surface of coronoid process & anterior border of ramus •INNERVATION: •CNV3 Via deep temporal branches •ACTION ON MANDIBLE: •Elevates mandible, closing jaws; posteriorly more horizontal fibers are the primary retractors of the mandible MASSETER •ORIGIN: •Inferior border and medial surface of maxillary process of zygomatic bone and arch •INSERTION: •Angle and lateral surface of ramus of the mandible •INNERVATION: •CNV3 Via masseteric nerve •ACTION ON THE MANDIBLE: •Elevator, closing jaws, superficial fibers make limited contribution to protrusion of mandible MEDIAL PTERYGOID •ORIGIN: •1) Medial surface of lateral pterygoid plate & pyramidal process of palatine bone •2) Tuberosity of maxilla •INSERTION: •Medial surface of ramus of mandible, inferior to the mandibular foramen •INNERVATION: •CNV3 Via medial pterygoid nerve •ACTION ON MANDIBLE: •Acts synergistically with masseter to elevate the mandible, contributes to protrusion, alternate unilateral activity produces smaller grinding movements LATERAL PTERYGOID •ORIGIN: •1) Infratemporal surface and crest of greater wing of sphenoid •2) lateral surface of lateral pterygoid plate •INSERTION: •Superior head attaches to joint capsule and articular disc of TMJ •Inferior head attaches to pterygoid fovea on anteromedial aspect of neck of condylar process •INNERVATION: •CNV3 Via lateral pterygoid nerve •ACTION ON MANDIBLE: •Acts bilaterally •Protracts mandible and depresses chin •Acting unilaterally •Swings jaw towards the contralateral side •Alternate unilateral contraction produces larger lateral chewing movements Additional muscles acting on the mandible and Temporomandibular joint Muscle Origin Insertion Innervation Action on mandible Suprahyoid muscles Digastric Base of cranium Hyoid bone Facial (CNVII) and mandibular (CNV3) Depresses mandible against resistance when infrahyoid muscles fix or depress hyoid boneStylohyoid Styloid process Facial nerve (CNVII) Mylohyoid Medial body of mandible Mandibular nerve (CNV3) Geniohyoid Anterior body of mandible Nerve to geniohyoid (C1-C2) Infrahyoid muscles Omohyoid Scapula Hyoid bone Ansa cervicalis from cervical plexus (C1-C3) Fixes or depresses hyoid bone Sternohyoid Manubrium of sternum Sternothyroid & Thyrohyoid Manubrium of sternum and thyroid cartilage Muscles of facial expression Platysma Subcutaneous tissue of infraclavicular and supraclavicular regions Base of mandible, skin of cheek and lower lip, angle of mouth and orbicularis oris Cervical branch of facial nerve (CNVII) Depresses mandible against resistance MUSCLES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANDIBLE ANATOMY OF THE TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT •Classified as a MODIFIED SYNOVIAL HINGE JOINT •Permits: gliding (translational), small degree of rotation (pivoting), flexion (elevation) and extension (depression) types of movement •Separated into upper and lower cavities by a FIBROCARTILAGINOUS DISC •Articulation surfaces include the condyle of the mandible and mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the temporal bone •Both bone surfaces are covered by a layer of fibrocartilage which is identical in composition to the disc •It is classified as an atypical synovial joint as the joint consists mainly of collagen fibers with a few cartilage cells and no hyaline cartilage ANATOMY OF THE TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT •The capsule is attached high up on the neck of the mandible anteriorly near articular margin of the head, but lower down the neck posteriorly •Superiorly it is attached anteriorly just in front of the articular eminence of the temporal bone, posteriorly to the squamotympanic fissure and medially/laterally to the margins of the mandibular fossa •The synovial membrane lines the inside of the capsule and the intracapsular posterior aspect of the neck of the mandible •Gliding movements of protrusion and retrusion (translation) occur between the temporal bone and articular disc (superior joint cavity) •Hinge movements of depression and elevation and the rotational or pivoting movements occur in the inferior joint cavity MAJOR LIGAMENTS OF THE TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT •LATERAL TEMPOROMANDIBULAR LIGAMENT – INTRINSIC LIGAMENT: •Stout band of fibrous tissue passing obliquely down and back from the articular tubercle of the zygomatic arch to the lateral surface and posterior border of the neck of the mandible •On its deepest aspect a narrow band runs transversely from the articular tubercle to the lateral pole of the mandibular head •In concert with the postglenoid tubercle this ligament acts to prevent posterior dislocation of the joint •STYLOMANDIBULAR LIGAMENT – EXTRINSIC LIGAMENT •Thickening of the fibrous capsule of the parotid gland •Runs between the styloid process and the angle of the mandible •Does not contribute significantly to the strength of the joint •SPHENOMANDIBULAR LIGAMENT – EXTRINSIC LIGAMENT •Running between the spine of the sphenoid and the lingula of the mandible •It’s an accessory ligament of the joint •NERVE SUPPLY TO THE TMJ IS FROM THE AURICULOTEMPORAL NERVE AND THE NERVE TO MASSETER LIGAMENTS OF THE TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT STABILITY OF THE TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT •Most stable when the teeth are in occlusion •In the occluded position apart from the stabilizing effect of the teeth, forward movement of the condyle is discouraged by the prominence of the articular eminence and by contraction of the posterior fibers of temporalis •Backward movement is prevented by fibers of the lateral ligament and by contraction of the lateral pterygoid muscle •In the open position the joint is less stable as the condyle lies forward on the slope of the articular eminence •Forward dislocation is normally opposed by the articular eminence and by tension of the lateral ligament as well as by contraction of the masseter, medial pterygoid and temporalis muscles STABILITY OF THE TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT (CONTINUED) •When the condyle is dislocated forwards, reduction is prevented by spasms of the masseter, medial pterygoid and temporalis muscles, which hold the dislocated jaw open with the condyle in front of the eminence •Anterior dislocation readily occurs in the edentulous •In addition to the loss of stability resulting from the lack of proper occlusion in the elderly, increased postural elevation of the edentulous mandibular body lowers the mandibular head and neck and elongates the lateral ligament CLINICAL ANATOMY: DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE •DIAGNOSIS: •Has close parallels to osteoarthritis •General onset is in middle age •Joint is generally very painful, especially on movement and is quite tender on palpation of the lateral pole •Limitation of movement, particularly translational movement is often severe with intercisal opening often around a maximum of 20mm •On occasion, there is a grating or crackling crepitus on joint movement with the patient describing grinding / grating noises in the joint •Onset is over a couple of weeks with rarely a discrete history of any TMJ disorder before the reported event •There is reported evidence of large-scale molar tooth loss associated with the condition, however this cannot definitively be attributed to the condition •Radiographic investigation is usually the best confirmation technique: •Erosion of the joint surfaces •Osteophytes or traction spurs in active disease •Marked irregularity of the condylar surface in the resolving phase •Natural history of the disease: •Painful inflammatory, erosive phase (lasting up to 3 years) •Phase of resolution where the joint surfaces appear to recover and to some degree smooth out again CLINICAL ANATOMY: DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE •PRINCIPLE CLINICAL FEATURES OF DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE: •Pain centered in the joint •Tender joint •Crepitus (joint crackling and stiffness) •Limitation of mouth opening •Limited translatory movement •Radiological signs (erosion, traction spurs, remodeling) •TREATMENT: •Principle treatment is to maintain comfort with analgesics (NSAID) and taking the load off the joint by ensuring maximum occlusal support, while waiting for natural resolution •In severe cases: irrigation of and injection into the joint of steroids or more invasive surgery 1.
