Course Outline • What is the ANS? • Nervous system organisation • Comparison of the ANS with the somatic nervous system • Basic structures and functions of the ANS – Receptor types and subtypes – Neurotransmitters – 2nd messengers • Organization of the ANS – Comparison of the SNS and PNS • Autonomic control of specific target organs – Lungs – Heart, blood vessels, adrenal gland and sweat glands – Bladder – Eyes • lens – accommodation • iris – pupil diameter – Liver, gall bladder, pancreas and GIT • Drugs/pharmacology and the ANS – Pharmacology and the acetylcholine synapse – Pharmacology and the noradrenaline synapse NERVOUS SYSTEM (NS) Central NS (CNS) Peripheral NS Afferent division Efferent division Somatic NS Brain and spinal cord Nerve fibres that carry info between CNS and the periphery. Carries info to CNS. Tells CNS about external environment and provides info on internal activities being regulated by CNS. Carries info from CNS. Carries info to effector organs (muscles and glands) to bring about desired effects. Fibres of motor neurons that supply skeletal muscles – VOLUNTARY CONTROL Innervates smooth muscle, cardiac muscle and glands – “SELF-GOVERNING” In general, the NS acts by means of electrical signals (action potentials) to control the rapid responses of the body. Nerve and muscle cells are considered to be excitable tissues because they are able to produce electrical signals when excited . ANS (sympathetic and parasympathetic Autonomic = “self governing” → ANS regulates activities of systems not under voluntary control e.g. respiration, circulation, digestion, body temperature, metabolism, sweating, some endocrine ANS concerned with control of target tissues: - cardiac muscle, - smooth muscle in blood vessels & viscera, - glands. →helps maintain a constant internal body environment (homeostasis). NB- Imp of SNS & PNS: many commonly used medications (eg, medications for treating high BP, for regulating GIT function, or for maintaining a regular heart beat) have their major actions on neurons within these systems. What is the Autonomic NS ANS is divided into two major anatomically distinct divisions that have largely opposing actions: - sympathetic (thoracolumbar) (SNS) - parasympathetic (craniosacral) (PNS) divisions The cell bodies of the primary neurons (presynaptic/ preganglionic neurons) are located in the intermediolateral (IML) gray column of the spinal cord or in the brain stem nuclei. They send axons, which are usually small-diameter, myelinated , relatively slow conducting B fibers, out to synapse with the secondary neuron (postsynaptic/ postganglionic, neuron) located in one of the autonomic ganglia. From there, the postganglionic axon (mostly unmyelinated C fibers) passes to it’s target organ. The autonomic outflow system projects widely to most target tissues and is not as highly focused as the somatic motor system. Because the postganglionic fibers outnumber the preganglionic neurons by a ratio of about 32:1, a single preganglionic neuron may control the autonomic functions of a rather extensive terminal area. Autonomic Outflow Comparison of the ANS with the somatic nervous system *Myelinated *Not myelinated Somatic: - innervates skeletal muscle. - no neuron on neuron synapse outside CNS. - may not be tonically active. - larger, thicker fibres – faster. - simple Ach-based NT communication ANS: - usually more complex- requires 2nd msger systems → receptor activated → starts a chain of events. Somatic AP originate in CNS & sometimes (not often) from reflexes Vs. ANS actions originate from CNS, but most often through reflexes. (in-built control system for homeostasis) ANS pathway from CNS to target has a set (chain) of two fibres. Comparison of the ANS with the somatic nervous system Feature Autonomic Nervous System Somatic Nervous System Site of origin Brain or spinal cord Mostly spinal cord, those for head muscles originate in the brain Number of neurons from origin in CNS to effector organ Two-neuron chain (preganglionic and postganglionic) Single motor neuron Organs innervated Cardiac muscle, smooth muscle and glands (exocrine and some endocrine) Skeletal muscle Type of innervation Most effector organs dually innervated by two branches of this system (SNS & PNS; dual neuron) Effector organs innervated only by motor neurons (single neuron) Neurotransmitter at effector organ Acetylcholine (PNS) Noradrenaline (SNS) Acetylcholine only Effects on effector organs Either stimulation or inhibition Stimulation mostly Types of control involuntary control voluntary control although much activity is subconsciously coordinated Adapted from Human Physiology 7th edition, Sherwood.

Heart: SNS activation causes ↑ HR, while PNS activation causes ↓ HR - Control of pupil diameter: SNS contracts the radial muscle to cause pupil dilation (mydriasis), while PNS contracts the sphincter muscle to cause pupil constriction (miosis). Complementary SNS & PNS activation eg. Salivary glands: PNS activation causes the release of watery saliva, while SNS activation causes the production of thick, viscous saliva. Tonically active Adv: more precise, fine control TONE Sympathetic NS Parasympathetic NS Fight , fright, flight or freeze. Prepares body for physical activity/coping with stress/emergency (“catabolic NS”) Dominates in quite, relaxed situations.

SNS: α1 (NA) = vasoconstriction (decreased blood flow to skin, organs and gut) Regulation is accomplished by increasing or decreasing the firing rate above or below the tonic level in the sympathetic fibres. SNS on Sweat glands • Apocrine sweat glands (coarse hair: underarms, pubic area/between legs- “localized sweating”) – thicker mucous secretion (pheromones) – SNS: α1 receptors (NA)= secretion (PNS: no supply) • Eccrine sweat glands (generalized sweating: all over the body incl. above lip, palms, forehead) – watery secretion – for stress response and thermoregulation (chest, back, legs, feet, face) • SNS: muscarinic receptors (Ach)= secretion (= EXCEPTION!)

DISEASES Damage to the SNS superior cervical ganglion on left side producing Horner’s syndrome Ptosis = drooping of the eyelid Pheochromocytoma -Catecholamine-secreting tumour → mostly ↑NA - ↑HR (beta-1 on SA node) – palpatations - ↑BP (heart & vessels – α1) - weight loss (all cells metabolism) - blood glucose - sweating Long-term ↑ catacholamines: -Blunts normal sympathetic reflexes → orthostatic hyptension or shock during surgery or other major trauma/stresses - Myocardium become sensitive to circulating catacholamines → cardiac arrhythmias → ischaemic heart disease (↑ing O2 consumption assoc with catacholamine release) - Impaired glucose tolerance Raynaud's disease affects the toes, the fingers, the edges of the ears, and the tip of the nose and spreads to involve large areas. Beginning with local changes when the parts are pale and cold, it may progress to local asphyxia characterized by a blue-gray cyanosis and, finally, symmetric, dry gangrene. It is a disorder of the peripheral vascular innervation. - Ischaemia (due to adrenergic vascular responses) Causalgia, a painful condition of the hands or feet, is caused by irritation of the median or sciatic nerve through injury. It is characterized by severe burning pain, glossy skin, swelling, redness, sweating, and trophic nail changes. Causalgia may be relieved by sympathetic blocks or sympathectomy of the involved areas. Hirschsprung's disease (megacolon) consists of marked dilatation of the colon, accompanied by chronic constipation. It is associated with congenital lack of parasympathetic ganglia and abnormal nerve fibers in an apparently normal segment of large bowel. FYI! ONLY!","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
