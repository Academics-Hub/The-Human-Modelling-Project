His mother told the staff that the child does not play outside. The child’s diet consisted mostly of maize meal, bananas and carbonated soft drink, Coca-Cola. After examining the child, the doctor took a blood sample and requested x-rays of the child’s legs. The results of the blood analysis are shown in the table below. Plasma Child Normal Values Ionised calcium concentration (mmol/l) 0.75 1.16 - 1.32 Calcitriol (mmol/l) 1.05 2.05 - 2.56 Parathyroid hormone (PTH) (ng/l) 130 7 – 53 The child was diagnosed as having rickets. 1.
