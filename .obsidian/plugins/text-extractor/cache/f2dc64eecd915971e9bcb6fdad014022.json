Peroneal Retinacula • Inferior Peroneal Retinaculum • The inferior peroneal retinaculum binds the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis muscles to the lateral side of the calcaneum. • The tendons each possess a synovial sheath, which is continuous above with the common sheath. • Relations • The tendon of peroneus brevis passes through the superior loop and that of peroneus longus through the inferior loop of the inferior retinaculum. • Each tendon is enclosed in a separate synovial sheath, which are the prolongations of the common synovial sheath in the superior peroneal retinaculum. Clinical Significance of the Lateral Leg • Tenosynovitis of the Peroneus Longus and Brevis Tendons • Tenosynovitis (inflammation of the synovial sheaths) can affect the tendon sheaths of the peroneus longus and brevis muscles as they pass posterior to the lateral malleolus. • Treatment consists of immobilization, heat, and physiotherapy. • Dislocation of the Peroneus Longus and Brevis Tendons • Tendon dislocation can occur when the tendons of peroneus longus and brevis dislocate forward from behind the lateral malleolus. • For this condition to occur, the superior peroneal retinaculum must be torn. • It usually occurs in older children and is caused by trauma. Dorsum of the Foot Dorsum of the Foot • Skin • The skin on the dorsum of the foot is thin, hairy, and freely mobile on the underlying tendons and bone. • Sensory innervation • Superficial peroneal (musculocutaneous) nerve • It provides sensory innervation to most of the dorsum of the foot except the skin of the cleft between the first and second toes. It also supplies medial margin of the great toe. • Deep peroneal nerve • It provides innervation to the cleft between the first and second toes. • Sural nerve • It supplies lateral margin of the dorsum of the foot and lateral margin of the little toe. • Saphenous nerve • It supplies medial margins of the dorsum of the foot up to the head of the first metatarsal. Cutaneous Innervation of the Dorsum of the FootMuscles of the Dorsum of the Foot • Extrinsic muscle tendons • This include the tendons of the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg • Tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and peroneus tertius. • Intrinsic muscles (Extensor digitorum brevis) • The only intrinsic muscle of the foot • Origin • Calcaneum • Insertion • By four tendons into the proximal phalanx of big toe and long extensor tendons to the second, third, and fourth toes. • Innervation • Deep peroneal nerve • Action • Extend the toes Dorsalis Pedis Artery • It is the chief artery of the dorsum of the foot and the direct continuation of the anterior tibial artery in front of the ankle. • It passes forward along the medial side of the dorsum of the foot to reach the proximal end of the first intermetatarsal. • It dips downward between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle to enter the sole of the foot. • It ends by anastomosing with the lateral plantar artery. Dorsalis Pedis Artery • Relations • Superficially: Extensor hallucis brevis crosses the artery superficially from the lateral to medial side. • Deep: Ankle joint and tarsal bones. • Medial: Tendon of the extensor hallucis longus. • Lateral: First tendon of the extensor digitorum longus. • Branches • Lateral and medial tarsal arteries • Arcuate artery • First dorsal metatarsal artery Dorsal Venous Arch • The dorsal venous arch lies in the subcutaneous tissue over the heads of the metatarsal bones and drains on the medial side into the great saphenous vein and on the lateral side into the small saphenous vein. • The greater part of the blood from the whole foot drains into the arch via digital veins and communicating veins from the sole, which pass through the interosseous spaces. Clinical Significance • Dorsalis pedis artery pulse • It can be easily felt between the tendons of extensor hallucis longus and first tendon of extensor digitorum longus. • It is often palpated in patients suffering from vaso-occlusive diseases of the lower limb, e.g., Buerger’s disease. • The clinicians feeling this pulse should know that the dorsalis pedis artery is congenitally absent in about 14% of the cases. • In such cases the absence of dorsalis pedis pulse should be confirmed by the posterior tibial artery pulse.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
