Most ofthese algorithms only account for input such as glucose, insulin and carbohydrate, which limits their performance. Here, we present anovel glucose prediction algorithm which, in addition to standard inputs, accounts for meal absorption and physical exerciseinformation to enhance prediction accuracy. Methods: a compartmental model of glucose-insulin dynamics combined with adeconvolution technique for state estimation is employed for glucose prediction. In silico data corresponding from the 10 adultsubjects of UVa-Padova simulator, and clinical data from 10 adults with T1D were used. Finally, a comparison against a validatedglucose prediction algorithm based on a latent variable with exogenous input (LVX) model is provided. Results: For a predictionhorizon of 60 minutes, accounting for meal absorption and physical exercise improved glucose forecasting accuracy. In particular,root mean square error (mg/dL) went from 26.68 to 23.89, p<0.001 (in silico data); and from 37.02 to 35.96, p<0.001 (clinical data -only meal information). Such improvement in accuracy was translated into significant improvements on hypoglycaemia andhyperglycaemia prediction. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is statistically superior to that of the LVX algorithm(26.68 vs. 32.80, p<0.001 (in silico data); 37.02 vs. 49.17, p<0.01 (clinical data). Conclusion: Taking into account meal absorptionand physical exercise information improves glucose prediction accuracy.c. The model uses machine learning algorithms to learn from historical data and adapt to new inputs.d. Real-time monitoring of blood glucose levels can be achieved using wearable devices or continuous glucose monitoring systems.Key Takeaways:1.
