The interpretation of abnormalities of observations made either on patients (clients) directly (clinical examination) or indirectly (laboratory assessments of for example blood, urine and other samples) is an essential component of diagnosis and management. The accuracy of these interpretations is driven by an understanding of the physiological and biochemical mechanisms that explain both normal and abnormal observations. Consequently, gaining an understanding of normal and abnormal observations made on patients (clients) is indispensable to the rational practice of your discipline. The practical component of the course in physiology and medical biochemistry provides an opportunity for you to perform measurements and interpret data obtained from some routine techniques employed in medical diagnosis and management. Although in most instances the measurements are part of normal clinical practice, in some instances, you will also make observations using techniques that are not necessarily part of routine clinical assessments. These measurements have been provided to underscore the importance of some clinically important physiological or biochemical principles. In the case where measurements may take a considerable time to perform, demonstrations will be provided to illustrate the principle involved. You are required to know and understand the physiological and medical biochemical principles that underlie the measurements and observations upon which you will one day base a diagnosis or treatment. The practical component of your course provides the opportunity for you to expand on your observational, deductive and interpretative skills. These skills are a critical component of developing rational diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The ability to observe requires concentration and perception free from preconceived ideas, deduction requires the recall of factual knowledge with which an observation is associated, while interpretation requires a higher order of mental skill – reasoning and manipulation of raw data. In the practical classes you will often be faced with raw experimental data, and their translation into a meaningful result will require rearrangement, calculation, and integration of a number of variables. All of these 4 processes are required to hone your deductive and interpretation skills. The questions asked in the practical sessions assess your ability to make observations and to interpret and manipulate data. The practical component of your course also provides an informal forum for the consolidation and expansion of your knowledge of normal and abnormal human function. As will be described in subsequent discussion, we will expect you to interpret abnormalities observed in “paper patients” in the context of the normal observations made during the practical. During the practical sessions, therefore, you are encouraged to not only learn about your own bodies, but also to apply your knowledge of normal physiology to explain abnormal physiology. Many of the questions relate to clinical cases provided in the appendix. You should engage with these questions either during the practical or after the practical session in order to appropriately prepare yourself for assessments (class tests and examinations) that will be conducted during the course of the year. It is worth emphasizing that most of the physiology and biochemistry you learn this year is occurring in your body as you read this introduction. Human function is not something that happens in other people only. By recording these variables, your records will serve as a source of important medical information such as your blood group, cardiovascular and renal function, neurological function and respiratory status. In addition, it is important that you establish your own “normal” values for different variables, and thereby appreciate the wide range of “normal”. Aims In short, in the practical component of the physiology and medical biochemistry course offered to you this year, you are expected: - to familiarize yourselves with some of the practical skills required to perform an appropriate clinical examination. - appreciate the range of “normal” values that you have obtained through measurements conducted on yourself or colleagues or which have been provided to you through demonstration. - show understanding of the physiological and biochemical mechanisms that control normal observations that you have made or which have been demonstrated to you. - show understanding of the physiological and biochemical principles that explain possible abnormalities of these observations. 5 Tasks and components of sessions The notes provided in this booklet provide background to the observations that you will undertake during the course of the practical sessions, describe each of the tasks that you are expected to perform, offer a series of questions that assess your ability to interpret normal observations, and offer a series of questions that assess your ability to interpret abnormal observations obtained in clinical cases that will be presented to you during the course of the practical sessions. In addition, each practical will begin with a short (~10 minute) pre-practical tutorial delivered by a member of staff. This tutorial will describe some of the measurements that you will be expected to perform, as well as provide the details of one or more patient’s clinical symptoms and signs and laboratory data that we will expect you to interpret in the context of the observations that you will make during the practical. In many instances the patient’s clinical signs and laboratory data provided will have been obtained using observations that you will either conduct or that will be demonstrated to you during the course of a practical. Hence, measurements made in the practical will relate to abnormalities described in these patients. Your task, as underscored above (see aims), is to perform and understand the normal observations that you may make on yourselves or others or that have been provided in a demonstration and subsequently to understand the abnormal observations made in the “paper” patient(s) given to you at each practical session or listed in the appendix. Each practical session is about two hours long, giving you ample time to complete the tasks set and for informal discussion with staff members and demonstrators. Use this opportunity to discuss your answers to the questions asked in the practical notes, as no model answers to practicals will be provided. You are encouraged to consult members of staff and demonstrators on any aspect of the course with which you may encounter difficulties. 6 Some of the practicals are designed to work on a rotation system. At the first practical session you will be assigned to your particular group. You will work in this group for the remainder of the year. Each of the practicals is designed to ensure that the student-to-equipment and student-to-demonstrator ratios are optimal. Each practical will consist of a series of diagnostic skills/tasks which you need to have performed and mastered by the end of that particular practical and a series of questions related to clinical problems which you should be able to answer either in the practical or at a later time. How to use this booklet to achieve the expected aims Each practical is introduced by way of a note on, or discussion of the clinical relevance of each of the measurements as well as some of the theoretical principles involved. Each practical task (measurement or demonstration) is assigned a station number and a short background may be given for the measurement or task required at these stations. To get the most out of practical sessions you should therefore come adequately prepared, and this includes studying and digesting these “preambles” before the laboratory class. During the practical sessions an earnest effort is required on your part to answer the problems and questions set. In many instances, to answer the questions you may be required to perform simple calculations which may require the use of calculators. Members of staff and demonstrators may be consulted whenever you may experience conceptual difficulties, but do not expect to be “spoon-fed”. Please bring your textbooks and class notes to each practical class as you will need to consult them on background information. If a practical session is conducted prior to the lectures for any particular topic, you should engage in the practical aspects in the time given and follow-up the practical aspects with applying your minds to understanding the theoretical aspects. For ease of use of the manual during the practical, descriptions of tasks have been blocked throughout the practical manual as demonstrated here. 7 Assessment of the practical component of the course Your understanding of the mechanisms of observations made during the course of the practical sessions during the year and your ability to apply this knowledge to clinical problems will be examined in class tests and in the final examination at the end of the year. Importantly, you will be tested on the information (theoretical and practical) contained in this practical book as well as your ability to interpret the clinical abnormalities noted in cases provided at each practical. 8 PRACTICAL SESSION 1: BODY COMPOSITION In South Africa, malnutrition, including under-nutrition (e.g Kwashiorkor) or over-nutrition (obesity) are leading causes of death. Abnormalities in body fluid status, which frequently precipitate death in malnutrition, are often associated with nutritional abnormalities (for example dehydration or oedema may occur in Kwashiorkor or diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and oedema may occur in obesity when complications such as heart failure arise). Hence, it is worth considering the impact of nutritional diseases and diseases that affect body fluid status together. In this regard, to understand the clinical consequences of nutritional diseases and abnormalities of body fluid status, you will, in your future professions, perform assessments that will provide you with insights into changes in the composition of the body that relate to body fluid and nutritional status, including aberrations in body fluid compartments, and abnormalities in the relative or absolute composition of lean versus fat tissue in the body. Importantly, irrespective of whether changes in the composition of body fluids or the absolute or relative composition of fat and lean tissue occurs, these changes can have major deleterious clinical effects and may be used to assist in the diagnosis and management of diseases. It is therefore important that you are able to perform and interpret measurements that provide insights into the causes or consequences of alterations in the composition of the body. During the course of the year, in class assessments, in the final examination, and finally as practitioners, you will be expected to interpret a variety of data related to the observations that you make in the present practical session. Importantly, clinical cases are provided in this practical session against which you should compare your findings and answer the questions given. Much of the patient’s clinical data can be found in the appendix of this manual. However, some of the data will only be made available during the practical session. 9 Practical 1 stations: STATION A: Body fluid composition. A-1: Urine osmolarity A-2: Impact of changes in plasma osmolality on red cell shape (blood smears). A-3: Oral rehydration therapy. STATION B: Body composition and causes of abnormalities of body composition B-1: Anthropometry. B-2: Energy intake. B-3: Bioimpedance. 1: Body fluid composition Abnormalities in fluid balance may result in over- or under-hydration of either the intracellular or the extracellular space, or both, changes which are not only determined by fluid loss or gain, but by changes in the osmolarity of the extracellular space as well. Plasma osmolarity, which is largely determined by plasma Na+ concentrations and the negative ions that it dissociates from, with a minor contribution from K +, glucose and urea concentrations, reflects osmolarity in the extracellular space. Plasma and extracellular osmolarity are the same, as most non-cellular constituents of blood, including electrolytes, glucose and urea, diffuse freely across the capillary membrane. Extracellular (reflected in plasma) osmolarity is an important determinant of the volume of the intracellular space, as, through osmotic effects, increases in extracellular osmolarity will reduce intracellular volume (fluid is encouraged to move out of the cell), whereas decreases in extracellular osmolarity will increase intracellular osmolarity (fluid is encouraged to move into the cell). Thus, a dehydrated extracellular space may result in an over-hydrated intracellular space. Consequently, when assessing body fluid balance, measures or estimates of the osmolarity of various body fluids such as in plasma or urine are often useful when interpreting abnormalities of body fluid composition. In the present practical you will be given the opportunity to better understand the factors that influence the osmolarity of various body fluids as well as the impact of changes in plasma osmolarity on the status of intracellular and extracellular 10 compartments and thus on cell volume. As oral rehydration is often a life-saving intervention in abnormalities of body fluid balance, and the type of fluid given influences plasma osmolarity and hence the clinical consequences of abnormalities of plasma osmolarity, you will also be given the opportunity to compare the clinical value of various oral fluids, based on knowledge of their constituents. STATION A-1: Urine osmolarity The kidneys are key regulators of plasma osmolality and often reflect changes in body fluid balance. This occurs mainly because the kidneys have a marked capacity to concentrate fluid that is excreted (urine), so that when we dehydrate, water is retained, but solutes are still excreted. This effect is also regulated by changes in plasma (extracellular) osmolarity, so that if plasma osmolarity increases, further water, but not solutes, are retained so that the effect is that relatively more solutes are excreted as compared to water. The water that is retained dilutes the extracellular fluid and the effect is to decrease extracellular osmolarity. Thus, measurements of urine osmolarity often provide important insights into changes in body fluid balance and plasma osmolarity. These changes are determined largely by different types of fluid loss or gain, where if the fluid lost contains more water than solutes (hypotonic fluid), with the net effect being an increase in plasma osmolarity (hypertonic dehydration), the kidneys will respond by retaining more water than solutes and the urine will become very concentrated. If the fluid lost contains an equivalent amount of solute (isotonic fluid), with the net effect being no change in plasma osmolarity (isotonic dehydration), the kidneys will respond by retaining an equivalent amount of water and solutes 11 Urine osmolarity is normally assessed in clinical laboratories with sophisticated techniques that go beyond the scope of your needs. However, a simple method of estimating urine osmolarity is by measuring urine specific gravity using the following approach provided for you at STATION A-1: For this station two methods will be used. The first uses a hydrometer and the second uses a refractometer. - Obtain a mid-stream urine sample and pour the sample into a measuring cylinder. Method 1 (Station A-1a) Determination of urine specific gravity using a hydrometer - Float the hydrometer supplied on the urine, spinning the hydrometer gently to make sure it is freely floating. - Determine your urine specific gravity from the bottom of the meniscus. Method 2 (Station A1-b) Determination of urine specific gravity using a clinical hand-held refractometer - Clean and calibrate the refractometer using the instructions at station A1-b. These instructions are on laminated sheets. - Place two drops of urine onto the cover plate. Close the cover plate and direct to the light. Record the urine specific gravity value visible in the last column. Nb the clinical refractometer can also be used to determine: a. Serum total protein concentration (middle column). b. Whether water has been contaminated. Pure water ND =1.333 Read and record the value 12 Your urine specific gravity method 1………………………………………. Your urine specific gravity method 2………………………………………. - Using the graph provided on the bench, estimate your urine osmolarity using the urine specific gravity value that you have obtained. Your urine osmolarity…………………………………….. Questions 1) Compare your urine osmolarity with that of your plasma osmolarity, assuming that your plasma osmolarity (normally 280-295 mmol/l) and indicate the differences. 2) Explain the physiological mechanisms that normally result in the differences in urine and plasma osmolarity that you have observed. 3) Name two important hormones involved in the regulation of plasma volume and osmolarity, respectively. 4) Explain the physiological mechanisms responsible for differences between your urine osmolarity and the patient’s urine osmolarity given for clinical case A in the appendix. STATION A-2 Impact of changes in plasma osmolarity on red cell shape When fluid is lost in conditions such as diarrhoea (clinical case A in the appendix), excess sweating, endocrine diseases and many other conditions, changes in the electrolyte concentration of blood may occur. If the electrolyte changes involve substances that contribute toward plasma osmolarity (NaCl), the cellular effect will be alterations in the volume of cells in the body as it is the osmolarity of blood that determines the direction in which fluid moves across cell membranes (see above discussion). If fluid is encouraged to move into cells because extracellular osmolarity is lower than intracellular osmolarity, cell volume will increase. If fluid moves out of cells, because extracellular osmolarity is greater than intracellular osmolarity, cell 13 volume decreases. These alterations in cell volume produce many clinical effects such as electrical disturbances of the heart and nervous system. The present station is designed to demonstrate to you the effect of changes in plasma electrolyte concentrations and hence osmolarity on cell volume. The demonstration at STATION A-2 shows the effect of changes in fluid osmolarity on red blood cell volume. Slides with blood exposed to fluids of different osmolarities are provided. You should view these slides under the microscope and record the general appearance of the erythrocytes in the blood smears after exposure to: Smear 1) 0.9% saline (NaCl) ………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………… Smear 2) 0.5% saline (NaCl) ………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………… Smear 3) 2.7 % saline (NaCl) ………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………… Questions 1) Calculate the osmolarity of the 0.9% solution and compare this osmolarity with your plasma osmolarity of ~ 295 mmol/l. 2) Explain the differences in erythrocyte shape recorded in blood smears exposed to different fluid osmolarities. 3) Using you observations noted in the different slides, and explaining your answer, indicate how in the clinical case A described in the appendix for this practical, the patient’s intracellular volume may have changed as compared to normal. 4) Giving a physiological explanation for your choice, decide whether red cells would look like either smear 1, 2 or 3 in a patient who is dehydrated because she has: 14 i) been running an ultramarathon. ii) a lack of antidiuretic hormone. STATION A-3 Oral rehydration therapy The most common cause of disturbances in body fluid balance is dehydration resulting from gastroenteritis (with diarrhoea and vomiting). An example of dehydration resulting from gastroenteritis in a child is given in clinical case A described in the appendix for this practical. You should note the typical clinical signs that occur with marked dehydration that are evident in the picture of the child, including dry mucous membranes and sunken eyes. Death rates from gastroenteritis in children have been considerably reduced since the initiation of campaigns to use oral rehydration therapy before children reach hospital settings. The goal of oral rehydration therapy is to restore blood volume and plasma osmolarity and hence to prevent hypovolaemic shock (shock from a decreased blood volume) and changes in intracellular fluid volume produced by changes in plasma osmolarity. Oral rehydration solutions are made by boiling a litre of water and allowing it to cool and subsequently adding a half a teaspoon of table salt (NaCl) and 8 teaspoons of table sugar (sucrose). Commercial oral rehydration fluid can also be purchased which, in addition to NaCl and sucrose, has KCl added. Although KCl is not a major determinant of plasma osmolarity, changes in plasma K+ concentrations, produced by K + loss in the gastrointestinal tract in gastroenteritis, can cause major electrical disturbances in the body (see Excitable tissue physiology). 15 To assess the characteristics of oral rehydration fluid, examine, list and compare the constituents/ingredients of the four fluids provided on the bench at STATION A-3: 1. Oral rehydration fluid ………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………… 2. Commercial rehydration salts ………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………… 3. Energade ………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………… 4. Coca cola ………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………… Questions 1) Indicate the purpose of boiling water before using it for oral rehydration therapy. 2) Indicate the physiological reason for including NaCl in oral rehydration therapy. 3) Indicate the physiological reason for including table sugar in oral rehydration therapy. 4) Indicate, how, once the constituents of these solutions are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, each of the solutions may influence plasma osmolarity. 5) Giving reasons for your choice, indicate one solution that you would select to use for oral rehydration therapy in the clinical case A given in the appendix for this practical. 16 2. Body composition As indicated in the aforementioned discussion, through socioeconomic circumstances, lack of education (of the foods that are appropriate for the normal growth and development of children), and susceptibility to consumer advertising; nutritional disorders that result in under-nutrition, such as Kwashiorkor, play a major role in accounting for the high mortality rates that exist in South Africa. With the increasing prevalence of infectious diseases, such as HIV and tuberculosis in South Africa, more frequently, under-nutrition is noted because of increasing body demands for nutrients to maintain nutritional homeostasis. Moreover, with changes in family support structures for children and an ever increasing emphasis placed on outward appearances produced by aggressive marketing strategies targeting youth, the prevalence of eating disorders which result in under-nutrition (e.g anorexia) is increasing in South Africa. These nutritional disorders all result in abnormalities of body composition. Although, undoubtedly under-nutrition is a serious health problem in South Africa, there is now good evidence to indicate that the prevalence of obesity (excessive adiposity) is also increasing at a rapid rate, a disturbance that is caused by over- nutrition. Importantly, obesity is also thought to contribute to excess mortality rates in South Africa and is an important factor contributing toward disability. There are many potential causes of obesity, but of note, a sedentary lifestyle and excessive intakes of carbohydrates and fat are the principle causes of obesity. In this regard, excessive carbohydrate and fat intake occurs because of the low cost of and easy access to nutritionally inappropriate foods which are designed to satisfy taste, but not nutritional needs; a susceptibility to aggressive consumer advertising; a lack of education as to appropriate eating habits and how to read food labels; and cultural beliefs. Over- nutrition also results in abnormalities of body composition. To identify under-nutrition or over-nutrition in clients or patients, you will employ simple measures of body composition to guide you in the identification or in the management of the nutritional problem. In the present practical you will be given an opportunity to perform many of these measurements on yourself or your colleagues and to interpret abnormalities in these measurements in “paper” cases. Many of the cases presented will also relate to you upcoming metabolism lectures. 17 STATION B-1 Anthropometry Anthropometry refers to the measurement of the size, weight and proportions of different parts of the body. Anthropometric measurements are frequently used to assess growth and nutritional status, of which body height and mass are the simplest and most commonly employed. In under-nutrition, weight (in both children and adults) and height (in children) are good indices of nutritional and growth status if they are measured repeatedly over time. For example, an adult who in the absence of attempts to reduce weight, loses 5% of their body mass over a month or 10% over 6 months is at nutritional risk and these changes suggest an underlying pathology. Also, body mass charts are routinely used by practitioners to track nutritional status in neonates, infants and children and are a key predictor of under-nutrition. These “growth charts” and their interpretation are provided in the appendix to the present practical. It is important to note that body mass alone is not an appropriate assessment of nutritional status. This is because a short person is likely to have a much lower body mass than a taller person, but the short person may not be undernourished and the tall person may not be over-nourished. To adjust for the impact of growth on body mass, body mass is adjusted for growth by calculating the body mass index (BMI) from the following formula. The interpretation of this value is given in a table in the appendix: Body mass index (BMI)=Mass (kg)/[height (m)]2 Although height in children and body mass in both children and adults are key predictors of under-nutrition, they are inadequate measures of over-nutrition or obesity, as they do not provide a guide to body composition. Indeed, obesity is not associated with an increased height and although obesity is associated with an excess body mass, an increase in body mass may occur because of an accumulation of either lean or fat tissue mass (such as occurs in an athlete). Thus, an increased body mass or an increased BMI does not necessarily indicate deleterious over-nutrition. Hence, in people with an increased body mass for their size, further anthropometric measurements such as skin- fold thickness, and waist and hip circumference are also performed. Whereas skin-fold thickness indicates the degree of peripheral or subcutaneous fat, waist circumference and the ratio between waist and hip circumference indicates 18 the degree of central fat accumulation (fat in visceral compartments, such as in the peritoneal cavity- see case C in the appendix). From the sum of skin-fold thickness (biceps, triceps, subscapular and supra-iliac), the percentage body fat can be estimated (see table in appendix). However, central obesity, as indexed by increases in waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio is more closely associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular events, such as strokes or heart attacks than is peripheral obesity. Thus, when assessing the cardiovascular risk of obesity, measures of central fat are preferred over measures of peripheral fat. It is important to note that because men tend to accumulate central fat, whereas women tend to accumulate fat in the periphery whilst only later on in life (postmenopausal period) centrally as well, fat distribution in the body is often referred to as either android (male pattern) or gynoid (female pattern). Measure your colleague’s body mass, height, skin-fold thickness and waist and hip circumference using the following approaches at STATION B-1: - Remove shoes and heavy clothing. - Zero the scale and stand still in the centre of the scale. - Record the body mass. Body mass……………………………………………………………………………. - Stand erect with feet placed together, heels against the wall or measuring board, and look straight ahead. - Lower the horizontal bar/block to rest onto the head. - Record your height to the nearest 0.0005 meters (5 mm).

Supra-iliac skin-fold thickness……………………………………………………… - Ask your colleague to stand with their hands elevated. - Half way between the lowest level of the ribs and the iliac crest place a tape measure around the waist so that it lies parallel with the floor (see photograph supplied in the laboratory) and record the waist circumference. 20 Waist circumference……………………………………………………… - Ask your colleague to stand with their hands loosely at the side. - At the umbilicus level (see photograph supplied in the laboratory) and record the waist circumference.

At rest, basal metabolic rate is between 6000-8000 kJ/day and hence each day, assuming that we are inactive, to meet our energy demands at rest, we should only consume this caloric value. To produce this energy, the diet should contain ~4500 kJ of carbohydrate, ~1500 kJ/day from protein and ~2000 kJ/day from fat. Eating normal helpings of unprocessed foods easily provides this requirement. However, most people consume processed foods and it is the consumption of these foods, together with an excess intake of carbohydrates and to some extent fats that, in general, produces obesity. You should perform the following task designed to demonstrate to you the impact of the consumption of processed foods or liquids on energy expenditure. Indicate your caloric intake if you were to consume the fluids or food products provided on the bench at STATION B-2: 1. 500 ml of coke light.…………………………………………………………. 2. 440 ml of coca cola.………………………………………………………… 3. One chocolate bar (35g/41.5g/50g/52g)……………………………………… 4. One 36 g packet of chips……………..……………………………………… 5. One 45 g packet of Doritos………………………………………………….. Questions 1) Assuming that a well-balanced lunch provides one third of your normal daily resting energy requirements, compare this with the energy intake of a lunch consisting of 500mls coca cola, one chocolate bar and one 30 g packet of chips. 2) Based on the patient’s dietary history and the nutritional values of food provided in the appendix and those recorded above, give a physiological explanation for the problems noted in patients B and C for the cases provided in the appendix. 3) Explaining your answer indicate the dietary advice that you would offer to patient’s B and C for the cases provided in the appendix. 22 4) People often think that processed fruit juices have less sugar than fizzy beverages. Compare the sugar content of the fruit juices to that of the fizzy drinks provided at station B2. What advice would you give people about processed fruit juices? STATION B-3 Bioimpedance Although the percentage body fat can be estimated using skin-fold thickness values, this technique relies on a high degree of skill to measure skin-fold thickness accurately, and the calculation produces only an estimate. Hence, more accurate assessments of the fat composition of the body have been developed. One such assessment is bioimpedance. Bioimpedance is a method used to assess body composition. The method assumes that most of body water is contained in muscle tissue and that hydration of adipose tissue is minimal. As water behaves as a conductor, fat- free mass has a higher conductivity than fat mass. The method of bioimpedance has become popular owing to its ease of use, portability of the equipment and it’s relatively low cost compared to some of the other methods of body composition analysis. However, methodological limitations of bioimpedance measurements include the lack of reliable data obtained in dehydration or overhydration (where oedema occurs), or with recent food intake or physical exercise. It is therefore recommended that subjects avoid alcohol intake, avoid physical exercise and should fast for at least 8 hours prior to measurements. Patients or clients should also void their bladders before measurements are obtained, and they should not be taking any drugs that affect water balance e.g. diuretics. There is also question as to the reliability of bioimpedance measurements in patients with a body mass index less than 16 kg/m2, or greater than 34 kg/m2. Nevertheless it is otherwise considered accurate in healthy subjects and in chronic diseases with a validated bioimpedance equation that is appropriate with regards to age, gender and ethnic group. 23 To assess your body composition using bioimpedance you should perform the following at STATION B-3: - Remove your shoes and socks or other foot covering. - Once the bioimpedance machine is ready, or on instruction from the demonstrator, stand in the centre of the metal pads on top of the machine and then stand still until either the machine indicates completion of the reading or the demonstrator tells you to step off. - Obtain a print-out of your body fat percentage, lean mass percentage, and body water percentage, amongst other parameters. Questions 1) Compare the results for your body fat percentage derived from the method of adding the skin folds to that derived using the method of bioimpedance. 2) Giving reasons for your answer comment on the reliability of the bioimpedance measurement that you have obtained on yourself. 3) Giving reasons for your answer indicate the reliability of the bioimpedance measurement, if made on patients A, B, C, or D in the clinical cases given for the present practical. 24 Additional questions related to body fluid composition In the aforementioned questions relating to case A given to you in the appendix of the present practical session, you were required to provide a physiological explanation for the oedema that occurred in the patient. There are many causes of oedema. The clinical problems of the following patients with oedema are described in the photographs posted in the laboratory. You should study these photographs in the laboratory to better observe the clinical signs and to identify the clinical problem Patient A Patient B Patient C Patient D Patient E Clinical problem ……………… ……………. ……………… ……………… …………………. ……………… …………… ……………… ……………… ………………….. ……………… …………… ……………… ………………. …………………. 1. Explaining your answer in each case, indicate whether the following statements are correct or incorrect. a) Patient A has a swollen leg because of an increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. b) Patient B has a swollen hand because of a decreased capillary oncotic pressure. c) Patient C has a swollen leg because of an increased permeability of the capillary membrane to fluid. d) Patient D has a swollen lip because of a decreased capillary osmotic pressure. e) Patient E has a swollen leg because of an increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. f) The patients depicted have fluid that has accumulated in the intracellular space. 25 APPENDIX Video Name QR Code Khan Academy Tonicity Skinfold Body Fat Assessment RBCs in Hypotonic-Isotonic and Hypertonic solution practical How to make oral rehydration solution Bioimpedance Video How to find your waist to hip ratio Station A-1 Urine osmolarity 26 Energy Balance How to measure your body fat without equipment and for free Hypotonic vs Hypertonic Solutions CASES PROVIDED FOR PRACTICAL 1 CASE A (also referred to in practical 2) The 14 month old dehydrated boy shown in the photograph had diarrhoea at the time of presentation.

The child’s body weight is indicated in the photograph provided and his legs were mildly oedematous. 27 The following blood and urine results were obtained in the child: Plasma Na + (mmol/l) 150 (Normal value=135-148) K + (mmol/l) 3.1 (Normal value=3.3-5.0) Glucose (mmol/l) 3.2 (Normal value=3.4-6.1) Urea (mmol/l) 9.4 (Normal value=2.5-6.6) Albumin (g/l) 26 (Normal value=35-55) Urine Specific gravity 1.045 (Normal value=1.005-1.045) Volume (l/24 hours) 0.5 (Normal value=0.9-4.0) CASES B-E The nutritional status of four patients was assessed using anthropometric measurements, as well as a series of blood tests. You should study the photographs provided in the laboratory to better observe these patients. Data for the anthropometric measurements and blood test results will be circulated at the practical session.
