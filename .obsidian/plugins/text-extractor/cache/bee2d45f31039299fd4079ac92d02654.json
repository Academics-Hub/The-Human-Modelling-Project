Therefore, the talus is the keystone of this arch. • Joints • The main joints of the medial longitudinal arch are talocalcaneonavicular and subtalar joints. Factors Maintaining the Medial Longitudinal Arch • Bones • The sustentaculum tali partly support the head of talus. • Ligaments • Plantar calcaneonavicular ligament (spring ligament) which provides dynamic support to the head of talus. • Interosseous ligaments connecting the adjacent bones. • Interosseous talocalcanean ligament, connecting these bones. These ligaments act as intersegmental ties. • Muscles, tendons, and aponeurosis acting as tie beams • The medial part of the plantar aponeurosis and abductor hallucis assisted by the flexor hallucis brevis act as tie beam to maintain the height of the medial longitudinal arch. Factors Maintaining the Medial Longitudinal Arch • Muscles, tendons, and aponeurosis acting as slings • The tendon of tibialis posterior lying underneath the spring ligament provides dynamic supports to the head of talus and suspends the arch from above. • The flexor hallucis longus is the bulkiest and strongest muscle to support the medial longitudinal arch. • It stretches the arch like the string of a bow. • It supports the calcaneus by passing underneath the sustentaculum tali. • It supports the talus by passing along its posterior groove. Lateral Longitudinal Arch • The lateral longitudinal arch is formed by the calcaneum cuboid and lateral two metatarsals. • It low, almost touches the ground and it receives and support the body weight during walking and running. • Pillars • The posterior pillar of the lateral longitudinal arch is formed by the lateral tubercle of the calcaneum, and the anterior pillar is formed by the heads of the lateral two metatarsals. • Summit • The summit of the lateral longitudinal arch lies at the level of articular facets on the superior surface of the calcaneum (i.e., at the level of subtalar joint). • Joints • The main joint of the lateral longitudinal arch is calcaneocuboid joint. Factors Maintaining the Lateral Longitudinal Arch • Bones • The proper shaping of the distal end of calcaneus and proximal end of cuboid. The cuboid is the keystone of longitudinal arch. • Ligaments (act as intersegmental ties) • Short plantar ligament: • The short plantar ligament is broad and thick. • It lies deep to the long plantar ligament and supports the calcaneocuboid joint from below. • Long plantar ligament: • The long plantar ligament is quite long and supports the joints between the calcaneum, cuboid, and related metatarsals. Factors Maintaining the Lateral Longitudinal Arch • Muscles, tendons, and aponeurosis acting as tie beams: • The lateral part of the plantar aponeurosis and the intrinsic muscles of the little toe • (e.g., lateral part of the flexor digitorum brevis, abductor digiti minimi brevis, and flexor digiti minimi brevis). • Muscles, tendons, and aponeurosis acting as slings: • The tendons of peroneus brevis and peroneus tertius, which are inserted on the base of the fifth metatarsal, act as weak slings from above. Transverse Arches • Anterior transverse arch • The heads of the metatarsals form the anterior transverse arch. • It is a complete arch because during standing position the heads of first and fifth metatarsals come into contact to the ground and form the two ends of the arch. • Posterior transverse arch • It is formed by greater parts of the tarsus and metatarsus. • It is an incomplete arch because only its lateral end meets the ground during standing position. • It forms only half of the dome in one foot. • The complete dome is formed when the two feet are brought together. Factors Maintaining the Transverse Arches • Bones • Most of the tarsal and metatarsal bones have larger dorsal and smaller plantar surfaces (i.e., wedge-shaped), which help to form and maintain the concavity on the plantar aspect of the foot skeleton. • Ligaments • These are small ligaments, which bind together the cuneiform bones and metatarsals. • Superficial and deep transverse metatarsal ligaments at the heads of metatarsals function as intersegmental ties to maintain the shallow arch at the heads of metatarsals. • Muscles and tendons • Acting as tie beams: The tendons of peroneus longus and tibialis posterior support the transverse arch as tie beam. • Acting as slings: The peroneus tertius and peroneus brevis on the lateral side and tibialis anterior on the medial side support the transverse arch as slings. • Acting as intersegmental ties: The dorsal interossei act Functions of the Arches • Distribute the body weight to the weight-bearing points of the sole (e.g., heel; balls of the toes, mainly those of first and fifth toes and lateral border of the sole). • Act as shock absorber during jumping by their springlike action. • The medial longitudinal arch provides a propulsive force during locomotion. • The lateral longitudinal arch functions as a static organ of support and weight transmission. • The concavity of the arches protects the nerves and vessels of the sole. Clinical Significance • Flat foot (pes planus): • It is the commonest of all foot problems. • It occurs due to the collapse of medial longitudinal arch. • The effects of the flat foot are: • The person usually has clumsy shuffling gait due to the loss of spring in the foot. • Makes the foot more liable to trauma due to loss of the shock absorbing function. • The compression of the nerves and vessels of the sole is due to the loss of concavity of the sole. https://www.foot-pain-explored.com/foot-arch-pain.html Clinical Significance • High arched foot (pes cavus): • The exaggeration of the longitudinal arch of the foot causes pes cavus. • This usually occurs because of a contracture (plantar flexion) at the transverse tarsal joint. • When the patient walks with a high arched foot there is dorsiflexion of the metatarsophalangeal joints and the plantar flexion of the interphalangeal joints of the toes. Clinical Significance • Club foot/Talipes: may be congenital or acquired- five types of clubfoot: • Talipes equinus (horse like): • In this condition, the foot is plantar flexed, and person walks on the toes with heel raised. • Talipes calcaneus: • In this condition, the person walks on the heel with forefoot raised. • Talipes varus: • In this condition, the foot is inverted and adducted. The person walks on the outer border of the foot. • Talipes valgus: • In this condition, the foot is everted and abducted. The person walks on the inner border of his foot. • Talipes equinovarus: • It is the commonest deformity of the foot. In this condition, the foot is inverted, adducted, and plantar flexed. Clinical Significance • Hallux valgus (Bunion) • In this condition, the big toe is deviated laterally at the metatarsophalangeal joint. • It usually occurs due to constant wearing of pointed shoes with high heel. • The head of the first metatarsal bone becomes prominent and rubs on the shoe. • This leads to the formation of protective adventitious bursa called bunion on the medial side of the big toe. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunion Clinical Significance • Hammer toe • It is a deformity of the toe in which metatarsophalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints are hyper-extended but the proximal interphalangeal joint is acutely flexed. • This deformity usually affects the 2nd and 3rd toes. https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/hammer-toe/","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
