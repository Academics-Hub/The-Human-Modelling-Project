Calculate: a) The peak voltage output. (ans. 240 V) b) The output frequency (ans. 100 Hz). c) The time interval corresponding to a phase angle of 900(2.5 ms) 2 What changes can you do to the single phase generator to increase the efficiency i.e. increase efficiency of conversion of the mechanical power input to electrical power output? _____________________________________________________ Disadvantage of single phase is pulsating power and Pett PI additionally causes freq p 2 frequ an unstable rotation machine back vibrates Decrease friction of rotor increase magnet surfer area M B M d i d u value 1a left 170 V U Avett up ftp yrPYzfs 60gy 120001120 10041 i not E 2g I Koot 0,0025 z5m","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
