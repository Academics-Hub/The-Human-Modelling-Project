V About the Authors Jan Koolman (left) was born in Lübeck, Ger- many, and grew up with the sea wind blowing off the Baltic. The high school he attended in the Hanseatic city of Lübeck was one that focused on providing a classical education, which left its mark on him. From 1963 to 1969, he studied biochemistry at the Univer- sity of Tübingen. He then took his doctorate (in the discipline of chemistry) at the Univer- sity of Marburg, under the supervision of bio- chemist Peter Karlson. In Marburg, he began to study the biochemistry of insects and other invertebrates. He took his postdoctoral de- gree in 1977 in the field of human medicine, and was appointed Honorary Professor in 1984. His field of study today is biochemical endocrinology. His other interests include ed- ucational methods in biochemistry. He is cur- rently Dean of Studies in the Department of Medicine in Marburg; he is married to an art teacher. Klaus-Heinrich Röhm (right) comes from Stuttgart, Germany. After graduating from the School of Protestant Theology in Urach —another institution specializing in classical studies—and following a period working in the field of physics, he took a diploma in bio- chemistry at the University of Tübingen, where the two authors first met. Since 1970, he has also worked in the Department of Medicine at the University of Marburg. He took his doctorate under the supervision of Friedhelm Schneider, and his postdoctoral de- gree in 1980 was in the Department of Chem- istry. He has beenanHonorary Professor since 1986. His research group is concerned with the structure and function of enzymes in- volved in amino acid metabolism. He is mar- ried to a biologist and has two children. Jürgen Wirth (center) studied in Berlin and at the College of Design in Offenbach, Germany. His studies focused on free graphics and illus- tration, and his diploma topic was “The devel- opment and function of scientific illustration.” From 1963 to 1977, Jürgen Wirth was involved in designing the exhibition space in the Senckenberg Museum of Natural History in Frankfurtam Main, whileatthe same time working as a freelance associate with several publishing companies, providing illustrations for schoolbooks, non-fiction titles, and scien- tific publications. He has received several awards for book illustration and design. In 1978, he was appointed to a professorship at the College of Design in Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany, and in 1986 he became Professor of Design at the Academy of Design in Darm- stadt, Germany. His specialist fields include scientific graphics/information graphics and illustration methods. He is married and has three children. VI Preface Biochemistry is a dynamic, rapidly growing field, and the goal of this color atlas is to illustrate this fact visually. The precise boun- daries between biochemistry and related fields,suchas cellbiology,anatomy,physiol- ogy, genetics, and pharmacology, are dif cult to define and, in many cases, arbitrary. This overlap is not coincidental. The object being studied is often the same—a nerve cell or a mitochondrion, for example—and only the point of view differs. For a considerable period of its history, bio- chemistry was strongly influenced by chem- istry and concentrated on investigating met- abolic conversions and energy transfers. Ex- plaining the composition, structure, and me- tabolism of biologically important molecules has always been in the foreground. However, new aspects inherited from biochemistry’s other parent, the biological sciences, are now increasingly being added: the relation- ship between chemical structure and biolog- ical function, the pathways of information transfer, observance of the ways in which biomolecules are spatially and temporally dis- tributed in cells and organisms, and an aware- ness of evolution as a biochemical process. These new aspects of biochemistry are bound to become more and more important. Owing to space limitations, we have concen- trated here on the biochemistry of humans and mammals, although the biochemistry of other animals, plants, and microorganisms is no less interesting. In selecting the material forthisbook,wehaveput the emphasis on subjects relevant to students of human med- icine. The main purpose of the atlas is to serve as an overview and to provide visual informa- tion quickly and ef ciently. Referring to text- books can easily fill any gaps. For readers encountering biochemistry for the first time, some of the plates may look rather complex. It must be emphasized,therefore,that the atlas is not intended as a substitute for a compre- hensive textbook of biochemistry. As the subject matter is often dif cult to vis- ualize, symbols, models, and other graphic elements had to be found that make compli- cated phenomena appear tangible. The graphics were designed conservatively, the aim being to avoid illustrations that might look too spectacular or exaggerated. Our goal was to achieve a visual and aesthetic way of representing scientific facts that would be simple and at the same time effective for teaching purposes. Use of graphics software helped to maintain consistency in the use of shapes,colors, dimensions,and labels,inpar- ticular. Formulae and other repetitive ele- ments and structures could be handled easily and precisely with the assistance of the com- puter. Color-coding has been used throughout to aid the reader, and the key to this is given in two special color plates on the front and rear in- side covers. For example, in molecular models each of the more important atoms has a par- ticular color: gray for carbon, white for hydro- gen, blue for nitrogen, red for oxygen, and so on. The different classes of biomolecules are also distinguished by color: proteins are al- ways shown in brown tones, carbohydrates in violet, lipids in yellow, DNA in blue, and RNA in green. In addition, specific symbols are used for the important coenzymes, such as ATP and NAD +. The compartments in which biochemical processes take place are color- coded as well. For example, the cytoplasm is shown in yellow, while the extracellular space is shaded in blue. Arrows indicating a chem- ical reaction are always black and those rep- resenting a transport process are gray. In terms of the visual clarity of its presenta- tion, biochemistry has still to catch up with anatomy and physiology. In this book, we sometimes use simplified ball-and-stick mod- els instead of the classical chemical formulae. In addition, a number of compounds are rep- resented by space-filling models. In these cases, we have tried to be as realistic as pos- sible. The models of small molecules are based on conformations calculated by com- puter-based molecular modeling. In illustrat- ing macromolecules, we used structural infor- VIIPreface mation obtained by X-ray crystallography that is stored in the Protein Data Bank. In naming enzymes, we have followed the of - cial nomenclature recommended by the IUBMB. For quick identification, EC numbers (in italics) are included with enzyme names. To help students assess the relevance of the material (while preparing for an examination, for example), we have included symbols on the text pages next to the section headings to indicate how important each topic is. A filled circle stands for “basic knowledge,” a half- filled circle indicates “standard knowledge,” and an empty circle stands for “in-depth knowledge.” Of course, this classification only reflects our subjective views. This second edition was carefully revised and a significant number of new plates were added to cover new developments. We are grateful to many readers for their comments and valuable criticisms during the preparation of this book. Of course, we would also welcome further comments and sugges- tions from our readers.

Introduction This paperback atlas is intended for students of medicine and the biological sciences. It provides an introduction to biochemistry, but with its modular structure it can also be used as a reference book for more detailed information. The 216 color plates provide knowledge in the field of biochemistry, ac- companiedbydetailedinformation in the text on the facing page. The degree of dif - culty of the subject-matter is indicated by symbols in the text: \u0001 stands for “basic biochemical knowledge” \u0002 indicates “standard biochemical knowl- edge” \u0003 means “specialist biochemical knowledge.” Some general rules used in the structure of the illustrations are summed up in two ex- planatory plates inside the front and back covers. Keywords, definitions, explanations of unfamiliar concepts and chemical formulas can be found using the index. The book starts with a few basics in biochemistry (pp. 2–33). There is a brief explanation of the concepts and principles of chemistry (pp. 2–15). These include the periodic table of the elements, chemical bonds, the general rules governing molecular structure, and the structures of im- portant classes of compounds. Several basic concepts of physical chemistry are also essen- tial for an understanding of biochemical processes. Pages 16–33 therefore discuss the various forms of energy and their intercon- version, reaction kinetics and catalysis, the properties of water, acids and bases, and re- dox processes. These basic concepts are followed by a sec- tion on the structure of the important biomo- lecules(pp. 34–87).Thispartof the book is arranged according to the different classes of metabolites. It discusses carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, peptides and proteins, nucleoti- des, and nucleic acids. Thenextpartpresentsthe reactions involved in the interconversion of these compounds—the part of biochemistry that is commonly referred to as metabolism (pp. 88–195). The section starts with a dis- cussion of the enzymes and coenzymes, and discusses the mechanisms of metabolic regu- lation and the so-called energy metabolism. After this, the central metabolic pathways are presented, once again arranged according to the class of metabolite (pp.150–195). The second half of the book begins with a discussion of the functional compartments within the cell, the cellular organelles (pp. 196–235). This is followed on pp. 236–265 by the current field of molecular genetics (molecular biology). A further extensive sec- tion is devoted to the biochemistry of individual tissues and organs (pp. 266–359). Here, it has only been possible to focus on the most important organs and organ systems— thedigestive system,blood,liver,kidneys, muscles, connective and supportive tissues, and the brain. Other topics include the biochemistry of nutrition (pp. 360–369), the structure and function of important hormones (pp. 370–393), and growth and development (pp. 394–405). The paperback atlas concludes with a series of schematic metabolic “charts” (pp. 407–419). These plates, which are not accom- panied by explanatory text apart from a brief introduction on p. 406, show simplified ver- sions of the most important synthetic and degradative pathways. The charts are mainly intended for reference, but they can also be used to review previously learned material. The enzymes catalyzing the various reactions are only indicated by their EC numbers. Their names can be found in the systematically ar- ranged and annotated enzyme list (pp. 420–430). 1Chemistry Periodic table A. Biologically important elements \u0002 There are 81 stable elements in nature. Fifteen of these are present in all living things, and a further 8–10 are only found in particular or- ganisms. The illustration shows the first half of the periodic table, containing all of the bio- logically important elements. In addition to physical and chemical data, it also provides information about the distribution of the ele- ments in the living world and their abun- dance in the human body. The laws of atomic structure underlying the periodic table are discussed in chemistry textbooks. More than 99% of the atoms in animals’ bodies are accounted for by just four ele- ments—hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Hydrogen and oxygen are the constituents of water, which alone makes up 60–70% of cell mass (see p.196). Together with carbon and nitrogen, hydrogen and oxy- gen are also the major constituents of the organic compounds on which most living processes depend. Many biomolecules also contain sulfur (S) or phosphorus (P). The above macroelements are essential for all or- ganisms. A second biologically important group of elements, which together represent only about0.5% ofthe body mass,are presental- most exclusively in the form of inorganic ions. This group includes the alkali metals sodium (Na) and potassium (K), and the alkaline earth metals magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca). The halogen chlorine (Cl) is also always ionized in the cell. All other elements important for life are present in such small quantities that they are referred to as trace elements.These in- clude transitionmetals suchas iron(Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co) and manganese (Mn). A few nonmetals, such as iodine (I) and selenium (Se), can also be classed as essential trace elements. B. Electron configurations: examples \u0003 The chemical properties of atoms and the types of bond they form witheachother are determined by their electron shells. The elec- tron configurations of the elements are there- fore also showninFig. A.Fig. B explains the symbols and abbreviations used. More de- tailed discussions of the subject are available in chemistry textbooks. The possible states of electrons are called orbitals. These are indicated by what is known as the principal quantum number and bya letter—s,p,ord. The orbitals are filled one by one as the number of electrons increases. Each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons, which must have oppositely directed “spins.” Fig. A shows the distribution of the electrons among the orbitals for each of the elements. For example, the six electrons of carbon (B1) occupy the 1s orbital, the 2s orbi- tal, and two 2p orbitals. A filled 1s orbital has the same electron configuration as the noble gas helium (He). This region of the electron shell of carbon is therefore abbreviated as “He” in Fig. A. Below this, the numbers of electrons in each of the other filled orbitals (2s and 2p in thecaseofcarbon) areshown on the right margin. For example, the electron shell of chlorine (B2)consists ofthatof neon (Ne) and seven additional electrons in 3s and 3p orbitals. Iniron(B3), a transition metal of the first series, electrons occupy the 4s orbital even though the 3d orbitals are still partly empty. Many reactions of the transition met- als involve empty d orbitals—e. g., redox reac- tions or the formation of complexes with bases. Particularly stable electron arrangements arise when the outermost shell is fully occu- pied with eight electrons (the “octet rule”). This applies, for example, to the noble gases, as well as to ions such as Cl – (3s23p 6)and Na + (2s 22p 6). It is only in the cases of hydrogen and helium that two electrons are already suf cient to fill the outermost 1s orbital. 2 Basics ?? ? ?? 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 3d 4s 4p 4d 5s 5p 3d 4s 4d 5s 4 5 44.96 Sc 21 Ar 1 2 47.88 Ti 22 Ar 2 2 50.94 V 23 Ar 3 2 52.00 Cr 24 Ar 4 2 54.94 Mn 25 Ar 5 2 55.85 Fe 26 Ar 6 2 58.93 Co 27 Ar 7 2 58.69 Ni 28 Ar 8 2 63.55 Cu 29 Ar 9 2 65.39 Zn 30 Ar 10 2 3456789 10 11 12 1.01 H 1 1 63 4.00 He 2 2 6.94 Li 3 1 9.01 Be 2 4 10.81 B 5 2 1 12.01 C 6 He 2 2 14.01 N 7 He 2 3 1.4 16.00 O 8 He 2 4 25.5 19.00 F 9 He 2 5 20.18 He Ne 10 2 6 HeHe He 22.99 Ne Na 1 11 0.03 24.31 Mg 12 Ne 2 0.01 26.98 Ne Al 13 2 1 28.09 Si 14 Ne 2 2 30.97 Ne P 15 2 3 0.22 32.07 S 16 Ne 2 4 0.05 35.45 Cl 17 Ne 2 5 0.03 39.95 Ar 18 2 6 39.10 Ar K 19 1 0.06 40.08 Ar Ca 20 2 0.31 69.72 Ga 31 Ar 10 2 1 72.61 Ge 32 Ar 10 2 2 74.92 As 33 Ar 10 2 3 78.96 Se 34 Ar 10 79.90 Br Ar 10 2 5 83.80 Kr 36 Ar 10 2 6 126.9 I 53 Kr 10 2 5 2 4 35 Ne 1 2 3 4 5 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 30.97 P 15 0.22 ?

Orbital hybridization and chemical bonding \u0003 Stable, covalent bonds between nonmetal atoms are produced when orbitals (see p. 2) of the two atoms form molecular orbitals that are occupied by one electron from each of the atoms. Thus, the four bonding electrons of the carbon atom occupy 2s and 2p atomic orbitals (1a). The 2s orbital is spherical in shape, while thethree 2p orbitals areshapedlikedumb- bells arranged along the x, y, and z axes. It might therefore be assumed that carbon atoms should form at least two different types of molecular orbital. However, this is not nor- mally the case. The reason is an effect known as orbital hybridization. Combination of the s orbital and the three p orbitals of carbon gives rise to four equivalent, tetrahedrally arranged sp 3 atomic orbitals (sp 3 hybridization). When these overlap with the 1s orbitals of H atoms, four equivalent σ-molecular orbitals (1b)are formed. For this reason, carbon is capable of forming four bonds—i. e., it has a valency of four. Single bonds between nonmetal atoms arise in the same way as the four σ or single bonds in methane (CH4). For example, the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO42–)and the ammonium ion (NH4+) are also tetrahedral in structure (1c). A second common type of orbital hybrid- ization involves the 2s orbital and only two of the three 2p orbitals (2a). This process is therefore referred to as sp 2 hybridization. The result is three equivalent sp2 hybrid orbi- tals lying in one plane at an angle of 120° to one another. The remaining 2px orbital is ori- ented perpendicular to this plane. In contrast to their sp 3 counterparts, sp2-hybridized atoms form two different types of bond when they combine into molecular orbitals (2b). The three sp 2 orbitals enter into σ bonds, as described above. In addition, the electrons in the two 2px orbitals, known as electrons, combine to give an additional, elongated π molecular orbital, which is located above and below the plane of the σ bonds. Bonds of this type are called double bonds.They consist of a σ bond and a π bond, and arise only when both of the atoms involved are capable of sp 2 hybridization. In contrast to single bonds, double bonds are not freely ro- tatable, since rotation would distort the π- molecular orbital. This is why all of the atoms lie in one plane (2c); in addition, cis–trans isomerism arises in such cases (see p. 8). Double bonds that are common in biomole- cules are C=C and C=O. C=N double bonds are found in aldimines (Schiff bases, see p. 178). B. Resonance \u0002 Many molecules that have several double bonds are much less reactive than might be expected. The reason for this is that the double bonds in these structures cannot be localized unequivocally. Their π orbitals are not confined to the space between the dou- ble-bonded atoms, but form a shared, extended -molecular orbital.Structures with this property are referred to as reso- nance hybrids, because it is impossible to de- scribe their actual bonding structure using standard formulas. One can either use what are known as resonance structures—i. e., idealized configurations in which π electrons are assigned to specific atoms (cf. pp. 32 and 66, for example)—or one can use dashed lines as in Fig. B to suggest the extent of the delo- calized orbitals. (Details are discussed in chemistry textbooks.) Resonance-stabilized systems include car- boxylate groups, as in formate;aliphatic hy- drocarbons with conjugated double bonds, such as 1,3-butadiene; and the systems known as aromatic ring systems. The best-known aromatic compound is benzene, which has six delocalized π electrons in its ring. Ex- tended resonance systems with 10 or more π electrons absorb light within the visible spectrum and are therefore colored. This group includes the aliphatic carotenoids (see p.132), for example, as well as the heme group, in which 18 π electrons occupy an ex- tended molecular orbital (see p. 106). 4 Basics S Pz Py Px SPz Py Px C + 4 H CH4 1a 2a 1b 1c 2b 2c H CH H H O PO O OH NH H H H CC H R R' H CO R' R CN H R R' H C C C C H H H H H C C C C C CH H H H H H HC O O A.

Resonance 5Chemistry Molecular structure The physical and chemical behavior of mole- cules is largely determined by their constitu- tion (the type and number of the atoms they contain and their bonding). Structural formu- las can therefore be used to predict not only the chemical reactivity of a molecule, but also its size and shape, and to some extent its conformation (the spatial arrangement of the atoms). Some data providing the basis for such predictions are summarized here and onthe facing page. Inaddition, L-dihy- droxyphenylalanine (L-dopa; see p. 352), is used as an example to show the way in which molecules are illustrated in this book. A. Molecule illustrations \u0002 In traditional two-dimensional structural formulas (A1), atoms are represented as letter symbols and electron pairs are shown as lines. Lines between two atomic symbols symbolize two bonding electrons (see p. 4), and all of the other lines represent free electron pairs,such as those that occur in O and N atoms. Free electrons are usually not represented explic- itly (and this is the convention used in this book as well). Dashed or continuous circles or arcs are used to emphasize delocalized elec- trons. Ball-and-stick models (A2) are used to illus- trate the spatial structure of molecules. Atoms are represented as colored balls (for the color coding, see the inside front cover) and bonds (including multiple bonds) as gray cylinders. Although the relative bond lengths and angles correspond to actual conditions, the size at which the atomsare representedistoo small to make the model more comprehensible. Space-filling van der Waals models (A3)are useful for illustrating the actual shape and size of molecules. These models represent atoms as truncated balls. Their effective ex- tent is determined by what is known as the van der Waals radius. This is calculated from the energetically most favorable distance be- tween atoms that are not chemically bonded to one another. B. Bond lengths and angles \u0003 Atomic radii and distances are now usually expressed in picometers (pm; 1 pm = 10 –12 m). The old angstrom unit (Å, Å = 100 pm) is now obsolete. The length of single bonds approximately corresponds to thesum of what areknown as the covalent radii of the atoms involved (see inside front cover). Double bonds are around 10–20% shorter thansingle bonds. Insp3-hybridized atoms, the angle between the individual bondsisapprox. 110°; in sp2-hybridized atomsitisapprox. 120°. C. Bond polarity \u0003 Depending on the position of the element in the periodic table (see p. 2), atoms have different electronegativity—i. e., a different tendency to take up extra electrons. The val- ues given in C2 areon a scalebetween 2and 4. The higher the value, the more electronega- tive the atom. When two atoms with very different electronegativities are bound to one another, the bonding electrons are drawn toward the more electronegative atom, and the bond is polarized. The atoms involved then carry positive or negative partial charges. In C1,the van der Waals surface is colored according to the different charge con- ditions (red = negative, blue = positive). Oxy- gen is the most strongly electronegative of the biochemically important elements, with C=O double bonds being especially highly polar. D. Hydrogen bonds \u0002 The hydrogen bond,a specialtype of nonco- valent bond, is extremely important in bio- chemistry. In this type of bond, hydrogen atomsof OH, NH, or SH groups(known as hydrogen bond donors)interactwithfree electrons of acceptor atoms (for example, O, N, or S). The bonding energies of hydrogen bonds (10–40 kJ mol –1)are much lower than those of covalent bonds (approx. 400 kJ mol –1). However, as hydrogen bonds can be very numerous in proteins and DNA, they play a key role in the stabilization of these molecules (see pp. 68, 84). The impor- tance of hydrogen bonds for the properties of water is discussed on p. 26. 6 Basics 0.9 2.1 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 1234 H C N O FNa AH B AH B AH B 120° 120° 120° 120° 120° 110° 110° 110° 110° 110° 110° 108°124pm111pm149pm110pm95pm 154 pm 140 pm 137 pm 100 pm 270–280 pm 280 pm 290 pm 290 pm O C O CC N HH H HO O HH H H H HH O HH OO H HH H C CH N N O H H R1 H O N C HC CO R2 CC C NC N N HC N R H N H H HN CN CH CC OCH3 RO Chiral center 1.

Examples 7Chemistry Isomerism Isomers are molecules with the same compo- sition (i. e. the same molecular formula), but with different chemical and physical proper- ties. If isomers differ in the way in which their atoms are bonded in the molecule, they are described as structural isomers (cf. citric acid and isocitric acid, D). Other forms of isomer- ism are based on different arrangements of the substituents of bonds (A, B)or on the presence of chiral centers in the molecule (C). A. cis–trans isomers \u0002 Double bonds are not freely rotatable (see p. 4). If double-bonded atoms have different substituents, there are two possible orienta- tions for these groups. In fumaric acid,an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (see p. 136), the carboxy groups lie on different sides of the double bond (trans or E position). In its isomer maleic acid, which is not pro- duced in metabolic processes, the carboxy groups lie on the same side of the bond (cis or Z position). Cis–trans isomers (geometric isomers) have different chemical and physical properties—e. g., their melting points (Fp.) and pKa values. They can only be intercon- verted by chemical reactions. In lipid metabolism, cis–trans isomerism is particularly important. For example, double bonds in natural fatty acids (see p. 48) usually have a cis configuration. By contrast, unsatu- rated intermediates of β oxidation have a trans configuration. This makes the break- down of unsaturated fatty acids more compli- cated (see p.166). Light-induced cis–trans iso- merization of retinal is of central importance in the visual cycle (see p. 358). B. Conformation \u0002 Molecular forms that arise as a result of rota- tion around freely rotatable bonds are known as conformers. Even small molecules can have different conformations in solution. In the two conformations of succinic acid illustrated opposite, the atoms are arranged in a similar way to fumaric acid and maleic acid. Both forms are possible, although conformation 1 is more favorable due to the greater distance between the COOH groups and therefore oc- curs more frequently. Biologically active mac- romoleculessuch asproteinsornucleic acids usually have well-defined (“native”) confor- mations, which are stabilized by interactions in themolecule(seep. 74). C. Optical isomers \u0002 Another type of isomerism arises when a mol- ecule contains a chiral center or is chiral as a whole. Chirality (from the Greek cheir, hand) leads to the appearance of structures that behave like image and mirror-image and that cannot be superimposed (“mirror” iso- mers). Themostfrequentcause of chiral be- havior is the presence of an asymmetric C atom—i. e., an atom with four different sub- stituents. Then there are two forms (enan- tiomers) with different configurations. Usu- ally, the two enantiomers of a molecule are designated as L and D forms. Clear classifica- tion of the configuration is made possible by the R/S system (see chemistry textbooks). Enantiomers have very similar chemical properties, but they rotate polarized light in opposite directions (optical activity,see pp. 36, 58). Thesameapplies to theenantiom- ers of lactic acid.The dextrorotatory L-lactic acid occurs in animal muscle and blood, while the D form produced by microorganisms is found in milk products, for example (see p.148). The Fischer projection is often used to represent the formulas for chiral centers (cf. p. 58). D. The aconitase reaction \u0003 Enzymes usually function stereospecifically. In chiral substrates, they only accept one of the enantiomers, and the reaction products are usually also sterically uniform. Aconitate hydratase (aconitase) catalyzes the conver- sion of citric acid into the constitution isomer isocitric acid (see p.136). Although citric acid is not chiral, aconitase only forms one of the four possible isomeric forms of isocitric acid (2R,3S-isocitric acid). The intermediate of the reaction, the unsaturated tricarboxylic acid aconitate, only occurs in the cis form in the reaction. The trans form of aconitate is found as a constituent of certain plants. 8 Basics HO H COO CH3 CHOHCOOCH3C 53 °C 3.7 -2.5˚ 53 °C 3.7 + 2.5˚ 2 3 1 1 1 H2OH2O C C OOC H OOC CH2 COO COO C C HOH H2C OOC H COO COO C C HH H2C OOC OH COO COO C CH3 HO H OOC C CH3 HHO D.

Important classes of compounds \u0001 Most biomolecules are derivatives of simple compounds of the non-metals oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and phosphorus (P). The biochemically important oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur compounds can be formally derived from their compounds with hydrogen (i. e., H2O, NH3,and H2S). In biological systems, phosphorus is found al- most exclusively in derivatives of phosphoric acid, H3PO4. If one or more of the hydrogen atoms of a non-metal hydride are replaced formally with another group, R—e. g., alkyl residues—then derived compounds of the type R-XHn–1, R-XHn–2-R, etc., are obtained. In this way, alcohols (R-OH) and ethers (R-O-R) are de- rived from water (H2O); primary amines (R- NH2), secondary amines (R-NH-R) and terti- ary amines (R-N-R\u0001R\u0002)amines are obtained from ammonia (NH3); and thiols (R-SH) and thioethers (R-S-R\u0001)arise from hydrogen sul- fide (H2S). Polar groups such as -OH and -NH2 are found as substituents in many organic compounds. As such groups are much more reactive than the hydrocarbon structures to which they are attached, they are referred to as functional groups. New functional groups can arise as a result of oxidation of the compounds mentioned above. For example, the oxidation of a thiol yields a disulfide (R-S-S-R). Double oxidation of a primary alcohol (R-CH2-OH) gives rise initially to an aldehyde (R-C(O)-H), and then to a carboxylic acid (R-C(O)-OH). In contrast, the oxidation of a secondary alcohol yields a ketone (R-C(O)-R). The carbonyl group (C=O) is characteristic of aldehydes and ketones. The addition of an amine to the carbonyl group of an aldehyde yields—after removal of water—an aldimine (not shown; see p.178). Aldimines are intermediates in amino acid metabolism (see p.178) and serve to bond aldehydes to amino groups in proteins (see p. 62, for example). The addition of an alcohol to the carbonyl group of an aldehyde yields a hemiacetal (R-O-C(H)OH-R). The cyclic forms of sugars are well-known examples of hemi- acetals (see p. 36). The oxidation of hemiace- tals produces carboxylic acid esters. Very important compounds are the carbox- ylic acids and their derivatives, which can be formally obtained by exchanging the OH group for another group. In fact, derivatives of this type are formed by nucleophilic sub- stitutions of activated intermediate com- pounds and the release of water (see p. 14). Carboxylic acid esters (R-O-CO-R\u0001)arise from carboxylic acids and alcohols. This group in- cludes the fats, for example (see p. 48). Sim- ilarly, a carboxylic acid and a thiol yield a thioester (R-S-CO-R\u0001). Thioesters play an ex- tremely important role in carboxylic acid me- tabolism. The best-known compound of this type is acetyl-coenzyme A (see p. 12). Carboxylic acids and primary amines react to form carboxylic acid amides (R-NH-CO-R\u0001). The amino acid constituents of peptides and proteins are linked by carboxylic acid amide bonds, which are therefore also known as peptide bonds (see p. 66). Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, is a tribasic (three- protic) acid—i. e., it contains three hydroxyl groups able to donate H + ions. At least one of these three groups is fully dissociated under normal physiological conditions, while the other two can react with alcohols. The resulting products are phosphoric acid mono- esters (R-O-P(O)O-OH) and diesters (R-O- P(O)O-O-R\u0001). Phosphoric acid monoesters are found in carbohydrate metabolism, for exam- ple(seep. 36),whereas phosphoric acid diester bonds occur in phospholipids (see p. 50) and nucleic acids (see p. 82 ). Compounds of one acid with another are referred to as acid anhydrides.Aparticularly large amount of energy is required for the formationofanacid—anhydride bond. Phos- phoric anhydride bonds therefore play a cen- tralrolein the storageand releaseof chemical energy in the cell (see p.122). Mixed anhy- drides between carboxylic acids and phos- phoric acid are also very important “energy- rich metabolites” in cellular metabolism. 10 Basics O N SP H O H O H CR H R' R O R' O C RR' O C H R' O PO O O R H O H CO H R' R O C OR' H O C O R' R O PO O O H H O PO O O R CR' O O PO O O R PO O O H N H RH N R'' RR' N H RR' R N C R' H O S HH S RH S R S R' O C SR' R N H HH A.

The con- struction of these molecules usually takes place through condensation reactions involv- ing the removal of water. Conversely, their breakdown functions in a hydrolytic fash- ion—i. e., as a result of water uptake. The page opposite illustrates this modular princi- ple using the example of an important coen- zyme. A. Acetyl CoA \u0002 Coenzyme A (see also p.106) is a nucleotide with a complex structure (see p. 80). It serves to activate residues of carboxylic acids (acyl residues). Bonding of the carboxy group of the carboxylic acid with the thiol group of the coenzyme creates a thioester bond (-S-CO-R; see p.10) in which the acyl residue has a high chemical potential. It can therefore be trans- ferred to other molecules in exergonic reac- tions. This fact plays an important role in lipid metabolism in particular (see pp. 162ff.), as well as in two reactions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle(seep. 136). As discussed on p. 16, the group transfer potential can be expressed quantitatively as the change in free enthalpy (∆G) during hy- drolysis of the compound concerned. This is an arbitrary determination, but it provides important indications of the chemical energy stored insuchagroup. In the case ofacetyl- CoA, the reaction to be considered is: Acetyl CoA + H2O \u0001 acetate + CoA In standard conditions and at pH 7, the change in the chemical potential G (∆G 0,see p.18) in this reaction amounts to –32 kJ mol –1 and it is therefore as high as the ∆G 0 of ATP hydrolysis (see p. 18). In addition to the “energy-rich” thioester bond, acetyl-CoA also has seven other hydrolyzable bonds with dif- ferent degrees of stability. These bonds, and the fragments that arise when they are hydro- lyzed, will be discussed here in sequence. (1) The reactive thiol group of coenzyme A is located in the part of the molecule that is derived from cysteamine.Cysteamine is a bio- genic amine (see p. 62) formed by decarbox- ylation of the amino acid cysteine. (2) The amino group of cysteamine is bound to the carboxy group of another bio- genic amine via an acid amide bond (-CO- NH-). β-Alanine arises through decarboxyla- tion of the amino acid aspartate, but it can also be formed by breakdown of pyrimidine bases (see p. 186). (3) Another acid amide bond (-CO-NH-) creates the compound for the next constituent, pantoinate.This compound con- tains a chiral center and can therefore appear in two enantiomeric forms (see p. 8). In natu- ral coenzyme A, only one of the two forms is found, the (R)-pantoinate. Human metabo- lism is not capable of producing pantoinate itself, and it therefore has to take up a compound of β-alanine and pantoinate— pantothenate (“pantothenic acid”)—in the form of a vitamin in food (see p. 366). (4) The hydroxy group at C-4 of pantoinate is bound to a phosphate residue by an ester bond. Thesection of themoleculediscussed so far represents a functional unit. In the cell, it is produced from pantothenate. The molecule also occurs in a protein-bound form as 4\u0001- phosphopantetheine in the enzyme fatty acid synthase (see p. 168). In coenzyme A, however, it is bound to 3\u0001,5\u0001-adenosine di- phosphate. (5) When two phosphate residues bond, they do not form an ester, but an “energy- rich” phosphoric acid anhydride bond,as also occurs in other nucleoside phosphates. By contrast, (6) and (7) are ester bonds again. (8) The base adenine is bound to C-1 of ribose by an N-glycosidic bond (see p. 36). In addition to C-2 to C-4, C-1 of ribose also rep- resents a chiral center. The -configuration is usually found in nucleotides. 12 Basics CH 3 C S O CH 2 CH 2 N C CH 2 H O CH 2 NH C C O HOH C CH 2 CH 3H 3C O P O OO P O OO CH 2 O H HH OOH H N N N HC N NH 2 P O OO Ribose A.

Illustrated here are the most important types of reaction in organic chemistry, using simple examples. Electron shifts are indicated by red arrows. A. Redox reactions \u0002 In redox reactions (see also p. 32), electrons are transferred from one molecule (the reduc- ing agent) to another (the oxidizing agent). One or two protons are often also transferred in the process, but the decisive criterion for the presence of a redox reaction is the elec- tron transfer. The reducing agent is oxidized during the reaction, and the oxidizing agent is reduced. Fig. A shows the oxidation of an alcohol into an aldehyde (1) and the reduction of the aldehyde to alcohol (2). In the process, one hydride ion is transferred (two electrons and one proton; see p. 32), which moves to the oxidizing agent A in reaction 1.The super- fluous proton is bound by the catalytic effect of a base B. In the reduction of the aldehyde (2), A-H serves as the reducing agent and the acid H-Bisinvolvedasthe catalyst. B. Acid–base reactions \u0002 In contrast to redox reactions, only proton transfer takes place in acid–base reactions (see also p. 30). When an acid dissociates (1), water serves as a proton acceptor (i. e., as a base). Conversely, water has the function of an acid in the protonation of a carboxylate anion (2). C. Additions/eliminations \u0002 A reaction in which atoms or molecules are taken up by a multiple bond is described as addition. The converse of addition—i. e., the removal of groups with the formation of a double bond, is termed elimination.When water is added to an alkene (1a), a proton is first transferred to the alkene. The unstable carbenium cation that occurs as an intermedi- ate initially takes up water (not shown), be- fore the separation of a proton produces alco- hol (1b). The elimination of water from the alcohol (2, dehydration) is also catalyzed by an acid and passes via the same intermediate as the addition reaction. D. Nucleophilic substitutions \u0002 Areactioninwhich onefunctionalgroup (see p.10) is replaced by another is termed substi- tution. Depending on the process involved, a distinction is made between nucleophilic and electrophilic substitution reactions (see chemistry textbooks). Nucleophilic substitu- tions start with the addition of one molecule to another, followed by elimination of the so- called leaving group. The hydrolysis of an ester to alcohol and acid (1) and the esterification of a carboxylic acid withanalcohol (2)are shownhereas an example of the SN2mechanism.Both reac- tions aremadeeasierbythe marked polarity of the C=O double bond. In the form of ester hydrolysis shown here, a proton is removed from a water molecule by the catalytic effect of thebaseB.The resulting stronglynucleo- philic OH – ion attacks the positively charged carbonyl C of the ester (1a), and an unstable sp 3-hybridized transition state is produced. From this, either water is eliminated (2b) and the ester re-forms, or the alcohol ROH is eliminated (1b) and thefreeacid results. In esterification (2), thesamesteps take placein reverse. Further information In rearrangements (isomerizations, not shown), groups are shifted within one and the same molecule. Examples of this in bio- chemistry include the isomerization of sugar phosphates (see p. 36) and of methylmalonyl- CoA to succinyl CoA (see p.166). 14 Basics HB RC O O OR' H OC R' O R B B HO H HO H BH BH RC O O OR' H RC O OH HB RC O O OR' H B RC O OH R' O H O H H RC O OH RC O OH H O H H O HH OH H OH H OH RC O O RC O O RC O O HBBAA H HBBAH A O B C H R H H A RC O H OC H R H H RC O H HB H A OC R' O R HO H B1a 1b 1a 2b 2b 2a CC R' H H R RC C H R' H H B B HO H HO H BH BH RC C H R' H HO H BH BH B B 2b 1a 2a 1b 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 B R' O H BH B R' O H BH 1b 2a B.

A. Forms of work \u0001 There is essentially no difference between work and energy. Both are measured in joule (J = 1 N m). An outdated unit is the calorie (1 cal = 4.187 J). Energy is defined as the abil- ity of a system to perform work. There are many different forms of energy—e. g., me- chanical, chemical, and radiation energy. A system is capable of performing work when matter is moving along a potential gra- dient. This abstract definition is best under- stood by an example involving mechanical work (A1). Due to the earth’s gravitational pull, the mechanical potential energy of an object is the greater the further the object is away from the center of the earth. A potential difference (∆P) therefore exists between a higher location and a lower one. In a waterfall, the water spontaneously follows this poten- tial gradient and, in doing so, is able to per- form work—e. g., turning a mill. Work and energy consist of two quantities: an intensity factor, which is a measure of the potential difference—i. e., the “driving force” of theprocess—(hereit is the height differ- ence) and a capacity factor,which is a mea- sure of the quantity of the substance being transported (here it is the weight of the water). In the case of electrical work (A2), the intensity factor is the voltage—i. e., the electrical potential difference between the source of the electrical current and the “ground,” while the capacity factor is the amount of charge that is flowing. Chemical work and chemical energy are defined in an analogous way. The intensity factor here is the chemical potential of a mol- ecule or combination of molecules. This is stated as free enthalpy G (also known as “Gibbs free energy”). When molecules spon- taneously react with one another, the result is products at lower potential. The difference in the chemical potentials of the educts and products (the change in free enthalpy, G)is ameasure of the “driving force” of the reac- tion. The capacity factor in chemical work is the amount of matter reacting (in mol). Although absolute values for free enthalpy G cannot be determined, ∆G can be calculated from the equilibrium constant of the reaction (see p.18). B. Energetics and the course of processes \u0001 Everyday experience shows that water never flows uphill spontaneously. Whether a partic- ular process can occur spontaneously or not depends on whether the potential difference between the final and the initial state, ∆P= P2 –P1, is positive or negative. If P2 is smaller than P1,then ∆Pwill benegative, andthe process will take place and perform work. Processesof thistype are called exergonic (B1). If there is no potential difference, then the system is in equilibrium (B2). In thecaseof endergonic processes, ∆P is positive (B3). Processesof thistype do not proceed sponta- neously. Forcing endergonic processes to take place requires the use of the principle of energetic coupling. This effect can be illustrated by a mechanical analogy (B4). When two masses M1 and M2 are connected by a rope, M1 will move upward even though this part of the processisendergonic. The sum of the two potential differences (∆Peff = ∆P1 + ∆P2)is the determining factor in coupled processes. When ∆Peff is negative, the entire process can proceed. Energetic coupling makes it possible to convert different forms of work and energy into one another. For example, in a flashlight, an exergonic chemical reaction provides an electrical voltage that can then be used for the endergonic generation of light energy. In the luminescent organs of various animals, it is a chemical reaction that produces the light. In the musculature (see p. 336), chemical en- ergy is converted into mechanical work and heat energy. A form of storage for chemical energy that is used in all forms of life is aden- osine triphosphate (ATP; see p. 122). Ender- gonic processes are usually driven by cou- pling to the strongly exergonic breakdown of ATP (see p.122). 16 Basics J = Joule = N · m =1 kg · m2 · s-2, 1 cal = 4.187 J ∆P ∆P1 ∆P2 M1 M2 P3 P1 P2 P3 P1 P2 ∆ Peff ∆P · A.

Energetics and the course of processes Process occurs spontaneously Process cannot occur 17Physical Chemistry Equilibriums A. Group transfer reactions \u0002 Every chemical reaction reaches after a time a state of equilibrium in which the forward and back reactions proceed at the same speed. The law of mass action describes the concentra- tions of the educts (A, B) and products (C, D) in equilibrium. The equilibrium constant K is di- rectly related to ∆G0,the change in free enthalpy G involved in the reaction (see p.16) under standard conditions (∆G 0 =–R T ln K). For any given concentrations, the lower equation applies. At ∆G< 0, the reac- tion proceeds spontaneously for as long as it takes for equilibrium to be reached (i. e., until ∆G=0). At ∆G>0, a spontaneous reaction is no longer possible (endergonic case; see p.16). In biochemistry, ∆G is usually related to pH 7, andthisisindicated by the“prime” symbol (∆G0\u0001 or ∆G\u0001). As examples, we can look at two group transfer reactions (on the right). In ATP (see p.122), the terminal phosphate residue is at a high chemical potential. Its transfer to water (reaction a, below) is therefore strongly exer- gonic. The equilibrium of the reaction (∆G = 0; see p. 122) is only reached when more than 99.9% of the originally available ATP has been hydrolyzed. ATP and similar compounds have a high group transfer potential for phosphate residues. Quantita- tively, thisis expressedasthe Gofhydrolysis (∆G 0\u0001 = –32 kJ mol –1; see p. 122). In contrast, the endergonic transfer of am- monia (NH3) to glutamate (Glu, reaction b, ∆G0\u0001 =+14 kJ mol –1) reaches equilibrium so quickly that only minimal amounts of the product glutamine (Gln) can be formed in this way. The synthesis of glutamine from these preliminary stages is only possible through energetic coupling (see pp.16, 124). B. Redox reactions \u0002 The course of electron transfer reactions (re- dox reactions, see p. 14) also follows the law of mass action. For a single redox system (see p. 32), the Nernst equation applies (top). The electron transfer potential of a redox system (i. e., its tendency to give off or take up elec- trons) is given by its redox potential E (in standard conditions, E 0 or E 0\u0001). The lower the redox potential of a system is, the higher the chemical potential of the transferred elec- trons. To describe reactions between two re- dox systems, ∆Ε—the difference between the two systems’ redox potentials—is usually used instead of ∆G. ∆Gand ∆Ehavea simple relationship, but opposite signs (below). A redox reaction proceeds spontaneously when ∆E>0, i. e. ∆G<0. Theright side of theillustration shows the way in which the redox potential E is depen- dent on the composition (the proportion of the reduced form as a %) in two biochemically important redox systems (pyruvate/lactate and NAD +/NADH+H +;see pp. 98, 104).In the standard state (both systems reduced to 50%), electron transfer from lactate to NAD + is not possible, because ∆Eis negative (∆E= –0.13 V, red arrow). By contrast, transfer can proceed successfully if the pyruvate/lactate system is reduced to 98% and NAD +/NADH is 98% oxi- dized (green arrow, ∆E=+0.08 V). C. Acid–base reactions \u0002 Pairs of conjugated acids and bases are always involved in proton exchange reactions (see p. 30). The dissociation state of an acid–base pair depends on the H + concentration. Usu- ally, it is not this concentration itself that is expressed, but its negative decadic logarithm, the pH value. The connection between the pH value and the dissociation state is described by the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation (be- low). As a measure of the proton transfer potential of an acid–base pair, its pKa value is used—the negative logarithm of the acid constant Ka (where “a” stands for acid). The stronger an acid is, the lower its pKa value. The acid of the pair with the lower pKa value (the stronger acid—in this case acetic acid, CH3COOH) can protonate (green arrow) the base of the pair with the higher pKa (in this case NH3), while ammonium acetate (NH4+ and CH3COO –)only forms very little CH3COOH and NH3. 18 Basics A + B C + D K= Ared Aox a b HA + H2O pH a b 30 20 10 0 -10 -20 -30 -40 -50 0 20406080 100 ∆G° = - R · T · ln K [C] · [D] [A] · [B] [C] · [D] [A] · [B] R = 8.314 J · mol -1 · K-1 ∆G= ∆G° + R · T · ln ∆G = – n · F · ∆E ∆E = EAcceptor – EDonor ∆E = ∆E° + · ln R · T n · F [Box] · [Bred] [Ared] · [Aox] A + H3O pH = pKa + log [HA] [A ] ∆G°(a) ∆G°(b) ∆E° (a) ∆Eº (b) NAD /NADH+H - 0.5 - 0.4 - 0.3 -0.2 - 0.1 0.0 020 40 60 80 100 pKa(a) pKa(b) NH4 /NH3 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 020 40 60 80 100 CH3 COOH/CH3COO Glu + NH4 Gln + H2O ATP + H2O ADP + Pi E = E° + · ln R · T n · F [Ared] [Aox] K = [HA] · [H2O] [A ] · [H3O ] Ka= [HA] [A ] · [H ] n = No. of electrons transferred F = Faraday constant A.

Acid–base reactions Measure of proton transfer potential Measure of electron transfer potential 19Physical Chemistry Enthalpy and entropy The change in the free enthalpy of a chemical reaction (i. e., its ∆G) depends on a number of factors—e. g., the concentrations of the reac- tants and the temperature (see p.18). Two further factors associated with molecular changes occurring during the reaction are dis- cussed here. A. Heat of reaction and calorimetry \u0002 All chemical reactions involve heat exchange. Reactions that release heat are called exothermic, and those that consume heat are called endothermic.Heatexchangeis measured as the enthalpy change ∆H(the heat of reaction). This corresponds to the heat exchange at constant pressure. In exo- thermic reactions, the system loses heat, and ∆H is negative. When the reaction is endo- thermic, the system gains heat, and ∆Hbe- comes positive. In many reactions, ∆Hand ∆Gare similarin magnitude (see B1, for example). This fact is used to estimate the caloric content of foods. In living organisms, nutrients are usually oxi- dized by oxygen to CO2 and H2O(see p.112). The maximum amount of chemical work sup- plied by a particular foodstuff (i. e., the ∆Gfor the oxidation of the utilizable constituents) can be estimated by burning a weighed amount in a calorimeter in an oxygen atmo- sphere. The heat of the reaction increases the water temperature in the calorimeter. The reaction heat canthenbe calculated from the temperature difference ∆T. B. Enthalpy and entropy \u0002 The reaction enthalpy ∆H and the change in free enthalpy ∆Gare not always of the same magnitude. There are even reactions that oc- cur spontaneously (∆G < 0) even though they are endothermic (∆H > 0). The reason for this is that changes in the degree of order of the system also strongly affect the progress of a reaction. This change is measured as the en- tropy change (S). Entropy is a physical value that describes the degree of order of a system.The lower the degree of order, the larger the entropy. Thus, when a process leads to increase in disor- der—and everyday experience shows that this is the normal state of affairs—∆Sis pos- itive for this process. An increase in the order in a system (∆S < 0) always requires an input of energy. Both of these statements are consequences of an important natural law, the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The connection between changes in enthalpy and entropy is described quantitatively by the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation (∆G= ∆H– T ∆S). The following examples will help explain these relationships. In the knall-gas (oxyhydrogen) reaction (1), gaseous oxygen and gaseous hydrogen react to form liquid water. Like many redox reactions, this reaction is strongly exothermic (i. e., ∆H < 0). However, during the reaction, the degree of order increases. The total num- ber of molecules is reduced by one-third, and a more highly ordered liquid is formed from freely moving gas molecules. As a result of the increase in the degree of order (∆S< 0), the term –T ∆S becomes positive. However, this is more than compensated for by the decrease in enthalpy, and the reaction is still strongly exergonic (∆G<0). The dissolutionofsaltinwater (2)is endo- thermic (∆H > 0)—i. e., the liquid cools. Never- theless, the process still occurs spontane- ously, since the degree of order in the system decreases.The Na + and Cl – ions are initially rigidly fixed in a crystal lattice. In solution, they move about independently and in random directions through the fluid. The decrease in order (∆S> 0) leads to a negative –T ∆Sterm, which compensates for the positive ∆Hterm and results ina negative ∆G term overall. Processes of this type are described as being entropy-driven. The folding of proteins (see p. 74) and the formation of ordered lipid structures in water (see p. 28) are also mainly entropy-driven. 20 Basics 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 ∆H = - 287 kJ · mol -1 ∆G = - 238 kJ · mol -1 -T · ∆S = +49 kJ · mol -1 -T · ∆S = - 12.8 kJ · mol -1 ∆G = - 9.0 kJ · mol -1 ∆H = +3.8 kJ · mol -1 O2 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 CO2 -200 -100 0 +100 +200 -12 -8 -4 0 +4 +8 +12 ∆G = ∆H - T · ∆S H2O A.

Enthalpy and entropy Water Energy Energy 21Physical Chemistry Reaction kinetics Thechangein freeenthalpy ∆Gin a reaction indicates whether or not the reaction can take place spontaneously in given conditions and how much work it can perform (see p. 18). However, it does not tell us anything about the rate of the reaction—i. e., its kinetics. A. Activation energy \u0002 Most organic chemical reactions (with the exception of acid–base reactions) proceed only very slowly, regardless of the value of ∆G. Thereason for theslow reaction rate is that the molecules that react—the educts—have to have a certain minimum en- ergy before they can enter the reaction. This is best understood with the help of an energy diagram (1) of the simplest possible reaction A \u0001 B. Theeduct A and theproduct B are each at a specific chemical potential (Ge and Gp, respectively). The change in the free enthalpy of the reaction, ∆G, corresponds to the differ- ence between these two potentials. To be converted into B, A first has to overcome a potential energy barrier, the peak of which, Ga,lies well above Ge. The potential difference Ga –Ge is the activation energy Ea of the re- action (in kJ mol –1). ThefactthatAcan be convertedinto B at all is because the potential Ge only represents the average potential of all the molecules. Individual molecules may occasionally reach much higher potentials—e. g., due to collisions with other molecules. When the increase in energy thus gained is greater than Ea,these molecules can overcome the barrier and be converted into B. The energy distribution for a group of molecules of this type, as calculated from a simple model, is shown in (2)and (3). ∆n/n is the fraction of molecules that have reached or exceeded energy E (in kJ per mol). At 27 °C, for example, approximately 10% of the molecules have energies > 6 kJ mol –1. The typical activation energies of chemical reactions aremuch higher. Thecourseof the energy function at energies of around 50 kJ mol –1 is shownin(3). Statistically, at 27 °C only two out of 10 9 molecules reach this energy. At 37 °C, the figure is already four. This is the basis for the long-familiar “Q10 law”—a rule of thumb that states that the speed of biological processes approximately doubles withanincrease intemperature of 10 °C. B. Reaction rate \u0002 The velocity v of a chemical reaction is deter- mined experimentally by observing the change in the concentration of an educt or product over time. In the example shown (again a reaction of the A \u0001 B type), 3 mmol of the educt A is converted per second and 3 mmol of the product B is formed per second in one liter of the solution. This corresponds to a rate of v =3mM s –1 =3 10–3 mol L –1 s –1 C. Reaction order \u0002 Reaction rates are influenced not only by the activation energy and the temperature, but also by the concentrations of the reactants. When thereis only oneeduct, A (1), v is proportional to the concentration [A] of this substance, and a first-order reaction is in- volved. When two educts,A andB,react with one another (2), it is a second order reaction (shown on the right). In this case, the rate v is proportional to the product of the educt concentrations (12 mM 2 at the top, 24 mM 2 in the middle, and 36 mM 2 at the bottom). The proportionality factors k and k\u0001 are the rate constants of the reaction. They are not dependent on the reaction concentra- tions, but depend on the external conditions for the reaction, such as temperature. In B, only the kinetics of simple irreversible reactionsisshown. More complicated cases, such as reaction with three or more reversible steps, can usually be broken down into first- orderorsecond-orderpartial reactionsand described using the corresponding equations (for an example, see the Michaelis–Menten reaction, p. 92). 22 Basics 5 0 s 0 s 1 s 10 15 1 2 3 1 2 3 C1 s 1. 2. 0 s 1 s 3 s 1. 2. 3. 0.0 0.5 1.0 0 5 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 55 50 45 1. 2. 3.

Since catalysts emerge from the catalyzed reaction without being changed, even small amounts are usu- ally suf cient to cause a powerful acceleration of the reaction. In the cell, enzymes (see p. 88) generally serve as catalysts. A few chemical changes are catalyzed by special RNA mole- cules, known as ribozymes (see p. 246). A. Catalysis: principle \u0001 Thereason for theslow rates of most reac- tionsinvolving organicsubstancesisthe high activation energy (see p. 22) that the reacting molecules have to reach before they can react. In aqueous solution, a large proportion of the activation energy is required to remove the hydration shells surrounding the educts. Dur- ing the course of a reaction, resonance-stabi- lized structures (see p. 4) are often tempora- rily suspended; this also requires energy. The highest point on the reaction coordinates cor- responds to an energetically unfavorable tran- sition state of this type (1). A catalyst creates a new pathway for the reaction (2). When all of the transition states arising have a lower activation energy than that of the uncatalyzed reaction, the reaction will proceed more rapidly along the alterna- tive pathway, even when the number of in- termediates is greater. Since the starting points and end points are the same in both routes, the change in the enthalpy ∆Gof the reaction is not influenced by the catalyst. Cat- alysts—including enzymes—are in principle not capable of altering the equilibrium state of the catalyzed reaction. The often-heard statement that “a catalyst reduces the activation energy of a reaction” is not strictly correct, since a completely different reaction takes place in the presence of a cata- lyst than in uncatalyzed conditions. However, its activation energy is lower than in the un- catalyzed reaction. B. Catalysis of H2O2 – breakdown by iodide \u0003 As a simple example of a catalyzed reaction, we can look at the disproportionation of hy- drogen peroxide (H2O2)into oxygenand water. In the uncatalyzed reaction (at the top), an H2O2 molecule initially decays into H2O and atomic oxygen (O), which then reacts with a second H2O2 molecule to form water and molecular oxygen (O2). The activation energy Ea required for this reaction is rela- tively high, at 75 kJ mol –1. In the presence of iodide (I –) as a catalyst, the reaction takes a different course (bottom). The intermediate arising in this case is hypoiodide (OI –), which also forms H2Oand O2 with another H2O2 molecule. In this step, the I – ion is released and can once again take part in the reaction. The lower activation energy of the reaction catalyzed by iodide (Ea =56kJ mol –1) causes acceleration of the reaction by a factor of 2000, as the reaction rate depends expo- nentially on Ea (v ~e –Ea/R T). Free metal ions such as iron (Fe) and plat- inum (Pt) are also effective catalysts for the breakdown of H2O2. Catalase (see p. 284), an enzyme that protects cells against the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide(seep. 284), is much more catalytically effective still. In the enzyme-catalyzed disproportionation, H2O2 is bound to the enzyme’s heme group, where it is quickly converted to atomic oxygen and water, supported by amino acid residues of the enzyme protein. The oxygen atom is tem- porarily bound to the central iron atom of the heme group, and then transferred from there to the second H2O2 molecule. The activation energy of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is only 23 kJ mol –1, which in comparison with the uncatalyzed reaction leads to acceleration by a factor of 1.3 109. Catalase is one of the most ef cient en- zymes there are. A single molecule can con- vert up to 10 8 (a hundred million) H2O2 mol- ecules per second. 24 Basics 100 80 60 40 20 1a 1b 2b2a A.

The properties of water are therefore of fundamental impor- tance to all living things. A. Water and methane \u0002 The special properties of water (H2O) become apparent when it is compared with methane (CH4). The two molecules have a similar mass and size. Nevertheless, the boiling point of water is more than 250 °C above that of methane. At temperatures on the earth’s sur- face, water is liquid, whereas methane is gas- eous. The high boiling point of water results from its high vaporization enthalpy, which in turn is due to the fact that the density of the electrons within the molecule is unevenly distributed. Two corners of the tetrahedrally- shaped water molecule are occupied by un- shared electrons (green), and the other two by hydrogen atoms. As a result, the H–O–H bond has an angled shape. In addition, the O–H bonds are polarized due to the high elec- tronegativity of oxygen (seep. 6). Onesideof the molecule carries a partial charge (δ)of about –0.6 units, whereas the other is corre- spondingly positively charged. The spatial separation of the positive and negative charges gives the molecule the properties of an electrical dipole. Water molecules are therefore attracted to one another like tiny magnets, and are also connected by hydrogen bonds (B)(seep. 6). When liquid water vapor- izes, a large amount of energy has to be ex- pended to disrupt these interactions. By con- trast, methane molecules are not dipolar, and therefore interact with one another only weakly. This is why liquid methane vaporizes at very low temperatures. B. Structure of water and ice \u0002 The dipolar nature of water molecules favors the formation of hydrogen bonds (see p. 6). Each molecule can act either as a donor or an acceptor of H bonds, and many molecules in liquid water are therefore connected by H bonds (1). Thebonds arein a stateof constant fluctuation. Tetrahedral networks of mole- cules, known as water “clusters,” often arise. As the temperature decreases, the proportion of water clusters increases until the water begins to crystallize. Under normal atmo- spheric pressure, this occurs at 0 °C. In ice, most of the water molecules are fixed in a hexagonal lattice (3). Since the distance be- tween the individual molecules in the frozen state is on average greater than in the liquid state, the density of ice is lower than that of liquid water. This fact is of immense biological importance—it means, for example, that in winter, ice forms on the surface of open stretches of water first, and the water rarely freezes to the bottom. C. Hydration \u0002 In contrast to most other liquids, water is an excellent solvent for ions. In the electrical field of cations and anions, the dipolar water molecules arrange themselves in a regular fashion corresponding to the charge of the ion. They form hydration shells and shield the central ion from oppositely charged ions. Metal ions are therefore often present as hexahydrates ([Me(H2O)62+], on the right). In the inner hydration sphere of this type of ion, the water molecules are practically immobi- lized and follow the central ion. Water has a high dielectric constant of 78—i. e., the elec- trostatic attraction force between ions is re- duced to 1/78 by the solvent. Electrically charged groups in organic molecules (e. g., carboxylate, phosphate, and ammonium groups) are also well hydrated and contribute to water solubility. Neutral molecules with several hydroxy groups, such as glycerol (on the left) or sugars, are also easily soluble, because they can form H bonds with water molecules. The higher the proportion of polar functional groups there is in a molecule, the more water-soluble (hydrophilic)it is. By con- trast, molecules that consist exclusively or mainly of hydrocarbons are poorly soluble or insoluble in water. These compounds are called hydrophobic (see p. 28). 26 Basics HO HO HO 1. 2. 3.

Substances of this type are referred to as polar or hydrophilic (“water-loving”). In contrast, substances that consist mainly of hydrocarbon structures dissolve only poorly in water. Such substances are said to be apolar or hydrophobic. A. Solubility of methane \u0003 To understand the reasons for the poor water solubility of hydrocarbons, it is useful first to examine the energetics (see p. 16) of the pro- cesses involved. In (1), the individual terms of the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation (see p. 20) for the simplest compound of this type, methane, are shown (see p. 4). As can be seen, the tran- sition from gaseous methane to water is ac- tually exothermic (∆H 0 < 0). Nevertheless, the change in thefreeenthalpy ∆G0 is positive (the process is endergonic), because the en- tropy term T ∆S0 has a strongly positive value. The entropy change in the process (∆S 0) is evidently negative—i. e., a solution of methane in water has a higher degree of order than either water or gaseous methane. One reason for this is that the methane molecules areless mobilewhen surroundedbywater. More importantly, however, the water around the apolar molecules forms cage-like “clath- rate” structures, which—as in ice—are stabi- lized by H bonds. This strongly increases the degreeoforder in the water—and themoreso the larger the area of surface contact between the water and the apolar phase. B. The “oil drop effect” \u0002 The spontaneous separation of oil and water, a familiar observation in everyday life, is due to the energetically unfavorable formation of clathrate structures. When a mixture of water and oil is firmly shaken, lots of tiny oil drops form to begin with, but these quickly coalesce spontaneously to form larger drops—the two phases separate. A larger drop has a smaller surface area than several small drops with the same volume. Separation therefore reduces the area of surface contact between the water and the oil, and consequently also the extent of clathrate formation. The ∆S for this process is therefore positive (the disorder in the water increases), and the negative term –T ∆S makes the separation process exergonic (∆G < 0),so thatitproceeds spontaneously. C. Arrangements of amphipathic substances in water \u0002 Molecules that contain both polar and apolar groups are called amphipathic or amphiphilic. This group includes soaps (see p. 48), phos- pholipids (see p. 50), and bile acids (see p. 56). As a result of the “oil drop effect” amphi- pathic substances in water tend to arrange themselves in such a way as to minimize the area of surface contact between the apolar regions of the molecule and water. On water surfaces, they usually form single-layer films (top) in which the polar “head groups” face toward the water. Soap bubbles (right) consist of double films, with a thin layer of water enclosed between them. In water, depending on their concentration, amphipathic com- pounds form micelles—i. e., spherical aggre- gates with their head groups facing toward the outside, or extended bilayered double membranes. Most biological membranes are assembled according to this principle (see p. 214). Closed hollow membrane sacs are known as vesicles. This type of structure serves to transport substances within cells and in the blood (see p. 278). The separation of oil and water (B)can be prevented by adding a strongly amphipathic substance.Duringshaking,a more or less stable emulsion then forms, in which the sur- face of the oil drops is occupied by amphi- pathic molecules that provide it with polar properties externally. The emulsification of fats in food by bile acids and phospholipids is a vital precondition for the digestion of fats (see p. 314). 28 Basics C. Arrangements of amphipathic substances in water A.

Acids and bases \u0001 In general, acids are defined as substances that can donate hydrogen ions (protons), while bases are compounds that accept pro- tons. Water enhances the acidic or basic proper- ties of dissolved substances, as water itself can act as either an acid or a base. For exam- ple, when hydrogen chloride (HCl) is in aque- ous solution, it donates protons to the solvent (1). This results in the formation of chloride ions (Cl –) and protonated water molecules (hydronium ions, H3O+, usually simply re- ferred to as H +). The proton exchange be- tween HCl and water is virtually quantitative: in water, HCl behaves as a very strong acid with a negative pKa value(seep.18). Bases such as ammonia (NH3)takeover protons from water molecules. As a result of this, hydroxyl ions (OH –)and positively charged ammonium ions (NH4+, 3)form. Hy- dronium and hydroxyl ions, like other ions, exist in water in hydrated rather than free form (see p. 26). Acid–base reactionsalwaysinvolve pairs of acids and the associated conjugated bases (see p.18). The stronger the acid or base, the weaker the conjugate base or acid, respec- tively. For example, the very strongly acidic hydrogen chloride belongs to the very weakly basic chloride ion (1). The weakly acidic am- monium ion is conjugated with the moder- ately strong base ammonia (3). The equilibrium constant K for the acid— base reaction between H2Omolecules (2)is very small. At 25 °C, K= [H +] [OH –]/ [H2O] = 2 10–16 mol L –1 In pure water, the concentration [H2O] is practically constant at 55 mol L–1.Substitut- ing this value into the equation, it gives: Kw =[H +] [OH–]= 1 10–14 mol L –1 The product [H +] [OH –]—the ion product of water—is constant even when additional acid–base pairs are dissolved in the water. At 25 °C, pure water contains H + and OH – at concentrations of 1 10–7 mol L –1 each; it is neutral and has a pH value of exactly 7. B. pH values in the organism \u0002 pH values in the cell and in the extracellular fluid are kept constant within narrow limits. In the blood, the pH value normally ranges only between 7.35 and 7.45 (see p. 288). This corresponds to a maximum change in the H + concentration of ca. 30%. The pH value of cytoplasm is slightly lower than that of blood, at 7.0–7.3. In lysosomes (see p. 234; pH 4.5–5.5), the H + concentration is several hun- dred times higher than in the cytoplasm. In the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, which forms part of the outside world relative to the organism, and in the body’s excretion prod- ucts, the pH values are more variable. Ex- treme values are found in the stomach (ca. 2) and in the small bowel (> 8). Since the kidney can excrete either acids or bases, de- pending on the state of the metabolism, the pH of urine has a particularly wide range of variation (4.8–7.5). C. Buffers \u0001 Short–term pH changes in the organism are cushioned by buffer systems.These are mix- tures of a weak acid, HB, with its conjugate base, B –, or of a weak base with its conjugate acid. This type of system can neutralize both hydronium ions and hydroxyl ions. In the first case (left), the base (B –)binds a large proportion of the added protons (H +) and HB and water are formed. If hydroxyl ions (OH –) are added, they react with HB to give B – and water (right). In both cases, it is primarily the [HB]/[B –] ratio that shifts, while the pH value only changes slightly. The titra- tion curve (top) shows that buffer systems are most effective at the pH values that corre- spond to the pKa value of the acid. This is where the curve is at its steepest, so that the pH change, ∆pH, is at its smallest with a given increase ∆cin [H +]or[OH –]. In other words, the buffer capacity ∆c/ ∆pH is highest at the pKa value. 30 Basics 3 2 1 23456789 HB HB B OHBH % B 100 80 60 40 20 0 Cl H O HH O H H O HH O H H N H HH H O HH O H O HH H O H H NH H H Cl Gastric juice Lysosomes Sweat Urine Cytoplasm Blood plasma Small intestine A.

Redox reactions \u0001 Redox reactions are chemical changes in which electrons are transferred from one re- action partner to another (1;see also p. 18). Like acid–base reactions (see p. 30), redox re- actionsalwaysinvolve pairs of compounds. A pair of this type is referred to as a redox system (2). Theessentialdifferencebetween the two components of a redox system is the number of electrons they contain. The more electronrich component is called the reduced form of the compound concerned, while the other one is referred to as the oxidized form. The reduced form of one system (the reducing agent) donates electrons to the oxidized form of another one (the oxidizing agent). In the process, the reducing agent becomes oxidized and the oxidizing agent is reduced (3). Any given reducing agent can reduce only certain other redox systems. On the basis of this type of observation, redox systems can be ar- ranged to form what are known as redox series (4). The position of a system within one of these series is established by its redox potential E (see p. 18). The redox potential has a sign; it can be more negative or more positive than a reference potential arbitrarily setatzero (thenormal potential of thesystem [2 H +/H2]). In addition, E depends on the con- centrations of the reactants and on the reac- tion conditions (see p.18). In redox series (4), the systems are arranged according to their increasing redox potentials. Spontaneous electron transfers are only possible if the re- dox potential of the donor is more negative than that of the acceptor (see p.18). B. Reduction equivalents \u0002 In redox reactions, protons (H +)are often transferred along with electrons (e –), or pro- tons may be released. The combinations of electrons and protons that occur in redox processes are summed up in the term reduc- tion equivalents. For example, the combina- tion 1 e–/1 H + corresponds to a hydrogen atom, while 2 e– and 2 H + together produce ahydrogen molecule. However, this does not mean that atomic or molecular hydrogen is actually transferred from one molecule to the other (see below). Only the combination 2 e –/ 1H +,the hydride ion, is transferred as a unit. C. Biological redox systems \u0002 In thecell, redox reactions arecatalyzed by enzymes, which work together with soluble or bound redox cofactors. Some of these factors contain metal ions as redox-active components. In these cases, it is usually single electrons that are transferred, with the metal ion changing its valency. Un- paired electrons often occur in this process, but these are located in d orbitals (see p. 2) and are therefore less dangerous than single electrons in non-metal atoms (“free radicals”; see below). We can only show here a few examples from the many organic redox systems that are found. In the complete reduction of the flavin coenzymes FMN and FAD (see p.104), 2e – and 2 H + are transferred. This occurs in two separate steps, with a semiquinone radi- cal appearing as an intermediate. Since or- ganic radicals of this type can cause damage to biomolecules, flavin coenzymes never oc- cur freely in solution, but remain firmly bound in the interior of proteins. In the reduction or oxidation of quinone/ quinol systems,freeradicals also appear as intermediate steps, but these are less reactive than flavin radicals. Vitamin E, another qui- none-type redox system (see p. 104), even functions as a radical scavenger, by delocaliz- ing unpaired electrons so effectively that they can no longer react with other molecules. The pyridine nucleotides NAD + and NADP+ always function in unbound form. The oxi- dized forms contain an aromatic nicotinamide ring in which the positive charge is delocal- ized. The right-hand example of the two res- onance structures showncontains anelec- tron-poor, positively charged C atom at the para position to nitrogen. If a hydride ion is added at this point (see above), the reduced forms NADH or NADPH arise. No radical inter- mediate steps occur. Because a proton is re- leased at thesametime, thereduced pyridine nucleotide coenzymes are correctly expressed as NAD(P)H+H +. 32 Basics Me n+ Mem+ 2e2e 2e 2e O O H H HO H O H H N N N C NH CH3C H3C R O O N N N C NH CH3C H3C R O O H H N N N C NH CH3C H3C R O O H 2e 2H2e1H1e1e 1H e [H] H [H2] 1e 1H C C H R O H3CO H3CO O C C H R OH H3CO H3CO O OH C C H R OH H3CO H3CO e H e H e H e H e H O O O O H e H e H e H O H C N CONH H H H 2 H R H H N A N A P F A F e 1e 1H C N CONH H H H 2 H R C N CONH H H H 2 H R A.

The carbohydrates include single sug- ars (monosaccharides) and their polymers, the oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. A. Carbohydrates: overview \u0001 Polymeric carbohydrates–above all starch, as well as some disaccharides–are important (but not essential) components of food (see p. 360). Inthe gut, they are brokendowninto monosaccharides and resorbed in this form (see p. 272). The form in which carbohydrates are distributed by the blood of vertebrates is glucose (“blood sugar”). This is taken up by the cells and either brokendownto obtainenergy (glycolysis) or converted into other metabo- lites (see pp.150–159). Several organs (partic- ularly the liver and muscles) store glycogen as apolymeric reserve carbohydrate (right; see p.156). The glycogen molecules are covalently bound to a protein, glycogenin. Polysaccha- rides are used by many organisms as building materials. For example, the cell walls of bac- teria contain murein as a stabilizing compo- nent (see p. 40), while in plants cellulose and other polysaccharides fulfill this role (see p. 42). Oligomeric or polymeric carbohydrates are often covalently bound to lipids or pro- teins. The glycolipids and glycoproteins formed in this way are found, for example, in cell membranes (center). Glycoproteins also occur in the blood in solute form (plasma proteins; see p. 276) and, as components of proteoglycans, form important constituents of the intercellular substance (see p. 346). B. Monosaccharides: structure \u0002 The most important natural monosaccharide, D-glucose,is analiphatic aldehyde with six C atoms, five of which carry a hydroxyl group (1). Since C atoms 2 to 5 represent chiral centers (see p. 8), there are 15 further isomeric aldohexoses in addition to D-glucose, although only a few of these are important in nature (see p. 38). Most natural monosaccha- rides have the same configuration at C-5 as D-glyceraldehyde–they belong to the D series. The open-chained form of glucose shown in (1) is found in neutral solution in less than 0.1% of the molecules. The reason for this is an intramolecular reaction in which one of the OH groups of the sugar is added to the alde- hyde group of the same molecule (2). This gives rise to a cyclic hemiacetal (see p. 10). In aldohexoses, the hydroxy group at C-5 reacts preferentially, and a six-membered pyran ring is formed. Sugars that contain this ring are called pyranoses. By contrast, if the OH group at C-4 reacts, a five-part furan ring is formed. In solution, pyranose forms and furanose forms are present in equilibrium with each other and with the open-chained form, while in glucose polymers only the pyranose form occurs. The Haworth projection (2) is usually used to depict sugars in the cyclic form, with the ring being shown in perspective as viewed from above. Depending on the configuration, the substituents of the chiral C atoms are then found above or below the ring. OH groups that lie on the right in the Fischer projection (1)appear under the ring level in the Haworth projection, while those on the left appear above it. As a result of hemiacetal formation, an ad- ditional chiral center arises at C-1, which can be present in both possible configurations (anomers)(seep. 8). To emphasizethis, the corresponding bonds are shown here using wavy lines. The Haworth formula does not take ac- count of the fact that the pyran ring is not plain, but usually has a chair conformation.In B3, two frequent conformations of D-glucopy- ranose are shown as ball-and-stick models. In the 1C4 conformation (bottom), most of the OH groups appear vertical to the ring level, as in the Haworth projection (axial or a posi- tion). In the slightly more stable 4C1 confor- mation (top), the OH groups take the equato- rial or e position. At room temperature, each form can change into the other, as well as into other conformations. 34 Biomolecules 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 23 4 5 6 OH C HO OH OH H O H H H H CH2HO H HO CH2OH O OH H HOH H OH H 1 4 1 4 C C HO C OHH C HHO C OHH CH2OH OHH O CHO OH H HOH H H CH2OH H OH O HO OH OH H H H H OHH CH2HO Glycoproteins Glycolipids Mono- saccharide Transporter Other monosaccharides Glucose Pyruvate ATP Amino acids CO2+H2O Glycogen Bacterium Periplasm Peptidoglycan (Murein) Proteoglycans A.

Reactions of the monosaccharides \u0002 The sugars (monosaccharides) occur in the metabolism in many forms (derivatives). Only a few important conversion reactions are discussed here, using D-glucose as an ex- ample. 1. Mutarotation. In the cyclic form, as op- posed to the open-chain form, aldoses have a chiral center at C-1 (see p. 34). The corre- sponding isomeric forms are called anomers. In the β-anomer (center left), the OH group at C-1 (the anomeric OH group) and the CH2OH group lie on the same side of the ring. In the α- anomer (right), they are on different sides. The reaction that interconverts anomers into each other is known as mutarotation (B). 2. Glycoside formation. When the anome- ric OH group of a sugar reacts with an alcohol, with elimination of water, it yields an O–glycoside (in the case shown, α –methylglu- coside). The glycosidic bond is not a normal ether bond, because the OH group at C-1 has a hemiacetal quality. Oligosaccharides and pol- ysaccharides also contain O-glycosidic bonds. Reaction of the anomeric OH group with an NH2 or NH group yields an N-glycoside (not shown). N-glycosidic bonds occur in nucleo- tides (see p. 80) and in glycoproteins (see p. 44), for example. 3. Reduction and oxidation. Reduction of the anomeric center at C-1 of glucose (2) pro- duces the sugar alcohol sorbitol.Oxidation of thealdehydegroup at C-1 gives the intramo- lecular ester (lactone) of gluconic acid (a gly- conic acid). Phosphorylated gluconolactone is an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway (seep.152). When glucoseis oxi- dized at C-6, glucuronic acid (a glycuronic acid) is formed. The strongly polar glucuronic acid plays an important role in biotransforma- tions in the liver (see pp.194, 316). 4. Epimerization. In weakly alkaline solu- tions, glucose is in equilibrium with the ketohexose D-fructose and the aldohexose D- mannose, via an enediol intermediate (not shown). The only difference between glucose and mannose is the configuration at C-2. Pairs of sugars of this type are referred to as epi- mers, and their interconversion is called epi- merization. 5. Esterification. The hydroxyl groups of monosaccharides can form esters with acids. In metabolism, phosphoric acid esters such as glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate (6) are particularly important. B. Polarimetry, mutarotation \u0003 Sugar solutions can be analyzed by polarim- etry, a method based on the interaction be- tween chiral centers and linearly polarized light—i. e., light that oscillates in only one plane. It can be produced by passing normal light through a special filter (a polarizer). A second polarizing filter of the same type (the analyzer), placed behind the first, only lets the polarized light pass through when the polar- izer and the analyzer are in alignment. In this case, the field of view appears bright when one looks through the analyzer (1). Solutions of chiral substances rotate the plane of polar- ized light by an angle α either to the left or to the right. When a solution of this type is placed between the polarizer and the ana- lyzer, the field of view appears darker (2). The angle of rotation, α,is determined by turning the analyzer until the field of view becomes bright again (3). A solution’s optical rotation depends on the type of chiral com- pound, its concentration, and the thickness of the layer of the solution. This method makes it possible to determine the sugar content of wines, for example. Certain procedures make it possible to ob- tain the α and β anomers of glucose in pure form. A 1-molar solution of α-D-glucose has a rotation value [α]D of +112°, while a corre- sponding solution of β-D-glucose has a value of +19°. These values change spontaneously, however, and after a certain time reach the same end point of +52°. The reason for this is that, in solution, mutarotation leads to an equilibrium between the α and β forms in which, independently of the starting condi- tions, 62% of the molecules are present in the β form and 38% in the α form. 36 Biomolecules 1 6 1 23 6 α β 1 α 1 1 100 80 60 40 20 0 1. 2. 3. a a 10 20 4030 50 2 1 O HO OH OH H H H H COO OH H O HO OH OH H H H H O HOCH2 OH CH2OH HO OH OH H H H H HOCH2 O HO OH OH H H H H OH H CH2HO O HO OH OH H H H H H OH CH2HO O HO OH OH H H H H OH H CH2OPO O O O HO H H HO OH H H CH2OH OH H O HO OH H HO H H H H OH HOCH2 O HO OH OH H H H H H OCH3 HOCH2 A.

Important monosaccharides \u0002 Only the most important of the large number of naturally occurring monosaccharides are mentioned here. They are classified according to the number of C atoms (into pentoses, hexoses, etc.) and according to the chemical nature of the carbonyl function into aldoses and ketoses. The best-known aldopentose (1), D-ribose, is a component of RNA and of nucleotide coenzymes and is widely distributed. In these compounds, ribose always exists in the fura- nose form (see p. 34). Like ribose, D-xylose and L-arabinose are rarely found in free form. However, large amounts of both sugars are foundasconstituentsof polysaccharides in the walls of plant cells (see p. 42). The most important of the aldohexoses (1) is D-glucose. A substantial proportion of the biomass is accounted for by glucose polymers, above all cellulose and starch. Free D-glucose is found in plant juices (“grape sugar”) and as “blood sugar” in the blood of higher animals. As a constituent of lactose (milk sugar), D- galactose is part of the human diet. Together with D-mannose, galactose is also found in glycolipids and glycoproteins (see p. 44). Phosphoric acid esters of the ketopentose D-ribulose (2) are intermediates in the pen- tose phosphate pathway (see p. 152) and in photosynthesis (see p.128). The most widely distributed of the ketohexoses is D-fructose.In free form, it is present in fruit juices and in honey. Bound fructose is found in sucrose (B) and plant polysaccharides (e. g., inulin). In the deoxyaldoses (3), an OH group is replaced by a hydrogen atom. In addition to 2-deoxy-D-ribose, a component of DNA (see p. 84) that is reduced at C-2, L-fucose is shown as another example of these. Fucose, a sugar in the λ series (see p. 34) is reduced at C-6. The acetylated amino sugars N-acetyl-D- glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-Galactosamine (4) are often encountered as components of glycoproteins. N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid, 5), is a characteristic component of glycoproteins. Other acidic monosaccharides such as D-glu- curonic acid, D-galacturonic acid,and liduronic acid, are typical constituents of the glycosa- minoglycans found in connective tissue. Sugar alcohols (6)suchas sorbitol and mannitol do not play an important role in animal metabolism. B. Disaccharides \u0002 When the anomeric hydroxyl group of one monosaccharide is bound glycosidically with one of the OH groups of another, a disaccha- ride is formed. As in all glycosides, the glyco- sidic bond does not allow mutarotation. Since this type of bond is formed stereospecifically by enzymes in natural disaccharides, they are only found in one of the possible configura- tions (α or β). Maltose (1) occurs as a breakdown product of the starches contained in malt (“malt sugar”; see p. 148) and as an intermediate in intestinal digestion. In maltose, the anomeric OH group of one glucose molecule has an α- glycosidic bond with C-4 in a second glucose residue. Lactose (“milk sugar,” 2)is the most impor- tant carbohydrate in the milk of mammals. Cow’s milk contains 4.5% lactose, while hu- man milk contains up to 7.5%. In lactose, the anomeric OH group of galactose forms a β- glycosidic bond with C-4 of a glucose. The lactosemoleculeis consequentlyelongated, and bothofits pyranrings lie inthe same plane. Sucrose (3) servesin plants asthe form in which carbohydrates are transported, and as a soluble carbohydrate reserve. Humans value it because of its intensely sweet taste. Sources used for sucrose are plants that contain par- ticularly high amounts of it, such as sugar cane and sugar beet (cane sugar, beet sugar). Enzymatic hydrolysis of sucrose-containing flower nectar in the digestive tract of bees— catalyzed by the enzyme invertase—produces honey, a mixture of glucose and fructose. In sucrose, the two anomeric OH groups of glu- cose and fructose have a glycosidic bond; su- crose is therefore one of the non-reducing sugars. 38 Biomolecules Pentoses 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 4 6 2 5 6 6 2 2 7 9 4 2141 1 α β α β O CH2 HH OH OH H OH HO O CH2 OH H HOH H OH HO O H OH H HOH HOH2C OH O HO OH H HO H H OH H HOCH2 O HO OH OH H H H OH H HOCH2 O H OH OH H H HO OH H HOCH2 O H HH OH OH H CH2OH OH CH2OH C C O C OHH CH2OH OHH O HOCH2 HHO OH H H CH2OH OH CH2OH C C O C HHO C OHH CH2OH OHH O HO OH HN H H H OH H CCH3 O HOCH2 O H OH HN H H HO OH H CCH3 O HOCH2 O HO H H HO OH H OH CH3 H O HO OH OH H H H OH H COO O HO OH OH H H H OH H COO O H OH HN H H H COO H C H CCH3 O HHO CHO H CH2OH CH2OH C C H C HHO C OHH CH2OH OHH HO CH2OH C C OH C H C OHH CH2OH OHH H HO O OH OH H H H OH H CH2OH O HO OH OH H H H H CH2OH H O O OH OH H H H OH H CH2OH O H OH OH H H HO H CH2OH H O O HO OH OH H H H H CH2OH H O O HHO OH H CH2OH H CH2OH O CH2 HH OH H H OH HO A.

They can be classified into three separate groups, based on their different functions. Structural polysaccharides provide mechani- cal stability to cells, organs, and organisms. Waterbinding polysaccharides are strongly hydrated and prevent cells and tissues from drying out. Finally, reserve polysaccharides serve as carbohydrate stores that release monosaccharides as required. Due to their polymeric nature, reserve carbohydrates are osmotically less active, and they can therefore be stored in large quantities within the cell. A. Polysaccharides: structure \u0002 Polysaccharides that are formed from only one type of monosaccharide are called homo- glycans, while those formed from different sugar constituents are called heteroglycans. Both forms can exist as either linear or branched chains. A section of a glycogen molecule is shown here as an example of a branched homogly- can. Amylopectin, the branched component of vegetable starch (see p. 42), has a very similar structure. Both molecules mainly consist of α1\u00014-linked glucose residues. In glycogen, on average every 8th to 10th residue car- ries —via an α1\u00016 bond—another 1,4-linked chain of glucose residues. This gives rise to branched, tree-like structures, which in ani- mal glycogen are covalently bound to a protein, glycogenin (see p.156). The linear heteroglycan murein,a struc- tural polysaccharide that stabilizes the cell walls of bacteria, has a more complex struc- ture. Only a short segment of this thread-like molecule is shown here. In murein, two differ- ent components, both β1\u00014-linked, alter- nate: N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuraminic acid (MurNAc), a lactic acid ether of N-acetylglucosamine. Peptides are bound to the carboxyl group of the lactyl groups, and attach the individual strands of murein to each other to form a three-dimen- sional network (not shown). Synthesis of the network-forming peptides in murein is inhib- ited by penicillin (see p. 254). B. Important polysaccharides \u0002 The table gives an overview of the composi- tion and make-up both of the glycans men- tioned above and of several more. In addition to murein, bacterial polysac- charides include dextrans—glucose polymers that are mostly α1\u00016-linked and α1\u00013- branched. In water, dextrans form viscous slimes or gels that are used for chromato- graphic separation of macromolecules after chemical treatment (see p. 78). Dextrans are also used as components of blood plasma substitutes (plasma expanders) and food- stuffs. Carbohydrates from algae (e. g., agarose and carrageenan) can also be used to produce gels. Agarose has been used in microbiology for more than 100 years to reinforce culture media (“agar-agar”). Algal polysaccharides are also added to cosmetics and ready-made foods to modify the consistency of these prod- ucts. The starches,the most importantvegetable reserve carbohydrate and polysaccharides from plant cell walls, are discussed in greater detail on the following page. Inulin,a fructose polymer, is used as a starch substitute in dia- betics’ dietary products (see p. 160). In addi- tion, it serves as a test substance for measur- ing renal clearance (see p. 322). Chitin, a homopolymer from β1\u00014-linked N-acetylglucosamine, is the most important structural substance in insect and crustacean shells, and is thus the most common animal polysaccharide. It also occurs in the cell wall of fungi. Glycogen, the reserve carbohydrate of higher animals, is stored in the liver and mus- culature in particular (A, see pp. 156, 336). The formationand breakdownofglycogen are subject to complex regulation by hormones and other factors (see p.120). 40 Biomolecules O OH HO H H H H O O OH OH H H H H H O H O CH2 O OH OH H H H H O O OH OH H H H H H O H O OH OH H H H H O OH OH H H H H H OO OH HO HO HO CH2 CH2 CH2 HO HOCH2 CH2 O NHCOCH3 H H H H O OH NHCOCH3 H H H H H O NHCOCH3 H H H H O OH NHCOCH3 H H H H HH OO OOO H OO CCH3CC O NH CO NH H3C HO HOCH2 CH2 HO HOCH2 CH2 HH 14 6 α β 14 α 14 α 14 α 1 α 14 β 14 β 14 23 Glycogen – branched homopolymer Mono- saccharide 1 D-GlcNAc D-Glc D-Gal D-Gal D-Glc D-Glc L-Ara D-Glc D-Glc D-Fru D-GlcNAc D-Glc D-GlcUA Occurrence Cell wall Slime Red algae (agar) Red algae Cell wall Cell wall (Hemicellulose) Cell wall (pectin) Amyloplasts Amyloplasts Storage cells Insects, crabs Liver, muscle Connective tissue Mono- saccharide 2 D-MurNAc 1) L-aGal 2) D-Xyl (D-Gal, L-Fuc) Function SC WB WB WB SC SC SC RC RC RC SK RK SK,WB 1 3 1 3 1 4 1 6 1 2) 1 3 1 6 1 6 SC= structural carbohydrate, RC= reserve carbohydrate, WB = water-binding carbohydrate; 1) N-acetylmuramic acid, 2) 3,6-anhydrogalactose Linkage Branch- ing β α β β β β α α α β β α β β α β α β β α α α Poly- saccharide Bacteria Murein Dextran Plants Agarose Carrageenan Cellulose Xyloglucan Arabinan Amylose Amylopectin Inulin Animals Chitin Glycogen Hyaluronic acid A.

A. Cellulose \u0002 Cellulose, a linear homoglycan of β1\u00014- linked glucose residues, is the most abundant organic substance in nature. Almost half of the total biomass consists of cellulose. Some 40–50% of plant cell walls are formed by cel- lulose. The proportion of cellulose in cotton fibers, an important raw material, is 98%. Cel- lulose molecules can contain more than 104 glucose residues (mass 1–2 106 Da) and can reach lengths of 6–8 µm. Naturally occurring cellulose is extremely mechanically stable and is highly resistant to chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis. These properties are due to the conformation of the molecules and their supramolecular or- ganization. The unbranched β1\u00014linkage re- sults in linear chains that are stabilized by hydrogen bonds within the chain and be- tween neighboring chains (1). Already during biosynthesis, 50–100 cellulose molecules as- sociate to form an elementary fibril with a diameter of 4 nm. About 20 such elementary fibrils then form a microfibril (2), which is readily visible with the electron microscope. Cellulose microfibrils make up the basic framework of the primary wall of young plant cells (3), where they form a complex network with other polysaccharides. The linking poly- saccharides include hemicellulose,which is a mixture of predominantly neutral heterogly- cans (xylans, xyloglucans, arabinogalactans, etc.). Hemicellulose associates with the cellu- lose fibrils via noncovalent interactions. These complexes are connected by neutral and acidic pectins, which typically contain galac- turonic acid. Finally, a collagen-related protein, extensin, is also involved in the for- mation of primary walls. In the higher animals, including humans, cellulose is indigestible,but importantas roughage (see p. 273). Many herbivores (e. g., the ruminants) have symbiotic unicellular or- ganisms in their digestive tracts that break down cellulose and make it digestible by the host. B. Starch \u0002 Starch, a reserve polysaccharide widely dis- tributed in plants, is the most important car- bohydrate in the human diet. In plants, starch is present in the chloroplasts in leaves, as well as in fruits,seeds,and tubers. The starch con- tent is especially high in cereal grains (up to 75% of the dry weight), potato tubers (ap- proximately 65%), and in other plant storage organs. In these plant organs, starch is present in the form of microscopically small granules in special organelles known as amyloplasts. Starch granules are virtually insoluble in cold water, but swell dramatically when the water is heated. Some 15–25% of the starch goes into solution in colloidal form when the mix- ture is subjected to prolonged boiling. This proportion is called amylose (“soluble starch”). Amylose consists of unbranched α1\u00014- linked chains of 200–300 glucose residues. Due the α configuration at C-1, these chains form a helix with 6–8 residues per turn (1). Thebluecoloringthatsoluble starch takes on when iodine is added (the “iodine–starch re- action”) is caused by thepresenceofthese helices—theiodineatoms form chains inside the amylose helix, and in this largely non- aqueous environment take on a deep blue color. Highly branched polysaccharides turn brownor reddishbrowninthe presence of iodine. Unlike amylose, amylopectin,which is practically insoluble, is branched.On average, onein 20–25 glucoseresidues is linkedto another chain via an α1\u00016bond. This leads to an extended tree-like structure, which— like amylose—contains only one anomeric OH group (a “reducing end”). Amylopectin molecules can contain hundreds of thousands of glucose residues; their mass can be more than 108 Da. 42 Biomolecules α 1 1 α 4 6 HO HO OH O O O O OO O O O O O O OO O OH OH OH OH O O O HO O O α 1 4 1. 2. 3.

Hyaluronic acid \u0003 As constituents of proteoglycans (see p. 346), the glycosaminoglycans—a group of acidic heteropolysaccharides—are important struc- tural elements of the extracellular matrix. Glycosaminoglycans contain amino sugars as well as glucuronic acid and iduronic acid as characteristic components (see p. 38). In ad- dition, most polysaccharides in this group are esterified to varying extents by sulfuric acid, increasing their acidic quality. Glycosamino- glycans can be found in free form, or as com- ponents of proteoglycans throughout the or- ganism. Hyaluronic acid, an unesterified glycosami- noglycan with a relatively simple structure, consists of disaccharide units in which N- acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid are alternately β1\u00014-linked and β1\u00013-linked. Due to the unusual β1\u00013linkage,hyaluronic acid molecules–which may contain several thousand monosaccharide residues—are coiled like a helix. Three disaccharide units form each turn of the helix. The outwardfac- ing hydrophilic carboxylate groups of the glu- curonic acid residues are able to bind Ca 2+ ions. The strong hydration of these groups enables hyaluronic acid and other glycosami- noglycans to bind water up to 10 000 times their own volume in gel form. This is the function which hyaluronic acid has in the vit- reous body of the eye, which contains approx- imately 1% hyaluronic acid and 98% water. B. Oligosaccharide in immunoglobulin G (IgG) \u0003 Many proteins on the surface of the plasma membrane, and the majority of secreted pro- teins, contain oligosaccharide residues that are post-translationally added to the endo- plasmic reticulum and in the Golgi apparatus (see p. 230). By contrast, cytoplasmic proteins are rarely glycosylated. Glycoproteins can contain more than 50% carbohydrate; how- ever, the proportion of protein is generally much greater. As an example of the carbohydrate compo- nent of a glycoprotein, the structure of one of the oligosaccharide chains of immunoglobu- lin G (IgG; see p. 300) is shown here. The oligosaccharide has an N-glycosidic link to the amide group of an asparagine residue in the Fc part of the protein. Its function is not known. Like all N-linked carbohydrates, the oligo- saccharide in IgG contains a T-shaped core structure consisting of two N-acetylglucos- amines and three mannose residues (shown in violet). In addition, in this case the struc- ture contains two further N-acetylglucos- amine residues, as well as a fucose residue and a galactose residue. Glycoproteins show many different types of branching. In this case, we not only have β1\u00014linkage,but also β1\u00012, α1\u00013, and α1\u00016bonds. C. Glycoproteins: forms \u0002 On the cell surface of certain glycoproteins, O-glycosidic links are found between the car- bohydrate part and a serine or threonine res- idue, instead of N-glycosidic links to aspara- gine residues. This type of link is less common than the N-glycosidic one. There are two types of oligosaccharide structure with N-glycosidic links, which arise through two different biosynthetic pathways. During glycosylation in the ER, the protein is initially linked to an oligosaccharide, which in addition to the core structure contains six further mannose residues and three terminal glucoseresidues (seep. 230). Thesimpler from of oligosaccharide (the mannose-rich type) is produced when only the glucose res- idues are cleaved from the primary product, and no additional residues are added. In other cases, the mannose residues that are located outside the core structure are also removed andreplacedby other sugars.Thisproduces oligosaccharides such as those shown on the right (the complex type). At the external end of the structure, glycoproteins of the complex type often contain N-acetylneuraminic acid residues, which give the oligosaccharide com- ponents negative charges. 44 Biomolecules Asn Gal GalNAc O NeuAc NeuAc Ser GlcNAc GlcNAc NH Man Man Man ManMan Man Asn NH Man Man Man GlcNAc GlcNAc Fuc GlcNAc GlcNAcGlcNAc Gal Gal Gal NeuAc NeuAc NeuAc Man Man Man I II III IV V VI β 13 4 1 β O OH NHCOCH3 H H H H O HO H H H H H O OH NHCOCH3 H H H H O OH H H H H HHHO OO H COO O O COO O OH NHCOCH3 H H H H O H H H H HHO O O H O COOHOCH2 HOCH2 HOCH2 O HO H HO H H H O OH NHCOCH3 H H H H O OH NHCOCH3 H H H H HH OO HN H O H OH OH H H HO H O OH NHCOCH3 H H H H HH O O OH H O H H H H OHO HOH2C CH2 C CH2 O C O H HOH H CH3 H OHO H CH2 HO O OH NHCOCH3 H H H H HHO O OH H O H H H H OHO HOH2C HOCH2 HOCH2 HO HOCH2 CH2 [ 3)-β-D-GlcNAc-(1 4)-β-D-GlcUA-(1 4]n OH OH A.

Classification \u0001 The lipids are a large and heterogeneous group ofsubstances ofbiologicaloriginthat are easily dissolved in organic solvents such as methanol, acetone, chloroform, and ben- zene. By contrast, they are either insoluble or only poorly soluble in water. Their low water solubility is due to a lack of polarizing atoms such as O, N, S, and P (see p. 6). Lipids can be classified into substances that are either hydrolyzable—i. e., able to undergo hydrolytic cleavage—or nonhydrolyzable.Only a few examples of the many lipids known can be mentioned here. The individual classes of lipids are discussed in more detail in the fol- lowing pages. Hydrolyzable lipids (components shown in brackets). The simple esters include the fats (triacylglycerol; one glycerol + three acyl res- idues); the waxes (one fatty alcohol + one acyl residue); and the sterol esters (one sterol + one acyl residue). The phospholipids are esters with more complex structures. Their charac- teristic component is a phosphate residue. The phospholipids include the phosphatidic acids (one glycerol + two acyl residues + one phosphate) and the phosphatides (one glyc- erol + two acyl residues + one phosphate + one amino alcohol). In the sphingolipids,glyc- eroland oneacylresidue arereplaced by sphingosine. Particularly important in this group are the sugar-containing glycolipids (one sphingosine + one fatty acid + sugar). The cerebrosides (one sphingosine + one fatty acid + one sugar) and gangliosides (one sphin- gosine + one fatty acid + several different sugars, including neuraminic acid) are repre- sentatives of this group. The components of the hydrolyzable lipids are linked to one another by ester bonds.They are easily broken down either enzymatically or chemically. Non-hydrolyzable lipids. The hydrocarbons include the alkanes and carotenoids.The lipid alcohols are also not hydrolyzable. They in- clude long-chained alkanols and cyclic sterols such as cholesterol, and steroids such as es- tradiol and testosterone. The most important acids among the lipids are fatty acids. The eicosanoids also belong to this group; these are derivatives of the polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (see p. 390). B. Biological roles \u0001 1. Fuel. Lipids are an important source of en- ergy in the diet. In quantitative terms, they represent the principal energy reserve in ani- mals. Neutral fats in particular are stored in specialized cells, known as adipocytes.Fatty acids are released from these again as needed, and these are then oxidized in the mitochon- dria to form water and carbon dioxide, with oxygen being consumed. This process also gives rise to reduced coenzymes, which are used for ATP production in the respiratory chain (see p. 140). 2. Nutrients. Amphipathic lipids are used by cells to build membranes (see p. 214). Typ- ical membrane lipids include phospholipids, glycolipids, and cholesterol. Fats are only weakly amphiphilic and are therefore not suitableas membranecomponents. 3. Insulation. Lipids are excellent insula- tors. In the higher animals, neutral fats are found in the subcutaneous tissue and around various organs, where they serve as mechan- ical and thermal insulators. As the principal constituent of cell membranes, lipids also in- sulate cells from their environment mechan- ically and electrically. The impermeability of lipid membranes to ions allows the formation of themembranepotential (see p.126). 4. Special tasks. Some lipids have adopted special roles in the body. Steroids, eicosa- noids, and some metabolites of phospholipids have signaling functions. They serve as hor- mones, mediators, and second messengers (see p. 370). Other lipids form anchors to at- tach proteins to membranes (see p. 214). The lipids also produce cofactors for enzymatic re- actions—e. g., vitamin K (see p. 52) and ubiq- uinone (see p.104). The carotenoid retinal, a light-sensitive lipid, is of central importance in the process of vision (see p. 358). Several lipids are not formed indepen- dently in the human body. These substances, as essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vita- mins, are indispensable components of nutri- tion (see pp. 364ff.) 46 Biomolecules O2 CO2 H2O CO O CH2 CO O CO CH2 O CO CH O H2CO P O O O NCH3 CH2 CH3 CO CH2 O CO CH O CO CH2 O HO OH COOH C NH O OH OH O OH OH O CH2 HO HO CO CH2 O CO CH O H2CO P O O O 4.

Carboxylic acids \u0002 The naturally occurring fatty acids are carbox- ylic acids with unbranched hydrocarbon chains of 4–24 carbon atoms. They are present in all organisms as components of fats and membrane lipids. In these com- pounds, they are esterified with alcohols (glycerol, sphingosine, or cholesterol). How- ever, fatty acids are also found in small amounts in unesterified form. In this case, they are known as free fatty acids (FFAs). As free fatty acids have strongly amphipathic properties (see p. 28), they are usually present in protein-bound forms. The table lists the full series of aliphatic carboxylic acids that are found in plants and animals. In higher plants and animals, un- branched, longchain fatty acids with either 16 or 18 carbon atoms are the most common— e. g., palmitic and stearic acid. The number of carbon atoms in the longer, natural fatty acids is always even. This is because they are bio- synthesized from C2 building blocks (see p.168). Some fatty acids contain one or more isolated double bonds, and are therefore “un- saturated.” Common unsaturated fatty acids include oleic acid and linoleic acid. Of the two possible cis–trans isomers (see p. 8), usually only the cis forms are found in natural lipids. Branched fatty acids only occur in bacteria. A shorthand notation with several numbers is used for precise characterization of the struc- ture of fatty acids—e g., 18:2;9,12 for linoleic acid. The first figure stands for the number of C atoms, while the second gives the number of double bonds. The positions of the double bonds follow after the semicolon. As usual, numbering starts at the carbon with the high- est oxidation state (i. e., the carboxyl group corresponds to C-1). Greek letters are also commonly used (α =C-2; β =C-3; ω =the last carbon, ω-3 = the third last carbon). Essential fatty acids are fatty acids that have to be supplied in the diet. Without ex- ception, these are all polyunsaturated fatty acids: the C20 fatty acid arachidonic acid (20:4;5,8,11,14) and the two C18 acids linoleic acid (18:2;9,12) and linolenic acid (18:3;9,12,15). The animal organism requires arachidonic acid to synthesize eicosanoids (see p. 390). As the organism is capable of elongating fatty acids by adding C2 units, but is not able to introduce double bonds into the end sections of fatty acids (after C-9), arachi- donic acid has to be supplied with the diet. Linoleic and linolenic acid can be converted into arachidonic acid by elongation, and they can therefore replace arachidonic acid in the diet. B. Structure of fats \u0002 Fats are esters of the trivalent alcohol glycerol with three fatty acids. When a single fatty acid is esterified with glycerol, the product is re- ferred to as a monoacylglycerol (fatty acid res- idue = acyl residue). Formally, esterification with additional fatty acids leads to diacylglycerol and ulti- mately to triacylglycerol, the actual fat (for- merly termed “triglyceride”). As triacylglycer- ols are uncharged, they are also referred to as neutral fats. The carbon atoms of glycerol are not usually equivalent in fats. They are distin- guished by their “sn” number, where sn stands for “stereospecific numbering.” The three acyl residues of a fat molecule may differ in terms of their chain length and thenumber ofdoublebonds they contain. This results in a large number of possible combinations of individual fat molecules. When extracted from biological materials, fats always represent mixtures of very similar compounds, which differ in their fatty acid residues. A chiral center can arise at the mid- dle C atom (sn -C-2) of a triacylglycerol if the two external fatty acids are different. The monoacylglycerols and diacylglycerols shown here are also chiral compounds. Nutritional fats contain palmitic, stearic, oleic acid, and linoleic acid particularly often. Unsaturated fatty acids are usually found at the central C atom of glycerol. The length of the fatty acid residues and the number of their double bonds affect the melting point of the fats. The shorter the fatty acid residues and themoredoublebonds they contain, the lower their melting points. 48 Biomolecules C-1 C-2 C-3 HOOC CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 CH3 HO CH2 C CH2 HHO HO OCH2 C CH2 HHO HO CR' O OCH2 C CH2 HO O C CR' R'' O O CR''' O OCH2 C CH2 HO HO C CR' R'' O O Number of double bonds Position of double bonds A.

Structure of phospholipids and glycolipids \u0002 Fats (triacylglycerol, 1) are esters of glycerol with three fatty acids (see p. 48). Within the cell, they mainly occur as fat droplets. In the blood, they are transported in the hydropho- bic interior of lipoproteins (see p. 278). Phospholipids (2)are the mainconsti- tuents of biological membranes (see pp. 214–217). Their common feature is a phos- phate residue that is esterified with the hy- droxyl group at C-3 of glycerol. Due to this residue, phospholipids have at least one neg- ativechargeat a neutral pH. Phosphatidates (anions of the phosphatidic acids), the simplest phospholipids, are phos- phate esters of diacylglycerol. They are impor- tant intermediates in the biosynthesis of fats and phospholipids (see p. 170). Phosphati- dates can also be released from phospholipids by phospholipases. The other phospholipids can be derived from phosphatidates (residue = phospha- tidyl). Their phosphate residues are esterified with the hydroxyl group of an amino alcohol (choline, ethanolamine,or serine)or with the cyclohexane derivative myo-inositol. Phos- phatidylcholine is shown here as an example of this type of compound. When two phos- phatidyl residues are linked with one glyc- erol, the result is cardiolipin (not shown), a phospholipid that is characteristic of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Lysophospholipids arise from phospholipids by enzymatic cleav- age of an acyl residue. The hemolytic effect of beeand snakevenoms is due in part to this reaction. Phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) is the most abundant phospholipid in membranes. Phosphatidylethanolamine (cephalin) has an ethanolamine residue instead of choline, and phosphatidylserine has a serine residue. In phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidate is esteri- fied with the sugarlike cyclic polyalcohol myo-inositol. A doubly phosphorylated deriv- ative of this phospholipid, phosphatidylinosi- tol 4,5-bisphosphate, is a special component of membranes, which, by enzymatic cleavage, can giveriseto two second messengers,diacyl- glycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate (InsP3; see p. 386). Some phospholipids carry additional charges, in addition to the negative charge at the phosphate residue. In phosphatidylcho- line and phosphatidylethanolamine, the N-atom of the amino alcohol is positively charged. As a whole, these two phosphatides therefore appear to be neutral. In contrast, phosphatidylserine—with one additional pos- itive charge and one additional negative charge in the serine residue—and phosphati- dylinositol (with no additional charge) have a negative net charge, due to the phosphate residue. Sphingolipids (3), whichare found inlarge quantities in the membranes of nerve cells in the brain and in neural tissues, have a slightly different structure from the other membrane lipids discussed so far. In sphingolipids, sphin- gosine, an amino alcohol with an unsaturated alkyl side chain, replaces glycerol and one of the acyl residues. When sphingosine forms an amidebondto a fatty acid, the compoundis called ceramide (3). This is the precursor of the sphingolipids. Sphingomyelin (2)—the most important sphingolipid—has an addi- tional phosphate residue with a choline group attached to it on the sphingosine, in addition to the fatty acid. Glycolipids (3)are present in all tissues on theouter surfaceofthe plasma membrane. They consist of sphingosine, a fatty acid, and an oligosaccharide residue, which can some- times be quite large. The phosphate residue typical of phospholipids is absent. Galacto- sylceramide and glucosylceramide (known as cerebroside) are simple representatives of this group. Cerebrosides in which the sugar is esterified with sulfuric acid are known as sulfatides. Gangliosides are the most complex glycolipids. They constitute a large family of membrane lipids with receptor functions that are as yet largely unknown. A characteristic component of many gangliosides is N-acetyl- neuraminic acid (sialic acid; see p. 38). 50 Biomolecules SO3 GalGalNAcGalGlc NeuAc P P P 2 P P CO CH2 O CO C H2CO P O O O O(CH2)2 H NCH3 CH3 CH3 NCH3 CH3 CH3 CH2CH2HO CH2HO CH NH3 COO CH2HO CH2 NH3 HO OH OH OH OH OH H H H H HH C O NH CH C CH2 COH H C H H OPO O O (CH2)2 NCH3 CH3 CH3 A.

Activated acetic acid as a component of lipids \u0002 Although the lipids found in plant and animal organisms occur in many different forms, they are all closely related biogenetically; they are all derived from acetyl-CoA,the “ac- tivated acetic acid” (see pp. 12, 110). 1. One major pathway leads from acetyl- CoA to the activated fatty acids (acyl-CoA;for details, see p.168). Fats, phospholipids, and glycolipids are synthesized from these, and fatty acid derivatives in particular are formed. Quantitatively, this is the most important pathway in animals and most plants. 2. The second pathway leads from acetyl- CoA to isopentenyl diphosphate (“active iso- prene”), the basic component for the isopren- oids. Its biosynthesis is discussed in connec- tion with biosynthesis of the isoprenoid, cho- lesterol (see p.172). B. Isoprenoids \u0002 Formally, isoprenoids are derived from a sin- gle common building block, isoprene (2- methyl-1,3-butadiene), a methyl-branched compound with five C atoms. Activated isoprene, isopentenyl diphosphate, is used by plants and animals to biosynthesize linear and cyclic oligomers and polymers. For the isoprenoids listed here—which only represent a small selection—the number of isoprene units (I) is shown. From activated isoprene, the metabolic pathway leads via dimerization to activated geraniol (I = 2) and then to activated farnesol (I = 3). At this point, the pathway divides into two. Further extension of farnesol leads to chains with increasing numbers of isoprene units—e. g., phytol (I = 4), dolichol (I = 14–24), and rubber (I = 700–5000). The other pathway involves a “head-to-head” linkage between two farnesol residues, giving rise to squalene (I = 6), which, in turn, is converted to choles- terol (I = 6) and the other steroids. The ability to synthesize particular iso- prenoids is limited to a few species of plants and animals. For example, rubber is only formed by a few plant species, including the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Several iso- prenoids that are required by animals for me- tabolism, but cannot be produced by them independently, are vitamins; this group includes vitamins A, D, E, and K. Due to its structure and function, vitamin D is now usu- ally classified as a steroid hormone (see pp. 56, 330). Isoprene metabolism in plants is very com- plex. Plants can synthesize many types of ar- omatic substances and volatile oils from iso- prenoids. Examples include menthol (I= 2 ), camphor (I = 2), and citronellal (I = 2). These C10 compounds are also called monoterpenes. Similarly, compounds consisting of three iso- prene units (I = 3) are termed sesquiterpenes, and the steroids (I = 6) are called triterpenes. Isoprenoids that have hormonal and sig- naling functions form an important group. These include steroid hormones (I = 6) and retinoate (the anion of retinoic acid; I = 3) in vertebrates, and juvenile hormone (I = 3) in arthropods. Some plant hormones also belong to the isoprenoids—e. g., the cytokinins, absci- sic acid, and brassinosteroids. Isoprene chains are sometimes used as lipid anchors to fix molecules to membranes (see p. 214). Chlorophyll has a phytyl residue (I =4) as a lipid anchor. Coenzymeswith iso- prenoid anchors of various lengths include ubiquinone (coenzyme Q; I = 6–10), plastoqui- none (I = 9), and menaquinone (vitamin K; I = 4–6). Proteins can also be anchored to mem- branes by isoprenylation. In some cases, an isoprene residue is used as an element to modify molecules chemi- cally. One example of this is N'-isopentenyl- AMP, which occurs as a modified component in tRNA. 52 Biomolecules O CH3C A S O C A S O P P 2 1 O CH3 H3C CH3 CH2OH HO CH2OH CH2OH O CH3 H3C HO CH3 CH3 O O CH3 O CH3 OCH3 n = 6–10 OH CH3 OH A.

Steroid building blocks \u0002 Common to all of the steroids is a molecular core structure consisting of four saturated rings, known as gonane. At the end of the steroid core, many steroids also carry a side chain, as seen in cholestane,the basic compo- nent of the sterols (steroid alcohols). B. Spatial structure \u0003 The four rings of the steroids are distin- guished using the letters A, B, C, and D. Due to the tetrahedral arrangement of the single carbon bonds, therings arenot flat, but puck- ered. Various ring conformations are known by the terms “chair,” “boat,” and “twisted” (not shown). The chair and boat conforma- tions are common. Fivemembered rings fre- quently adopt a conformation referred to as an “envelope”. Some rings can be converted from one conformation to another at room temperature, but with steroids this is dif cult. Substituents of the steroid core lie either approximately in the same plane as the ring (e = equatorial) or nearly perpendicular to it (a = axial). In threedimensional representa- tions, substituents pointing toward the ob- server are indicated by an unbroken line (β position), while bonds pointing into the plane of thepageare indicatedby a dashed line (α position). The so-called angular methyl groups at C-10 and C-13 of the steroids always adopt the β position. Neighboring rings can lie in the same plane (trans; 2) or at an angle to one another (cis; 1). This depends on the positions of the substitu- ents of the shared ring carbons, which can be arranged either cis or trans to the angular methyl group at C-10. The substituents of ste- roid that lie at the points of intersection of the individual rings are usually in trans position. As a whole, the core of most steroids is more or less planar, and looks like a flat disk. The only exceptions to this are the ecdysteroids, bile acids (in which A:B is cis), cardiac glyco- sides, and toad toxins. A more realistic impression of the three- dimensional structure of steroids is provided by the space-filling model of cholesterol (3). The four rings form a fairly rigid scaffolding, onto which the much more mobile side chain is attached. Steroids are relatively apolar (hydropho- bic). Some polar groups—e. g., hydroxyl and oxo groups—give them amphipathic proper- ties. This characteristic is especially pro- nounced with the bile acids (see p. 314). C. Thin-layer chromatography \u0003 Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is a power- ful, mainly analytic, technique for rapidly sep- arating lipids and other small molecules such as amino acids, nucleotides, vitamins, and drugs. The sample being analyzed is applied to a plate made of glass, aluminum, or plastic, which is covered with a thin layer of silica gel or other material (1). The plate is then placed in a chromatography chamber that contains some solvent. Drawn by capillary forces, the solvent moves up the plate (2). The substan- ces in the sample move with the solvent. The speed at which they move is determined by their distribution between the stationary phase (the hydrophilic silica), and the mobile phase (the hydrophobic solvent). When the solvent reaches the top edge of the plate, the chromatography is stopped. After evapo- ration of the solvent, the separated substan- ces can be made visible using appropriate staining methods or with physical processes (e. g., ultraviolet light) (3). The movement of a substance in a given TLC system is expressed as its Rf value. In this way, compounds that are not known can be identified by comparison with reference substances. A process in which the polarity of the sta- tionary and mobile phases is reversed—i. e., the stationary phase is apolar and the solvent is polar—is known as “reversed-phase thin- layer chromatography” (RP-TLC). 54 Biomolecules 1. 2.

Particularly in plants, compounds with steroid structures are also found that are notable for their pharmacological ef- fects—steroid alkaloids, digitalis glycosides, and saponins. A. Sterols \u0002 Sterols are steroid alcohols.Theyhave a β-positioned hydroxyl group at C-3 and one or more double bonds inringB andinthe side chain. There are no further oxygen functions, as in the carbonyl and carboxyl groups. The most important sterol in animals is cholesterol. Plants and microorganisms have a wide variety of closely related sterols in- stead of cholesterol—e. g., ergosterol, β-sitos- terol,and stigmasterol. Cholesterolis present in allanimaltissues, and particularly in neural tissue. It is a major constituent of cellular membranes, in which it regulates fluidity (see p. 216). The storage and transport forms of cholesterol are its esters with fatty acids. In lipoproteins, cholesterol and its fatty acid esters are associated with other lipids (see p. 278). Cholesterol is a con- stituent of the bile and is therefore found in many gallstones. Its biosynthesis, metabo- lism, and transport are discussed elsewhere (see pp. 172, 312). Cholesterol-rich lipoproteins of the LDL type are particularly important in the devel- opment of arteriosclerosis, in which the arte- rial walls are altered in connection with an excess plasma cholesterol level. In terms of dietary physiology, it is important that plant foodstuffs are low in cholesterol. By contrast, animal foods can contain large amounts of cholesterol—particularly butter, egg yolk, meat,liver,and brain. B. Bile acids \u0002 Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver (see p. 314). Their structures can therefore be derived from that of cholesterol. Characteristic for the bile acids is a side chain shortened by three C atoms in which the last carbon atom is oxidized to a carboxyl group. Thedoublebond in ringB is reduced and rings Aand Bare in cis position relative to each other (seep. 54).One to threehydroxyl groups (in α position) are found in the steroid core at positions 3,7,and 12.Bileacids keep bile cholesterol in a soluble state as micelles and promote the digestion of lipids in the intestine (see p. 270). Cholic acid and cheno- deoxycholic acid are primary bile acids that are formed by the liver. Their dehydroxylation at C-7 by microorganisms from the intestinal flora gives rise to the secondary bile acids lithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid. C. Steroid hormones \u0002 The conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones (see p. 376) is of minor importance quantitatively, but of major importance in terms of physiology. The steroid hormones are a group of lipophilic signal substances that regulate metabolism, growth, and repro- duction (see p. 374). Humans have six steroid hormones: progesterone, cortisol, aldosterone, testos- terone, estradiol,and calcitriol.With the ex- ception of calcitriol, these steroids have either no side chain or only a short side one consist- ing of two carbons. Characteristic for most of them is an oxo group at C-3, conjugated with a double bond between C-4 and C-5 of ring A. Differences occur in rings C and D. Estradiol is aromatic in ring A, and its hydroxyl group at C-3 is therefore phenolic. Calcitriol differs from other vertebrate steroid hormones; it still contains the complete carbon framework of cholesterol, but lightdependent opening of ring B turns it into what is termed a “secoste- roid” (a steroid with an open ring). Ecdysone is the steroid hormone of the arthropods. It can be regarded as an early form of the steroid hormones. Steroid hor- mones with signaling functions also occur in plants. 56 Biomolecules HO HO HO OH HO OH OH O OH HO O HO OH OH O OH HO O OH O HO C OH CH2OH O OHC O HO C CH2OH O O OH O C CH3 O OH OH CH2 HO 13 25 OH OH HO HO O OH HO H HO OH C.

Sterols B. Bile acids 57Lipids Amino acids: chemistry and properties A. Amino acids: functions \u0001 The amino acids (2-aminocarboxylic acids) fulfill various functions in the organism. Aboveall, they serveas the components of peptides and proteins. Only the 20 proteino- genic amino acids (see p. 60) are included in the genetic code and therefore regularly found in proteins. Some of these amino acids undergo further (post-translational) change following their incorporation into proteins (see p. 62). Amino acids or their derivatives are also form components of lipids—e. g., ser- ine in phospholipids and glycine in bile salts. Several amino acids function as neurotransmitters themselves (see p. 352), while others are precursors of neurotransmit- ters, mediators, or hormones (see p. 380). Amino acids are important (and sometimes essential) components of food (see p. 360). Specific amino acids form precursors for other metabolites—e. g., for glucose in gluconeogen- esis, for purine and pyrimidine bases, for heme, and for other molecules. Several non- proteinogenic amino acids function as inter- mediates in the synthesis and breakdown of proteinogenic amino acids (see p. 412) and in the urea cycle (see p.182). B. Optical activity \u0002 The natural amino acids are mainly α-amino acids, in contrast to β-amino acids such as β- alanine and taurine. Most α-amino acids have four different substituents at C-2 (Cα). The α atom therefore represents a chiral center—i. e., there are two different enantiomers (L- and D-amino acids; see p. 8). Among the proteino- genic amino acids, only glycine is not chiral (R =H). In nature,itisalmostexclusively L-amino acids that are found. D-Amino acids occur inbacteria—e. g.,inmurein(see p. 40)—and in peptide antibiotics. In animal metabolism, D-Amino acids would disturb the enzymatic reactions of L-amino acids and they are therefore broken down in the liver by the enzyme D-amino acid oxidase. The Fischer projection (center) is used to present the formulas for chiral centers in bio- molecules. It is derived from their three-di- mensional structure as follows: firstly, the tetrahedron is rotated in such a way that the most oxidized group (the carboxylate group) is at the top. Rotation is then continued until the line connecting line COO– and R (red) is level with the page. In L-amino acids, the NH3+ group is thenonthe left,while in D- amino acids it is on the right. C. Dissociation curve of histidine \u0002 All amino acids have at least two ionizable groups, and their net charge therefore de- pends on the pH value. The COOH groups at the α-C atom have pKa values of between 1.8 and2.8 andare thereforemore acidicthan simple monocarboxylic acids. The basicity of the α-amino function also varies, with pKa values of between 8.8 and 10.6, depending on the amino acid. Acidic and basic amino acids have additional ionizable groups in their side chain. The pKa values of these side chains arelistedon p. 60. Theelectrical charges of peptides and proteins are mainly determined by groups in thesidechains, as most α-car- boxyl and α-amino functions are linked to peptide bonds (see p. 66). Histidine can beusedhereas an example of thepH-dependence of thenet charge of an amino acid. In addition to the carboxyl group and the amino group at the α-C atom with pKa values of 1.8 and 9.2, respectively, histidine also has an imidazole residue in its side chain with a pKa value of 6.0. As the pH increases, the net charge (the sum of the positive and negative charges) therefore changes from +2 to –1. At pH 7.6, the net charge is zero, even though the molecule contains two almost completely ionized groups in these condi- tions. This pH value is called the isoelectric point. At its isoelectric point, histidine is said to be zwitterionic,as ithas both anionic and cationic properties. Most other amino acids are also zwitterionic at neutral pH. Peptides and proteins also have isoelectric points, which can vary widely depending on the composition of the amino acids. 58 Biomolecules R H COORHCOO H3NH3NCC R C HH3N COORCHCOOH3N 2 6 pK3 9.2 pK2 6.0 pK1 1.8 8 10 12 pH 4 0-1 +1 +2 COO CH3N CH2 H C HN HC N CH COO CH2N CH2 H C HN HC N CH COOH CH3N CH2 H C HN HC NH CH COO CH3N CH2 H C HN HC NH CH A.

The proteinogenic amino acids \u0002 The amino acids that are included in the ge- netic code (see p. 248) are described as “pro- teinogenic.” With a few exceptions (see p. 58), only these amino acids can be incorporated into proteins through translation.Onlythe side chains of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids are shown here. Their classification is based on the chemical structure of the side chains, on the one hand, and on their polarity on the other (see p. 6). The literature includes several slightly different systems for classify- ing amino acids, and details may differ from those in the system used here. For each amino acid, the illustration names: • Membership of structural classes I–VII (see below; e. g., III and VI for histidine) • Name and abbreviation, formed from the first three letters of the name (e. g., histi- dine, His) • The one-letter symbol introduced to save space in the electronic processing of se- quence data (H for histidine) • A quantitative valuefor thepolarity of the side chain (bottom left; 10.3 for histidine). The more positive this value is, the more polar the amino acid is. In addition, the polarity of the side chains is indicated by color. It increases from yellow, through light and dark green, to bluish green. For ionizing side chains, the corresponding pKa values are also given (red numbers). The aliphatic amino acids (class I) include glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine. These amino acids do not contain heteroa- toms (N, O, or S) in their side chains and do not contain a ring system. Their side chains are markedly apolar. Together with threonine (see below), valine, leucine, and isoleucine form the group of branched-chain amino acids.The sulfurcontaining amino acids cys- teine and methionine (class II), are also apolar. However, in the case of cysteine, this only applies to the undissociated state. Due to its ability to form disulfide bonds, cysteine plays an important role in the stabilization of pro- teins (see p. 72). Two cysteine residues linked by a disulfide bridge are referred to as cystine (not shown). The aromatic amino acids (class III) contain resonancestabilized rings. In this group, only phenylalanine has strongly apolar properties. Tyrosine and tryptophan are moderately polar, and histidine is even strongly polar. The imi- dazole ring of histidine is already protonated at weakly acidic pH values. Histidine, which is only aromatic in protonated form (see p. 58), can therefore also be classified as a basic amino acid. Tyrosine and tryptophan show strong light absorption at wavelengths of 250–300 nm. The neutral amino acids (class IV) have hydroxyl groups (serine, threonine)or amide groups (asparagine, glutamine). Despite their nonionic nature, the amide groups of aspara- gine and glutamine are markedly polar. The carboxyl groups in the side chains of the acidic amino acids aspartic acid and glu- tamic acid (class V) are almost completely ionized at physiological pH values. The side chains of the basic amino acids lysine and arginine are also fully ionized—i. e., positively charged—at neutral pH. Arginine, with its positively charge guanidinium group, is par- ticularly strongly basic, and therefore ex- tremely polar. Proline (VII) is a special case. Together with the α-C atom and the α-NH2 group, its side chain forms a fivemembered ring. Its nitrogen atom is only weakly basic and is not proto- nated at physiological pH. Due to its ring structure, proline causes bending of the pep- tide chain in proteins (this is important in collagen, for example; see p. 70). Several proteinogenic amino acids cannot be synthesized by the human organism, and therefore have to be supplied from the diet. These essential amino acids (see p. 360) are marked with a star in the illustration. Histi- dine and possibly also arginine are essential for infants and small children. 60 Biomolecules –2.4 –1.9 –2.0 –2.3 –2.2 –1.2 –1.5 8.3 +0.8 +6.1 +5.9 +6.0 +5.1 +4.9 10.1 6.04.3 4.0 12.5 10.8 +9.7 +9.4 +11.0 +10.2 +10.3 +15.0 +20.0 H CH3 CH CH3 H3C CH2 CH CH3 H3C C CH2 H3CH CH3 CH2 SH CH2 CH2 S CH3 C OH H3CHCH2 OHCH HN H2CCH2 CH2 COO N H CH2CH2 OH CH2 CH2 CONH2 CH2 CH2 CONH2 CH2 COO CH2 HN HC N CH CH2 CH2 CH2 NH C H2NNH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 NH3 CH2 CH2 COO (Gly, G) (Ala, A) (Val, V) (Leu, L) (Ile, I) (Cys, C) (Met, M) Glycine Cysteine Aliphatic Alanine Valine Leucine Isoleucine Methionine Sulfur-containing pKa value A.

These arise during metabolic reactions (A)or as a result of enzymatic modifications of amino acid residues in peptides or proteins (B). The “biogenic amines” (C) are synthesized from α- amino acids by decarboxylation. A. Rare amino acids \u0003 Only a few important representatives of the non-proteinogenic amino acids are men- tioned here. The basic amino acid ornithine is an analogue of lysine with a shortened side chain. Transfer of a carbamoyl residue to or- nithine yields citrulline.Both of these amino acids are intermediates in the urea cycle (see p.182). Dopa (an acronym of 3,4-dihydroxy- phenylalanine) is synthesized by hydroxyla- tion of tyrosine. It is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of catecholamines (see p. 352) and of melanin. It is in clinical use in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Selenocys- teine, a cysteine analogue, occurs as a compo- nent of a few proteins—e. g., in the enzyme glutathioneperoxidase (seep. 284). B. Post-translational protein modification \u0002 Subsequent alteration of amino acid residues in finished peptides and proteins is referred to as post-translational modification. These re- actions usually only involve polar amino acid residues, and they serve various purposes. The free α-amino group at the N-terminus is blocked in manyproteinsbyan acetyl res- idue or a longer acyl residue (acylation). N- terminal glutamate can cyclize into a pyroglu- tamate residue, while the C-terminal carbox- ylategroup can bepresent in an amidated form (see TSH, p. 380). The side chains of ser- ine and asparagine residues are often linked to oligosaccharides (glycosylation, see p. 230). Phosphorylation of proteins mainly affects serine and tyrosine residues. These reactions have mainly regulatory functions (see p.114). Aspartate and histidine residues of enzymes are sometimes phosphorylated, too. A special modification of glutamate residues, -carbox- ylation, is found in coagulation factors. It is essential for blood coagulation (see p. 290). The ε-amino group of lysine residues is sub- ject to a particularly large number of modifi- cations. Its acetylation (or deacetylation) is an important mechanism for controlling genetic activity (see p. 244). Many coenzymes and cofactors are covalently linked to lysine resi- dues. These include biotin (see p. 108), lipoic acid (see p.106), and pyridoxal phosphate (see p. 108), as well as retinal (see p. 358). Covalent modification with ubiquitin marks proteins for breakdown (see p.176). In colla- gen, lysine and proline residues are modified by hydroxylation to prepare for the formation of stable fibrils (see p. 70). Cysteine residues form disulfide bonds with one another (see p. 72). Cysteine prenylation serves to anchor proteins in membranes (see p. 214). Covalent bonding of a cysteine residue with heme oc- curs in cytochrome c.Flavins are sometimes covalently bound to cysteine or histidine res- idues of enzymes. Among the modifications of tyrosine residues, conversion into iodinated thyroxine (see p. 374) is particularly interest- ing. C. Biogenic amines \u0002 Several amino acids are broken down by de- carboxylation. This reaction gives rise to what are known as biogenic amines, which have various functions. Some of them are compo- nents of biomolecules,suchas ethanolamine in phospholipids (see p. 50). Cysteamine and -alanine are components of coenzyme A (see p.12) and of pantetheine (see pp. 108, 168). Other amines function as signaling substan- ces. An important neurotransmitter derived from glutamate is γ-aminobutyrate (GABA, see p. 356). The transmitter dopamine is also a precursor for the catecholamines epineph- rine and norepinephrine (see p. 352). The bio- genic amine serotonin, a substance that has many effects, is synthesized from tryptophan via the intermediate 5-hydroxytryptophan. Monamines are inactivated into aldehydes by amine oxidase (monoamine oxidase, “MAO”) with deamination and simultaneous oxidation. MAO inhibitors therefore play an important role in pharmacological interven- tions in neurotransmitter metabolism. 62 Biomolecules HN N COO C CH2 CH2 CH2 NH3 H3NH COO C CH2 CH2 CH2 N H3NH CNH2 O H COO C CH2 H3NH OH OH COO C CH2 H3NH Se H NH3COOCONH2OH SH OH OOC H3N Neurotrans- mitter (GABA) A.

Proteins \u0002 When amino acids are linked together by acid–amide bonds, linear macromolecules (peptides) are produced. Those containing more than ca. 100 amino acid residues are described as proteins (polypeptides). Every organism contains thousands of different pro- teins, which have a variety of functions. At a magnification of ca. 1.5 million, the semi- schematic illustration shows the structures of a few intra and extracellular proteins, giv- ing an impression of their variety. The func- tions of proteins can be classified as follows. Establishment and maintenance of struc- ture. Structural proteins are responsible for the shape and stability of cells and tissues. A small part of a collagen molecule is shown as an example (right; see p. 70). The complete molecule is 1.5 300 nm in size, and at the magnification used here it would be as long as three pages of the book. Histones are also structural proteins. They organize the ar- rangement of DNA in chromatin. The basic components of chromatin, the nucleosomes (top right; see p. 218) consist of an octameric complex of histones, around which the DNA is coiled. Transport. A wellknown transport protein is hemoglobin in the erythrocytes (bottom left). It is responsible for the transport of oxy- gen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and tissues (see p. 282). The blood plasma also contains many other proteins with trans- port functions. Prealbumin (transthyretin; middle), for example, transports the thyroid hormones thyroxin and triiodothyronine. Ion channels and other integral membrane pro- teins (see p. 220) facilitate the transport of ions and metabolites across biological mem- branes. Protection and defense. The immune sys- tem protects the body from pathogens and foreign substances. An important component of this system is immunoglobulin G (bottom left; see p. 300). The molecule shown here is bound to an erythrocyte by complex forma- tion with surface glycolipids (see p. 292). Control and regulation. In biochemical sig- nal chains, proteins function as signaling sub- stances (hormones) and as hormone recep- tors. The complex between the growth hormone somatotropin and its receptor is shown here as an example (middle). Here, the extracellular domains of two receptor molecules here bind one molecule of the hor- mone. This binding activates the cytoplasmic domains of the complex, leading to further conduction of the signal to the interior of thecell(seep. 384).The smallpeptide hormone insulin is discussed in detail else- where (see pp. 76, 160). DNA-binding proteins (transcription factors; see p. 118) are decisively involved in regulating the metabolism and in differentiation processes. The structure and function of the catabolite activator protein (top left) and similar bacterial transcription factors have been particularly well investi- gated. Catalysis. Enzymes, with more than 2000 known representatives, are the largest group of proteins in terms of numbers (see p. 88). The smallest enzymes have molecular masses of 10–15 kDa. Intermediatesized enzymes, such as alcohol dehydrogenase (top left) are around 100–200 kDa, and the largest— including glutamine synthetase with its 12 monomers (top right)—can reach more than 500 kDa. Movement. The interaction between actin and myosin is responsible for muscle contrac- tion and cell movement (see p. 332). Myosin (right), with a length of over 150 nm, is among the largest proteins there are. Actin filaments (F-actin)arise dueto the polymer- ization of relatively small protein subunits (G- actin). Along with other proteins, tropomyo- sin, which is associated with F-actin, controls contraction. Storage. Plants contain special storage pro- teins, which are also important for human nutrition (not shown). In animals, muscle proteins constitute a nutrient reserve that can be mobilized in emergencies. 64 Biomolecules Hemoglobin Immuno- globulin G Prealbumin Water Glucose Cholesterol Ion channel Alcohol dehydrogenase DNACatabolite activator protein Glutamine synthetase Myosin F-Actin Nucleus 10 nm Cyto- plasm Nucleosome Somatotropin receptor (dimer) Somatotropin Insulin Blood Collagen triple helix Tropo- myosin A. Proteins Erythrocyte 65Peptides and Proteins Peptide bonds A. Peptide bond \u0002 The amino acid components of peptides and proteins are linked together by amide bonds (see p. 60) between α-carboxyl and α-amino groups. This type of bonding is therefore also known as peptide bonding.In the dipeptide shown here, the serine residue has a free ammonium group, while the carboxylate group in alanine is free. Since the amino acid with the free NH3+ group is named first, the peptide is known as seryl alanine,orin abbre- viated form Ser-Ala or SA. B. Resonance \u0002 Like all acid–amide bonds, the peptide bond is stabilized by resonance (see p. 4). In the con- ventional notation (top right) it is represented as a combination of a C=O double bond with a C–N single bond. However, a C=N double bond with charges at O and N could also be written (middle). Both of these are only extreme cases of electron distribution, known as resonance structures. In reality, the π electrons are delocalized throughout all the atoms (bot- tom). As a mesomeric system, the peptide bond is planar.Rotation aroundthe C–N bond would only be possible at the expense of large amounts of energy, and the bond is therefore not freely rotatable. Rotations are only possible around the single bonds marked with arrows. The state of these is expressed using the angles φ and ψ (see D). The plane in which the atoms of the peptide bond lie is highlighted in light blue here and on the fol- lowing pages. C. Peptide nomenclature \u0002 Peptide chains have a direction and therefore two different ends. The amino terminus (N terminus) ofa peptidehas a freeammonium group, while the carboxy terminus (Ctermi- nus) is formed by the carboxylate group of the last amino acid. In peptides and proteins, the amino acid components are usually linked in linear fashion. To express the sequence of a peptide, it is therefore suf cient to combine the three-letter or single-letter abbreviations for the amino acid residues (see p. 60). This sequence always starts at the N terminus. For example, the peptide hormone angiotensin II (see p. 330) has the sequence Asp-Arg-Val- Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe, or DRVYIHPF. D. Conformational space of the peptide chain \u0003 With the exception of the terminal residues, every amino acid in a peptide is involved in two peptide bonds (one with the preceding residueand onewith the following one).Due to the restricted rotation around the C–N bond, rotations are only possible around the N–Cα and Cα–C bonds (2). As mentioned above, these rotations are described by the dihedral angles φ (phi) and ψ (psi). The angle describes rotation around the N–Cα bond; ψ describes rotation around Cα–C—i. e., the po- sition of the subsequent bond. For steric reasons, only specific combina- tions of the dihedral angles are possible. These relationships can be illustrated clearly by a so-called φ/ ψ diagram (1). Most combi- nations of φ and ψ are sterically “forbidden” (red areas). For example, the combination φ = 0° and ψ =180° (4)would placethe two carbonyl oxygen atoms less than 115 pm apart—i. e., at a distance much smaller than the sum of their van der Waals radii (see p. 6). Similarly, in the case of φ =180°and ψ =0° (5), the two NH hydrogen atoms would collide. The combinations located within the green areasare the onlyonesthat are sterically feasible (e. g., 2 and 3). The important secon- dary structures that are discussed in the fol- lowing pages are also located in these areas. The conformations located in the yellow areas are energetically less favorable, but still pos- sible. The φ/ψ diagram (also known as a Rama- chandran plot)was developed from modeling studies of small peptides. However, the con- formations of most of the amino acids in pro- teins are also located in the permitted areas. The corresponding data for the small protein, insulin (see p. 76), are represented by black dots in 1. 66 Biomolecules 180 120 60 ψ 0 -60 -120 -180 -120 -60 0 60 120 180 ϕ A-9 B-20 B-8 αr βp βa C B-23 αl 2. 3. 4. 5. ϕ ψ 2R 1 3 R 3 1 ϕ ψ2 R ϕ ψ 1 3 2 ϕ ψ R 2 1 3 1.

When several succes- sive residues adopt one of these conforma- tions, defined secondary structures arise, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds ei- ther within the peptide chain or between neighboring chains. When a large part of a protein takes on a defined secondary struc- ture, the protein often forms mechanically stable filaments or fibers. Structural proteins of this type (see p. 70) usually have character- istic amino acid compositions. The most important secondary structural elements of proteins are discussed here first. The illustrations only show the course of the peptide chain; the side chains are omitted. To make thecourseof the chains clearer, the levels of the peptide bonds are shown as blue planes. The dihedral angles of the struc- tures shown here are also marked in diagram D1 on p. 67. A. -Helix \u0002 The right-handed α-helix (αR)is one of the most common secondary structures. In this conformation, the peptide chain is wound like a screw. Each turn of the screw (the screw axis in shown in orange) covers approxi- mately 3.6 amino acid residues. The pitch of the screw (i. e., the smallest distance between two equivalent points) is 0.54 nm. α-Helices are stabilized by almost linear hydrogen bonds between the NH and CO groups of residues, which are four positions apart from each an- other in the sequence (indicated by red dots; see p. 6). In longer helices, most amino acid residuesthusenter into two Hbonds.Apolar or amphipathic α-helices with five to seven turns often serve to anchor proteins in bio- logical membranes (transmembrane helices; see p. 214). The mirror image of the αR helix, the left- handed -helix (αL), is rarely found in nature, although it would be energetically “permissi- ble.” B. Collagen helix \u0002 Another type of helix occurs in the collagens, which are important constituents of the con- nectivetissue matrix (see pp. 70, 344). The collagen helix is left-handed,and with a pitch of 0.96 nm and 3.3 residues per turn, it is steeper than the α-helix. In contrast to the α-helix, H bonds are not possible within the collagen helix. However, the conformation is stabilized by the association of three helices to form a righthanded collagen triple helix (see p. 70). C. Pleated-sheet structures \u0002 Two additional, almost stretched, conforma- tions of the peptide chain are known as pleated sheets, as the peptide planes are ar- ranged like a regularly folded sheet of paper. Again, H bonds can only form between neigh- boring chains (“strands”) in pleated sheets. When the two strands run in opposite direc- tions (1), the structure is referred to as an antiparallel pleated sheet (βa). When they runinthe same direction(2), it is a parallel pleated sheet (βp). In both cases, the α-C atoms occupy the highest and lowest points in the structure, and the side chains point alternately straight up or straight down (see p. 71 C). The βa structure, with its almost lin- ear H bonds, is energetically more favorable. In extended pleated sheets, the individual strands of the sheet are usually not parallel, but twisted relative to one another (see p. 74). D. Turns \u0002 Turns are often found at sites where the peptide chain changes direction. These are sections in which four amino acid residues are arranged in such a way that the course of the chain reverses by about 180° into the opposite direction. The two turns shown (types I and II) are particularly frequent. Both are stabilized by hydrogen bonds be- tween residues 1 and 4. β Turns are often located between the individual strands of antiparallel pleated sheets, or between strands of pleated sheets and α helices. 68 Biomolecules NC NC N C N C A. α Helix B.

Most of these proteins contain a high percentage of specific secondary struc- tures (see p. 68). For this reason, the amino acid composition of many structural proteins is also characteristic (see below). A. Keratin \u0003 -Keratin is a structural protein that predom- inantly consists of α helices. Hair (wool), feathers, nails, claws and the hooves of ani- mals consist largely of keratin. It is also an important component of the cytoskeleton (cytokeratin), where it appears in intermedi- ate filaments (see p. 204). In thekeratins, largeparts of thepeptide chain show right-handed α-helical coiling. Two chains each form a left-handed super- helix, asisalsoseen in myosin (see p. 65). The superhelical keratin dimers join to form tetramers, and these aggregate further to form protofilaments,with a diameter of 3 nm. Finally, eight protofilaments then form an intermediate filament,witha diam- eter of 10 nm (see p. 204). Similar keratin filaments are found in hair. In a single wool fiber with a diameter of about 20 µm, millions of filaments are bundled to- gether within dead cells. The individual kera- tin helices are cross-linked and stabilized by numerous disulfide bonds (see p. 72). This fact is exploited in the perming of hair. Initially, the disulfide bonds of hair keratin are dis- rupted by reduction with thiol compounds (see p. 8). The hair is then styled in the desired shape and heat-dried. In the process, new disulfide bonds are formed by oxidation, which maintain the hairstyle for some time. B. Collagen \u0002 Collagen is the quantitatively most important proteininmammals, makingup about 25%of the total protein. There are many different types of collagen, particularly in connective tissue. Collagen has an unusual amino acid composition. Approximately one-third of the amino acids are glycine (Gly), about 10% pro- line (Pro), and 10% hydroxyproline (Hyp). The two latter amino acids are only formed during collagen biosynthesis as a result of posttrans- lational modification (see p. 344). The triplet Gly-X-Y (2)is constantly re- peated in the sequence of collagen, with the X position often being occupied by Pro and the Y position by Hyp. The reason for this is that collagen is largely present as a triple helix made up of three individual collagen helices (1). In triple helices, every third residue lies on the inside of the molecule, where for steric reasons there is only room for glycine resi- dues (3; the glycine residues are shown in yellow). Only a small section of a triple helix is illustrated here. The complete collagen molecule is approximately 300 nm long. C. Silk fibroin \u0003 Silk is produced from the spun threads from silkworms (thelarvaeof the moth Bombyx mori and related species). The main protein in silk, fibroin, consists of antiparallel pleated sheet structures arranged one on top of the other in numerous layers (1). Since the amino acid side chains in pleated sheets point either straightuporstraightdown (seep. 68),only compact side chains fit between the layers. In fact, more than 80% of fibroin consists of gly- cine, alanine, and serine, the three amino acids with the shortest side chains. A typical repetitive amino acid sequence is (Gly-Ala- Gly-Ala-Gly-Ser). The individual pleated sheet layers in fibroin are found to lie alternately 0.35 nm and 0.57 nm apart. In the first case, only glycine residues (R = H) are opposed to oneanother. Theslightly greater distance of 0.57 nm results from repulsion forces be- tween the side chains of alanine and serine residues (2). 70 Biomolecules Ala Gly Ala Gly Ala Ala Gly Gly GlyGly SerAla Gly Gly Gly Gly Gly Gly Arg Gln Pro Pro Ala X Hyp Arg Hyp Gln Arg Y Gly 3 nm 10 nm A. α-Keratin C.

The shape of soluble pro- teinsismore or lessspherical (globular). In their biologically active form, globular proteins have a defined spatial structure (the native conformation). If this structure is destroyed (denaturation; see p. 74), not only does the biological effect disappear, but the protein also usually precipitates in insoluble form. This happens, for example, when eggs are boiled; the proteins dissolved in the egg white are denatured by the heat and produce the solid egg white. To illustrate protein conformations in a clear (but extremely simplified) way, Richard- son diagrams are often used. In these diagrams, α-helices are symbolized by red cylinders or spirals and strands of pleated sheets by green arrows. Less structured areas of the chain, including the β-turns, are shown as sections of gray tubing. A. Conformation-stabilizing interactions \u0002 The native conformation of proteins is stabi- lized by a number of different interactions. Among these, only the disulfide bonds (B) represent covalent bonds. Hydrogen bonds, which can form inside secondary structures, as well as between more distant residues, are involved in all proteins (see p. 6). Many pro- teins are also stabilized by complex formation with metal ions (see pp. 76, 342, and 378, for example). The hydrophobic effect is particu- larly important for protein stability. In glob- ular proteins, most hydrophobic amino acid residues are arranged in the interior of the structure in the native conformation, while the polar amino acids are mainly found on the surface (see pp. 28, 76). B. Disulfide bonds \u0002 Disulfide bonds arise when the SH groups of two cysteine residues are covalently linked as a dithiol by oxidation. Bonds of this type are only found (with a few exceptions) in extra- cellular proteins, because in the interior of the cell glutathione (see p. 284) and other reduc- ing compounds are present in such high con- centrations that disulfides would be reduc- tively cleaved again. The small plant protein crambin (46 amino acids) contains three di- sulfide bonds and is therefore very stable. The high degree of stability of insulin (see p. 76) has a similar reason. C. Protein dynamics \u0002 The conformations of globular proteins are not rigid, but can change dramatically on binding of ligands or in contact with other proteins. For example, the enzyme adenylate kinase (see p. 336) has a mobile domain (do- main = independently folded partial struc- ture), which folds shut after binding of the substrate (yellow). The larger domain (bot- tom) also markedly alters its conformation. There are large numbers of allosteric proteins of this type. This group includes, for example, hemoglobin (see p. 280), calmodulin (see p. 386), and many allosteric enzymes such as aspartate carbamoyltransferase (see p.116). D. Folding patterns \u0003 The globular proteins show a high degree of variability in folding of their peptide chains. Only a few examples are shown here. Purely helically folded proteins such as myoglobin (1; see p. 74, heme yellow) are rare. In general, pleated sheet and helical elements exist alongside each other. In the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (2;see p. 378), a small, two-stranded pleated sheet functions as a “cover” for the hormone binding site (estradiol yellow). In flavodoxin, asmall flavo- protein with a redox function (3;FMN yel- low),a fan-shaped,pleated sheetmadeupof five parallel strands forms the core of the molecule. The conformation of the β subunit of the G-protein transducin (4;see pp. 224, 358) is very unusual. Seven pleated sheets form a large, symmetrical “β propeller.” The N-terminal section of the protein contains one long and one short helix. 72 Biomolecules S NH CO SS CO NH CH2HC CH2 CH A.

The na- tive forms of many proteins arise spontane- ously in the test tube and within a few mi- nutes. Nevertheless, there are special auxiliary proteins (chaperonines) that sup- port the folding of other proteins in the con- ditions present within the cell (see p. 232). An important goal of biochemistry is to under- stand the laws governing protein folding.This wouldmakeit possibleto predict theconfor- mation of a protein from the easily accessible DNAsequence(seep. 260). A. Folding and denaturation of ribonuclease A \u0002 The folding of proteins to the native form is favored under physiological conditions. The native conformation is lost, as the result of denaturation,atextreme pH values,at high temperatures, and in the presence of organic solvents, detergents, and other denaturing substances, such as urea. Thefactthata denaturedprotein can spon- taneously return to its native conformation was demonstrated for the first time with ri- bonuclease, a digestive enzyme (see p. 266) consisting of 124 amino acids. In the native form (top right), there are extensive pleated sheet structures and three α helices. The eight cysteine residues of the protein are forming four disulfide bonds. Residues His-12, Lys-41 and His-119 (pink) are particularly important for catalysis. Together with additional amino acids, they form the enzyme’s active center. The disulfide bonds can be reductively cleaved by thiols (e. g., mercaptoethanol, HO-CH2-CH2-SH). If urea at a high concentra- tion is also added, the protein unfolds com- pletely. In this form (left), it is up to 35 nm long. Polar (green) and apolar (yellow) side chains are distributed randomly. The dena- tured enzyme is completely inactive, because the catalytically important amino acids (pink) are too far away from each other to be able to interact witheachother and withthe sub- strate. When the urea and thiol are removed by dialysis (see p. 78), secondary and tertiary structures develop again spontaneously. The cysteine residues thus return to a suf ciently close spatial vicinity that disulfide bonds can once again form under the oxidative effect of atmospheric oxygen. The active center also reestablishes itself. In comparison with the denatured protein, the native form is aston- ishingly compact, at 4.5 2.5 nm. In this state, the apolar side chains (yellow) predominate in the interior of the protein, while the polar residues aremainlyfound on thesurface.This distribution is due to the “hydrophobic effect” (see p. 28), and it makes a vital contribution to the stability of the native conformation (B). B. Energetics of protein folding \u0003 The energetics of protein folding are not at present satisfactorily understood. Only a sim- plified model is discussed here. The confor- mation of a molecule is stable in any given conditions if the change in its free enthalpy during folding (∆Gfold)is negative(seep. 16). Themagnitude of thefolding enthalpy is af- fected by several factors. The main factor working against folding is the strong increase in the ordering of the molecule involved. As discussed on p. 20, this leads to a negative change in entropy of ∆Sconf and therefore to a strongly positive entropy term –T ∆S(violet arrow). By contrast, the covalent and nonco- valent bonds in the interior of the protein have a stabilizing influence. For this reason, the change in folding enthalpy ∆Hfold is neg- ative (red arrow). A third factor is the change in the system’s entropy due to the hydropho- bic effect. During folding, the degree of order in the surrounding water decreases—i. e., ∆Swater is positive and therefore –T ∆Sis negative (blue arrow). When the sum of these effects is negative (green arrow), the protein folds spontaneously into its native conforma- tion. 74 Biomolecules 26-84 40-95 58-110 65-72 – + 40 95 26 84 58 110 65 72 A.

The biosynthesis and function of this important hormone are discussed else- where in this book (pp.160, 388). Monomeric insulin consists of 51 amino acids, and with a molecular mass of 5.5 kDa it is only half the size of the smallest enzymes. Nevertheless, it has the typical properties of a globular pro- tein. Large quantities of pure insulin are re- quired for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (see p.160). The annual requirement for insu- lin isover500 kg in a country thesizeof Germany. Formerly, the hormone had to be obtained from the pancreas of slaughtered animals in a complicated and expensive procedure. Human insulin,which is produced by overexpression in genetically engineered bacteria, is now mainly used (see p. 262). A. Structure of insulin \u0003 There are various different structural levels in proteins, and these can be briefly discussed again here using the example of insulin. The primary structure of a protein is its amino acid sequence. During the biosynthesis of insulin in the pancreas, a continuous pep- tide chain with 84 residues is first synthesi- zed—proinsulin (see p. 160). After folding of the molecule, the three disulfide bonds are firstformed, and residues31to 63are then proteolytically cleaved releasing the so-called Cpeptide. The molecule that is left over (1) now consists of two peptide chains, the A chain (21 residues, shown in yellow) and the Bchain (30 residues, orange). One of the di- sulfide bonds is located inside the A chain, and the two others link the two chains to- gether. Secondary structures are regions of the peptide chain with a defined conformation (see p. 68) that are stabilized by H-bonds. In insulin (2), the α-helical areas are predomi- nant, making up 57% of the molecule; 6% consists of β-pleated-sheet structures, and 10% of β-turns, while the remainder (27%) cannot be assigned to any of the secondary structures. The three-dimensional conformation of a protein, made up of secondary structural ele- ments and unordered sections, is referred to as the tertiary structure.In insulin,itis com- pact and wedge-shaped (B). The tip of the wedge is formed by the B chain, which changes its direction at this point. Quaternary structure. Due to non-covalent interactions, many proteins assemble to form symmetrical complexes (oligomers). The indi- vidual components of oligomeric proteins (usually 2–12) are termed subunits or mono- mers. Insulin also forms quaternary struc- tures. In the blood, it is partly present as a dimer. In addition, there are also hexamers stabilized by Zn 2+ ions (light blue) (3), which represent the form in which insulin is stored in thepancreas (seep. 160). B. Insulin (monomer) \u0003 The van der Waals model of monomeric in- sulin (1) once again shows the wedge-shaped tertiary structure formed by the two chains together. In the second model (3,bottom), the side chains of polar amino acids are shown in blue, while apolar residues are yellow or pink. This model emphasizes the importance of the “hydrophobic effect” for protein folding (see p. 74). In insulin as well, most hydrophobic side chains are located on the inside of the molecule, while the hydrophilic residues are located on the surface. Apparently in contra- diction to this rule, several apolar side chains (pink) are found on the surface. However, all of these residues are involved in hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the dimeric and hexameric forms of insulin. In the third model (2,right), thecolored residues are those that are located on the surface and occur invariably (red) or almost invariably (orange) in all known insulins. It is assumed that amino acid residues that are not replaced by other residues during the course of evolution are essential for the protein’s function. In the case of insulin, almost all of these residues are located on one side of the molecule. They are probably involved in the binding of the hormone to its receptor (see p. 224). 76 Biomolecules 2324252627282930 RR A K P T Y F F G R 22 12 3456 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 CGI V E Q S L Y Q L E N 21 YC N 123 456 78 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 F V N Q H L CG S H L V E A L Y L V CG E TS I 7 C 11 C 89 10 KR Q E NH3 NH3 OOC OOC NH3 OOC OOC NH3 1. 2. 3.

Since the globular proteins in particular are very unstable (see p. 72), purification is carried out at low tem- peratures (0–5 °C) and particularly gentle separation processes are used. A few of the methods of purifying and characterizing pro- teinsare discussedon thispage. A. Salt precipitation \u0003 The solubility of proteins is strongly depen- dent on the salt concentration (ionic strength) of the medium. Proteins are usually poorly soluble in pure water. Their solubility in- creases as the ionic strength increases, be- cause more and more of the well-hydrated anorganic ions (blue circles) are bound to the protein’s surface, preventing aggregation of the molecules (salting in). At very high ionic strengths, the salt withdraws the hy- drate water from the proteins and thus leads to aggregation and precipitation of the mole- cules (salting out). For this reason, adding saltssuch asammoniumsulfate (NH4)2SO4 makes itpossibleto separateproteins from a mixture according to their degree of solubility (fractionation). B. Dialysis \u0003 Dialysis is used to remove lower-molecular components from protein solutions, or to ex- change the medium. Dialysis is based on the fact that due to their size, protein molecules areunableto pass through thepores of a semipermeable membrane, while lower-mo- lecular substances distribute themselves evenly between the inner and outer spaces over time. After repeated exchanging of the external solution, the conditions inside the dialysis tube (salt concentration, pH, etc.) will be thesameas in the surrounding solu- tion. C. Gel filtration \u0003 Gel permeation chromatography (“gel filtra- tion”) separates proteins according to their size and shape. This is done using a chroma- tography column, which is filled with spherical gel particles (diameter 10–500 µm) of polymeric material (shown schematically in 1a). Theinsides of theparticles aretra- versed by channels that have defined diame- ters. A protein mixture is then introduced at the upper end of the column (1b)and elution is carried out by passing a buffer solution through the column. Large protein molecules (red) areunableto penetrate theparticles, and therefore pass through the column quickly. Medium-sized (green) and small par- ticles (blue) are delayed forlongerorshorter periods (1c). The proteins can be collected separately from the ef uent (eluate)(2). Their elution volume Ve depends mainly on their molecular mass (3). D. SDS gel electrophoresis \u0003 The most commonly used procedure for checking the purity of proteins is sodium do- decylsulfate polyacrylamide gelelectropho- resis (SDS-PAGE). In electrophoresis, mole- cules move in an electrical field (see p. 276). Normally, the speed of their movement de- pends on three factors—their size, their shape, and their electrical charge. In SDS-PAGE, the protein mixture is treated in such a way that only the molecules’ mass affects their movement. This is achieved by adding sodium dodecyl sulfate (C12H25- OSO3Na), the sulfuric acid ester of lauryl alco- hol(dodecylalcohol). SDSis a detergent with strongly amphipathic properties (see p. 28). It separates oligomeric proteins into their sub- units and denatures them. SDS molecules bind to the unfolded peptide chains (ca. 0.4 g SDS / g protein) and give them a strongly negative charge. To achieve complete denatu- ration, thiols are also added in order to cleave the disulfide bonds (1). Following electrophoresis, which is carried out in a vertically arranged gel of polymeric acrylamide (2), the separated proteins are made visible by staining. In example (3), the following were separated: a)a cell extract with hundreds of different proteins, b)a pro- tein purified from this, and c)amixture of proteins with known masses. 78 Biomolecules 22 20 18 16 14 12 ab c 20 40 60801012 16 20 248 Ve (mL) 20 40 60 80ab c SDS S S D.

They are divided into two major classes: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) func- tions solely in information storage, while ri- bonucleic acids (RNAs) are involved in most steps of gene expression and protein biosyn- thesis. All nucleic acids are made up from nucleotide components, which in turn consist of a base,a sugar,and a phosphate residue. DNA and RNA differ from one another in the type of the sugar and in one of the bases that they contain. A. Nucleic acid bases \u0002 The bases that occur in nucleic acids are aromatic heterocyclic compounds derived from either pyrimidine or purine.Fiveofthese bases are the main components of nucleic acids in all living creatures. The purine bases adenine (abbreviation Ade, not “A”!) and gua- nine (Gua) and the pyrimidine base cytosine (Cyt) are present in both RNA and DNA. In contrast, uracil (Ura) is only found in RNA. In DNA, uracil is replaced by thymine (Thy), the 5-methyl derivative of uracil. 5-methylcyto- sine also occurs in small amounts in the DNA of the higher animals. A large number of other modified bases occur in tRNA (see p. 82) and in other types of RNA. B. Nucleosides, nucleotides \u0002 When a nucleic acid base is N-glycosidically linked to ribose or 2-deoxyribose (see p. 38), it yields a nucleoside. The nucleoside adenosine (abbreviation: A) is formed in this way from adenine and ribose, for example. The corre- sponding derivatives of the other bases are called guanosine (G), uridine (U), thymidine (T) and cytidine (C). When the sugar compo- nent is 2-deoxyribose, the product is a deoxyribonucleoside—e. g., 2\u0001-deoxyadeno- sine (dA, not shown). In the cell, the 5\u0001OH group of the sugar component of the nucleo- side is usually esterified with phosphoric acid. 2\u0001-Deoxythymidine (dT) therefore gives rise to 2\u0001-deoxythymidine-5\u0001-monophosphate (dTMP), one of the components of DNA (2). If the 5\u0001phosphate residue is linked via an acid–anhydride bond to additional phosphate residues, it yields nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates—e. g., ADP and ATP, which are important coenzymes in energy metabo- lism (see p.106). All of these nucleoside phos- phates are classified as nucleotides. In nucleosides and nucleotides, the pentose residues arepresent in thefuranoseform (see p. 34). The sugars and bases are linked by an N-glycosidic bond between the C-1 of the sugar and either the N-9 of the purine ring or N-1 of the pyrimidine ring. This bond al- ways adopts the β-configuration. C. Oligonucleotides, polynucleotides \u0002 Phosphoric acid molecules can form acid–an- hydride bonds with each other. It is therefore possible for two nucleotides to be linked via the phosphate residues. This gives rise to di- nucleotides with a phosphoric acid–anhydride structure. This group includes the coenzymes NAD(P) + and CoA, as well as the flavin derivative FAD (1;see p.104). If the phosphate residue of a nucleotide reacts with the 3\u0001-OH group of a second nu- cleotide, the result is a dinucleotide with a phosphoric acid diester structure.Dinucleo- tides ofthis typehavea free phosphateresi- due at the 5\u0001 end and a free OH group at the 3\u0001 end. They can therefore be extended with additional mononucleotides by adding fur- ther phosphoric acid diester bonds. This is the way in which oligonucleotides,and ulti- mately polynucleotides, are synthesized. Polynucleotides consisting of ribonucleo- tide components are called ribonucleic acid (RNA),while thoseconsistingof deoxyribonu- cleotide monomers are called deoxyribonu- cleic acid (DNA;see p. 84). To describe the structure of polynucleotides, the abbrevia- tions for the nucleoside components are writ- ten from left to right in the 5\u0001\u00013\u0001 direction. The position of the phosphate residue is also sometimes indicated by a “p”. In this way, the structure of the RNA segment shown Fig. 2 can be abbreviated as ..pUpG.. or simply as ..

The bases the contain are mainly uracil, cytosine, adenine, and guanine, but many unusual and modified bases are also found in RNAs (B). A. Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) \u0002 RNAs areinvolved inall theindividualsteps of gene expression and protein biosynthesis (see pp. 242–253). The properties of the most im- portant forms of RNA are summarized in the table. The schematic diagram also gives an idea of the secondary structure of these mol- ecules. In contrast to DNA, RNAs do not form ex- tended double helices. In RNAs, the base pairs (see p. 84) usually only extend over a few residues. For this reason, substructures often arise that have a finger shape or clover-leaf shape in two-dimensional representations. In these, the paired stem regions are linked by loops. Large RNAs such as ribosomal 16S- rRNA (center) contain numerous “stem and loop” regions of this type. These sections are again folded three-dimensionally—i. e., like proteins, RNAs have a tertiary structure (see p. 86). However, tertiary structures are only known of small RNAs, mainly tRNAs. The dia- grams in Fig. B and on p. 86 show that the “clover-leaf” structure is not recognizable in a three-dimensional representation. Cellular RNAs vary widely in their size, structure, and lifespan. The great majority of them are ribosomal RNA (rRNA),which in severalforms is a structuraland functional component of ribosomes (see p. 250). Riboso- mal RNA is produced from DNA by transcrip- tion in the nucleolus, and it is processed there and assembled with proteins to form ribo- some subunits (see pp. 208, 242). The bacte- rial 16S-rRNA shown in Fig. A,with 1542 nu- cleotides (nt), is a component of the small ribosomae subunit, while the much smaller 5S-rRNA (118 nt) is located in the large sub- unit. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) transfer genetic information from the cell nucleus to the cyto- plasm. The primary transcripts are substan- tially modified while still in the nucleus (mRNA maturation; see p. 246). Since mRNAs have to be read codon by codon in the ribo- some, they must not form a stable tertiary structure. This is ensured in part by the at- tachment of RNA-binding proteins, which pre- vent base pairing. Due to the varying amounts of information that they carry, the lengths of mRNAs also vary widely. Their lifespan is usu- ally short, as they are quickly broken down after translation. Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are involved in the splicing of mRNA precursors (see p. 246). They associate with numerous pro- teins to form “spliceosomes.” B. Transfer RNA (tRNAPhe) \u0002 The transfer RNAs (tRNAs) function during translation (see p. 250) as links between the nucleic acids and proteins. They are small RNA molecules consisting of 70–90 nucleoti- des, which “recognize” specific mRNA codons with their anticodons through base pairing. At thesametime, at their 3\u0001 end (sequence .. CCA-3\u0001) they carry the amino acid that is assigned to the relevant mRNA codon accord- ing to the genetic code (see p. 248). Thebase sequenceand thetertiarystruc- ture of the yeast tRNA specific for phenylala- nine (tRNA Phe)is typical of alltRNAs. The molecule (see also p. 86) contains a high pro- portion of unusual and modified components (shaded in dark green in Fig. 1). These include pseudouridine (Ψ), dihydrouridine (D), thymi- dine (T), which otherwise only occurs in DNA, andmanymethylatednucleotides such as 7- methylguanidine (m 7G) and—in the anti- codon—2\u0001-O-methylguanidine (m2G). Numer- ous base pairs, sometimes deviating from the usual pattern, stabilize the molecule’s confor- mation (2). 82 Biomolecules 3' 5' 3'5' 3' 5' 3' 5' 3' 5' * 3' 5' * * * * * * * PheA C G U C A C U A A GA AC C GUUCCU G GAG C G U A Y Y G A A U C C AG A C G GA GC AG G G D D G A CU C GA U U U A G G C G G C T C U A G C Y Phe 3' 5' NH C N C C C N HC N O O CH2O H OOH H HH NH CH3 1' 3' O N O CH2O H OH H HH C NH C H2C H2C O O O C O CH2O H OH H HH C NH C HN HC O O 5' NH C N C C C N HC N O O CH2O H OOCH3 H HH NH2 A.

DNA: structure \u0001 Like RNAs (see p. 82), deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs) are polymeric molecules consisting of nucleotide building blocks. Instead of ribose, however, DNA contains 2\u0001-deoxyribose, and the uracil base in RNA is replaced by thymine. Thespatial structureof the two molecules also differs (see p. 86). The first evidence of the special structure of DNA was the observation that the amounts of adenine and thymine are almost equal in every type of DNA. The same applies to gua- nine and cytosine. The model of DNA struc- ture formulated in 1953 explains these con- stant base ratios: intact DNA consists of two polydeoxynucleotide molecules (“strands”). Each base in one strand is linked to a comple- mentary base in the other strand by H-bonds. Adenine is complementary to thymine, and guanine is complementary to cytosine. One purine base and one pyrimidine base are thus involved in each base pair. The complementarity of A with T and of G with C can be understood by considering the H bonds that arepossiblebetween thediffer- ent bases. Potential donors (see p. 6) are amino groups (Ade, Cyt, Gua) and ring NH groups. Possible acceptors are carbonyl oxy- gen atoms (Thy, Cyt, Gua) and ring nitrogen atoms. Two linear and therefore highly stable bonds can thus be formed in A–T pairs, and three in G–C pairs. Base pairings of this type are only possible, however, when the polarity of the two strands differs—i. e., when they run in opposite direc- tions (see p. 80). In addition, the two strands have to be intertwined to form a double helix. Due to steric hindrance by the 2\u0001-OH groups of theriboseresidues, RNA is unable to form a double helix. The structure of RNA is therefore less regular than that of DNA (see p. 82). The conformation of DNA that predomi- nates within the cell (known as B-DNA)is shown schematically in Fig. A2 and as a van der Waals model in Fig. B1.In the schematic diagram (A2), the deoxyribose–phosphate “backbone” is shown as a ribbon. The bases (indicated by lines) are located on the inside of the double helix. This area of DNA is there- fore apolar. By contrast, the molecule’s surface is polar and negatively charged, due to the sugar and phosphate residues in the back- bone. Along the whole length of the DNA molecule, there are two depressions—re- ferred to as the “minor groove” and the “ma- jor groove”—that lie between the strands. B. Coding of genetic information \u0001 In all living cells, DNA serves to store genetic information.Specific segments of DNA (“genes”) are transcribed as needed into RNAs, which either carry out structural or catalytic tasks themselves or provide the basis for synthesizing proteins (see p. 82). In the latter case, the DNA codes for the primary structure of proteins. The “language” used in this process has four letters (A, G, C, and T). All of the words (“codons”) contain three letters (“triplets”), and each triplet stands for one of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids. Thetwo strands ofDNA arenot function- ally equivalent. The template strand (the (–) strand or “codogenic strand,” shown in light gray in Fig. 1) is the one that is read during the synthesis of RNA (transcription; see p. 242). Its sequence is complementary to the RNA formed. The sense strand (the (+) strand or “coding strand,” shown in color in Figs. 1 and 2)has the same sequence as the RNA, except that T is exchanged for U. By convention, it is agreed that gene sequences are expressed by reading the sequence of the sense strand in the 5\u0001\u00013\u0001 direction. Using the genetic code (see p. 248), in this case the protein sequence (3) is obtained directly in the reading direc- tion usual for proteins—i. e., from the N termi- nus to the C terminus. 84 Biomolecules Phe Tyr Ala Thr Glu Glu Met 1. 2. 3.

Fig. A shows various con- formations of DNA, and Fig. B shows the spa- tial structures of two small RNA molecules. In both, the van der Waals models (see p. 6) are accompanied by ribbon diagrams that make the course of the chains clear. In all of the models, the polynucleotide “backbone” of the molecule is shown in a darker color, while the bases are lighter. A. DNA: conformation \u0003 Investigations of synthetic DNA molecules have shown that DNA can adopt several dif- ferent conformations. All of the DNA seg- ments shown consist of 21 base pairs (bp) and have the same sequence. By far the most common form is B-DNA (2). As discussed on p. 84, this consists of two antiparallel polydeoxynucleotide strands in- tertwined with one another to form a right- handed double helix. The “backbone” of these strandsisformedby deoxyribose and phos- phate residues linked by phosphoric acid di- ester bonds. In the B conformation, the aromatic rings of the nucleobases are stacked at a distance of 0.34 nm almost at right angles to the axis of the helix. Each base is rotated relative to the preceding one by an angle of 35°. A complete turn of the double helix (360°) therefore con- tains around 10 base pairs (abbreviation: bp), i. e., the pitch of the helix is 3.4 nm. Between thebackbones of thetwo individual strands there are two grooves with different widths. The major groove is visible at the top and bottom, while the narrower minor groove is seen in the middle. DNA-binding proteins and transcription factors (see pp. 118, 244) usually enter into interactions in the area of the major groove, with its more easily accessible bases. In certain conditions, DNA can adopt the A conformation (1). In this arrangement, the double helix is still right-handed, but the bases are no longer arranged at right angles to the axis of the helix, as in the B form. As can be seen, the A conformation is more compact than the other two conformations. The minor groove almost completely disappears, and the major groove is narrower thaninthe B form. A-DNA arises when B-DNA is dehydrated. It probably does not occur in the cell. In the Z-conformation (3), which can occur within GC-rich regions of B-DNA, the organ- ization of the nucleotides is completely differ- ent. In this case, the helix is left-handed, and thebackboneadopts a characteristic zig-zag conformation (hence “Z-DNA”). The Z double helix has a smaller pitch than B-DNA. DNA segments in the Z conformation probably have physiological significance, but details are not yet known. B. RNA \u0003 RNA molecules are unable to form extended double helices, and are therefore less highly ordered than DNA molecules. Nevertheless, they have defined secondary and tertiary structures, and a large proportion of the nu- cleotide components enter into base pairings with other nucleotides. The examples shown here are 5S-rRNA (see p. 242), which occurs as a structural component in ribosomes, and a tRNA molecule from yeast (see p. 82) that is specific for phenylalanine. Both molecules are folded in such a way that the 3\u0001 end and the 5\u0001 end are close to- gether. Asin DNA, most of the basesare lo- cated in the inside of the structures, while the much more polar “backbone” is turned out- wards. An exception to this is seen in the three bases of the anticodon of the tRNA (pink), which have to interact with mRNA and therefore lie on the surface of the mole- cule. The bases of the conserved CCA triplet at the 3\u0001 end (red) also jut outward. During amino acid activation (see p. 248), they are recognized and bound by the ligases. 86 Biomolecules 5'3' 5'3' 5' 3' 5' 3' 5' 3' 5' 3' 5' 3' 5'3' A. DNA: conformation B. RNA 1. A - DNA 2.

The orderly course of metabolic processes is only possible because each cell is equipped with its own genetically determined set of enzymes. It is only this that allows coordinated sequences of reactions (metabolic pathways;see p.112). Enzymes are also involved in many regulatory mechanisms that allow the metabolism to adapt to changing conditions (see p.114). Al- most all enzymes are proteins.However, there are also catalytically active ribonucleic acids, the “ribozymes” (see pp. 246, 252). A. Enzymatic activity \u0001 The catalytic action of an enzyme, its activity, is measured by determining the increase in the reaction rate under precisely defined con- ditions—i. e., the difference between the turn- over (violet) of the catalyzed reaction (or- ange) and uncatalyzed reaction (yellow) in a specific time interval. Normally, reaction rates are expressed as the change in concentration per unit of time (mol 1 –1 s–1;see p. 22). Since the catalytic activity of an enzyme is independent of the volume, the unit used for enzymes is usually turnover per unit time, expressed in katal (kat, mol s –1). However, the international unit U is still more com- monly used (µmol turnover min –1;1 U = 16.7 nkat). B. Reaction and substrate specificity \u0001 The action of enzymes is usually very specific. This applies not only to the type of reaction being catalyzed (reaction specificity), but also to the nature of the reactants (“substrates”) that are involved (substrate specificity;see p. 94). In Fig. B, this is illustrated schemati- cally using a bond-breaking enzyme as an example. Highly specific enzymes (type A, top) catalyze the cleavage of only one type of bond, and only when the structure of the substrate is the correct one. Other enzymes (type B, middle) have narrow reaction specif- icity, but broad substrate specificity. Type C enzymes (with low reaction specificity and low substrate specificity, bottom) are very rare. C. Enzyme classes \u0002 More than 2000 different enzymes are cur- rently known. A system of classification has been developed that takes into account both their reaction specificity and their substrate specificity. Each enzyme is entered in the En- zyme Catalogue with a four-digit Enzyme Commission number (EC number). The first digit indicates membership of one of the six major classes. The next two indicate sub- classes and subsubclasses. The last digit indi- cates where theenzymebelongs in thesub- subclass. For example, lactate dehydrogenase (see pp. 98–101) has the EC number 1.1.1.27 (class 1, oxidoreductases; subclass 1.1, CH–OH group as electron donor; sub-subclass 1.1.1, NAD(P) + as electron acceptor). Enzymes with similar reaction specificities are grouped into each of the six major classes: The oxidoreductases (class 1) catalyze the transfer of reducing equivalents from one re- dox system to another. The transferases (class 2) catalyze the transfer of other groups from one molecule to another. Oxidoreductases and transferases generally require coenzymes (see pp.104ff.). The hydrolases (class 3) are also involved in group transfer, but the acceptor is always a water molecule. Lyases (class 4, often also referred to as “synthases”) catalyze reactions involving ei- ther the cleavage or formation of chemical bonds, with double bonds either arising or disappearing. The isomerases (class 5)movegroups within a molecule, without changing the gross composition of the substrate. The ligation reactions catalyzed by ligases (“synthetases,” class 6) are energy-dependent and are therefore always coupled to the hy- drolysis of nucleoside triphosphates. In addition to the enzyme name, we also usually give its EC number. The annotated enzyme list (pp. 420ff.) includes all of the en- zymes mentioned in this book, classified ac- cording to the Enzyme Catalog system. 88 Metabolism 89Enzymes + + Ared + + A–B A–B B–OH + A A–B Iso-A X PP P P P X P ++ ++ B A XTP X=A,G,U,C XDP A–B Aox A A–H Box C H2O B A Bred B–C C B A A BBBB C C C C C C C C = Reduction equivalent A.

They can increase therateofa catalyzed re- action by a factor of 10 12 or more. To grasp the mechanisms involved in enzyme catalysis, we can start by looking at the course of an un- catalyzed reaction more closely. A.

In solution, reactants A and B are surrounded by a shell of water molecules (the hydration shell), and they move in ran- dom directions due to thermal agitation. They can only react with each other if they collide in a favorable orientation. This is not very probable, and therefore only occurs rarely. Before conversion into the products C + D, the collision complex A-B hasto passthrough a transition state, the formation of which usu- ally requires a large amount of activation energy, Ea (see p. 22). Since only a few A–B complexescan producethisamountof en- ergy, a productive transition state arises even less often than a collision complex. In solution, a large proportion of the activation energy is required for the removal of the hy- dration shells between A and B. However, charge displacements and other chemical processes within the reactants also play a role. As a result of these limitations, conver- sion only happens occasionally in the absence of a catalyst, and the reaction rate v is low, even when the reaction is thermodynamically possible—i. e., when ∆G<0 (see p. 18). B. Enzyme-catalyzed reaction \u0002 Shown here is a sequential mechanism in which substrates A and B are bound and prod- ucts C and D are released, in that order. An- other possible reaction sequence, known as the “ping-pong mechanism,” is discussed on p. 94. Enzymes are able to bind the reactants (their substrates) specifically at the active cen- ter. In the process, the substrates are oriented in relation to each other in such a way that they take on the optimal orientation for the formation of the transition state (1–3). The proximity and orientation of the substrates therefore strongly increase the likelihood that productive A–B complexes will arise. In addition, binding of the substrates results in removal of their hydration shells. As a result of the exclusion of water, very different con- ditions apply in the active center of the en- zyme during catalysis than in solution (3–5). A third important factor is the stabilization of the transition state as a result of interactions between the amino acid residues of the pro- tein and the substrate (4). This further re- duces the activation energy needed to create the transition state. Many enzymes also take up groups from the substrates or transfer them to the substrates during catalysis. Proton transfers are particularly common. This acid–base catalysis by enzymes is much more effective than the exchange of protons between acids and bases in solution. In many cases, chemical groups are temporarily bound covalently to the amino acid residues of the enzyme or to coenzymes during the catalytic cycle. This effect is referred to as covalent catalysis (see the transaminases, for example; p.178). The principles of enzyme catalysis sketched out here are discussed in greater detail on p.100 using the example of lactate dehydrogenase. C. Principles of enzyme catalysis \u0002 Although it is dif cult to provide quantitative estimates of the contributions made by indi- vidual catalytic effects, it is now thought that the enzyme’s stabilization of the transition state is the most important factor. It is not tight binding of the substrate that is impor- tant, therefore—this would increase the acti- vation energy required by the reaction, rather than reducing it—but rather the binding of the transition state. This conclusion is supported by the very high af nity of many enzymes for analogues of the transition state (see p. 96). A simple mechanical analogy may help clarify this (right). To transfer the metal balls (the reactants) from location EA (the substrate state) via the higher-energy transition state to EP (the product state), the magnet (the catalyst) has to be orientated in such a way that its attractive force acts on the transition state (bottom) rather than on EA (top). 90 Metabolism C + + BA D C D A B A X Y Z B X Y Z X Y Z YX Z C X Y Z D C EPEA EPEA Ea G acc b d X Y Z X Y Z A.

It is therefore more complex than the kinetics of an uncata- lyzed reaction (see p. 22). Here we discuss these issues using the example of a simple first-order reaction (see p. 22) A. Michaelis–Menten kinetics \u0002 In the absence of an enzyme, the reaction rate v is proportional to the concentration of sub- stance A (top). The constant k is the rate con- stant of the uncatalyzed reaction. Like all cat- alysts, the enzyme E (total concentration [E]t) creates a new reaction pathway. Initially, A is bound to E (partial reaction 1, left). If this reaction is in chemical equilibrium, then with the help of the law of mass action—and taking into account the fact that [E]t =[E] + [EA]—one can express the concentration [EA] of the enzyme–substrate complex as a func- tion of [A] (left). The Michaelis constant Km thus describes the state of equilibrium of the reaction. In addition, we know that kcat >k—in other words, enzyme-bound substrate reacts to B much faster than A alone (partial reaction 2, right). kcat,the enzyme’s turnover number, corresponds to the number of substrate mol- ecules converted by one enzyme molecule per second. Like the conversion A \u0001 B, the forma- tion of B from EA is a first-order reaction—i. e., v = k [EA] applies. When this equation is combined with the expression already de- rived for EA, the result is the Michaelis– Menten equation. In addition to the variables vand [A], the equation also contains two parameters that do not depend on the substrate concentration [A], but describe properties of the enzyme itself: the product kcat [E]g is the limiting valuefor the reaction rateata very high [A], the maximum velocity Vmax of the reaction (recommended abbreviation: V). The Michae- lis constant Km characterizes the af nity of the enzyme for a substrate. It corresponds to the substrate concentration at which v reaches half of Vmax (if v = Vmax/2, then [A]/(Km + [A]) = 1/2, i. e. [A] is then = Km). A high af nity of theenzymefor a substrate thereforeleads to a low Km value, and vice versa. Of the two enzymes whose substrate saturation curves are shown in diagram 1, enzyme 2 has the higher af nity for A [Km = 1 mmol l –1); Vmax, by contrast, is much lower than with enzyme 1. Since v approaches V asymptotically with increasing values of [A], it is dif cult to obtain reliable values for Vmax—and thus for Km as well—from diagrams plotting v against [A]. To get around this, the Michaelis–Menten equa- tion can be arranged in such a way that the measured points lie on a straight line. In the Lineweaver–Burk plot (2),1/v is plotted against 1/[A]. The intersections of the line of best fit with the axes then produce 1/Vmax and—1/Km. This type of diagram is very clear, but for practical purposes it is less suitable for determining Vmax and Km. Calculation meth- ods using personal computers are faster and more objective. B. Isosteric and allosteric enzymes \u0002 Many enzymes can occur in various conforma- tions (see p. 72), which have different catalytic properties and whose proportion of the total number of enzyme molecules is influenced by substrates and other ligands (see pp.116 and 280, for example). Allosteric enzymes of this type, which are usually present in oligomeric form, can be recognized by their S-shaped (sigmoidal) saturation curves, which cannot be described using the Michaelis model. In thecaseofisosteric enzymes (with only one enzyme conformation, 1), the ef ciency of substrate binding (dashed curve) declines constantly with increasing [A], because the number of free binding sites is constantly decreasing. In most allosteric enzymes (2), the binding ef ciency initially rises with in- creasing [A], because the free enzyme is present in a low-af nity conformation (square symbols), which is gradually con- verted into a higher-af nity form (round sym- bols) as a result of binding with A. It is only at high [A] values that a lack of free binding sites becomes noticeable and the binding strength decreases again. In other words, the af nity of allosteric enzymesisnot constant, but de- pends on the type and concentration of the ligand. 92 Metabolism 0 90 100 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 [A] v = Km · + [A] kcat [E]g EAE + A [EA] = [E]g [A] Km + [A] kcat v = kcat · [EA] [EA] E + B AB Km EA kcat A E E Km -0.5-1.0108426 95 10 8 4 2 0 6 1.0 0.8 0.4 0.2 0.0 0.6 Vmax Km -1/Km 1/Vmax 1/VmaxVmax Km 010515 20 0 10515 20 -1/Km v = k · [A] · [A] O.5Km VmaxVmax Vmax = kcat · [E]g (mol · l-1· s-1) Uncatalyzed reaction Concentration [A] (mM)Velocity v 1.

These factors include physical quantities (temperature, pressure), the chemical properties of the solution (pH value, ionic strength), and the concentrations of the relevant substrates, cofactors, and in- hibitors. A. pH and temperature dependency of enzyme activity \u0002 The effect of enzymes is strongly dependent on the pH value (see p. 30). When the activity is plotted against pH, a bell-shaped curve is usually obtained (1). With animal enzymes, the pH optimum—i. e., the pH value at which enzyme activity is at its maximum—is often close to the pH value of the cells (i. e., pH 7). However, there are also exceptions to this. For example, the proteinase pepsin (see p. 270), which is active in the acidic gastric lumen, has a pH optimum of 2, while other enzymes (at least in the test tube) are at their most active at pH values higher than 9. The bell shape of the activity–pH profile results from the fact that amino acid residues with ioniz- able groups in the side chain are essential for catalysis. In example (1), these are a basic group B (pKa = 8), which has to be protonated in order to become active, and a second acidic amino acid AH (pKa =6), which isonly active in a dissociated state. At the optimum pH of 7, around 90% of both groups are present in the active form; at higher and lower values, one or the other of the groups increasingly passes into the inactive state. The temperature dependency of enzymatic activity is usually asymmetric. With increas- ing temperature, the increased thermal movement of the molecules initially leads to a rate acceleration (see p. 22). At a certain temperature, the enzyme then becomes un- stable, and its activity is lost within a narrow temperature difference as a result of denatu- ration (see p. 74). The optimal temperatures of the enzymes in higher organisms rarely ex- ceed 50 °C, while enzymes from thermophilic bacteria found in hot springs, for instance, may still be active at 100 °C. B. Substrate specificity \u0002 Enzymes “recognize” their substrates in a highly specific way (see p. 88). It is only the marked substrate specificity of the enzymes that makes a regulated metabolism possible. This principle can be illustrated using the ex- ample of the two closely related proteinases trypsin and chymotrypsin.Both belong to the group of serine proteinases and contain the same “triad” of catalytically active residues (Asp–His–Ser, shown here in green; see p.176). Trypsin selectively cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of basic amino acids (lysine and arginine), while chymotryp- sin is specific for hydrophobic residues. The substrate binding “pockets” of both enzymes have a similar structure, but their amino acid sequences differ slightly. In trypsin, a nega- tively charged aspartate residue (Asp-189, red) is arranged in such a way that it can bind and fix the basic group in the side chain of the substrate. In chymotrypsin, the “bind- ing pocket” is slightly narrower, and it is lined with neutral and hydrophobic residues that stabilize the side chains of apolar substrate amino acids through hydrophobic interac- tions (see p. 28). C. Bisubstrate kinetics \u0003 Almost all enzymes—in contrast to the sim- plified description given on p. 92—have more than one substrate or product. On the other hand, it is rare for more than two substrates to be bound simultaneously. In bisubstrate reac- tions of the type A + B \u0001 C+ D, anumber of reaction sequences are possible. In addition to the sequential mechanisms (see p. 90), in which all substrates are bound in a specific sequence before the product is released, there are also mechanisms in which the first sub- strate A is bound and immediately cleaved. A part of this substrate remains bound to the enzyme, and is then transferred to the second substrate B after the first product C has been released. Thisisknown as the ping-pong mechanism, and it is used by transaminases, for example (see p.178). In the Lineweaver— Burk plot (right; see p. 92), it can be recog- nized in the parallel shifting of the lines when [B] is varied. 1.0 0.8 0.4 0.2 0.0 0.6 45 6 7 8 9 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 02 4 X Y Z YX Z A B P2 X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z 1 2 {B} 1.0 0.8 0.4 0.2 0.0 0.6 BH + A - BH + AH BH + A - B A - A -BH + P1 A. pH and temperature dependency of enzyme activityActivity pH Temperature (°C) Enzyme active Enzyme denatured Denaturation Increased activity due to temperature increase Proportion BH Proportion A B.

Enzyme inhibitors are particularly important here. A large proportion of medicines act as enzyme inhibitors. Enzyme- kinetic experiments are therefore an impor- tant aspect of drug development and testing procedures. Natural metabolites are also in- volved in regulatory processes as inhibitors (see p.114). A. Types of inhibitor \u0002 Most enzyme inhibitors act reversibly—i. e., they do not cause any permanent changes in the enzyme. However, there are also irrever- sible inhibitors that permanently modify the target enzyme. The mechanism of action of an inhibitor—its inhibition type—can be deter- mined by comparing the kinetics (see p. 92) of the inhibited and uninhibited reactions (B). This makes it possible to distinguish compet- itive inhibitors (left) from noncompetitive inhibitors (right), for example. Allosteric inhibition is particularly important for meta- bolic regulation (see below). Substrate analogs (2) have properties sim- ilar to those of one of the substrates of the target enzyme. They are bound by the en- zyme, but cannot be converted further and therefore reversibly block some of the enzyme molecules present. A higher substrate concen- tration is therefore needed to achieve a half- maximum rate; the Michaelis constant Km increases (B). High concentrations of the sub- strate displace the inhibitor again. The max- imum rate Vmax is therefore not influenced by this type of inhibition. Because the substrate and the inhibitor compete with one another for the same binding site on the enzyme, this type of inhibition is referred to as compe- titive. Analogs of the transition state (3)usu- ally also act competitively. When an inhibitor interacts with a group that is important for enzyme activity, but does not affect binding of the substrate, the inhi- bition is non-competitive (right). In this case, Km remains unchanged, but the concentration of functional enzyme [E]t,and thus Vmax,de- crease. Non-competitive inhibitors generally act irreversibly, by modifying functional groups of the target enzyme (4). “Suicide substrates” (5)are substrateana- logs that also contain a reactive group. Ini- tially, they bind reversibly, and then they form a covalent bond with the active center of the enzyme. Their effect is therefore also non-competitive. A well-known example of this is the antibiotic penicillin (see p. 254). Allosteric inhibitors bind to a separate binding site outside the active center (6). This results in a conformational change in the enzyme protein that indirectly reduces its activity (see p. 116). Allosteric effects prac- tically only occur in oligomeric enzymes. The kinetics of this type of system can no longer be described using the simple Micha- elis–Menten model. B. Inhibition kinetics \u0002 In addition to the Lineweaver–Burk plot (see p. 92), the Eadie–Hofstee plot is also com- monly used. In this case, the velocity v is plotted against v /[A]. In this type of plot, Vmax corresponds to the intersection of the approximation lines with the v axis, while Km is derived from the gradient of the lines. Competitive and non-competitive inhibitors are also easily distinguishable in the Eadie— Hofstee plot. As mentioned earlier, competi- tive inhibitors only influence Km, and not Vmax. The lines obtained in the absence and presence of an inhibitor therefore intersect on the ordinate. Non-competitive inhibitors pro- duce lines that have the same slope (Km un- changed) but intersect with the ordinate at a lower level. Another type of inhibitor, not shown here, in which Vmax and Km are re- duced by the same factor, is referred to as uncompetitive. Inhibitors with purely uncom- petitive effects are rare. A possible explana- tion for this type of inhibition is selective binding of the inhibitor to the EA complex. Allosteric enzymes shift the target en- zyme’s saturation curve to the left (see p. 92). In Eadie–Hofstee and Lineweaver–Burk plots (see p. 92), allosteric enzymes are recog- nizable because they produce curved lines (not shown). 96 Metabolism 10 8 4 2 0 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 10 8 4 2 0 010 20 80 90 100 6 6 6. 1.

A. Lactate dehydrogenase: structure \u0003 The active form of lactate dehydrogenase (mass 144 kDa) is a tetramer consisting of four subunits (1). Each monomer is formed by a peptide chain of 334 amino acids (36 kDa). In the tetramer, the subunits occupy equivalent positions (1); each mono- mer has an active center. Depending on met- abolic conditions, LDH catalyzes NADH-de- pendent reduction of pyruvate to lactate, or NAD +-dependent oxidation of lactate to pyru- vate (see p. 18). The active center of an LDH subunit is shown schematically in Fig. 2. The peptide backbone is shown as a light blue tube. Also shown are the substrate lactate (red), the coenzyme NAD + (yellow), and three amino acid side chains (Arg-109,Arg-171,and His- 195; green), which are directly involved in the catalysis. A peptide loop (pink) formed by amino acid residues 98–111 is also shown. In the absence of substrate and coenzyme, this partial structure is open and allows access to the substrate binding site (not shown). In the enzyme lactate NAD+ complex shown, the peptideloop closes the activecenter. Thecat- alytic cycle of lactate dehydrogenase is dis- cussed on the next page. B. Isoenzymes \u0002 There are two different LDH subunits in the organism—M and H—which have a slightly different amino acid sequence and conse- quently different catalytic properties. As these two subunits can associate to form tetramers randomly, a total of five different isoenzymes of LDH are found in the body. Fig. 1 shows sections from the amino acid sequences of the two subunits, using the sin- gle-letter notation (see p. 60). A common pre- cursor gene was probably duplicated at some point in evolution. The two genes then con- tinued to develop further independently of each other through mutation and selection. The differences in sequence between the M and H subunits are mainly conservative—i. e., both residues are of the same type, e. g. gly- cine (G) and alanine (A), or arginine (R) and lysine (K). Non-conservative exchanges are less frequent—e. g., lysine (K) for glutamine (Q), or threonine (T) for glutamic acid (E). Overall, the H subunit contains more acidic and fewer basic residues than the M form, and it therefore has a more strongly negative charge. This fact is exploited to separate the isoenzymes using electrophoresis (2;see pp. 78, 276). The isoenzyme LDH-1, consisting of four H subunits, migrates fastest, and the M4 isoenzyme is slowest. The separation and analysis of isoenzymes in blood samples is important in the diagnosis of certain diseases. Normally, only small amounts of enzyme activity are found in se- rum. When an organ is damaged, intracellular enzymes enter the blood and can be demon- strated in it (serum enzyme diagnosis). The total activity of an enzyme reflects the se- verity ofthe damage,while thetypeof iso- enzyme foundin the bloodprovidesevidence of the site of cellular injury, since each of the genes is expressed in the various organs at different levels. For example, the liver and skeletal muscles mainly produce M subunits of lactate dehydrogenase (M for muscle), while the brain and cardiac muscle mainly express H subunits (H for heart). In conse- quence, each organ has a characteristic isoen- zyme pattern (3). Following cardiac infarction, forexample,there is a strongincrease inthe amount of LDH-1 in the blood, while the con- centration of LDH-5 hardly changes. The iso- enzymes of creatine kinase (see p. 336) are also of diagnostic importance. 98 Metabolism RYLMGERLGVHPLSCHGWVLGEHGDSSVPVWSGMNVAGCSLKTLHPDL GTD..

A. Lactate dehydrogenase: catalytic cycle \u0003 LDH catalyzes the transfer of hydride ions (see p. 32) from lactate to NAD+ or from NADH to pyruvate. L-lactate + NAD + ↔pyruvate + NADH + H + The equilibrium of the reaction strongly fa- vors lactate formation.Athigh concentrations of lactate and NAD +, however, oxidation of lactateto pyruvateis also possible(see p.18). LDH catalyzes the reaction in both di- rections, but—like all enzymes—it has no ef- fect on chemical equilibrium. As the reaction is reversible, the catalytic process can be represented as a closed loop. The catalytic cycle of LDH is reduced to six “snapshots” here. Intermediate steps in catal- ysis such as thoseshown here areextremely short-lived and therefore dif cult to detect. Their existence was deduced indirectly from a large number of experimental findings—e. g., kinetic and binding measurements. Many amino acid residues play a role in the active center of LDH. They can mediate the binding of the substrate and coenzyme, or take part in one of the steps in the catalytic cycle directly. Only the side chains of three particularly important residues are shown here. The positively charged guanidinium group of arginine-171 binds the carboxylate group of the substrate by electrostatic inter- action. The imidazole group of histidine-195 is involved in acid–base catalysis, and the side chain of arginine-109 is important for the sta- bilization of the transition state. In contrast to His-195, which changes its charge during cat- alysis, the two essential arginine residues are constantly protonated. In addition to these three residues, the peptide loop 98–111 men- tioned on p. 98 is also shown here schemati- cally (red). Its function consists of closing the active center after binding of the substrate and coenzyme, so that water molecules are largely excluded during the electron transfer. We can now look at the partial reactions involved in LDH-catalyzed pyruvate reduc- tion. In thefreeenzyme, His195 is protonated (1). This form of the enzyme is therefore de- scribed as E H +.The coenzyme NADH is bound first (2), followed by pyruvate (3). It is important that the carbonyl group of the pyruvate in theenzymeand theactivesitein the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme should have a fairly optimal position in relation to each other, and that this orientation should become fixed (proximity and orientation of the substrates). The 98–111 loop now closes over theactivecenter. This produces a marked decrease in polarity, which makes it easier to achieve the transition state (4; water ex- clusion). In the transition state, a hydride ion, H – (see p. 32), is transferred from the coen- zyme to the carbonyl carbon (group transfer). The transient—and energetically unfavora- ble—negative charge on the oxygen that oc- curs here is stabilized by electrostatic inter- action with Arg-109 (stabilization of the tran- sition state). At thesametime, a proton from His-195 is transferred to this oxygen atom (group transfer), giving rise to the enzyme- bound products lactate and NAD + (5). After the loop opens, lactate dissociates from the enzyme, and the temporarily uncharged imi- dazole group in His-195 again binds a proton from the surrounding water (6). Finally, the oxidized coenzyme NAD + is released, and the initial state (1) is restored. As the diagram shows, the proton that appears in the reaction equation (NADH + H +) is not bound together with NADH, but after release of the lacta- te—i. e., between steps (5)and (6)of the previous cycle. Exactly the same steps occur during the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate, but in the opposite direction. As mentioned earlier, the direction which the reaction takes depends not on the enzyme, but on the equilibrium state—i. e., on the concentrations of all the reactants and the pH value (see p. 18). 100 Metabolism E .

In biological material—e. g., in body fluids—even tiny quantities of an en- zyme can be detected by measuring its cata- lytic activity. However, enzymes are also used as reagents to determine the concentrations of metabolites—e. g., the blood glucose level (C). Most enzymaticanalysisproceduresuse the method of spectrophotometry (A). A. Principle of spectrophotometry \u0003 Many substances absorb light in the visible or ultraviolet region of the spectrum. This prop- erty can be used to determine the concentra- tion of such a substance. The extent of light absorption depends on the type and concen- tration of the substance and on the wave- length of the light used. Monochromatic light—i. e., light with a defined wavelength isolated from white light using a monochrom- ator—is therefore used. Monochromatic light with an intensity of I0 is passed through a rectangular vessel made of glass or quartz (a cuvet), which contains a solution of the ab- sorbing substance. The absorption A of the solution (often also referred to as its extinc- tion)is defined as the negative decadic loga- rithm of the quotient I/I0. The Beer–Lambert law states that A is proportional to the con- centration c of the absorbing substance and the thickness d of the solution it passes through. As mentioned earlier, the absorption coef•cient ε depends on the type of substance and the wavelength. B. Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase activity \u0003 Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity takes advantage of the fact that while the reduced coenzyme NADH + H + absorbs lightat340 nm,oxidized NAD + does not. Ab- sorption spectra (i. e., plots of A against the wavelength) for the substrates and the coen- zymes of the LDH reaction are shown in Fig. 1. Differences in absorption behavior between NAD + and NADH between 300 and 400 nm result from changes in the nicotinamide ring during oxidation or reduction (see p. 32). To measure the activity, a solution containing lactate and NAD + is placed in a cuvet, and absorption is recorded at a constant wavelength of 340 nm. The uncatalyzed LDH reaction is very slow. It is only after addition of theenzymethat measurablequantities of NADH are formed and absorption increases. Since according to the Beer–Lambert law the rate of the increase in absorption ∆A/∆tis proportional to the reaction rate ∆c/∆t. The absorption coef cient ε at 340 nm or compar- ison with a standard solution can be used to calculate LDH activity. C. Enzymatic determination of glucose \u0003 Most biomolecules do not show any absorp- tion in the visible or ultraviolet spectrum. In addition, they are usually present in the form of mixtures with other—similar—compounds that would also react to a chemical test pro- cedure. These two problems can be avoided by using an appropriate enzyme to produce a colored dye selectively from the metabolite that is being analyzed. The absorption of the dye canthenbe measured. Aprocedure (1)thatis often used to mea- sure glucose when monitoring blood glucose levels (see p. 160) involves two successive re- actions. The glucose-specific enzyme glucose oxidase (obtained from fungi) first produces hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, which in the second step—catalyzed by a peroxidase—oxidizes a colorless precursor into a green dye (2). When all of the glucose in the sample has been used up, the amount of dye formed— which can be measured on the basis of its light absorption—is equivalent to the quantity of glucose originally present. 102 Metabolism ∆A 0 2010 O2 H2O22 H2O 240 280 320 360 400 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 ∆t 0 ∆A NAD 0 1. 2. ∆c ; ; ∆A ∆c ∆t · ε ∆t v= = A = –log I = ε .c.d d 0 ε ∆A = I A.

Coenzymes: definitions \u0001 In many enzyme-catalyzed reactions, elec- trons or groups of atoms are transferred from one substrate to another. This type of reaction always also involves additional mol- ecules, which temporarily accept the group being transferred. Helper molecules of this type are called coenzymes. As they are not catalytically active themselves, the less fre- quently used term “cosubstrate” would be more appropriate. In contrast to substrates for which a given enzyme is usually specific (see p. 88), coenzymes cooperate with many enzymes of varying substrate specificity. We have rather arbitrarily divided the coenzymes here into group-transferring and redox coen- zymes. Strictly speaking, redox coenzymes also transfer groups—namely, reducing equiv- alents (see p. 32). Depending on the type of interaction with the enzyme, a distinction is made between soluble coenzymes and prosthetic groups. Soluble coenzymes (1)are bound like substrates during a reaction, undergo a chem- ical change, and are then released again.The original form of the coenzyme is regenerated by a second, independent reaction. Prosthetic groups (2), on the other hand, are coenzymes that are tightly bound to the enzyme and re- main associated with it during the reaction. Thepartof the substratebound by thecoen- zyme is later transferred to another substrate or coenzyme of the same enzyme (not shown in Fig. 2). B. Redox coenzymes 1 \u0002 All oxidoreductases (see p. 88) require coen- zymes. The most important of these redox coenzymes are shown here. They can act in soluble form (S) or prosthetically (P). Their normal potentials E 0\u0001 are shown in addition to the type of reducing equivalent that they transfer (see p. 18). The pyridine nucleotides NAD + and NADP+ (1) are widely distributed as coenzymes of dehydrogenases. They transport hydride ions (2e – and 1 H +; see p. 32) and always act in soluble form. NAD + transfers reducing equiv- alents from catabolic pathways to the respi- ratory chain and thus contributes to energy metabolism. In contrast, reduced NADP+ is the most important reductant involved in biosyn- thesis (see p. 112). The flavin coenzymes FMN and FAD (2, 3) contain flavin (isoalloxazine) as a redox-active group. This is a three-membered, N-contain- ingringsystem that can accept a maximum of two electrons and two protons during reduc- tion. FMN carries the phosphorylated sugar alcohol ribitol at the flavin ring. FAD arises from FMN through bonding with AMP. The two coenzymes are functionally similar. They are found in dehydrogenases, oxidases, and monooxygenases.In contrastto the pyri- dine nucleotides, flavin reactions give rise to radical intermediates (see p. 32). To prevent damage to cell components, the flavins al- ways remain bound as prosthetic groups in theenzymeprotein. Theroleof ubiquinone (coenzyme Q, 4)in transferring reducing equivalents in the res- piratory chain is discussed on p. 140. During reduction, the quinone is converted into the hydroquinone (ubiquinol). The isoprenoid side chain of ubiquinone can have various lengths. It holds the molecule in the membrane, where it is freely mobile. Similar coenzymes are also found in photosynthesis (plastoquinone; see p. 132). Vitamins E and K (see p. 52) also be- long to the quinone/hydroquinone systems. L-Ascorbic acid (vitamin C, 5)is a powerful reducing agent. As an antioxidant,it provides nonspecific protection against oxidative dam- age (see p. 284), but it is also an essential cofactor for various monooxygenases and di- oxygenases. Ascorbic acid is involved in the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues during the biosynthesis of collagen (see p. 344), in the synthesis of catecholamines (see p. 352) and bile acids (see p. 314), as well as in the breakdown of tyrosine (see p. 415). Thereduced form of thecoenzyme is a relatively strong acid and forms salts, the ascorbates. The oxidized form is known as dehydroascorbic acid. The stimulation of theimmunesystem caused byascorbicacid has not yet been fully explained. 104 Metabolism L –0.32 L N A N A P N A N A P 2[H] OH OH ab c d 1. 2.

Redox coenzymes 2 \u0002 In lipoic acid (6), an intramolecular disulfide bond functionsasa redox-active structure. As a result of reduction, it is converted into the corresponding dithiol. As a prosthetic group, lipoic acid is usually covalently bound to a lysine residue (R) of the enzyme, and it is then referred to as lipoamide. Lipoamide is mainly involved in oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxo acids (see p. 134). The peptide coenzyme glutathione is a similar disulfide/ dithiol system (not shown; see p. 284). Iron–sulfur clusters (7)occur as prosthetic groups in oxidoreductases, but they are also found in lyases—e. g., aconitase (see p. 136) and other enzymes. Iron–sulfur clusters con- sist of 2–4 iron ions that are coordinated with cysteine residues of the protein (–SR) and with anorganic sulfide ions (S). Structures of this type are only stable in the interior of proteins. Depending on the number of iron and sulfide ions, distinctions are made be- tween [Fe2S2], [Fe3S4], and [Fe4S4]clusters. These structures are particularly numerous in the respiratory chain (see p. 140), and they are found in all complexes except com- plex IV. Heme coenzymes (8)withredox functions exist in the respiratory chain (see p. 140), in photosynthesis (see p. 128), and in monooxy- genases and peroxidases (see p. 24). Heme- containing proteins with redox functions are also referred to as cytochromes.In cyto- chromes, in contrast to hemoglobin and myo- globin, the iron changes its valence (usually between +2 and +3). There are several classes of heme (a, b, and c), which have different types of substituent – R1 to – R 3.Hemoglobin, myoglobin, and the heme enzymes contain heme b. Two types of heme a are found in cytochrome c oxidase(seep. 132), while heme c mainly occurs in cytochrome c,where it is covalently bound with cysteine residues of the protein part via thioester bonds. B. Group-transferring coenzymes 1 \u0002 The nucleoside phosphates (1) are not only precursors for nucleic acid biosynthesis; many of them also have coenzyme functions. They serve for energy conservation, and as a result of energetic coupling (see p. 124) also allow endergonic processes to proceed. Metabolites are often made more reactive (“activated”) as a result of the transfer of phosphate residues (phosphorylation). Bonding with nucleoside diphosphate residues (mainly UDP and CDP) provides activated precursors for polysac- charides and lipids (see p. 110). Endergonic formation of bonds by ligases (enzyme class 6) also depends on nucleoside triphosphates. Acyl residues are usually activated by transfer to coenzyme A (2). In coenzyme A (see p. 12), pantetheine is linked to 3\u0001-phos- pho-ADP by a phosphoric acid anhydride bond. Pantetheine consists of three compo- nents connected by amide bonds—pantoic acid, -alanine,and cysteamine. The latter two components are biogenic amines formed by the decarboxylation of aspartate and cysteine, respectively. The compound formed from pantoic acid and β−alanine (pantothenic acid) has vitamin-like characteristics for hu- mans (see p. 368). Reactions between the thiol group of the cysteamine residue and carboxylic acids give rise to thioesters,such as acetyl CoA. This reaction is strongly ender- gonic, and it is therefore coupled to exergonic processes. Thioesters represent the activated form of carboxylic acids, because acyl residues of this type have a high chemical potential and are easily transferred to other molecules. This property is often exploited in metabo- lism. Thiamine diphosphate (TPP, 3), in coopera- tion with enzymes, is able to activate alde- hydes or ketones as hydroxyalkyl groups and then to pass them on to other molecules. This type of transfer is important in the transketo- lase reaction, for example (see p. 152). Hy- droxyalkyl residues also arise in the decar- boxylation of oxo acids. In this case, they are released as aldehydes or transferred to lipo- amide residues of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases (see p. 134). The functional component of TPP is the sulfur- and nitrogen-containing thiazole ring. 106 Metabolism P 3+ 2+ 1e P 2[H] S S HS SH B-Rib B-Rib- TPP A S N PP P P B-Rib- PP P 1eP Fe S FeS SFe SFeRS RS SR Fe Fe S S RS RS SR SR SS HC C H2 CH SS HC C H2 CH HH N H O NN NN Fe3+ CH3 R3 CH3R1 H3C R2 AB DC COOCOO O HH OH OH H CH2 Base OPO O O PO O O PO O O C N O CH2 H CH2 SH CH2 C N O CH2 H CH2 S CH2 C CH3 O N H CC O C H OH CH2 CH3 CH3 OPO O O P O OO CH2 O HHH OOH H N N N HC N NH2 P O OO H NS H3CCH2 C NSCH2 H3CCH2 CH2O N N H3CNH2 R OHH PP NN NN Fe 2+ CH3 R3 CH3R1 H3C R2 AB DC COOCOO [Fe2S2][Fe4S4] n+ m+ ox. red.

Group-transferring coenzymes 2 \u0002 Pyridoxal phosphate (4)is the most important coenzyme in amino acid metabolism. Its role in transamination reactions is discussed in detail on p. 178. Pyridoxal phosphate is also involved in other reactions involving amino acids, such as decarboxylations and dehydra- tions. The aldehyde form of pyridoxal phos- phate shown here (left) is not generally found in free form. In the absence of substrates, the aldehyde group is covalently bound to the ε- amino group of a lysine residue as aldimine (“Schiff’s base”). Pyridoxamine phosphate (right) is an intermediate of transamination reactions. It reverts to the aldehyde form by reacting with 2-oxoacids (see p. 178). Biotin (5)is the coenzyme of the carboxy- lases. Like pyridoxal phosphate, it has an amide-type bond via the carboxyl group with a lysine residue of the carboxylase. This bond is catalyzed by a specific enzyme. Using ATP, biotin reacts with hydrogen carbonate (HCO3–)to form N-carboxybiotin . From this activated form, carbon dioxide (CO2)is then transferred to other molecules, into which a carboxyl group is introduced in this way. Ex- amples of biotindependent reactions of this type include the formation of oxaloacetic acid from pyruvate (see p. 154) and the synthesis of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA (see p. 162). Tetrahydrofolate (THF, 6)is a coenzyme that can transfer C1 residues in different oxi- dation states. THF arises from the vitamin folic acid (see p. 366) by double hydrogenation of the heterocyclic pterin ring. The C1 units being transferred are bound to N-5, N-10, or both nitrogen atoms. The most important de- rivatives are: a) N 5-formyl-THF and N 10-formyl-THF,in which the formyl residue has the oxidation state of a carboxylic acid; b) N5-methylene-THF,with a C1 residue in theoxidation stateof an aldehyde; and c) N 5-methyl-THF,in which themethyl group has the oxidation state of an alcohol. C1 units transferred by THF play a role in the synthesis of methionine (see p. 412), pu- rine nucleotides (see p. 188), and dTMP (see p. 190), for example. Due to the central role of THF derivatives in the biosynthesis of DNA precursors, the enzymes involved in THF me- tabolism are primary targets for cytostatic drugs (see p. 402). The cobalamins (7) are the chemically most complex form of coenzyme. They also repre- sent the only natural substances that contain the transition metal cobalt (Co) as an essential component. Higher organisms are unable to synthesize cobalamins themselves, and are therefore dependent on a supply of vitamin B12 synthesized by bacteria (see p. 368). The central component of the cobalamins is the corrin ring, a member of the tetrapyr- roles, at the center of which the cobalt ion is located. The end of one of the side chains of the ring carries a nucleotide with the unusual base dimethylbenzimidazole. The ligands for the metal ion are the four N atoms of the pyrrole ring, a nitrogen from dimethylbenzi- midazole, and a group X, which is organo- metallically bound—i. e., mainly covalently. In methylcobalamin,X is a methyl group. This compound functions as a coenzyme for several methyltransferases, and among other things is involved in the synthesis of methio- nine from homocysteine (see p. 418). How- ever, in human metabolism, in which methio- nine is an essential amino acid, this reaction does not occur. Adenosylcobalamin (coenzyme B12)carries a covalently bound adenosyl residue at the metal atom. This is a coenzyme of various isomerases, which catalyze rearrangements following a radical mechanism. The radical arises here through homolytic cleavage of the bond between the metal and the adenosyl group. The most important reaction of this type in animal metabolism is the rearrange- ment of methylmalonyl-CoA to form succinyl- CoA, which completes the breakdown of odd- numbered fatty acids and of the branched amino acids valine and isoleucine (see pp. 166 and 414). 108 Metabolism 109Enzymes Activated metabolites Many coenzymes (see pp. 104ff.) serve to ac- tivate molecules or groups that are poorly reactive. Activation consists of the formation of reactive intermediate compounds in which the group concerned is located at a higher chemical potential and can therefore be transferred to other molecules in an exer- gonic reaction (see p. 124). Acetyl-CoA is an exampleofthis typeofcompound (seep. 12). ATP and the other nucleoside triphosphate coenzymes not only transfer phosphate resi- dues, but also provide the nucleotide compo- nents for this type of activation reaction. On this page, we discuss metabolites or groups that are activated in the metabolism by bond- ing with nucleosides or nucleotides. Inter- mediates of this type are mainly found in the metabolism of complex carbohydrates and lipids. A. Activated metabolites \u0002 1. Uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPglucose) The inclusion of glucose residues into poly- mers such as glycogen or starches is an ender- gonic process. The activation of the glucose building blocks that is required for this takes places in several steps, in which two ATPs are used per glucose. After the phosphorylation of free glucose, glucose 6-phosphate is isomer- ized to glucose 1-phosphate (a), reaction with UTP (b) then gives rise to UDPglucose, in which the anomeric OH group at C-1 of the sugar is bound with phosphate. This “energy- rich” compound (an acetal phosphate) allows exergonic transfer of glucose residues to gly- cogen (c; see pp. 156, 408) or other acceptors. 2. Cytidine diphosphate choline (CDPcholine) The amino alcohol choline is activated for in- clusion in phospholipids following a similar principle (see p. 170). Choline is first phos- phorylated by ATP to form choline phosphate (a), which by reaction with CTP and cleavage of diphosphate, then becomes CDPcholine. In contrast to (1), it is not choline that is trans- ferred from CDPcholine, but rather choline phosphate, which with diacylglycerol yields phosphatidylcholine (lecithin). 3. Phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS) Sulfate residues occur as strongly polar groups in various biomolecules—e. g., in gly- cosaminoglycans (see p. 346) and conjugates of steroid hormones and xenobiotics (see p. 316). In the synthesis of the “activated sul- fate” PAPS, ATP first reacts with anorganic sulfate to form adenosine phosphosulfate (APS, a). This intermediate already contains the “energy-rich” mixed anhydride bond be- tween phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid. In the second step, the 3\u0001-OH group of APS is phosphorylated, with ATP being used again. After transfer of the sulfate residue to OH groups (c), adenosine-3\u0001,5\u0001-bisphosphate re- mains. 4. S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) The coenzyme tetrahydrofolate (THF) is the main agent by which C1 fragments are trans- ferred in the metabolism. THF can bind this type of group in various oxidation states and pass it on (see p. 108). In addition, there is “activated methyl,” in the form of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). SAM is involved in many methylation reactions—e. g., in creatine syn- thesis (see p. 336), the conversion of norepi- nephrine into epinephrine (see p. 352), the inactivation of norepinephrine by methyla- tion of a phenolic OH group (see p. 316), and in the formation of the active form of the cytostatic drug 6-mercaptopurine (see p. 402). SAM is derived from degradation of the proteinogenic amino acid methionine,to whichthe adenosyl residue ofanATP mole- cule is transferred. After release of the acti- vated methyl group, S-adenosyl homocys- teine (SAH) is left over. This can be converted back into methionine in two further steps. Firstly, cleavage of the adenosine residue gives rise to the non-proteinogenic amino acid homocysteine,to which a methylgroup is transferred once again with the help of N5- methyl-THF (see p. 418). Alternatively, homo- cysteine canalso be brokendownintopro- pionyl-CoA. 110 Metabolism THF PP U A PPP PP U A PPP PP C P C P P P A A PPP P P A P P A P A S R A A S R THF PGlc Glc P Glc PP Glc Glc U PPP C PPP PP PP A PPP A PPP H3C 3 CH3 SO3O O3S OH O3S SO4 2 PP A a b c a b c d a b c a b c P P CH3 O P O OOPO O O CH2 O N C NH C HC HC NH2 O H OH OH H HH NH3C(CH2)2 CH3 CH3 O P O O O HO OH OH H CH2HO H H H H OPO O O CH2 O N C NH C HC HC O O H OH OH H HH N CH N C C C N HC N N O CH2O H OOH H HH HH P O O OSO O O P O OO N C N C C C N C N N O CH2S H OH OH H HH H HH H H3C CH2 CH2 CH3N COO H A.

The chemical compounds involved in this are known as metabolites.Outside of the cell, almost all of the chemical changes in metabolites would only take place very slowly and without any specific direction. By contrast, organized sequences of chemical re- actions with a high rate of throughput, known as metabolic pathways, become possible through the existence of specific enzymes (see p. 88). A. Intermediary metabolism: overview \u0001 A number of central metabolic pathways are common to most cells and organisms. These pathways, which serve for synthesis, degra- dation, and interconversion of important me- tabolites, and also for energy conservation, are referred to as the intermediary metabo- lism. In order to survive, all cells constantly re- quire organic and inorganic nutrients,as well as chemical energy, which is mainly derived from ATP (see below). Depending on the way in which these needs are satisfied, organisms can be classified into autotrophic and hetero- trophic groups. The autotrophs,which in- clude plants and many microorganisms, can synthesize organic molecules from inorganic precursors (CO2). An autotrophic lifestyle is possible through photosynthesis,for exam- ple (see p. 128). The heterotrophs—e. g., ani- mals and fungi—depend on organic substan- ces supplied in their diet. The schema shown on this page provides an overview of animal metabolism. The polymeric substances contained in the diet (proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids—top) cannot be used by the organism directly. Digestive processes first have to de- grade them to monomers (amino acids, sug- ars, nucleotides). These are then mostly bro- kendownby catabolic pathways (pink ar- rows) into smaller fragments. The metabolites produced in this way (generally referred to as the “metabolite pool”) are then either used to obtain energy through further catabolic con- version, or are built up again into more com- plex molecules by anabolic pathways (blue arrows). Of the numerous metabolites in the pool, only three particularly important repre- sentatives—pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, and gly- cerol—are shown here. These molecules represent connecting links between the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. The metabolite pool also includes the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (6). This cyclic pathway has both catabolic and anabolic functions—i. e., it is amphibolic (vio- let; see p. 138). Waste products from the degradation of organic substances in animal metabolism include carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and ammonia (NH3). In mammals, the toxic substance ammonia is incorporated into urea andexcretedin thisform (see p. 182). The most important form of storage for chemical energy in all cells is adenosine triphosphate (ATP, see p. 122). ATP synthesis requires energy—i. e., the reaction is ender- gonic. Conversely, cleavage of ATP into ADP and phosphate releases energy. Exergonic hy- drolysis of ATP, as a result of energetic coupling (see p. 16), makes energy-depend- ent (endergonic)processes possible. For ex- ample, most anabolic pathways, as well as movement and transport processes, are en- ergy-dependent. The most important pathway for the syn- thesis of ATP is oxidative phosphorylation (see p. 122). In this process, catabolic path- ways first form reduced cofactors (NADH+H +, QH2,ETFH2). Electrons are then transferred from these compounds to oxygen. This strongly exergonic process is catalyzed by the respiratory chain andusedindirectlyfor the ATP synthesis (see p. 140). In anaerobic conditions—i. e., in the absence of oxygen— most organisms can fall back on ATP that arises in glycolysis (3). This less ef cient type of ATP synthesis is referred to as fermen- tation (see p. 146). While NADH exclusively supplies oxidative phosphorylation, NADPH+H +—a very similar coenzyme—is the reducing agent for anabolic pathways. NADPH + H + is mainly formed in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP, 1;see p. 152). 112 Metabolism 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 4 5 7 P 2 6 3 Proteins Nucleic acids Fats Iso- prenoids Amino acids Pentoses Fatty acids Bases Glycerol ATP NADPH NADH Other biosyn- theses NADH ETF NH3 ATP H2O CO2Urea Catabolic pathway Anabolic pathway Amphibolic pathway Pentose phosphate pathway Gluconeogenesis Glycolysis β-Oxidation Fatty acid biosynthesis Tricarboxylic acid cycle Urea cycle Waste products Lipids Food Poly- saccharides Storage compoundNADH QH2 Pyruvate Acetyl CoA Glucose A. Intermediary metabolism: overview O2 Oxidative phospho- rylation 113Metabolic Regulation Regulatory mechanisms A. Fundamental mechanisms of metabolic regulation \u0002 The activities of all metabolic pathways are subject to precise regulation in order to adjust the synthesis and degradation of metabolites to physiological requirements. An overview of the regulatory mechanisms is presented here. Further details are shown on pp. 116ff. Metabolite flow along a metabolic pathway is mainly determined by the activities of the enzymes involved (see p. 88). To regulate the pathway, it is suf cient to change the activity of the enzyme that catalyzes the slowest step in the reaction chain. Most metabolic path- ways have key enzymes of this type on which the regulatory mechanisms operate. The ac- tivity of key enzymes is regulated at three independent levels: Transcriptional control. Here, Biosynthesis of the enzyme protein is influenced at the genetic level (1). Interventions in enzyme synthesis mainly affect synthesis of the cor- responding mRNA—i. e., transcription of the gene coding for the enzyme. The term “tran- scriptional control” is therefore used (see pp. 118, 244). This mechanism is mediated by regulatory proteins (transcription factors) that act directly on DNA. The genes have a special regulatory segment for this purpose, known as the promoter region, which contains bind- ing sites (control elements) for regulatory proteins. The activity of these proteins is, in turn, affected by metabolites or hormones. When synthesis of a protein is increased by transcriptional control, the process is referred to as induction; when it is reduced or sup- pressed, it is referred to as repression.Induc- tion and repression processes take some time and are therefore not immediately effective. Interconversion of key enzymes (2)takes effect considerably faster than transcriptional control. In this case, the enzyme is already present at its site of effect, but it is initially still inactive. It is only when needed that it is converted into the catalytically active form, after signaling and mediation from second messengers (see p. 120) through an activating enzyme (E1). If the metabolic pathway is no longer required, an inactivating enzyme (E2) returns the key enzyme to its inactive resting state. Interconversion processes in most cases involve ATP-dependent phosphorylation of theenzymeprotein by a protein kinase or dephosphorylation of it by a protein phospha- tase (see p. 120). The phosphorylated form of thekey enzyme is usually themoreactive one, but the reverse may also occur. Modulation by ligands. An important vari- able that regulates flow through a metabolic pathway is precursor availability (metabolite A in the case shown here). The availability of precursor A increases along with the activity of the metabolic pathways that form A (3)and it decreases with increasing activity of other pathways that also consume A (4). Transport from one cell compartment to another can also restrict the availability of A. Coenzyme availability can also often have a limiting effect (5). If thecoenzymeis regen- erated by a second, independent metabolic pathway, the speed of the second pathway can limit that of the first one. For example, glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle are mainly regulated by the availability of NAD+ (see p. 146). Since NAD+ is regenerated by the respiratory chain, the latter indirectly con- trols the breakdown of glucose and fatty acids (respiratory control, see p. 144). Finally, the activity of key enzymes can be regulated by ligands (substrates, products, coenzymes, or other effectors), which as allo- steric effectors do notbindatthe active center itself, but at another site in the enzyme, thereby modulating enzyme activity (6;see p. 116). Key enzymes are often inhibited by immediate reaction products, by end prod- ucts of the reaction chain concerned (“feed- back” inhibition), or by metabolites from com- pletely different metabolic pathways. The precursors for a reaction chain can stimulate their own utilization through enzyme activa- tion. 114 Metabolism P R H H H P P A A ZC P 6 2 1 5 4 A PP P 3 BA A Z A.

Allosteric effects are mediated by the substrate itself or by inhibitors and activators (allosteric effectors, seep. 114). Thelatterbind at special sites outside the active center, pro- ducing a conformational change in the en- zyme protein and thus indirectly lead to an alteration in its activity. A. Aspartate carbamoyltransferase: reaction \u0003 ACTase catalyzes the transfer of a carbamoyl residue from carbamoyl phosphate to the amino group of L-aspartate. The N-carbamoyl L-aspartate formed in this way already con- tains all of the atoms of the later pyrimidine ring (see p. 188). The ACTase of the bacterium Escherichia coli is inhibited by cytidine tri- phosphate (CTP), an end product of the ana- bolic metabolism of pyrimidines, and is ac- tivated by the precursor ATP. B. Kinetics \u0002 In contrast to the kinetics of isosteric (normal) enzymes, allosteric enzymes such as ACTase have sigmoidal (S-shaped) substrate satura- tion curves (see p. 92). In allosteric systems, the enzyme’s af nity to the substrate is not constant, but depends on the substrate con- centration [A]. Instead of the Michaelis con- stant Km (see p. 92), the substrate concentra- tion at half-maximal rate ([A]0.5)is given. The sigmoidal character of the curve is described by the Hill coef•cient h. In isosteric systems, h = 1, and h increases with increasing sig- moidicity. Depending on the enzyme, allosteric effec- tors can influence the maximum rate Vmax, the semi-saturation concentration [A]0.5,and the Hill coef cient h. If it is mainly Vmax that is changed, the term “Vsystem”is used. Much more common are “Ksystems”, in which al- losteric effects only influence [A]0.5 and h. The K type also includes ACTase. The inhib- itor CTP in this case leads to right-shifting of thecurve,withanincreasein [A]0.5 and h (curve II). By contrast, the activator ATP causes a left shift; it reduces both [A]0.5 and h (curve III). This type of allosteric effect was first observed in hemoglobin (see p. 280), which can be regarded as an “honorary” en- zyme. C. R and T states \u0003 Allosteric enzymes are almost always oligo- mers with 2–12 subunits. ACTase consists of six catalytic subunits (blue) and six regulatory subunits (yellow). The latter bind the allo- steric effectors CTP and ATP. Like hemoglobin, ACTase can also be present in two conforma- tions—the less active Tstate (for “tense”) and the more active Rstate (for “relaxed”). Sub- strates and effectors influence the equili- brium between the two states, and thereby give rise to sigmoidal saturation behavior. With increasing aspartate concentration, the equilibrium is shifted more and more toward the R form. ATP also stabilizes the R confor- mation by binding to the regulatory subunits. By contrast, binding of CTP to the same sites promotes a transition to the T state. In the case of ACTase, the structural differences be- tween the R and T conformations are partic- ularly dramatic. In T \u0001 Rconversion, the cat- alytic subunits separate from one another by 1.2 nm, and the subunits also rotate around the axis of symmetry. The conformations of the subunits themselves change only slightly, however. D. Structure of a dimer \u0003 The subunits of ACTase each consist of two domains—i. e., independently folded partial structures. The N-terminal domain of the reg- ulatory subunit (right) mediates interaction with CTPorATP (green). A second, Zn 2+-con- taining domain (Zn 2+ showninlight blue) establishes contact with the neighboring cat- alytic subunit. Between the two domains of the catalytic subunit lies the active center, which is occupied here by two substrate ana- logs (red). 116 Metabolism C PP P COO CH2 H3N C H COO NH2 PO C H2N O C C HN H CH2 COO COO P A PP P CTP UMP P CTP ATP III I II 5 4 3 2 1 00.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 6 7 [A]0.5 C1 C3 C4 C6 R1 R'1 R'1 C1 C3 C4 C6 R1 R'2 R2 C2 C5 R3 C2 C5 R'2 R2 Substrate Catalytic subunit ATP/CTP-binding domain Regulatory subunit N-Carbamoyl L-aspartateN-Carbamoyl– L-Aspartate Aspartate carbamoyl- transferase 2.1.3.2 [ Zn2 ] ATP (CTP) A.

Functioning of regulatory proteins \u0002 Regulatory proteins (transcription factors) are involved in controlling gene expression in all cells. These regulatory proteins bind to spe- cific DNA sequences and thereby activate or inhibit the transcription of genes (Tran- scription control). The effects of transcription factors are usually reversible and are often controlled by ligands or by interconversion. The nomenclature for transcription factors is confusing. Depending on their mode of ac- tion, various terms are in use both for the proteins themselves and for the DNA sequen- ces to which they bind. If a factor blocks tran- scription, it is referred to as a repressor;oth- erwise, it is called an inducer. DNA sequences to which regulatory proteins bind are referred to as control elements. In prokaryotes, control elements that serve as binding sites for RNA polymerases are called promoters, whereas repressor-binding sequences are usually called operators. Control elements that bind activating factors are termed enhancers, while elements that bind inhibiting factors are known as silencers. The numerous regulatory proteins that are known can be classified into four different groups (1–4), based on their mechanisms of action. Negative gene regulation—i. e., switching off of the gene concerned—is car- ried out by repressors. Some repressors only bind to DNA (1a) in the absence of specific ligands (L). In this case, the complex between the repressor and the ligand loses its ability to bind to the DNA, and the promoter region becomes accesible for binding of RNA poly- merase (1b). It is often the free repressor that does not bind to the DNA, so that transcrip- tion is only blocked in the presence of the ligand (2a, 2b). A distinction between two different types of positive gene regulation canbe made inthe same way. If it is only the free inducer that binds, then transcription is inhibited by the appropriate ligand (3). Conversely, many inducers only become ac- tive when they have bound a ligand (4). This group includes the receptors for steroid hor- mones, for example (see p. 378). B. Lactose operon \u0003 The well-investigated lactose operon of the bacterium Escherichial coli can be used here as an example of transcriptional control. The lac operon is a DNA sequence that is simul- taneously subject to negative and positive control. The operon contains the structural genes for three proteins that are required for the utilization of lactose (one transporter and two enzymes), as well as control elements that serveto regulatethe operon. Since lactose is converted to glucose in the cell, there is no point in expressing the genes if glucose is already available. And indeed, the genes are in fact only transcribed when glu- cose is absent and lactose is present (3). This is achieved by interaction between two regula- tory proteins. In the absence of lactose, the lac repressor blocks the promoter region (2). When lactose is available, it is converted into allolactose, which binds to the repressor and thereby detaches it from the operator (3). However, this is still not suf cient for the transcription of the structural genes. For bind- ingofthe RNApolymeraseto takeplace,an inducer—the catabolite activator protein (CAP)—is required, which only binds to the DNA when it is present as a complex with 3,5\u0001-cyclo-AMP (cAMP; see p. 386). cAMP, a signal for nutrient deficiency, is only formed by E. coli in the absence of glucose. The interaction between the CAP–cAMP complex and DNA is shown in Fig. 4.Each subunit of the dimeric inducer (yellow or or- ange) binds one molecule of cAMP (red). Con- tact with the DNA (blue) is mediated by two “recognition helices” that interact with the majorgrooveofthe DNA. Thebending of the DNA strandcausedbyCAP hasfunctional sig- nificance. Transcription control is much more com- plex in eukaryotes (see p. 244). The number of transcription factors involved is larger, and in addition the gene activity is influenced by the state of the chromatin (see p. 238). 118 Metabolism L L L L 1a 1b 2a 2b 3a 3b 4a 4b CAP 1. 2. 3. 5' 3' O CH2 O H OOH H HH P O O RNA poly- merase DNA Gen Repressor Negative regulation Without ligand With ligand mRNA Ligand RNA poly- merase Inducer Positive regulation Without ligand Promoter B.

Functions of regulatory proteins Adenin 119Metabolic Regulation Hormonal control In higher organisms, metabolic and other processes (growth, differentiation, control of the internal environment) are controlled by hormones (see pp. 370ff.) A. Principles of hormone action \u0001 Depending on the type of hormone, hormone signals are transmitted to the target cells in different ways. Apolar (lipophilic) hormones penetrate the cell and act in the cell nucleus, while polar (hydrophilic) hormones act on the external cell membrane. Lipophilic hormones, which include the steroid hormones, thyroxine, and retinoic acid, bind to a specific receptor protein inside their target cells. The complex formed by the hormone and the receptor then influences transcription of specific genes in the cell nu- cleus (seepp. 118, 244). Thegroup of hydro- philic hormones (see p. 380) consists of hor- mones derived from amino acids, as well as peptide hormones and proteohormones. Their receptors are located in the plasma membrane. Binding of the hormone to this type of receptor triggers a signal that is trans- mitted to the interior of the cell, where it controls the processes that allow the hor- mone signal to take effect (signal transduc- tion; see pp. 384ff.) B. Hormonal regulation of glucose metabolism in the liver \u0002 The liver plays a major role in glucose homeo- stasis in the organism (see p. 310). If glucose deficiency arises, the liver releases glucose into the blood, and when blood sugar levels are high, it takes glucose up from the blood and converts it into different metabolites. Several hormones from both groups are in- volved in controlling these processes. A very simplified versionofthe way inwhich they work is presented here. Glycogen is the form in which glucose is stored in the liver and muscles. The rate of glycogen synthesis is determined by glycogen synthase (bottom right), while its breakdown is catalyzed by glycogen phosphorylase (bottom left). Regulation by interconversion (bottom). If theblood glucoselevel falls, thepeptide hormone glucagon is released. This activates glycogen breakdown, releasing glucose, and at the same time inhibits glycogen synthesis. Glucagon binds to receptors in the plasma membrane (bottom left) and, with mediation by a G-protein (see p. 386), activates the enzyme adenylate cyclase, which forms the second messenger 3,5\u0001-cyclo-AMP (cAMP) from ATP. cAMP binds to another enzyme, protein kinase A (PK-A), and activates it. PK-A has several points of attack. Through phosphorylation, it converts the active form of glycogen synthase into the inactive form, thereby terminating the synthesis of glyco- gen. Secondly, it activates another protein kinase (not shown), which ultimately con- verts the inactive form of glycogen phosphor- ylase into the active form through phosphor- ylation. The active phosphorylase releases glu- cose 1-phosphate from glycogen, which after conversion into glucose 6-phosphate supplies free glucose. In addition, via an inhibitor (I) of protein phosphatase (PP), active PK-A inhibits inactivation of glycogen phosphorylase. When the cAMP level falls again, phosphoprotein phosphatases become active, which dephos- phorylate the various phosphoproteins in the cascade described, and thereby arrest glyco- gen breakdown and re-start glycogen synthe- sis. Activation and inactivation of proteins through phosphorylation or dephosphoryla- tion is referred to as interconversion. In contrast to glucagon, the peptide hormone insulin (see p. 76) increases glyco- gen synthesis and inhibits glycogen break- down. Via several intermediates, it inhibits protein kinase GSK-3 (bottom right; for de- tails, see p. 388) and thereby prevents inacti- vation of glycogen synthase. In addition, in- sulin reduces the cAMP level by activating cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). Regulation by transcriptional control (top). If the liver’s glycogen reserves have been ex- hausted, the steroid hormone cortisol main- tains glucose release by initiating the conver- sion of amino acids into glucose (gluconeo- genesis; see p. 154). In the cell nucleus, the complex of cortisol and its receptor (see p. 378) binds to the promoter regions of var- ious key enzymes of gluconeogenesis and leads to their transcription. The active en- zymes are produced through translation of the mRNA formed. Control of the transcrip- tion of the gluconeogenesis enzyme PEP car- boxykinase is discussed on p. 244. 120 Metabolism H H H H HH P P I P P P A. Principles of hormone action B.

Cleavage of ATP is strongly exergonic. The energy this provides (∆G; see p. 16) is used to drive ender- gonic processes (such as biosynthesis and movementand transportprocesses) through energetic coupling (see p. 124). The other nu- cleoside triphosphate coenzymes (GTP,CTP,and UTP) have similar chemical properties to ATP, but they are used for different tasks in metab- olism (see p. 110). A. ATP: structure \u0002 In ATP, a chain of three phosphate residues is linked to the 5\u0001-OH group of the nucleoside adenosine(seep. 80).These phosphateresi- dues are termed α, β,and γ.The α phosphate is bound to ribose by a phosphoric acid ester bond. The linkages between the three phos- phate residues, on the other hand, involve much more unstable phosphoric acid anhy- dride bonds. Theactivecoenzyme is in fact generally a complex of ATP with an Mg2+ ion, which is coordinatively bound to the α and β phosphates (Mg2+ ATP 4–). However, the term “ATP” is usually used for the sake of simplicity. B. Hydrolysis energies \u0002 The formula for phosphate residues shown in Fig. A, with single and double bonds, is not an accurate representation of the actual charge distribution. In ATP, the oxygen atoms of all three phosphate residues have similarly strong negative charges (orange), while the phosphorus atoms represent centers of posi- tive charge. One of the reasons for the insta- bility of phosphoric anhydride bonds is the repulsion between these negatively charged oxygen atoms, which is partly relieved by cleavage of a phosphate residue. In addition, thefreephosphate anion formedbyhydroly- sis of ATP is better hydrated and more strongly resonance-stabilized than the corresponding residue in ATP. This also contributes to the strongly exergonic character of ATP hydroly- sis. In standard conditions, the change in free enthalpy ∆G0\u0001 (see p. 18) that occurs in the hydrolysis of phosphoric acid anhydride bonds amounts to –30 to –35 kJ mol –1 at pH 7. The particular anhydride bond of ATP that is cleaved only has a minor influence on ∆G0\u0001 (1–2). Even the hydrolysis of diphos- phate (also known as pyrophosphate; 4)still yields more than –30 kJ mol –1. By contrast, cleavage of the ester bond between ribose and phosphate only provides –9 kJ mol –1 (3). In the cell, the ∆G of ATP hydrolysis is sub- stantially larger, because the concentrations of ATP, ADP and Pi are much lower than in standard conditions and there is an excess of ATPoverADP (see p. 18). ThepHvalue and Mg2+ concentration also affect the value of ∆G. The physiological energy yield of ATP hydrol- ysis to ADP and anorganic phosphate (Pi)is probably around –50 kJ mol –1. C. Types of ATP formation \u0001 Only a few compounds contain phosphate residues with a group transfer potential (see p. 18) that is high enough to transfer them to ADP and thus allow ATP synthesis. Processes that raise anorganic phosphate to this type of high potential are called substrate level phos- phorylations (see p. 124). Reactions of this type take place in glycolysis (see p. 150) and in thetricarboxylic acid cycle(seep. 136). Another “energy-rich” phosphate compound is creatine phosphate, which is formed from ATP inmuscle and canregenerate ATP as needed (see p. 336). Most cellular ATP does not arise in the way described above (i. e., by transfer of phosphate residues from organic molecules to ADP), but rather by oxidative phosphorylation.This process takes place in mitochondria (or as light-driven phosphorylation in chloroplasts) and is energetically coupled to a proton gra- dient over a membrane. These H + gradients are established by electron transport chains and are used by the enzyme ATP synthase as a source of energy for direct linking of anor- ganic phosphate to ADP. In contrast to sub- strate level phosphorylation, oxidative phos- phorylation requires the presence of oxygen (i. e., aerobic conditions). 122 Metabolism -10 -20 -30 ∆G OI kJ · mol-1 βαγ Mg P P A A PP P P ATP H P P A A PP PP P P e N CH N C C C N HC N NH2 O CH2O H OH OH H HH P O O OPO O O P O O O αβγ P P P P + 4ATP P P PAdenosine+ 3AMP P PATP + 2ADPATP P + 1 321 A H O CH2O H OH H P O O OPO O O αβ A.

The most impor- tant metabolite of this type is adenosine tri- phosphate (ATP), which drives a large number of energy-dependent reactions via energetic coupling (see p. 16). A. Energetic coupling \u0002 The change in free enthalpy ∆G0 during hy- drolysis (see p. 18) has been arbitrarily se- lected as a measure of the group transfer potential of “energy-rich” compounds. How- ever, thisdoesnot mean that ATPisin fact hydrolyzed in energetically coupled reactions. If ATP hydrolysis and an endergonic process were simply allowed to run alongside each other, the hydrolysis would only produce heat, without influencing the endergonic process. For coupling, the two reactions have to be linked in such a way that a common intermediate arises. This connection is illus- trated here using the example of the gluta- mine synthetase reaction. Direct transfer of NH3 to glutamate is en- dergonic (∆G 0\u0001 =+14 kJ mol –1;see p. 18), and can therefore not take place. In the cell, the reaction is divided into two exergonic steps. First, the γ-phophate residue is trans- ferred from ATP to glutamate. This gives rise to an “energy-rich” mixedacidanhydride.In the second step, the phosphate residue from the intermediate is substituted by NH3,and glutamine and free phosphate are produced. Theenergybalance of thereaction asa whole (∆G 0\u0001 =–17 kJ mol –1) is the sum of the changes in free enthalpy of direct glutamine synthesis (∆G0\u0001 =14kJ mol –1)plus ATP hy- drolysis (∆G 0\u0001 =–31 kJ mol –1), although ATP has not been hydrolyzed at all. B. Substrate-level phosphorylation \u0002 As mentioned earlier (see p. 122), there are a few metabolites that transfer phosphate to ADP in an exergonic reaction and can there- fore form ATP. In ATP synthesis, anorganic phosphate or phosphate bound in an ester- like fashion is transferred to bonds with a high phosphate transfer potential. Reactions of this type are termed “substrate-level phos- phorylations,” as they represent individual steps within metabolic pathways. In the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehy- drogenation reaction, a step involved in gly- colysis (1;see also C), thealdehydegroup in glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is oxidized into a carboxyl group. During the reaction, an anor- ganic phosphate is also introduced into the product, producing a mixedacidanhy- dride—1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Phosphopyr- uvate hydratase (“enolase”, 2) catalyzes the elimination of water from 2-phosphoglycer- ate. In the enol phosphate formed (phosphoe- nol pyruvate), the phosphate residue—in con- trast to 2-phosphoglycerate—is at an ex- tremely high potential (∆G0\u0001 of hydrolysis: –62 kJ mol –1). A third reaction of this type is the formation of succinyl phosphate, which occurs in the tricarboxylic acid cycle as an individual step in the succinyl CoA ligase re- action. Here again, anorganic phosphate is introduced into a mixed acid anhydride bond to be transferred from there to GDP. Succinyl phosphate is only an intermediate here, and is not released by the enzyme. In the literature, the term “substrate level phosphorylation” is used inconsistently. Some authors use it to refer to reactions in which anorganic phosphate is raised to a high potential, while others use it for the subse- quent reactions, in which ATP or GTP is formed from the energy-rich intermediates. C. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase \u0003 The reaction catalyzed during glycolysis by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) is shown here in detail. Initially, the SH group of a cysteine residue of the enzyme is added to the carbonyl group of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (a). This inter- mediate is oxidized by NAD+ into an “en- ergy-rich” thioester (b). In the third step (c), anorganic phosphate displaces the thiol, and the mixed anhydride 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate arises. In this bond, the phosphate residue is at ahighenoughpotential for it to be trans- ferred to ADP in the next step (not shown; see p. 150). 124 Metabolism 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 a b c N A N A N A P P P P P N A A PP P P P P P P P P + H C RO S H H CRS OH CRS O S H CRO O C H COO (CH ) C O O NH 22 3 C H COO (CH ) C O NH NH 2 22 3 C H COO (CH ) C O O NH PHO O O 22 3 A PP P P P A 2 1 3 A.

In the field of tech- nology, this type of system would be called a condenser. Using the same principle, energy is also stored (“conserved”) at cell membranes. Themembranefunctions as an insulator; electrically charged atoms and molecules (ions)functionas charges. A. Electrochemical gradient \u0002 Although artificial lipid membranes are al- most impermeable to ions, biological mem- branes contain ion channels that selectively allow individual ion types to pass through (see p. 222). Whether an ion can cross this type of membrane, and if so in which direc- tion, depends on the electrochemical gra- dient—i. e., on the concentrations of the ion on each side of the membrane (the concen- tration gradient)and on the difference in the electrical potential between the interior and exterior, the membrane potential. The membrane potential of resting cells (resting potential;see p. 350) is –0.05to –0.09 V—i. e., there is an excess negative charge on the inner side of the plasma mem- brane. The main contributors to the resting potential are the two cations Na+ and K +,as well as Cl – and organic anions (1). Data on the concentrations of these ions outside and in- side animal cells, and permeability coef - cients, are shown in the table (2). The behavior of an ion type is described quantitatively by the Nernst equation (3). ∆ψG is themembranepotential (in volts, V) at which there is no net transport of the ion concerned across the membrane (equilibrium potential). The factor R T/F n has a value of 0.026 V for monovalent ions at 25 °C. Thus, for K +,the table (2)gives an equilibrium po- tential of ca. –0.09 V—i. e., a value more or less thesameas that of the resting potential.By contrast, for Na + ions, ∆ψG is much higher than the resting potential, at +0.07 V. Na + ions therefore immediately flow into the cell when Na + channels open (see p. 350). The disequilibrium between Na + and K+ ions is constantly maintained by the enzyme Na +/ K +-ATPase, which consumes ATP. B. Proton motive force \u0002 Hydronium ions (“H + ions”) can also develop electrochemical gradients. Such a proton gra- dient plays a decisive part in cellular ATP syn- thesis (see p. 142). As usual, the energy con- tent of the gradient depends on the concen- tration gradients—i. e., on the pH difference ∋pH between the two sides of the membrane. In addition, the membrane potential ∆ψ also makes a contribution. Together, these two values give the proton motive force ∆p, a measure for the work that the H + gradient can do. The proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane thus delivers ap- proximately 24 kJ per mol H +. C. Energy conservation in proton gradients \u0002 Proton gradients can be built up in various ways. A very unusual type is represented by bacteriorhodopsin (1), a light-driven proton pump that various bacteria use to produce energy. As with rhodopsin in the eye, the light-sensitive component used here is cova- lently bound retinal (see p. 358). In photosyn- thesis (see p. 130), reduced plastoquinone (QH2) transports protons, as well as electrons, through the membrane (Qcycle, 2). The for- mation of the proton gradient by the respira- tory chain is also coupled to redox processes (see p. 140). In complex III, a Q cycle is respon- sible for proton translocation (not shown). In cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, 3), H + trans- port is coupled to electron flow from cytochrome c to O2. In each of these cases, the H + gradient is utilized by an ATP synthase (4)to form ATP. ATP synthases consist of two components—a proton channel (F0)and an inwardly directed protein complex (F1), which conserves the energy of back-flowing protons through ATP synthesis (see p. 142). 126 Metabolism A PP P P P A P Fe Fe A.

With the help of photosynthesis, light energy is used to produce organic substances from CO2 and water. This property of phototrophic organ- isms (plants, algae, and some bacteria) is ex- ploited by heterotrophic organisms (e. g., ani- mals), whichare dependent ona supply of organic substances in their diet (see p. 112). The atmospheric oxygen that is vital to higher organisms is also derived from photosynthe- sis. A. Photosynthesis: overview \u0002 The chemical balance of photosynthesis is simple. Six molecules of CO2 are used to form one hexose molecule (right). The hydro- gen required for this reduction process is taken from water, and molecular oxygen is formed as a by-product (left). Light energy is required, since water is a very poor reducing agent and is therefore not capable of reducing CO2. In the light-dependent part of photosyn- thesis—the “light reactions ”—H2O molecules are split into protons, electrons, and oxygen atoms. The electrons undergo excitation by light energy and are raised to an energy level that is high enough to reduce NADP+.The NADPH+H + formed in this way, in contrast to H2O, is capable of “fixing” CO2 reductive- ly—i. e., of incorporating it into organic bonds. Another product of the light reactions is ATP, which is also required for CO2 fixation. If NADPH+H +,ATP, and theappropriate en- zymes are available, CO2 fixation can also take place in darkness. This process is there- fore known as the “dark reaction.” The excitation of electrons to form NADPH is a complex photochemical process that involves chlorophyll, a tetrapyrrole dye con- taining Mg2+ that bears an extra phytol resi- due (see p. 132). B. Light reactions \u0003 In green algae and higher plants, photosyn- thesis occurs in chloroplasts. These are organ- elles, which—like mitochondria—are sur- rounded by two membranes and contain their ownDNA. Intheir interior, the stroma, thyla- koids or flattened membrane sacs are stacked on top of each other to form grana.The inside of the thylakoid is referred to as the lumen. The light reactions are catalyzed by enzymes located in the thylakoid membrane, whereas the dark reactions take place in the stroma. As in the respiratory chain (see p. 140), the lightreactionscause electronstopassfrom one redox system to the next in an electron transport chain. However, the direction of transport is opposite to that found in the res- piratory chain. In the respiratory chain, elec- trons flow from NADH+H + to O2,withthe production of water and energy. In photosynthesis, electrons are taken up from water and transferred to NADP+,withan expenditure of energy. Photosynthetic electron transport is therefore energetically “uphill work.” To make this possible, the transport is stimulated at two points by the absorption of light energy. This occurs through two pho- tosystems—protein complexes that contain large numbers of chlorophyll molecules and other pigments (see p. 132). Another compo- nent of the transport chain is the cytochrome b/f complex, an aggregate of integral mem- brane proteins that includes two cytochromes (b563 and f). Plastoquinone,which is com- parable to ubiquinone, and two soluble pro- teins, the coppercontaining plastocyanin and ferredoxin, function as mobile electron car- riers. At the end of the chain, there is an enzyme that transfers the electrons to NADP +. Because photosystem II and the cyto- chrome b/f complex release protons from re- duced plastoquinone into the lumen (via a Q cycle), photosynthetic electron transport es- tablishes an electrochemical gradient across the thylakoid membrane (see p. 126), which is used for ATP synthesis by an ATP synthase. ATP and NADPH+H +,which arebothneeded for the dark reactions, are formed in the stroma. 128 Metabolism Mg 2+ P P A A PP P N A P P H N A P 6 H2O 3 O2 H 12 H Q QH2 H2O 2 H2 H [O] P P A A PP P P N A PATP nH N A P1 2 1 2 NADPH + H NADP Mg 2+ Mg 2+ O C N N H3C N N O CH3 CH2 CH3 CH H C H H3CO Mg H CH2 CH3 O H3C O B.

The chemical energy needed for this is produced from radiant en- ergy by two photosystems. A. Photosystem II \u0003 The photosynthetic electron transport chain in plants starts in photosystem II (PS II; see p. 128). PS II consists of numerous protein subunits (brown) that contain bound pig- ments—i. e., dye molecules that are involved in the absorption and transfer of light energy. The schematic overview of PS II presented here (1) only shows the important pigments. These include a special chlorophyll molecule, the reaction center P680; a neighboring Mg2+ free chlorophyll (pheophytin); and two bound plastoquinones (QA and QB). A third quinone (QP) is not linked to PS II, but belongs to the plastoquinone pool. The white arrows indi- cate the direction of electron flow from water to QP. Only about 1% of the chlorophyll mol- ecules in PS II are directly involved in photo- chemical excitation (see p. 128). Most of them are found, along with other pigments, in what are known as light-harvesting or antenna complexes (green). The energy of light quanta striking these can be passed on to the reaction center, where it can be utilized. In Fig. 2, photosynthetic electron transport in PS II is separated into the individual steps involved. Light energy from the light-harvest- ing complexes (a)raises anelectronof the chlorophyll in the reaction center to an excited “singlet state.” The excited electron is immediately passed on to the neighboring pheophytin. This leaves behind an “electron gap” in the reaction center—i. e., a positively charged P680 radical (b). This gap is now filled by an electron removed from an H2Omole- cule by the water-splitting enzyme (b). The excited electron passes on from the pheophy- tin via QA to QB,convertingthe latter into a semiquinone radical (c). QB is then reduced to hydroquinone by a second excited electron, and is then exchanged for an oxidized qui- none (QP) from the plastoquinone pool. Fur- ther transport of electrons from the plasto- quinone pool takes place as described on the preceding page and shown in B. B. Redox series \u0003 It can be seen from the normal potentials E0 (see p. 18) of the most important redox sys- tems involved in the light reactions why two excitation processes are needed in order to transfer electrons from H2OtoNADP+.After excitation in PS II, E0 rises from around –1 V back to positive values in plastocyanin (PC)—i. e., the energy of the electrons has to be increased again in PS I. If there is no NADP+ available, photosynthetic electron transport can still be used for ATP synthesis. During cyclic photophosphorylation, electrons return from ferredoxin (Fd) via the plastoquinone pool to the b/f complex. This type of electron transport does not produce any NADPH, but does lead to the formation of an H + gradient and thus to ATP synthesis. C. Calvin cycle \u0003 The synthesis of hexoses from CO2 is only showninavery simplified form here;acom- plete reaction scheme is given on p. 407. The actual CO2 fixation—i. e., the incorporation of CO2 into an organic compound—is catalyzed by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygen- ase (“rubisco”). Rubisco, the most abundant enzyme on Earth, converts ribulose 1,5-bis- phosphate, CO2 and water into two mole- cules of 3-phosphoglycerate. These are then converted, via 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and 3-phosphoglycerate, into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (glyceral 3-phosphate). In this way, 12 glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates are syn- thesized from six CO2. Two molecules of this intermediate are used by gluconeogenesis re- actions to synthesize glucose 6-phosphate (bottom right). From the remaining 10 mole- cules, six molecules of ribulose 1,5-bisphos- phate are regenerated, and the cycle then starts over again. In the Calvin cycle, ATP is required for phosphorylation of 3-phospho- glycerate and ribulose 5-phosphate. NADPH+H +, the second product of the light reaction, is consumed in the reduction of 1,3- bisphosphoglycerate to glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate. 130 Metabolism N A P E Ol (V) -1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 +0.2 +0.4 +0.6 +0.8 -1.2 H Ph QA QB QP b/f PC Q Fe/S Fd H2O Mg 2+ Mg 2+ QB QPQA Fe H2O 2 H 1/2 O2 ab c d 2.

These two molecules are among the few integral membrane pro- teins for which the structure is known in de- tail. Both structures were determined by X- ray crystallography. A. Cytochrome c oxidase \u0003 Theenzymecytochrome c oxidase (“COX,” EC 1.9.3.1) catalyzes the final step of the respira- tory chain. It receives electrons from the small heme protein cytochrome c and transfers them to molecular oxygen, which is thereby reduced to water (see p. 140). At the same time, 2–4 protons per water molecule formed are pumped from the matrix into the inter- membrane space. Mammalian COX (the illustration shows theenzymefrom bovineheart)is a dimer that has two identical subunits with masses of 204 kDa each. Only one subunit is shown in detail here; the other is indicated by gray lines. Each subunit consists of 13 different polypeptides, which all span the inner mito- chondrial membrane. Only polypeptides I (light blue) and II (dark blue) and the linked cofactors are involved in electron transport. The other chains, which are differently ex- pressed in the different organs, probably have regulatory functions. The two heme groups, heme a (orange) and heme a1 (red) are bound in polypeptide 1. The copper center CuA consists of two copper ions (green), which are coordinated by amino acid residues in polypeptide II. The second copper (CuB)is located in polypeptide I near heme a3. To reduce an O2 molecule to two molecules of H2O, a total of four electrons are needed, which are supplied by cytochrome c (pink, top left) and initially given off to CuA.From there, they are passed on via heme a and heme a3 to the enzyme’s reaction center, which is located between heme a3 and CuB.The reduction of the oxygen takes place in several steps, with- out any intermediate being released. The four protons needed to produce water and the H + ions pumped into the intermembrane space are taken up by two channels (D and K, not shown). The mechanism that links proton transport to electron transfer is still being investigated. B. Reaction center of Synechococcus elongatus \u0003 Photosystem I (PS I) in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus is the first system of this type for which the structure has been solved in atomic detail. Although the bacterial photosystem differs slightly from the systems in higher plants, the structure provides val- uable hints about the course of the light re- actions in photosynthesis (see p. 128). The functioning of the photosystem is discussed in greater detail on p. 130. The functional form of PS I in S. elongatus consists of a trimer with a mass of more than 106 Da that is integrated into the membrane. Only one of the three subunits is shown here. This consists of 12 different polypeptides (gray-blue), 96 chlorophyll molecules (green), 22 carotenoids (orange), several phylloqui- nones (yellow), and other components. Most of the chlorophyll molecules are so-called an- tenna pigments. These collect light energy and conduct it to the reaction center,which is located in the center of the structure and therefore not visible. In the reaction center, an electron is excited and transferred via various intermediate steps to a ferredoxin molecule (see p. 128). The chlorophylls (see formula) are heme-like pigments with a highly modi- fied tetrapyrrole ring, a central Mg2+ ion, and an apolar phytol side chain. Shown here is chlorophyll a, which is also found in the re- action center of the S. elongatus photosystem. The yellow and orange-colored carot- enoids—e. g., -carotene (see formula)—are auxiliary pigments that serve to protect the chloroplasts from oxidative damage. Danger- ousradicalscan be produced during the light reaction—particularly singlet oxygen.Caroten- oids prevent compounds of this type from arising, or render them inactive. Carotenoids are also responsible for the coloring of leaves seen during fall. They are left behind when plants break down chlorophyll in order to recover the nitrogen it contains. 132 Metabolism N N N N CH2 CH3HH3C H H H3CO CH3 CH3 CH3 C O O C O O CH Mg 2+ H3C H3C O O Inner mitochondrial membrane Matrix A.

NAD+ acts as the electron acceptor. In addition, thiamine di- phosphate, lipoamide, and FAD are also in- volved in the reaction. The oxoacid dehydrogenases include a) the pyruvate dehy- drogenase complex (PDH, pyruvate \u0001 acetyl CoA), b) the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (ODH, 2-oxoglutarate \u0001 succinyl CoA), and c) the branched chain dehydrogenase complex, which is involved in the catabolism of valine, leu- cine, and isoleucine (see p. 414). A. Pyruvate dehydrogenase: reactions \u0002 The pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction takes place in the mitochondrial matrix (see p. 210). Three different enzymes [E1–E3] form thePDH multienzymecomplex (see B). [1] Initially, pyruvate dehydrogenase [E1] catalyzes the decarboxylation of pyruvate and the transfer of the resulting hydroxyethyl residue to thiamine diphosphate (TPP, 1a). The same enzyme then catalyzes oxidation of the TPP-bound hydroxyethyl group to yield an acetyl residue. This residue and the reducing equivalents obtained are then transferred to lipoamide (1b). [2] The second enzyme, dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase [E2], shifts the acetyl residue from lipoamide to coenzyme A (2), with dihy- drolipoamide being left over. [3] The third enzyme, dihydrolipoamide de- hydrogenase [E3], reoxidizes dihydrolipo- amide, with NADH+H + being formed. The electrons are first taken over by enzyme- bound FAD (3a) and then transferred via a catalytically active disulfide bond in the E3 subunit (not shown) to soluble NAD+ (3b). Thefivedifferent coenzymes involved are associated with the enzyme components in different ways. Thiamine diphosphate is non-covalently bound to E1, whereas lipo- amide is covalently bound to a lysine residue of E2 andFAD is boundasa prosthetic group to E3. NAD+ and coenzyme A, being soluble coenzymes, are only temporarily associated with the complex. An importantaspectof PDH catalysisis the spatial relationship between the components of the complex. The covalently bound lipo- amidecoenzymeis partof a mobile domain of E2, and is therefore highly mobile. This structure is known as the lipoamide arm, and swings back and forth between E1 and E3 during catalysis. In this way, lipoamide can interact with the TPP bound at E1, with solute coenzyme A, and also with the FAD that serves as the electron acceptor in E3. B. PDH complex of Escherichia coli \u0003 The PDH complex of the bacterium Escheri- chia coli has been particularly well studied. It has a molecular mass of 5.3 106,and with a diameter of more than 30 nm it is larger than a ribosome. The complex consists of a total of 60 polypeptides (1, 2): 24 molecules of E2 (eight trimers) form the almost cube-shaped core of the complex. Each of the six surfaces of the cube is occupied by a dimer of E3 compo- nents, while each of the twelve edges of the cube is occupied by dimers of E1 molecules. Animal oxoacid dehydrogenases have similar structures, but differ in the numbers of sub- units and their molecular masses. Further information The PDH reaction, which is practically irrever- sible, occupies a strategic position at the inter- face between carbohydrate and fatty acid me- tabolism, and also supplies acetyl residues to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. PDH activity is therefore strictly regulated (see p. 144). Inter- conversion is particularly important in animal cells (see p. 120). Several PDH-specific protein kinases inactivate the E1 components through phosphorylation, while equally specific pro- tein phosphatases reactivate it again. The binding of the kinases and phosphatases to the complex is in turn regulated by metabo- lites. For example, high concentrations of ace- tyl CoA promote binding of kinases and thereby inhibit the reaction, while Ca 2+ in- creases the activity of the phosphatase. Insu- lin activates PDH via inhibition of phosphor- ylation. 134 Metabolism E1 E2 CoA E3 1. E1+ E2+E3=60 E1 12·2=24 E2 8·3=24 E3 6·2=12 10nm E1 E3 E2 2.

In eightsteps, itoxi- dizesacetyl residues(CH3-CO-) to carbon di- oxide (CO2). The reducing equivalents ob- tained in this process are transferred to NAD + or ubiquinone, and from there to the respiratory chain (see p. 140). Additional met- abolic functions of the cycle are discussed on p. 138. A. Tricarboxylic acid cycle \u0002 The acetyl-CoA that supplies the cycle with acetyl residues is mainly derived from - oxidation of fatty acids (see p. 164) and from the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. Both of these processes take place in the mitochon- drial matrix. [1] In the first step of the cycle, citrate synthase catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl residue from acetyl CoA to a carrier molecule, oxaloacetic acid. The product of this reaction, tricarboxylic acid, gives the cycle its name. [2] In the next step, tricarboxylic acid undergoes isomerization to yield isocitrate. In the process, only the hydroxyl group is shifted within the molecule. The correspond- ing enzyme is called aconitate hydratase (“aconitase”), because unsaturated aconitate arises as an enzyme-bound intermediate dur- ing the reaction (not shown; see p. 8). Due to the properties of aconitase, the isomerization is absolutely stereospecific. Although citrate is not chiral, isocitrate has two chiral centers, so that it could potentially appear in four iso- meric forms. However, in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, only one of these stereoisomers, (2R,3S)-isocitrate, is produced. [3] The first oxidative step now follows. Isocitrate dehydrogenase oxidizes the hy- droxyl group of isocitrate into an oxo group. At thesametime, a carboxylgroup is released as CO2,and 2-oxoglutarate (also known as α- ketoglutarate) and NADH+H + are formed. [4] The next step, the formation of succinyl CoA, also involves one oxidation and one de- carboxylation. It is catalyzed by 2-oxogluta- rate dehydrogenase, a multienzyme complex closely resembling the PDH complex (see p. 134). NADH+H + is once again formed in this reaction. [5] The subsequent cleavage of the thio- ester succinylCoA into succinate and coen- zyme A by succinic acid-CoA ligase (succinyl CoA synthetase, succinic thiokinase) is strongly exergonic and is used to synthesize a phosphoric acid anhydride bond (“substrate level phosphorylation ”, see p.124). However, it is not ATPthat isproduced here as isother- wise usually the case, but instead guanosine triphosphate (GTP). However, GTP can be con- verted into ATP by a nucleoside diphosphate kinase (not shown). [6] Via the reactions described so far, the acetyl residue has been completely oxidized to CO2. At the same time, however, the carrier molecule oxaloacetate has been reduced to succinate. Three further reactions in the cycle now regenerate oxaloacetate from succinate. Initially, succinate dehydrogenase oxidizes succinate to fumarate. In contrast to the other enzymes in the cycle, succinate dehydrogenase is anintegralproteinofthe inner mitochondrial membrane. It is therefore also assigned to the respiratory chain as complex II. Although suc- cinate dehydrogenase contains FAD as a pros- thetic group, ubiquinone is the real electron acceptor of the reaction. [7] Water is now added to the double bond of fumarate by fumarate hydratase (“fuma- rase”), and chiral (2S)-malate is produced. [8] In the last step of the cycle, malate is again oxidized by malate dehydrogenase into oxaloacetate,with NADH+H + again being pro- duced. With this reaction, the cycle is com- plete and can start again from the beginning. As the equilibrium of the reaction lies well on thesideofmalate, theformation of oxaloace- tic acid by reaction [8] depends on the strongly exergonic reaction [1], which imme- diately removes it from the equilibrium. The net outcome is that each rotation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle converts one ace- tyl residue and two molecules of H2Ointotwo molecules of CO2. At the same time, one GTP, three NADH+H + andone reducedubiquinone (QH2) are produced. By oxidative phosphory- lation (see p. 122), the cell obtains around nine molecules of ATP from these reduced coenzymes (see p. 146). Together with the directly formed GTP, this yields a total of 10 ATP per acetyl group. 136 Metabolism 5 P N A A S H2O H2O O OH OH O G PP P P P G A S 7 8 2 3 1 6 CO2 CO2 N A N A N AN A 2 7 8 16 A S +28.1 -38.2 +6.7 -7.1-37.0 -8.8 ±0 -3.8 4 4 3 N A 5 A S GTP kJ · mol-1 ∆G0I COO CH C OH COO HH COO CH C COO H COO CH2 CH2 COO CH2H2C C OOC O OC O CH2H2C C COO OOC O OC O COO CH2C C H COO OOC HOH COO CH2C CH2 OH COO OOC CCH3 O COO C CH2 O COO (2S) - Malate Respiratory chain Fumarate Succinate Acetyl CoA Citrate Succinyl CoA 2-Oxoglutarate Citrate synthase 4.1.3.7 Aconitase 4.2.1.3 [Fe4S4] Isocitrate DH 1.1.1.41 2-Oxoglutarate DH complex 1.2.4.2, 1.8.1.4, 2.3.1.61 Succinate-CoA ligase 6.2.1.4 Succinate DH 1.3.5.1 [FAD, Fe2S2, Fe4S4] Fumarate hydratase 4.2.1.2 Malate DH 1.1.1.37DH = dehydrogenase Center of chirality Ubiquinol QH2 Oxaloacetate (2R,3S)-Isocitrate A. Tricarboxylic acid cycle 137Energy Metabolism Tricarboxylic acid cycle: functions A. Tricarboxylic acid cycle: functions \u0002 The tricarboxylic acid cycle (see p. 136) is often described as the “hub of intermediary metabolism.” It has both catabolic and ana- bolic functions—it is amphibolic. As a catabolic pathway, it initiates the “ter- minal oxidation” of energy substrates. Many catabolic pathways lead to intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, or supply metab- olites such as pyruvate and acetyl-CoA that can enter the cycle, where their C atoms are oxidized to CO2. The reducing equivalents (see p. 14) obtained in this way are then used for oxidative phosphorylation—i. e., to aerobically synthesize ATP (see p. 122). The tricarboxylic acid cycle also supplies important precursors for anabolic pathways. Intermediates in the cycle are converted into: • Glucose (gluconeogenesis; precursors: oxa- loacetate and malate—see p. 154) • Porphyrins (precursor: succinyl-CoA—see p. 192) • Amino acids (precursors: 2-oxoglutarate, oxaloacetate—see p. 184) • Fatty acids and isoprenoids (precursor: cit- rate—see below) Theintermediates of thetricarboxylic acid cycle are present in the mitochondria only in very small quantities. After the oxidation of acetyl-CoA to CO2, they are constantly regen- erated, and their concentrations therefore re- main constant, averaged over time. Anabolic pathways, which remove intermediates of the cycle (e. g., gluconeogenesis) would quickly use up the small quantities present in the mitochondria if metabolites did not reenter the cycle at other sites to replace the com- pounds consumed. Processes that replenish the cycle in this way are called anaplerotic reactions. The degradation of most amino acids is anaplerotic, because it produces either inter- mediates of the cycle or pyruvate (glucogenic amino acids; see p. 180). Gluconeogenesis is in fact largely sustained by the degradation of amino acids. A particularly important ana- plerotic step in animal metabolism leads from pyruvate to oxaloacetic acid. This ATP- dependent reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase [1]. It allows pyruvate yielding amino acids and lactate to be used for gluco- neogenesis. By contrast, acetyl CoA does not have ana- plerotic effects in animal metabolism. Its car- bonskeletoniscompletely oxidized toCO2 and is therefore no longer available for bio- synthesis. Since fatty acid degradation only supplies acetylCoA,animals areunableto convert fatty acids into glucose. During peri- ods of hunger, it is therefore not the fat re- serves that are initially drawn on, but pro- teins. In contrast to fatty acids, the amino acids released are able to maintain the blood glucose level (see p. 308). The tricarboxylic acid cycle not only takes up acetyl CoA from fatty acid degradation, but also supplies the material for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and isoprenoids. Acetyl CoA, which is formed in the matrix space of mito- chondria by pyruvate dehydrogenase (see p. 134), is not capable of passing through the inner mitochondrial membrane. The acetyl residue is therefore condensed with oxalo- acetate by mitochondrial citrate synthase to form citrate. This then leaves the mitochon- dria by antiport with malate (right; see p. 212). In the cytoplasm, it is cleaved again by ATP-dependent citrate lyase [4] into acetyl- CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate formed is reduced by a cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase to malate [2], which then re- turns to the mitochondrion via the antiport already mentioned. Alternatively, the malate can be oxidized by “malic enzyme” [5], with decarboxylation, to pyruvate. The NADPH+H + formed in this process is also used for fatty acid biosynthesis. Additional information Using the so-called glyoxylic acid cycle,plants and bacteria are able to convert acetyl-CoA into succinate, which then enters the tricar- boxylic acid cycle. For these organisms, fat degradation therefore functions as an ana- plerotic process. In plants, this pathway is located in special organelles, the glyoxysomes. 138 Metabolism Pi CO2 O2 2[H]2[H] H2O CO2 ADP ATP CO2 Asp Phe* Tyr Asp Asn Ile* Val* Met* Trp* His Pro Arg Gln Glu 1 2 3 4 5 3 AN OH OH NADH+H A PPPP A PP + 2 A S 4 5 P AN P AN 2 Pyruvate ATP 1 2 ADP+PiATP CoA Carbo- hydrates Oxalo- acetate Malate Citrate Fatty acids Fat Phe*, Tyr, Trp* Acetyl CoA Ala, Ser, Thr*, Cys, Gly Asp, Asn, Arg, Met*, Thr*, Ile* Irreversible Oxaloacetate Pyruvate Mitochondrial matrix Catabolic pathway Anabolic pathway Anaplerotic reaction Ala, Leu*, Val* Ubiquinol (QH2) Carnitine shuttle * Essential * amino acid Fat Malate Pyruvate carboxylase 6.4.1.1 Malate dehydrogenase 1.1.1.37 PEP carboxykinase 4.1.1.32 Citrate lyase 4.1.3.8 Malic enzyme 1.1.1.40 β-Oxidation Oxidative phosphorylation GTP Cytoplasm Irreversible CO2 CO2 Malate Fumarate Succinate Succinyl CoA 2-Oxo- glutarate Isocitrate Citrate Oxalo- acetate Glu, Gln, Pro, Arg Acyl- CoA Acyl CoA Acetyl CoA Porphyrins A.

It catalyzes the steps by which elec- trons are transported from NADH+H + or re- duced ubiquinone (QH2)to molecular oxygen. Dueto the wide differencebetween theredox potentials of the donor (NADH+H + or QH2) and the acceptor (O2), this reaction is strongly exergonic (see p. 18). Most of the energy re- leased is used to establish a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (see p. 126), which is then ultimately used to synthesize ATP with the help of ATP synthase.

Components of the respiratory chain \u0002 The electron transport chain consists of three protein complexes (complexes I, III, and IV), which are integrated into the inner mitochon- drial membrane, and two mobile carrier mol- ecules—ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) and cyto- chrome c. Succinate dehydrogenase, which ac- tually belongs to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is also assigned to the respiratory chain as complex II. ATP synthase (see p. 142) is some- times referred to as complex V,although it is not involved in electron transport. With the exception of complex I, detailed structural in- formation is now available for every complex of the respiratory chain. All of the complexes in the respiratory chain are made up of numerous polypeptides and contain a series of different protein bound redox coenzymes (see pp. 104, 106). These include flavins (FMN or FAD in com- plexes I and II), iron–sulfur clusters (in I, II, and III), and heme groups (in II, III, and IV). Of themorethan 80polypeptides in the res- piratory chain, only 13 are coded by the mi- tochondrial genome (see p. 210). The remain- der are encodedbynuclear genes, andhaveto be imported into the mitochondria after being synthesized in the cytoplasm (see p. 228). Electrons enter the respiratory chain in var- ious different ways. In the oxidation of NADH+H + by complex I, electrons pass via FMN and Fe/S clusters to ubiquinone (Q). Elec- trons arising during the oxidation of succinate, acyl CoA, and other substrates are passed to ubiquinone by succinate dehydrogenase or other mitochondrial dehydrogenases via en- zyme-bound FADH2 and the electron-trans- porting flavoprotein (ETF; see p. 164). Ubiq- uinol passes electrons on to complex III, which transfers them via two b-type heme groups, one Fe/S cluster, and heme c1 to the small heme protein cytochrome c.Cytochrome c then transports the electrons to complex IV—cytochrome c oxidase. Cytochrome c oxi- dase contains redox-active components in the form of two copper centers (CuA and CuB)and hemes a and a3, through which the electrons finally reach oxygen (see p. 132). As the result of the two-electron reduction of O2,the strongly basic O 2– anion is produced (at least formally), andthisisconverted into waterby binding of two protons. The electron transfer is coupled to the formation of a proton gradi- ent by complexes I, III, and IV (see p. 126). B. Organization \u0003 Proton transport via complexes I, III, and IV takes place vectorially from the matrix into the intermembrane space. When electrons are being transported through the respiratory chain, the H + concentrationinthis space in- creases—i. e., the pH value there is reduced by about one pH unit. For each H2Omolecule formed, around 10 H + ions are pumped into the intermembrane space. If the inner mem- brane is intact, then generally only ATP syn- thase (see p. 142) can allow protons to flow back into the matrix. This is the basis for the coupling of electron transport to ATP synthe- sis, which is important for regulation pur- poses (see p. 144). As mentioned, although complexes I through V are all integrated into the inner membrane of the mitochondrion, they are not usually in contact with one another, since the electrons are transferred by ubiquinone and cytochrome c. With its long apolar side chain, ubiquinone is freely mobile within the mem- brane. Cytochrome c is water-soluble and is located on the outside of the inner membrane. NADH oxidation via complex I takes place on the inside of the membrane—i. e., in the matrix space, where the tricarboxylic acid cycle and β-oxidation (the most important sources of NADH) are also located. O2 reduc- tion and ATP formation also take place in the matrix. 140 Metabolism I III V 4 H 4 H H2O 4 H 10 H ATP 33 3 P P A A PP P P 2-4 H 1/2 O2 O2 IV ? 4 H 2 H 2 H Q ∆p NA NA NADH+H NAD 2e II ETF II P P A A PP PP H 2 H I III HS SH -0.3 E OI (V +0.1 +0.3 +0.8 Q H H IV CN O2 1/2 O2 H2O nH V nH CO N A Electron flow Proton flow Cytochrome C Mr 12 kDa 1 heme Succinate Fumarate NADH Inner mitochon- drial membrane Matrix space Outer mitochon- drial membrane Inter- membrane space Tricarboxylic acid cycle β-Oxidation Cyto- chrome C Pyruvate 2-Oxoglutarate 3-Hydroxybutyrate 3-Hydroxyacyl CoA Malate Isocitrate Acyl CoA α-Glycerophosphate Dihydroorotat Cholin Complex I NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1.6.5.3 Mr 700 - 800 kDa, 25 - 30 subunits 1 FMN, 2 Fe2S2, 4 - 5 Fe4S4 Complex II Succinate dehydrogenase 1.3.5.1 Mr 125 kDa, 4 - 6 subunits 1 FAD, 1 Fe2S2, 1 Fe4S4, 1Fe3S4 2 ubiquinone, 1 heme b Complex III Ubiquinol-cytochrome C reductase 1.10.2.2 Mr ≈ 400 kDa, 11 subunits 2 Fe2S2, 2 heme b, 1 heme c1 Complex V Complex IV Mr >400 kDa, >20 subunits Cytochrome C oxidase 1.9.3.1 Mr ≈ 200 kDa, 8 - 13 subunits 2 Cu, 1 Zn, 1 heme a, 1 heme a3 Liponamide-H2 A. Components of the respiratory chain B. Organization H -transporting ATP synthase 3.6.1.34 141Energy Metabolism ATP synthesis In the respiratory chain (see p. 140), electrons are transferred from NADH or ubiquinol (QH2) to O2. The energy obtained in this process is used to establish a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. ATP synthe- sis is ultimately coupled to the return of pro- tons from the intermembrane space into the matrix. A. Redox systems of the respiratory chain \u0002 The electrons provided by NADH do not reach oxygen directly, but instead are transferred to it in various steps. They pass through at least 10 intermediate redox systems, most of which are bound as prosthetic groups in complexes I, III, and IV. The large number of coenzymes involved in electron transport may initially appear surprising. However, as discussed on p. 18, in redox reactions, the change in free enthalpy ∆G—i. e., the chemical work that is done—depends only on the difference in re- dox potentials ∆E between the donor and the acceptor. Introducing additional redox sys- tems does not alter the reaction’s overall en- ergy yield. In the case of the respiratory chain, the difference between the normal potential of the donor (NAD +/NADH+H +,E0\u0001 =–0.32 V) and that of the acceptor (O2/H2O, E0\u0001 = +0.82 V) corresponds to an energy difference ∆G0\u0001 of more than 200 kJ mol –1.This large amount is divided into smaller, more manageable “packages,” the size of which is determined by the difference in redox poten- tials between the respective intermediates.It is assumed that this division is responsible for the astonishingly high energy yield (about 60%) achieved by the respiratory chain. The illustration shows the important redox systems involved in mitochondrial electron transport and their approximate redox poten- tials. These potentials determine the path fol- lowed by the electrons, as the members of a redox series have to be arranged in order of increasing redox potential if transport is to occur spontaneously (see p. 32). In complex 1, the electrons are passed from NADH+H+ first to FMN (see p. 104) and then on to several iron–sulfur (Fe/S) clusters. These redox systems are only stable in the interior of proteins. Depending on the type, Fe/S clus- ters may contain two to six iron ions, which form complexes with inorganic sulfide and the SH groups of cysteine residues (see p. 286). Ubiquinone (coenzyme Q; see p. 104) is a mobile carrier that takes up elec- trons from complexes I and II and from re- duced ETF and passes them on to complex III. Heme groups are also involved in electron transport in a variety of ways. Type b hemes correspond to that found in hemoglobin (see p. 280). Heme c in cytochrome c is covalently bound to the protein, while the tetrapyrrole ring of heme a is isoprenylated and carries a formyl group. In complex IV, a copper ion (CuB) and heme a3 react directly with oxygen. B. ATP synthase \u0002 The ATP synthase (EC 3.6.1.34, complex V) that transports H + is a complex molecular ma- chine. The enzyme consists of two parts—a proton channel (Fo, for “oligomycin-sensitive”) that is integrated into the membrane; and a catalytic unit (F1) that protrudes into the ma- trix. The Fo part consists of 12 membrane- spanning c-peptides and one a-subunit. The “head” of the F1 part is composed of three α and three β subunits, between which there are three active centers. The “stem” between Fo and F1 consists of one γ and one ε subunit. Two more polypeptides, b and δ,form a kind of “stator,” fixing the α and β subunits relative to the Fo part. The catalytic cycle can be divided into three phases, through each of which the three active sites pass in sequence. First, ADP and Pi are bound (1), then the anhydride bond forms (2), and finally the product is released (3). Each time protons pass through the Fo chan- nel protein into the matrix, all three active sites change from their current state to the next. It has been shown that the energy for proton transport is initially converted into a rotation of the γ subunit, whichin turncycli- cally alters the conformation of the α and β subunits, which are stationary relative to the Fo part, and thereby drives ATP synthesis. 142 Metabolism A PPP A PPP A PPP A PPP A PPP A PPP A PP P A PP P A PPP A PPP 1 2 3 A PPP H2O H2O H2O H2O H2O H2O H2O 2+3+ 2+3+ 2+ 3+ 2+3+ N A N A OH OH Cu2 Cu Cu2 Cu O2 F F ∆G' (kJ · mol–1) E' (V) –0.4 –0.2 0 +0.2 +0.4 +0.6 +0.8 0 –220 O IV III I NAD NADH +H 2+3+ F1 ε α β β α ε F0 β α γ H H a b2 δ ∆G = –n · F · ∆E O O A.

The need to coordinate the production and consumption of ATP is already evident from thefactthatthe total amounts of coenzymes in the organism are low. The human body forms about 65 kg ATP per day, but only con- tains 3–4 g of adenine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, and ATP). Each ADP molecule therefore has to be phosphorylated to ATP and dephosphory- lated again many thousand times a day. A. Respiratory control \u0002 The simple regulatory mechanism which en- sures that ATP synthesis is “automatically” coordinated with ATP consumption is known as respiratory control.It is based on the fact that the different parts of the oxidative phos- phorylation process are coupled via shared coenzymes and other factors (left). If a cell is not using any ATP, hardly any ADP will be available in the mitochondria. Without ADP, ATP synthase (3)is unable to break down the proton gradient across the inner mito- chondrial membrane. This in turn inhibits electron transport in the respiratory chain (2), which means that NADH+H + can no lon- ger be reoxidized to NAD +. Finally, the result- ing high NADH/NAD+ ratio inhibits the tricar- boxylic acid cycle (C), and thus slows down the degradation of the substrate SH2 (1). Con- versely, high rates of ATP utilization stimulate nutrient degradation and the respiratory chain via the same mechanism. If the formation of a proton gradient is prevented (right), substrate oxidation (1) and electron transport (2)proceed much more rapidly. However, instead of ATP, only heat is produced. B. Uncouplers \u0002 Substances that functionally separate oxida- tion and phosphorylation from one another are referred to as uncouplers. They break down the proton gradient by allowing H + ions to pass from the intermembrane space back into the mitochondrial matrix without the involvement of ATP synthase. Uncoupling effects are produced by mechanical damage to theinnermembrane(1) or by lipid-soluble substances that can transport protons through the membrane, such as 2,4- dinitrophenol (DNP, 2). Thermogenin (uncou- pling protein-1, UCP-1, 3)—an ion channel (see p. 222) in mitochondria of brown fat tis- sue—is a naturally occurring uncoupler. Brownfat is found, for example,innewborns and in hibernating animals, and serves exclu- sively to generate heat. In cold periods, nor- epinephrine activates the hormone-sensitive lipase (see p. 162). Increased lipolysis leads to the production of large quantities of free fatty acids. Like DNP, these bind H + ions in the intermembrane space, pass the UCP in this form, and then release the protons in the matrix again. This makes fatty acid degrada- tion independent of ADP availability—i. e., it takes place at maximum velocity and only produces heat (A). It is becoming increasingly clear that there are also UCPs in other cells, whichare controlled by hormones suchas thyroxine (see p. 374). This regulates the ATP yield and what is known as the basal metabolic rate. C. Regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle \u0002 The most important factor in the regulation of the cycle is the NADH/NAD + ratio. In addition to pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and oxoglu- tarate dehydrogenase (ODH; see p. 134), cit- rate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase are also inhibited by NAD + deficiency or an excess of NADH+H +. With the exception of isocitrate dehydrogenase, these enzymes are also sub- ject to product inhibition by acetyl-CoA, suc- cinyl-CoA, or citrate. Interconversion processes (see p. 120) also play an important role. They are shown here in detail using the example of the PDH com- plex (see p. 134). The inactivating protein kinase [1a] is inhibited by the substrate pyru- vate and is activated by the products acetyl- CoA and NADH+H +.The protein phosphatase [1b]—like isocitrate dehydrogenase [3] and the ODH complex [4]—is activated by Ca 2+.This is particularly important during muscle con- traction, when large amounts of ATP are needed. Insulin also activates the PDH com- plex (through inhibition of phosphorylation) and thereby promotes the breakdown of glu- cose and its conversion into fatty acids. 144 Metabolism AN AH2 A A PPP 1 2 3 AN PA PP AN AH2 A A PPP 1 2 3 AN PA PP 1 3 1b 2 31a 4 NADH 1b Ca2 2 Ca2 N A 3 1a 4 H H H H NO2 NO2 NO2 O2N H H O OH 2,4-Dinitrophenol Norepinephrine Fatty acids Dehydro- genases Respira- tory chain ATP synthase Heat 1.

Aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of glucose \u0002 In thepresenceof oxygen (i. e.,in aerobic conditions), most animal cells are capable of “respiring” various types of nutrient (lipids, amino acids, and carbohydrates)—i. e., using oxidative processes to break them down com- pletely. If oxygen is lacking (i. e., in anaerobic conditions), only glucose can be used for ATP synthesis. Although in these conditions glu- cose breakdowninanimals already ends in lactate and only produces small quantities of ATP, it is decisively important for the survival of cells at times of oxygen deficiency. In aerobic conditions (left), ATP is derived almost exclusively from oxidative phosphor- ylation (see p. 140). Fatty acids enter the mi- tochondria with the help of carnitine (see p. 164),and arebrokendownthere into CoA- bound acetyl residues. Glucose is converted into pyruvate by glycolysis (see p. 150) in the cytoplasm. Pyruvate is then also transported into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is oxidatively decarboxylated by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (see p. 134) to yield acetyl-CoA. The reducing equivalents (2 NADH+H + per glucose) that arise in glycolysis enter the mitochondrial matrix via the malate shuttle (see p. 212). The acetyl residues that are formed are oxidized to CO2 in the tricar- boxylic acid cycle (see p. 136). Breakdown of amino acids also produces acetyl residues or products that can directly enter the tricarbox- ylic acid cycle(seep. 180). Thereducing equivalents that are obtained are transferred to oxygen via the respiratory chain as re- quired. In the process, chemical energy is re- leased, which is used (via a proton gradient) to synthesize ATP (see p. 140). In the absence of oxygen—i. e., in anaerobic conditions—the picture changes completely. Since O2 is missing as the electron acceptor for the respiratory chain, NADH+H + and QH2 can no longer be reoxidized. Consequently, not only is mitochondrial ATP synthesis halted, but also almost the whole metabolism in the mitochondrial matrix. The main reason forthisisthe high NADH+H + concentration and lack of NAD+, which inhibit the tricarbox- ylic acid cycle and the pyruvate dehydro- genase reaction (see p. 144). β-Oxidation and the malate shuttle, which are dependent on free NAD +, also come to a standstill. Since amino acid degradation is also no longer able to contribute to energy production, the cell becomes totally dependent on ATP synthe- sized via the degradation of glucose by glycolysis. For this process to proceed contin- uously, the NADH+H + formed in the cyto- plasm has to be constantly reoxidized. Since this can no longer occur in the mitochondria, in anaerobic conditions animal cells reduce pyruvate to lactate and pass it into the blood. This type of process is called fermentation (see p. 148). The ATP yield is low, with only two ATPs per glucose arising during lactate synthesis. To estimate the number of ATP molecules formed in an aerobic state, it is necessary to know the P/O quotient—i. e., the molar ratio between synthesized ATP (“P”) and the water formed (“O”). During transport of two elec- trons from NADH+H + to oxygen, about 10 pro- tons are transported into the intermembrane space, while from ubiquinol (QH2), the num- ber is only six. ATP synthase (see p. 142) prob- ably requires three H + to synthesize one ATP, so that maximum P/O quotients of around 3 or 2 are possible. This implies a yield of up to 38 ATP per mol of glucose. However, the ac- tual value is much lower. It needs to be taken into account that the transport of specific me- tabolites into the mitochondrial matrix and the exchange of ATP4– for ADP3– are also driven by the proton gradient (see p. 212). TheP/O quotients for theoxidation of NADH+H + and QH2 are therefore more in the range of 2.5 and 1.5. If the energy balance of aerobicglycolysisiscalculatedon thisbasis, the result is a yield of around 32 ATP per glucose. However, this value is also not con- stant, and can be adjusted as required by the cell’s own uncouplers (UCPs; see p. 144) and other mechanisms. 146 Metabolism 7 9 +2 0 –2 –2 –1 A PPP 2 GTP AN A PPP A PPP H H2O H H A PPP 2 2 2 PA PP 2 1 2 4 AN 225 O2 PA PP AN A P AN A PPP A PPP H H H A PPP 2 2 2 PA PP 2 1 2 4 AN AN 225 O2 A P 2 8 9 10 11 12 AN +2 ATP +3 ATP +5 ATP +5 ATP +5 ATP +5 ATP +5 ATP 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 10 11 12+2 GTP +2 QH2 +2 NADH +2 NADH +2 NADH +2 NADH +2 ATP +2 ATP +2 NADH –1 ATP –1 ATP +32 +30 +27 +22 +17 +12 +7 +5 +3 –2 –1 –2 NADH +2 ATP +2 ATP +2 NADH –1 ATP –1 ATP 8 10 12 11 3 6 3 PP P P AN 7 9 7 Pyruvate Acetyl CoA ATP Coenzymes Glucose 1.

In the animal organism, this is achieved by the reduction of pyruvate to lactate. In microorganisms, there are many other forms of NAD + regeneration. Processes of this type are referred to as fermentations. Microbial fermentation processes are often used to produce foodstuffs and alcoholic bev- erages, or to preserve food. Features common to all fermentation processes are that they start with pyruvate and only occur under anaerobic conditions. A. Lactic acid and propionic acid fermentation \u0003 Many milk products, such as sour milk, yo- gurt, and cheese are made by bacterial lactic acid fermentation (1). The reaction is the same as in animals. Pyruvate, which is mainly de- rived from degradation of the disaccharide lactose (see p. 38), is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase [1]. Lactic acid fermen- tation also plays an important role in the production of sauerkraut and silage. These products usually keep for a long time, because the pH reduction that occurs during fermen- tation inhibits the growth of putrefying bac- teria. Bacteria from the genera Lactobacillus and Streptococcus are involved in the first steps of dairy production (3). The raw materials pro- duced by their effects usually only acquire their final properties after additional fermen- tation processes. For example, the character- istic taste of Swiss cheese develops during a subsequent propionic acid fermentation. In this process, bacteria from the genus Propionibacterium convert pyruvate to propi- onate in a complex series of reactions (2). B. Alcoholic fermentation \u0003 Alcoholic beverages are produced by the fer- mentation of plant products that have a high carbohydrate content. Pyruvate, which is formed from glucose, is initially decarboxy- lated by pyruvate decarboxylase [2], which does not occur in animal metabolism, to pro- duce acetaldehyde (ethanal). When this is re- duced by alcohol dehydrogenase [3], with NADH being consumed, ethanol [3] is formed. Yeasts, unicellular fungi that belong to the eukaryotes (3), rather than bacteria, are re- sponsible for this type of fermentation. Yeasts are also often used in baking. They produce CO2 and ethanol, which raise the dough. Brewers’ and bakers’ yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are usually haploid and reproduce asexually by budding (3). They can live both aerobically and anaerobically. Wine is pro- duced by other types of yeast, some of which already live on the grapes. To promote the formation of ethanol, efforts are made to gen- erally exclude oxygen during alcoholic fer- mentation—for example, by covering dough with a cloth when it is rising and by ferment- ing liquids in barrels that exclude air. C. Beer brewing \u0003 Barley is the traditional starting material for the brewing of beer. Although cereal grains contain starch, they hardly have any free sug- ars. The barley grains are therefore first al- lowed to germinate so that starch-cleaving amylases are formed. Careful warming of the sprouting grain produces malt. This is then ground, soaked in water, and kept warm for a certain time. In the process, a substantial proportion of the starch is broken down into the disaccharide maltose (see p. 38). The product (the wort) is then boiled, yeast and hops are added, and the mixture is allowed to ferment for several days. The addition of hops makes the beer less perishable and gives it its slightly bitter taste. Other substances con- tained in hops act as sedatives and diuretics. 148 Metabolism Champagne CO2 + CO21. 3.2. O2 1 1. 2 3 3.2. 2 N A N A 3 N A 1. 10 µm 3.2.

Balance \u0001 Glycolysis is a catabolic pathway in the cyto- plasm that is found in almost all organisms— irrespective of whether they live aerobically or anaerobically. The balance of glycolysis is simple: glucose is broken down into two mol- ecules of pyruvate, and in addition two mol- ecules of ATP and two of NADH+H + are formed. In thepresenceofoxygen, pyruvate and NADH+H + reach the mitochondria, where they undergo further transformation (aerobic glycolysis; see p. 146). In anaerobic condi- tions, fermentation products such as lactate or ethanol have to be formed in the cytoplasm from pyruvate and NADH+H +,inorder to re- generate NAD + so that glycolysis can continue (anaerobic glycolysis; see p. 146). In the anae- robic state, glycolysis is the only means of obtaining ATP that animal cells have. B. Reactions \u0002 Glycolysis involves ten individual steps, in- cluding three isomerizations and four phos- phate transfers. The only redox reaction takes place in step [6]. [1] Glucose, which is taken up by animal cells from the blood and other sources, is first phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate,with ATP being consumed. The glucose 6-phos- phate is not capableofleaving thecell. [2] In the next step, glucose 6-phosphate is isomerized into fructose 6-phosphate. [3] Using ATP again, another phosphoryla- tion takes place, giving rise to fructose 1,6- bisphosphate. Phosphofructokinase is the most important key enzyme in glycolysis (see p. 144). [4] Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is broken down by aldolase into the C3 compounds glyc- eraldehyde 3-phosphate (also known as glyc- eral 3-phosphate) and glycerone 3-phosphate (dihydroxyacetone 3-phosphate). [5] The latter two products are placed in fast equilibrium by triosephosphate isomerase. [6] Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is now oxidized by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate de- hydrogenase, with NADH+H + being formed. In this reaction, inorganic phosphate is taken up into the molecule (substrate-level phos- phorylation;see p. 124), and 1,3-bisphos- phoglycerate is produced. This intermediate contains a mixed acid–anhydride bond, the phosphate part of which is at a high chemical potential. [7] Catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase, this phosphate residue is transferred to ADP, producing 3-phosphoglycerate and ATP. The ATP balance is thus once again in equilibrium. [8] As a result of shifting of the remaining phosphate residue within the molecule, the isomer 2-phosphoglycerate is formed. [9] Elimination of water from 2-phospho- glycerate produces the phosphate ester of the enol form of pyruvate—phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). This reaction also raises the second phosphate residue to a high potential. [10] In the last step, pyruvate kinase trans- fers this residue to ADP. The remaining enol pyruvate is immediately rearranged into pyruvate,which is much more stable. Along with step [7] and the thiokinase reaction in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (see p. 136), the pyruvate kinase reaction is one of the three reactions in animal metabolism that are able to produce ATP independently of the respira- tory chain. In glycolysis, two molecules of ATP are ini- tially used for activation ([1], [3]). Later, two ATPs are formed per C3 fragment. Overall, therefore, there is a small net gain of 2 mol ATP per mol of glucose. C. Energy profile \u0003 The energy balance of metabolic pathways de- pends not only on the standard changes in enthalpy ∆G0, but also on the concentrations of the metabolites (see p. 18). Fig. C shows the actual enthalpy changes ∆Gfor the individual steps of glycolysis in erythrocytes. As can be seen, only three reactions ([1], [3], and [10]), are associated with large changes in free enthalpy. In these cases, the equilibrium lies well on the side of the prod- ucts (see p. 18). All of the other steps are freely reversible. Thesamesteps arealso fol- lowed—in the reverse direction—in gluconeo- genesis (see p. 154), with the same enzymes being activated as in glucose degradation. The non-reversible steps [1], [3], and [10] are by- passed in glucose biosynthesis (see p. 154). 150 Metabolism 0 -20 -40 -60 -80 PP A A PPP ∆G ' (kJ · mol-1) PP A A PPP PP A A PPP PP A A PPP 8 76 5 4 9 1 10 3 2 PP AA PPP PP AA PPP PP AA PPP PP A A PPP 1 32 8 7 4 5 22 22 N AN A 6 1 2 3 4 5 10 9 7 9 P P P P P P 10 P P 6 8 2 H2O P P A A PP P N A N A P 2 2 2 2 2 ∆G OI = –35 kJ · mol–1 22 P PP P O HO OH OH OH H H H H CH2 H HO O HO OH OH OH H H H H CH2 H HO O HO OH OH OH H H H H CH2 H O O CH2O OH H CH2OH OH H HHO O CH2O OH H CH2 OH HHHO O HC OH H2C C O OO HC OH H2C C OO O HC O H2C C OO OH HC OH H2C C O OH CO CH2 H2C O OH CO CH2 C OO CO CH3 C OO CO CH3 COO CO CH3 COO P Pyruvate Steps 1, 3 and 10 are bypassed in gluconeogenesis Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 1,3-Bisphospho- glycerate 3-Phospho- glycerate Phospho- enolpyruvate 2-Phospho- glycerate Glycerone 3-phosphate Fructose 6-phosphate Glucose 6-phosphate Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate 2 22 2 Hexokinase 2.7.1.1 Glucose 6-phosphate Isomerase 5.3.1.9 6-Phosphofructo- kinase 2.7.1.11 Fructose bisphosphate aldolase 4.1.2.13 Triose-phosphate isomerase 5.3.1.1 Pyruvate kinase 2.7.1.40 Phosphopyruvate hydratase 4.2.1.11 Phosphoglycerate kinase 2.7.2.3 Glucose Pyruvate2 Glyceraldehyde- 3- dehydro- genase 1.2.1.12 Phosphoglycerate mutase 5.4.2.1 Glucose Pyruvate Pyruvate Glycolysis A. Glycolysis: balance C. Energy profile B. Reactions 2 151Carbohydrate Metabolism Pentose phosphate pathway The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP, also known as the hexose monophosphate pathway) is an oxidative metabolic pathway located in the cytoplasm, which, like glycoly- sis, starts from glucose 6-phosphate. It sup- plies two important precursors for anabolic pathways: NADPH+H+, which is required for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and isopren- oids, for example (see p. 168), and ribose 5- phosphate, a precursor in nucleotide biosyn- thesis (see p. 188). A. Pentose phosphate pathway: oxidative part \u0002 The oxidative segment of the PPP converts glucose 6-phosphate to ribulose 5-phosphate. One CO2 and two NADPH+H + are formed in the process. Depending on the metabolic state, themuch morecomplex regenerative part of the pathway (see B)can convertsome of the pentose phosphates back to hexose phosphates, or it can pass them on to glycol- ysis for breakdown. In most cells, less than 10% of glucose 6-phosphate is degraded via the pentose phosphate pathway. B. Reactions \u0002 [1] The oxidative part starts with the oxida- tion of glucose 6-phosphate by glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase.This forms NADPH+H + for the first time. The second product, 6-phosphogluconolactone,is an in- tramolecular ester (lactone) of 6-phospho- gluconate. [2] A specific hydrolase then cleaves the lactone, exposing the carboxyl group of 6-phosphogluconate. [3] The last enzyme in the oxidative part is phosphogluconate dehydrogenase [3], which releases the carboxylate group of 6-phospho- gluconate as CO2 and at thesame timeoxi- dizes the hydroxyl group at C3 to an oxo group. In addition to a second NADPH+H +, this also produces the ketopentose ribulose 5-phosphate. This is converted by an isomer- ase to ribose 5-phosphate, the initial com- pound for nucleotide synthesis (top). The regenerative part of the PPP is only shown here schematically. A complete reac- tion scheme is given on p. 408. The function of the regenerative branch is to adjust the net production of NADPH+H + and pentose phos- phates to the cell’s current requirements. Nor- mally, the demand for NADPH+H + is much higher than that for pentose phosphates. In these conditions, the reaction steps shown first convert six ribulose 5-phosphates to five molecules of fructose 6-phosphate and then, by isomerization, regenerate five glu- cose 6-phosphates. These can once again sup- ply NADPH+H + to the oxidative part of the PPP. Repeating these reactions finally results in the oxidation of one glucose 6-phosphate into six CO2.TwelveNADPH+H + arise in the same process. In sum, no pentose phosphates are produced via this pathway. In the recombination of sugar phosphates in theregenerativepart ofthe PPP, thereare two enzymes that are particularly important: [5] Transaldolase transfers C3 units from sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, a ketose with seven C atoms, to the aldehyde group of glyc- eraldehyde 3-phosphate. [4] Transketolase, which contains thiamine diphosphate, transfers C2 fragments from one sugar phosphate to another. The reactions in the regenerative segment of the PPP are freely reversible. It is therefore easily possible to use the regenerative part of the pathway to convert hexose phosphates into pentose phosphates. This can occur when there is a high demand for pentose phosphates—e. g., during DNA replication in theS phaseof the cell cycle(seep. 394). Additional information When energy in the form of ATP is required in addition to NADPH+H +, the cell is able to channel the products of the regenerative part of the PPP (fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) into glycolysis. Further degradation is carried out via the tri- carboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory chain to CO2 and water. Overall, the cell in this way obtains 12 mol NADPH+H + and around 150 mol ATP from 6 mol glucose 6-phos- phate. PPP activity is stimulated by insulin (see p. 388). This not only increases the rate of glucose degradation, but also produces ad- ditional NADPH+H + for fatty acid synthesis (see p. 168). 152 Metabolism CO2 2 N A P NADP NADPH + H PPP – oxidative part 2 N A P P P b 6 6 ab b a b a b a 6CO2 N A P N A P ab ab aa b 6 6 N A P N A P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P PP P P PP P P P a b 1 1 PP 4 5 4 P P P P P P P P 5 3 4 3 2 H2O 2 P 6 6 6 6 P P P O HO OH OH OH H H H H CH2 H O O C H CHC H OH C H OH C O H H OH O C H CHC H OH C H OH C O H H OH O C H CHC H OH C H OH C OH C H OHH O O O C HO OH OH H H H CH2 H O O O HO OH OH OH H H H H CH2 H O P A.

If the amount of carbohydrate taken up in food is not suf cient, the blood sugar level can be maintained for a limited time by degradation of hepatic glycogen (see p. 156). If these re- serves are also exhausted, de-novo synthesis of glucose (gluconeogenesis)begins. The liver is also mainly responsible for this (see p. 310), but the tubular cells of the kidney also show a high level of gluconeogenetic activity (see p. 328). The main precursors for gluconeo- genesis are amino acids derived from muscle proteins. Another important precursor is lactate, which isformed in erythrocytesand muscle proteins when there is oxygen de- ficiency. Glycerol produced from the degrada- tion of fats can also be used for gluconeogen- esis. However, the conversion of fatty acids into glucose is not possible in animal metab- olism (seep. 138). Thehuman organism can synthesize several hundred grams of glucose per day by gluconeogenesis. A. Gluconeogenesis \u0002 Many of the reaction steps involved in gluco- neogenesis are catalyzed by the same en- zymes that are used in glycolysis (see p. 150). Other enzymes are specific to gluco- neogenesis and are only synthesized, under the influence of cortisol and glucagon when needed (see p. 158). Glycolysis takes place exclusively when needed in the cytoplasm, but gluconeogenesis also involves the mito- chondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Gluconeogenesis consumes 4 ATP (3 ATP + 1 GTP) perglucose—i. e., twiceasmany asgly- colysis produces. [1] Lactate as a precursor for gluconeogen- esis is mainly derived from muscle (see Cori cycle, p. 338) and erythrocytes. LDH (see p. 98) oxidizes lactate to pyruvate, with NADH+H + formation. [2] The first steps of actual gluconeogenesis take place in the mitochondria. The reason for this “detour” is the equilibrium state of the pyruvate kinase reaction (see p. 150). Even coupling to ATP hydrolysis would not be suf- ficient to convert pyruvate directly into phos- phoenol pyruvate (PEP). Pyruvate derived from lactate or amino acids is therefore ini- tially transported into the mitochondrial ma- trix, and—in a biotin-dependent reaction cat- alyzed by pyruvate carboxylase—is carboxy- lated there to oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is also an intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Amino acids with breakdown products that enter the cycle or supply pyruvate can therefore be converted into glucose (see p. 180). [3] The oxaloacetate formed in the mito- chondrial matrix is initially reduced to ma- late, which can leave the mitochondria via inner membrane transport systems (see p. 212). [4] In the cytoplasm, oxaloacetate is re- formed and then converted into phospho- enol pyruvate by a GTP-dependent PEP car- boxykinase. The subsequent steps up to fruc- tose 1,6-bisphosphate represent the reverse of the corresponding reactions involved in glycolysis. One additional ATP per C3 frag- ment is used for the synthesis of 1,3-bisphos- phoglycerate. Two gluconeogenesis-specific phosphat- ases then successively cleave off the phos- phate residues from fructose 1,6-bisphos- phate. In between these reactions lies the isomerization of fructose 6-phosphate to glu- cose 6-phosphate—another glycolytic reac- tion. [5] The reaction catalyzed by fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is an important regulation point in gluconeogenesis (see p. 158). [6] The last enzyme in the pathway, glucose 6-phosphatase, occurs in the liver, but not in muscle. It is located in the interior of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Specific transporters allow glucose 6-phosphate to enter the ER and allow the glucose formed there to return to the cytoplasm. From there, it is ultimately released into the blood. Glycerol initially undergoes phosphoryla- tion at C-3 [7]. The glycerol 3-phosphate formed is then oxidized by an NAD +-depen- dent dehydrogenase to form glycerone 3- phosphate [8] and thereby channeled into gluconeogenesis. An FAD-dependent mito- chondrial enzyme isalsoable tocatalyze this reaction (known as the “glycerophos- phate shuttle”; see p. 212). 154 Metabolism P P P P H2O ADPATP NADH +H CO2 NADH+H NAD NAD NAD NADH +H NADHNAD 5 3 P 8 7 ADP ATP CO2 ADP ATP 23 1 GDPGTP 4 gER 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 P H2O 6 P P O HO OH OH OH H H H H CH2 H O O CH2O OH H CH2OH OH H HHO O HO OH OH OH H H H H CH2 H HO O CH2O OH H CH2 OH H HHO O COO C CH2 O COO CO CH2 COO COO C CH3 O COO C CH3 OHH H2C HC H2C OH OH OH COO C CH3 O COO C CH2 O COO COO CH CH2 OH COO Glucose 6-phosphate 3-Phospho- glycerate 1,3-Bisphospho- glycerate Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 2-Phospho- glycerate Phospho- enolpyruvate Pyruvate Lactate Glycerol Glycerone 3-phosphate Oxaloacetate Pyruvate Glucose Mitochrondrion Cytoplasm Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate Malate Oxaloacetate Amino acids Fructose 6-phosphate Lactate dehydrogenase 1.1.1.27 Pyruvate carboxylase (biotin)6.4.1.1 Malate dehydrogenase 1.1.1.37 Fructose 1,6- bisphosphate 3.1.3.11 Glucose 6- phosphatase 3.1.3.9 Glycerol kinase 2.7.1.30 Glycerol 3- phosphate dehydrogenase 1.1.1.8 PEP carboxykinase 4.1.1.32 Glycerol Lactate Amino acids Glucose 6-phosphate Glucose Glycerol 3-phosphate A. Gluconeogenesis Malate 155Carbohydrate Metabolism Glycogen metabolism Glycogen (see p. 40) is used in animals as a carbohydrate reserve, from which glucose phosphates and glucose can be released when needed. Glucose storage itself would not be useful, as high concentrations within cells would make them strongly hypertonic and would therefore cause an influx of water. By contrast, insoluble glycogen has only low osmotic activity. A. Glycogen balance \u0002 Animal glycogen, like amylopectin in plants, is a branched homopolymer of glucose. The glu- cose residues are linked by an α1\u00014-glyco- sidic bond. Every tenth or so glucose residue has an additional α1\u00016bond to another glucose. These branches are extended by additional α1\u00014-linked glucose residues. This structure produces tree-shaped mole- cules consisting of up to 50 000 residues (M > 1 10 7 Da). Hepatic glycogen is never completely de- graded. In general, only the nonreducing ends of the “tree” are shortened, or—when glucose is abundant—elongated. The reducing end of the tree is linked to a special protein, glyco- genin. Glycogenin carries out autocatalytic covalent bonding of the first glucose at one of its tyrosine residues and elongation of this by up to seven additional glucose residues. It is only at this point that glycogen synthase becomes active to supply further elongation. [1] The formation of glycosidic bonds be- tween sugars is endergonic. Initially, there- fore, the activated form—UDP-glucose—is synthesized by reaction of glucose 1-phos- phate with UTP (see p. 110). [2] Glycogen synthase now transfers glu- cose residues one by one from UDP-glucose to the non-reducing ends of the available “branches.” [3] Once the growing chain has reached a specific length (> 11 residues), the branching enzyme cleaves an oligosaccharide consisting of 6–7 residues from the end of it, and adds this into the interior of the same chain or a neighboring one with α1\u00016linkage.These branches are then further extended by glyco- gen synthase. [4] The branched structure of glycogen al- lows rapid release of sugar residues. The most important degradative enzyme, glycogen phosphorylase, cleaves residues from a non- reducing end one after another as glucose 1-phosphate. The larger the number of these ends, the more phosphorylase molecules can attack simultaneously. The formation of glu- cose 1-phosphate instead of glucose has the advantage that no ATP is needed to channel the released residues into glycolysis or the PPP. [5] [6] Due to the structure of glycogen phosphorylase, degradation comes to a halt four residues away from each branching point. Two more enzymes overcome this blockage. First, a glucanotransferase moves a trisaccharide from the side chain to the end of the main chain [5]. A 1,6-glucosidase [6] then cleaves the single remaining residue as a free glucose and leaves behind an unbranched chain that is once again accessible to phos- phorylase. The regulation of glycogen metabolism by interconversion, and the role of hormones in these processes, are discussed on p. 120. B. Glycogen balance \u0002 The human organism can store up to 450 g of glycogen—one-third in the liver and almost all of the remainder in muscle. The glycogen content of the other organs is low. Hepatic glycogen is mainly used to main- tain the blood glucose level in the postresorp- tive phase(seep. 308). Theglycogen content of the liver therefore varies widely, and can decline to almost zero in periods of extended hunger. After this, gluconeogenesis (see p. 154) takes over the glucose supply for the organism. Muscle glycogen serves as an energy reserve and is not involved in blood glucose regulation. Muscle does not contain any glu- cose 6-phosphataseand is thereforeunableto release glucose into the blood. The glycogen content of muscle therefore does not fluctuate as widely as that of the liver. 156 Metabolism 1 R R R P R 2 3 4 5 6 P P U P P U P P P P 1 4 R 42 6 5 4 3 A. Glycogen metabolism B.

Regulation of carbohydrate metabolism \u0002 In all organisms, carbohydrate metabolism is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms involving hormones, metabolites,and coenzymes. The scheme shown here (still a simplified one) applies to the liver, which has central functions in carbohydrate metab- olism (see p. 306). Some of the control mech- anisms shown hereare noteffectivein other tissues. One of the liver’smost important tasksisto store excess glucose in the form of glycogen and to release glucose from glycogen when required (buffer function). When the glycogen reserves are exhausted, the liver can provide glucose by de novo synthesis (gluconeogene- sis; see p. 154). In addition, like all tissues, the liver breaks glucose down via glycolysis. These functions have to be coordinated with each other. For example, there is no point in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis taking place simultaneously, and glycogen synthesis and glycogen degradation should not occur simul- taneously either. This is ensured by the fact that two different enzymes exist for important steps in both pathways, each of which cata- lyzes only the anabolic or the catabolic reac- tion. The enzymes are also regulated differ- ently. Only these key enzymes are shown here. Hormones. The hormones that influence carbohydrate metabolism include the pepti- des insulin and glucagon; a glucocorticoid, cortisol; and a catecholamine, epinephrine (see p. 380). Insulin activates glycogen synthase ([1]; see p. 388), and induces several enzymes involved in glycolysis [3, 5, 7]. At the same time, insulin inhibits the synthesis of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis (repression; [4,6,8,9]). Glucagon, the antag- onist of insulin, has the opposite effect. It induces gluconeogenesis enzymes [4, 6, 8, 9] and represses pyruvate kinase [7], a key en- zyme of glycolysis. Additional effects of glu- cagonare based onthe interconversion of en- zymes and are mediated by the second mes- senger cAMP. This inhibits glycogen synthesis [1] and activates glycogenolysis [2]. Epinephrine acts in a similar fashion. The in- hibition of pyruvate kinase [7] by glucagon is also due to interconversion. Glucocorticoids—mainly cortisol (see p. 374)—induceall of thekey enzymes in- volved in gluconeogenesis [4,6,8,9]. At the same time, they also induce enzymes in- volved in amino acid degradation and thereby provide precursors for gluconeogenesis. Reg- ulation of the expression of PEP carboxy- kinase, a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is discussed in detail on p. 244. Metabolites. High concentrations of ATP and citrate inhibit glycolysis by allosteric reg- ulation of phosphofructokinase. ATP also inhibits pyruvate kinase. Acetyl-CoA, an inhib- itor of pyruvate kinase, has a similar effect. All of these metabolites arise from glucose degradation (feedback inhibition). AMP and ADP, signals for ATP deficiency, activate gly- cogen degradation and inhibit gluconeogene- sis. B. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate \u0002 Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-bP) plays an important part in carbohydrate metabo- lism. Thismetabolite isformed in small quan- tities from fructose 6-phosphate and has purely regulatory functions. It stimulates gly- colysis by allosteric activation of phospho- fructokinase and inhibits gluconeogenesis by inhibition of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. The synthesis and degradation of Fru-2,6- bP are catalyzed by one and the same protein [10a, 10b]. If the enzyme is present in an un- phosphorylated form [10a], it acts as a kinase and leads to the formation of Fru-2,6-bP. After phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PK-A), it acts as a phosphatase [10b] and now catalyzes the degradation of Fru-2,6- bP to fructose 6-phosphate. The equilibrium between [10a] and [10b] is regulated by hor- mones. Epinephrine and glucagon increase the cAMP level (see p. 120). As a result of increased PK-A activity, this reduces the Fru- 2,6-bP concentration and inhibits glycolysis, while at the same time activating gluconeo- genesis. Conversely, via [10a], insulin acti- vates the synthesis of Fru-2,6-bP and thus glycolysis. In addition, insulin also inhibits the action of glucagon by reducing the cAMP level (see p. 120). 158 Metabolism 1 2 3 4 5 3' 6 7 8 9 3 4 3' R R 8 R R R 21 7 5 6 9 P 5 6 ATP ADP 10a 10b 10b 10a A.

The lack of this peptide hormone (see p. 76) mainly affects carbohy- drate and lipid metabolism. Diabetes mellitus occurs in two forms. In type 1 diabetes (in- sulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, IDDM), the insulin-forming cells are destroyed in young individuals by an autoimmune reac- tion. The less severe type 2 diabetes (non- insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, NIDDM) usually has its first onset in elderly individu- als. The causes have not yet been explained in detail in this type. A. Insulin biosynthesis \u0003 Insulin is produced by the B cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. As is usual with secretory proteins, the hormone’s precursor (preproinsulin) carries a signal peptide that directs the peptide chain to the interior of the endoplasmic reticulum (see p. 210). Proin- sulin is produced in the ER by cleavage of the signal peptide and formation of disulfide bonds. Proinsulin passes to the Golgi appara- tus, where it is packed into vesicles—the β- granules. After cleavage of the Cpeptide, ma- ture insulin is formed in the β-granules and is stored in the form of zinc-containing hexam- ers until secretion. B. Effects of insulin deficiency \u0002 The effects of insulin on carbohydrate metabolism are discussed on p. 158. In sim- plified terms, they can be described as stim- ulation of glucose utilization and inhibition of gluconeogenesis. In addition, the transport of glucose from the blood into most tissues is also insulin-dependent (exceptions to this in- clude the liver, CNS, and erythrocytes). The lipid metabolism of adipose tissue is also influenced by the hormone. In these cells, insulin stimulates the reorganization of glu- cose into fatty acids. This is mainly based on activation of acetyl CoA carboxylase (see p. 162) and increased availability of NADPH+H + due to increased PPP activity (see p. 152). Onthe other hand, insulinalso inhibits the degradation of fat by hormone- sensitive lipases (see p. 162) and prevents the breakdown of muscle protein. The effects of insulin deficiency on metab- olism are shown by arrows in the illustration. Particularly noticeable is the increase in the glucose concentration in the blood, from 5mM to 9 mM (90 mg dL –1)or more (hyperglycemia, elevated blood glucose level). In muscle and adipose tissue –the two most important glucose consumers—glucose uptake and glucose utilization are impaired by insulin deficiency. Glucose utilization in the liver is also reduced. At the same time, gluconeogenesisisstimulated, partly due to increased proteolysis in the muscles. This in- creases the blood sugar level still further. When the capacity of the kidneys to resorb glucose is exceeded (at plasma concentrations of 9 mM or more), glucose is excreted in the urine (glucosuria). The increased degradation of fat that oc- curs in insulin deficiency also has serious ef- fects. Some of the fatty acids that accumulate in large quantities are taken up by the liver andusedfor lipoprotein synthesis (hyperlipi- demia),and therestare broken down into acetyl CoA. As the tricarboxylic acid cycle is not capable of taking up such large quantities of acetyl CoA, the excess is used to form ke- tone bodies (acetoacetate and -hydroxy- butyrate see p. 312). As H + ions are released in this process, diabetics not receiving ad- equate treatment can suffer severe metabolic acidosis (diabetic coma). The acetone that is also formed gives these patients’ breath a characteristic odor. In addition, large amounts of ketone body anions appear in the urine (ketonuria). Diabetes mellitus can have serious secon- dary effects. A constantly raised blood sugar level can lead in the long term to changes in the blood vessels (diabetic angiopathy), kid- ney damage (nephropathy) and damage to the nervous system (neuropathy), as well as to cataracts in the eyes. 160 Metabolism 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 CC Exo- cytosis Rough ER Golgi apparatus β-Granules H3N Preproinsulin Signal peptide OOC 104 AS Proinsulin C peptide 84 AS Insulin 51 AS Zn2 Insulin hexamer Nucleus A.

Fat metabolism \u0002 Fat metabolism in adipose tissue (top). Fats (triacylglycerols) are the most important en- ergy reserve in the animal organism. They are mostly stored in insoluble form in the cells of adipose tissue—the adipocytes—where they are constantly being synthesized and broken down again. As precursors for the biosynthesis of fats (lipogenesis), the adipocytes use triacylgly- cerols from lipoproteins (VLDLs and chylomi- crons; see p. 278), which are formed in the liver and intestines and delivered by the blood. Lipoprotein lipase [1], which is located on the inner surface of the blood capillaries, cleaves these triacylglycerols into glycerol and fatty acids, which are taken up by the adipocytes and converted back into fats. The degradation of fats (lipolysis) is cata- lyzed in adipocytes by hormone-sensitive lipase [2]—an enzyme that is regulated by various hormones by cAMP-dependent inter- conversion (see p. 120). The amount of fatty acids released depends on the activity of this lipase; in this way, the enzyme regulates the plasma levels of fatty acids. In the blood plasma, fatty acids are trans- ported in free form—i. e., non-esterified. Only short-chain fatty acids are soluble in the blood; longer, less water-soluble fatty acids are transported bound to albumin. Degradation of fatty acids in the liver (left). Many tissues take up fatty acids from the blood plasma in order to synthesize fats or to obtain energy by oxidizing them. The me- tabolism of fatty acids is particularly intensive in the hepatocytes in the liver. The most important process in the degra- dation of fatty acids is -oxidation—a meta- bolic pathway in the mitochondrial matrix (see p. 164). Initially, the fatty acids in the cytoplasm are activated by binding to coen- zyme A into acyl CoA [3]. Then, with the help of a transport system (the carnitine shuttle [4]; seep. 164), theactivated fattyacids enter the mitochondrial matrix, where they are brokendowninto acetyl CoA.The resulting acetyl residues can be oxidized to CO2 in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, producing reduced coenzyme andATP derivedfrom itbyoxida- tive phosphorylation. If acetyl CoA production exceeds the energy requirements of the hepa- tocytes—as is the case when there is a high level of fatty acids in the blood plasma (typical in hunger and diabetes mellitus)—then the excess is converted into ketone bodies (see p. 312). These serve exclusively to supply other tissues with energy. Fat synthesis in the liver (right). Fatty acids andfatsare mainly synthesizedin the liver and in adipose tissue, aswell asin the kid- neys, lungs, and mammary glands. Fatty acid biosynthesis occurs in the cytoplasm—in con- trast to fatty acid degradation. The most im- portant precursor is glucose,but certain aminoacids can alsobe used. The first step is carboxylation of acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA. Thisreaction iscatalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase [5], which is the key enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis. Synthesis into fatty acids is carried out by fatty acid synthase [6]. This multifunctional enzyme (see p. 168) starts with one molecule of ace- tyl-CoA and elongates it by adding malonyl groups in seven reaction cycles until palmi- tate is reached. One CO2 molecule is released in each reaction cycle. The fatty acid therefore growsbytwo carbon unitseach time. NADPH+H + is used as the reducing agent and is derived either from the pentose phos- phate pathway (see p. 152) or from isocitrate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme reactions. The elongation of the fatty acid by fatty acid synthase concludes at C16,and theproduct, palmitate (16:0), is released. Unsaturated fatty acids and long-chain fatty acids can arise from palmitate in subsequent reactions. Fats are finally synthesized from activated fatty acids (acyl CoA) and glycerol 3-phosphate (see p. 170). To supply peripheral tissues, fats are packed by the hepatocytes into lipo- protein complexes of the VLDL type and re- leased into the blood in this form (see p. 278). 162 Metabolism 2 1 3 4 2 3 4 5 6 5 6 P PP CoA ATP AMP+ HCO3 NADP NADPH +H ADP+ ATP CO2 7x COO 1 NADH +H COO Chylo- microns Triacylglycerols Free fatty acids Insulin Hormone-sensitive lipase 3.1.1.3 Lipoprotein lipase 3.1.1.34 Fatty acid-CoA ligase 6.2.1.3 Carnitine O- palmitoyltrans- ferase 2.3.1.21 Fatty acid-albumin complex Largest energy store Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 6.4.1.2 [Biotin] Fatty acid synthase 2.3.1.85 From the intestine Epinephrine Norepinephrine Glucagon etc. Blood A.

Fatty acid degradation: -oxidation \u0002 After uptake by the cell, fatty acids are activated by conversion into their CoA deriva- tives—acyl CoA is formed.Thisusesuptwo energy-rich anhydride bonds of ATP per fatty acid (see p. 162). For channeling into the mi- tochondria, the acyl residues are first trans- ferred to carnitine and then transported across the inner membrane as acyl carnitine (see B). The degradation of the fatty acids occurs in the mitochondrial matrix through an oxida- tive cycle in which C2 units are successively cleaved off as acetyl CoA (activated acetic acid). Before the release of the acetyl groups, each CH2 group at C-3 of the acyl residue (the β-C atom) is oxidized to the keto group— hence the term \u0001-oxidation for this metabolic pathway. Both spatially and functionally, it is closely linked to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (see p. 136) and to the respiratory chain (see p. 140). [1] The first step is dehydrogenation of acyl CoA at C-2 and C-3. This yields an unsaturated ∆ 2-enoyl-CoA derivative with a trans-config- ured double bond. The two hydrogen atoms are initially transferred from FAD-containing acyl CoA dehydrogenase to the electron-trans- ferring flavoprotein (ETF). ETF dehydrogenase [5] passes them on from ETF to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q), a component of the respiratory chain (see p. 140). Other FAD-containing mi- tochondrial dehydrogenases are also able to supply the respiratory chain with electrons in this fashion. There are three isoenzymes (see p. 98) of acyl CoA dehydrogenase that are specialized for long-chain fatty acids (12–18 C atoms), medium-chain fatty acids (4–14), and short- chain fatty acids (4–8). [2] The next step in fatty acid degradation is the addition of a water molecule to the double bond of the enoyl CoA (hydration), with formation of \u0001-hydroxyacyl CoA. [3] In the next reaction, the OH group at C- 3 is oxidized to a carbonyl group (dehydro- genation). This gives rise to \u0001-ketoacyl CoA, and the reduction equivalents are transferred to NAD +, which also passes them on to the respiratory chain. [4] β-Ketoacyl-CoA is now broken down by an acyl transferase into acetyl CoA and an acyl CoA shortened by 2 C atoms (“thioclastic cleavage”). Several cycles are required for complete degradation of long-chain fatty acids—eight cycles in the case of stearyl-CoA (C18:0), for example. The acetyl CoA formed can then undergo further metabolism in the tricarbox- ylic acid cycle (see p. 136), or can be used for biosynthesis. When there is an excess of ace- tyl CoA, the liver can also form ketone bodies (see p. 312). When oxidative degradation is complete, one molecule of palmitic acid supplies around 106 molecules of ATP, corresponding to an energy of 3300 kJ mol –1. This high energy yield makes fats an ideal form of storage for metabolic energy. Hibernating animals such as polar bears can meet their own energy requirements for up to 6 months solely by fat degradation,while at thesametimepro- ducing the vital water they need via the res- piratory chain (“respiratory water”). B. Fatty acid transport \u0002 The inner mitochondrial membrane has a group-specific transport system for fatty acids. In the cytoplasm, the acyl groups of activated fatty acids are transferred to carni- tine by carnitine acyltransferase [1]. They are then channeled into the matrix by an acylcar- nitine/carnitine antiport as acyl carnitine,in exchange for free carnitine. In the matrix, the mitochondrial enzyme carnitine acyltransfer- ase catalyzes the return transfer of the acyl residue to CoA. The carnitine shuttle is the rate-determin- ing step in mitochondrial fatty acid degrada- tion. Malonyl CoA, a precursor of fatty acid biosynthesis, inhibits carnitine acyltransferase (see p. 162), and therefore also inhibits uptake of fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix. The most important regulator of β-oxida- tion is the NAD +/NADH+H + ratio. If the respi- ratory chain is not using any NADH+H +,then not only the tricarboxylic acid cycle (see p. 136) but also β-oxidation come to a stand- still due to the lack of NAD +. 164 Metabolism N A A S A SN A 2 H2O 4 QH2 Q F A F A 5 1 3 A S A S A S A S A S A S A S A S 1 S A 1 SAA 3 4 5 2 1 1 S A SA CCC H H H H C H H O CC H H O CC H H O H CC H H O H CC H H O H CCC H H C HO H O CC H H O H CCC H H H C HO CCC H H C HO H OH H C O O C H CH2 N CH3 CH3 CH3 CH2OOC A.

They are broken down via -oxidation (see p.164). In addition, there are special path- ways involving degradation of unsaturated fatty acids (A), degradation of fatty acids with an odd number of C atoms (B), α and ω oxidation of fatty acids, and degradation in peroxisomes. A. Degradation of unsaturated fatty acids \u0003 Unsaturated fatty acids usually contain a cis double bond at position 9 or 12—e. g., linoleic acid (18:2; 9,12). As with saturated fatty acids, degradationinthis case occurs via β-oxida- tion until the C-9-cis double bond is reached. Since enoyl-CoA hydratase only accepts sub- strates with trans double bonds, the corre- sponding enoyl-CoA is converted by an iso- merase from the cis-∆ 3, cis- ∆ 6 isomer into the trans-∆ 3,cis-∆ 6 isomer [1]. Degradation by β- oxidation can now continue until a shortened trans-∆ 2, cis-∆ 4 derivative occurs in the next cycle. This cannot be isomerized in the same way as before, and instead is reduced in an NADPH-dependent way to the trans-∆ 3 com- pound [2]. After rearrangement by enoyl-CoA isomerase [1], degradation can finally be com- pleted via normal β-oxidation. B. Degradation of oddnumbered fatty acids \u0003 Fatty acids with an odd number of C atoms are treated in the same way as “normal” fatty acids—i. e., they are taken up by the cell with ATP-dependent activation to acyl CoA and are transported into the mitochondria with the help of the carnitine shuttle and broken down there by β−oxidation (see p. 164). In the last step, propionyl CoA arises instead of acetyl CoA. This is first carboxylated by pro- pionyl CoA carboxylase into (S)-methylmalonyl CoA [3], which—after isomerization into the (R) enantiomer (not shown; see p. 411)—is isomerized into succinyl CoA [4]. Various coenzymes are involved in these reactions. The carboxylase [3] requires biotin, and the mutase [4] is dependent on coenzyme B12 (5\u0001-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin; see p. 108). Succinyl-CoA is an intermediate in the tricar- boxylic acid cycle and is available for gluco- neogenesis through conversion into oxaloace- tate. Odd-numbered fatty acids from pro- pionyl-CoA can therefore be used to synthe- size glucose. This pathway is also important for rumi- nant animals, which are dependent on sym- biotic microorganisms to break down their food. The microorganisms produce large amounts of propionic acid as a degradation product, which the host can channel into the metabolism in the way described. Further information \u0003 In addition to the degradation pathways de- scribed above, there are also additional spe- cial pathways for particular fatty acids found in food. Oxidation is used to break down methyl- branched fatty acids. It takes place through step-by-step removal of C1 residues, begins with a hydroxylation, does not require coen- zyme A, and does not produce any ATP. Oxidation—i. e., oxidation starting at the end of the fatty acid—also starts with a hy- droxylation catalyzed by a monooxygenase (see p. 316), and leads via subsequent oxida- tion to fatty acids with two carboxyl groups, which can undergo β-oxidation from both ends until C8 or C6 dicarboxylic acids are reached, which can be excreted in the urine in this form. Degradation of unusually long fatty acids. An alternative form of β-oxidation takes place in hepatic peroxisomes,which arespecialized for the degradation of particularly long fatty acids (n > 20). The degradation products are acetyl-CoA and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is detoxified by the catalase (see p. 32) common in peroxisomes. Enzyme defects are also known to exist in the minor pathways of fatty acid degradation. In Refsum disease, the methyl-branched phy- tanic acid (obtained from vegetable foods) cannot be degraded by α-oxidation. In Zell- weger syndrome, a peroxisomal defect means that long-chain fatty acids cannot be de- graded. 166 Metabolism cis cis trans trans trans A S A S A S A S trans cis A S cis A S N A N A P P 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 3 CoA 4 CoA NADPH NADP P P AA PP P P n Acetyl CoA CO2 A S 43 4 3 A S A S A S A S CC H H O H CC H H O C H H H CC H COO O C H H H CC H H O C H COO H C O 12 9 C O 3 6 C O 6 2 C O 2 4 C O 2 C O 3 Linoleoyl CoA (18 : 2; 9,12) 5 Acetyl CoA Reduction and shift of the marked double bonds Shift and izomerization of the marked double bond 3 Acetyl CoA Acetyl CoA β-Oxidation Enoyl-CoA isomerase 5.3.3.8 2,4-Dienoyl-CoA reductase 1.3.1.34 β-Oxidation β-Oxidation CoA Odd-numbered fatty acids Tricarboxylic acid cycle Propionyl CoA Methylmalonyl CoA Succinyl CoA Propionyl-CoA carboxylase 6.4.1.3 [biotin] Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase 5.4.99.2 [cobamide] β-Oxidation A. Degradation of unsaturated fatty acids B. Degradation of odd-numbered fatty acids 167Lipid Metabolism Fatty acid synthesis In the vertebrates, biosynthesis of fatty acids is catalyzed by fatty acid synthase, amulti- functional enzyme. Located in the cytoplasm, the enzyme requires acetyl CoA as a starter molecule. In a cyclic reaction, the acetyl resi- dueis elongated by oneC2 unit at a time for seven cycles. NADPH+H + is used as a reducing agent in the process. The end product of the reaction is the saturated C16 acid, palmitic acid. A. Fatty acid synthase \u0002 Fatty acid synthase in vertebrates consists of two identical peptide chains—i. e., it is a ho- modimer. Each of the two peptide chains, which are shown here as hemispheres, cata- lyzes all seven of the partial reactions re- quired to synthesize palmitate. The spatial compression of several successive reactions into a single multifunctional enzyme has ad- vantages in comparison with separate en- zymes. Competing reactions are prevented, the individual reactions proceed in a coordi- nated way as if on a production line, and due to low diffusion losses they are particularly ef cient. Each subunit of the enzyme binds acetyl residues as thioesters at two different SH groups: at one peripheral cysteine residue (CysSH) and one central 4\u0001-phosphopante- theine group (Pan-SH). Pan-SH, which is very similar to coenzyme A (see p. 12), is cova- lently bound to a protein segment of the syn- thase known as the acyl-carrier protein (ACP). This part functions like a long arm that passes the substrate from one reaction center to the next. The two subunits of fatty acid synthase cooperate in this process; the enzyme is therefore only capable of functioning as a dimer. Spatially, the enzyme activities are ar- ranged into three different domains. Domain 1 catalyzes the entry of the substrates acetyl CoA and malonyl CoA by [ACP]-S- acetyltransferase [1] and [ACP]-Smalonyl transferase [2] and subsequent condensation of the two partners by 3-oxoacyl-[ACP]- synthase [3]. Domain 2 catalyzes the conver- sion of the 3-oxo group to a CH2 group by 3- oxoacyl-[ACP]-reductase [4], 3-hydroxyacyl- [ACP]-dehydratase [5], and enoyl-[ACP]-re- ductase [6]. Finally, domain 3 serves to release the finished product by acyl-[ACP]-hydrolase [7] after sevensteps of chainelongation. B. Reactions of fatty acid synthase \u0002 The key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis is ace- tyl CoA carboxylase (see p. 162), which pre- cedes the synthase and supplies the malonyl- CoA required for elongation. Like all carbox- ylases, the enzyme contains covalently bound biotin as a prosthetic group and is hormone- dependently inactivated by phosphorylation or activated by dephosphorylation (see p. 120). The precursor citrate (see p. 138) is an allosteric activator, while palmitoyl-CoA inhibits the end product of the synthesis pathway. [1] The first cycle (n = 1) starts with the transfer of an acetyl residue from acetyl CoA to the peripheral cysteine residue (Cys-SH). At thesametime, [2] a malonyl residue is transferred from malonyl CoA to 4-phosphopantetheine (Pan- SH). [3] By condensation of the acetyl resi- due—or (in later cycles) the acyl residue—with the malonyl group, with simultaneous decar- boxylation, the chain is elongated. [4]–[6] The following three reactions (re- duction of the 3-oxo group, dehydrogenation of the 3-hydroxyl derivative, and renewed reduction of it) correspond in principle to a reversal of β-oxidation, but they are catalyzed by other enzymes and use NADPH+H + instead of NADH+H + for reduction. They lead to an acyl residue bound at Pan-SH with 2n + 2 C atoms (n = the number of the cycle). Finally, depending on the length of the product, [1\u0001] The acyl residue is transferred back to the peripheral cysteine, so that the next cycle can begin again with renewed loading of the ACP with a malonyl residue, or: [7] After seven cycles, the completed pal- mitic acid is hydrolytically released. In all, one acetyl-CoA and seven malonyl- CoA are converted with the help of 14 NADPH+H + into one palmitic acid, 7 CO2, 6H2O, 8CoA and14NADP+. Acetyl CoA car- boxylase also uses up seven ATP. 168 Metabolism N A P CC H H O C OH H CH H H 1 21 3 4 5 6 7 7 ACP 2 1 3 4 5 6 ACP Cys SH SH SH SH Cys P A S A S 5 6 7 A S A S 1 A S 71 7x Cys–S Pan–S A S 2 H2O 5 H2O Cys–SH Pan–S 6 N A P NADP Cys–SH Pan–S Cys–SH Pan–S 4 N A P N A P NADP Cys–SH Pan–S 3 H CO2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 CC H H O C H H CH H H CC HO C H CH H H CC H H O C O CH H H CC H H O COO CC H H O H NADP+H NADP+H A.

Biosynthesis of fats and phospholipids \u0002 Complex lipids, such as neutral fats (triacyl- glycerols), phospholipids, and glycolipids, are synthesized via common reaction pathways. Most of the enzymes involved are associated with the membranes of the smooth endoplas- mic reticulum. The synthesis of fats and phospholipids starts with glycerol 3-phosphate.This com- pound can arise via two pathways: [1] By reduction from the glycolytic intermediate glycerone 3-phosphate (dihy- droxyacetone 3-phosphate; enzyme: glyc- erol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) 1.1.1.8), or: [2] By phosphorylation of glycerol deriving from fat degradation (enzyme: glycerol kinase 2.7.1.30). [3] Esterification of glycerol 3-phosphate with a long-chain fatty acid produces a strongly amphipathic lysophosphatidate (en- zyme: glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 2.3.1.15). In this reaction, an acyl residue is transferred from the activated precursor acyl-CoA to the hydroxy group at C-1. [4] A second esterification of this type leads to a phosphatidate (enzyme: 1-acylglycerol-3- phosphate acyltransferase 2.3.1.51). Unsatu- rated acyl residues, particularly oleic acid, are usually incorporated at C-2 of the glycerol. Phosphatidates (anions of phosphatidic acids) are the key molecules in the biosynthesis of fats, phospholipids, and glycolipids. [5] To biosynthesize fats (triacylglycerols), the phosphate residue is again removed by hydrolysis (enzyme: phosphatidate phospha- tase 3.1.3.4). This produces diacylglycerols (DAG). [6] Transfer of an additional acyl residue to DAG forms triacylglycerols (enzyme: diacyl- glycerol acyltransferase 2.3.1.20). This com- pletes the biosynthesis of neutral fats. They are packaged into VLDLs by the liver and re- leased into the blood. Finally, they are stored by adipocytes in the form of insoluble fat droplets. The biosynthesis of most phospholipids also starts from DAG. [7] Transfer of a phosphocholine residue to thefreeOHgroup gives riseto phosphatidyl- choline (lecithin; enzyme: 1-alkyl-2-acetyl- glycerolcholine phosphotransferase 2.7.8.16). The phosphocholine residue is derived from the precursor CDP-choline (see p. 110). Phos- phatidylethanolamine is similarly formed from CDP-ethanolamine and DAG. By contrast, phosphatidylserine is derived from phosphatidylethanolamine by an exchange of the amino alcohol. Further reactions serve to interconvert the phospholipids—e. g., phos- phatidylserine can be converted into phos- phatidylethanolamine by decarboxylation, and the latter can then be converted into phosphatidylcholine by methylation with S- adenosyl methionine (not shown; see also p. 409). The biosynthesis of phosphatidylino- sitol starts from phosphatidate rather than DAG. [8] Inthe lumenof the intestine, fats from food are mainly broken down into monoacyl- glycerols (see p. 270). The cells of the intesti- nal mucosa re-synthesize these into neutral fats. This pathway also passes via DAG (enzyme: acylglycerolpalmitoyl transferase 2.3.1.22). [9] Transfer of a CMP residue gives rise first to CDP-diacylglycerol (enzyme: phosphatida- tecytidyl transferase 2.3.1.22). [10] Substitution of the CMP residue by inositol then provides phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns;enzyme: CDPdiacylglycerolinositol-3- phosphatidyl transferase 2.7.8.11). [12] An additional phosphorylation (en- zyme: phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate kin- ase 2.7.1.68) finally provides phosphaditylino- sitol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2,PtdIns(4,5)P2). PIP2 is the precursor for the second messen- gers 2,3-diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol- 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3,IP3; see p. 367).

Biosynthesis of fats and phospholipids 171Lipid Metabolism Biosynthesis of cholesterol Cholesterol is a major constituent of the cell membranes of animal cells (see p. 216). It wouldbepossiblefor thebodyto provide its full daily cholesterol requirement (ca. 1 g) by synthesizing it itself. However, with a mixed diet, only about half of the cholesterol is de- rived from endogenous biosynthesis,which takes place in the intestine and skin, and mainly in the liver (about 50%). The rest is taken up from food. Most of the cholesterol is incorporated into the lipid layer of plasma membranes, or converted into bile acids (see p. 314). A very small amount of cholesterol is used for biosynthesis of the steroid hormones (see p. 376). In addition, up to 1 g cholesterol per day is released into the bile and thus excreted. A. Cholesterol biosynthesis \u0003 Cholesterol is one of the isoprenoids, synthe- sis of which starts from acetyl CoA (see p. 52). In a long and complex reaction chain, the C27 sterol is built up from C2 components. The biosynthesis of cholesterol can be divided into four sections. In the first (1), mevalonate, aC6 compound, arises from three molecules of acetyl CoA. In the second part (2), mevalonate is converted into isopen- tenyl diphosphate, the “active isoprene.” In the third part (3), six of these C5 molecules are linked to produce squalene, aC30 com- pound. Finally, squalene undergoes cycliza- tion, with three C atoms being removed, to yield cholesterol (4). The illustration only shows the most important intermediates in biosynthesis. (1) Formation of mevalonate. The conver- sion of acetyl CoA to acetoacetyl CoA and then to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (3-HMG CoA) corresponds to the biosynthetic path- way for ketone bodies (details on p. 312). In this case, however, the synthesis occurs not in the mitochondria as in ketone body synthesis, but in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. In the next step, the 3-HMG group is cleaved from the CoA and at the same time reduced to mevalonate with the help of NADPH+H +. 3- HMG CoA reductase is the key enzyme in cho- lesterol biosynthesis. It is regulated by repres- sion of transcription (effectors: oxysterols such as cholesterol) and by interconversion (effectors: hormones). Insulin and thyroxine stimulate the enzyme and glucagon inhibits it by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. A large supply of cholesterol from food also inhibits 3-HMG-CoA reductase. (2) Formation of isopentenyl diphosphate. After phosphorylation, mevalonate is decar- boxylated to isopentenyl diphosphate, with consumption of ATP. Thisisthe component from which all of the isoprenoids are built (see p. 53). (3) Formation of squalene. Isopentenyl diphosphate undergoes isomerization to form dimethylallyl diphosphate. The two C5 molecules condense to yield geranyl diphos- phate, and the addition of another isopen- tenyl diphosphate produces farnesyl diphos- phate. This can then undergo dimerization, in a head-to-head reaction, to yield squalene. Farnesyl diphosphate is also the starting- point for other polyisoprenoids, such as doli- chol (see p. 230) and ubiquinone (see p. 52). (4) Formation of cholesterol. Squalene, a linear isoprenoid, is cyclized, with O2 being consumed, to form lanosterol, a C30 sterol. Three methyl groups are cleaved from this in the subsequent reaction steps, to yield the end product cholesterol. Some of these reac- tions are catalyzed by cytochrome P450 sys- tems (see p. 318). The endergonic biosynthetic pathway de- scribed above is located entirely in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The energy needed comes from the CoA derivatives used and from ATP. The reducing agent in the formation of mevalonate and squalene, as well as in the final steps of cholesterol biosynthesis, is NADPH+H +. The division of the intermediates of the reaction pathway into three groups is charac- teristic: CoA compounds, diphosphates, and highly lipophilic, poorly soluble compounds (squalene to cholesterol), which are bound to sterol carriers in the cell. 172 Metabolism P P A A PP P A S N A P PN A P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P A S A S A PP P PP A P P 2 2 C2 C6 C5 C30 C273x 6x 2 CO2 1 HCOOH R NADPH+H NADP N A P O2 + H2O + N A P N A P x O2 + x x H2O + x N A P 2 2 1 1 2 3 3 4 1C 2 3C 4 CO2 P P 3x H3CC O OOC CH2 CCH2 CH3 OH C O OOC CH2 CCH2 CH3 OH CH2OH O O O O OOC CH2 CCH2 CH3 OH CH2OH O C H2C CH3 HO HO OOC CH2 CCH2 CH3 OH CH2 O Squalene Acetyl CoA 3-Hydroxy- 3-methyl- glutaryl CoA Mevalonyl diphosphate Key enzyme Dimethylallyl diphosphate Geranyl diphosphate Farnesyl diphosphate Lanosterol Acetyl CoA Mevalonate Isopentenyl diphosphate Squalene Cholesterol Insulin Thyroxin Glucagon Cholesterol Isopentenyl diphosphate Multiple steps Isopentenyl diphosphateMevalonate Mevalonate Two steps A. Cholesterol biosynthesis Cholesterol Squalene HMG-CoA reductase 1.1.1.34 173Lipid Metabolism Protein metabolism: overview Quantitatively, proteins are the most impor- tant group of endogenous macromolecules. A person weighing 70 kg contains about 10 kg protein, with most of it located in muscle. By comparison, the proportion made up by other nitrogencontaining compounds is minor. The organism’s nitrogen balance is therefore pri- marily determined by protein metabolism. Several hormones—mainly testosterone and cortisol—regulate the nitrogen balance (see p. 374). A. Protein metabolism: overview \u0001 In adults, the nitrogen balance is generally in equilibrium—i. e., the quantities of protein ni- trogen taken in and excreted per day are ap- proximately equal. If only some of the nitro- gen taken in is excreted again, then the bal- ance is positive. This is the case during growth, for example. Negative balances are rare and usually occur due to disease. Proteins taken up in food are initially bro- kendowninthe gastrointestinal tract into amino acids, which are resorbed and distrib- uted in the organism via the blood (see p. 266). The human body is not capable of synthesizing 8–10 of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids it requires (see p. 60). These amino acids are essential, and have to be sup- pliedfrom food(seep. 184). Proteins are constantly being lost via the intestine and, to a lesser extent, via the kid- neys. To balance these inevitable losses, at least 30 g of protein have to be taken up with food every day. Although this minimum value is barely reached in some countries, in the industrial nations the protein content of food is usually much higher than necessary. As it is not possible to store amino acids, up to 100 g of excess amino acids per day are used forbiosynthesisordegradedin the liverin this situation. The nitrogen from this excess is convertedinto urea (seep. 182) andex- creted in the urine in this form. The carbon skeletons are used to synthesize carbohy- drates or lipids (see p. 180), or are used to form ATP. It is thought that adults break down 300–400 g of protein per day into amino acids (proteolysis). On the other hand, ap- proximately the same amount of amino acids is reincorporated into proteins (protein bio- synthesis). The body’s high level of protein turnover is due to the fact that many proteins are relatively short-lived. On average, their half-lives amount to 2–8 days. The key en- zymes of the intermediary metabolism have even shorter half-lives. They are sometimes broken down only a few hours after being synthesized, and are replaced by new mole- cules. This constant process of synthesis and degradation makes it possible for the cells to quickly adjust the quantities, and therefore the activity, of important enzymes in order to meet current requirements. By contrast, structural proteins such as the histones, he- moglobin, and the components of the cyto- skeleton are particularly long-lived. Almost all cells are capable of carrying out biosynthesis of proteins (top left). The forma- tion of peptide chains by translation at the ribosome is described in greater detail on pp. 250–253. However, the functional forms of most proteins arise only after a series of additional steps. To begin with, supported by auxiliary proteins, the biologically active con- formation of the peptide chain has to be formed (folding; see pp. 74, 232). During subsequent “post-translational” maturation, many proteins remove part of the peptide chain again and attach additional groups— e. g., oligosaccharides or lipids. These pro- cesses take place in the endoplasmic reticu- lum and in the Golgi apparatus (see p. 232). Finally, the proteins have to be transported to their site of action (sorting; see p. 228). Some intracellular protein degradation (proteolysis) takes place in the lysosomes (see p. 234). In addition, there are protein complexes in the cytoplasm, known as pro- teasomes, in which incorrectly folded or old proteins are degraded. These molecules are recognized by a special marking (see p. 176). The proteasome also plays an important part in the presentation of antigens by immune cells (see p. 296). 174 Metabolism A PP P 100 gProtein synthesis (300–400 g/day)Proteolysis (300–400 g/day) Proteasome Lysosome Peptide Intestine 10g/day Kidney Marking Degradation Degradation 50–100 g/day Degradation Food 50–100 g/day NH3 CO2, H2O Ketone bodies As required De-novo synthesis LipidsGlucose Urea Pyruvate Phosphoenolpyruvate 3-Phosphoglycerate 2-Oxoacids Sugar phosphates Digestion Functional proteins Maturation Folding Translation 50 g/day Protein secretion Up to 150 g/day 2-Oxo- acids Excess amino acids Amino acids A. Protein metabolism: overview Amino acid pool Resorption Sugars ATP 10 000 g 175Protein Metabolism Proteolysis A. Proteolytic enzymes \u0002 Combinations of several enzymes with differ- ent specificities are required for complete degradation of proteins into free amino acids. Proteinases and peptidases are found not only in the gastrointestinal tract (see p. 268), but also inside the cell (see below). The proteolytic enzymes are classified into endopeptidases and exopeptidases,according to their site of attack in the substrate mole- cule. The endopeptidases or proteinases cleave peptide bonds inside peptide chains. They “recognize” and bind to short sections of the substrate’s sequence, and then hydrolyze bonds between particular amino acid residues in a relatively specific way (see p. 94). The proteinases are classified according to their reaction mechanism. In serine proteinases, for example (see C), a serine residue in the enzyme is important for catalysis, while in cysteine proteinases, it is a cysteine residue, and so on. The exopeptidases attack peptides from their termini. Peptidases that act at the N terminus are known as aminopeptidases, while those that recognize the C terminus are called carboxypeptidases.The dipepti- dases only hydrolyze dipeptides. B. Proteasome \u0003 The functional proteins in the cell have to be protected in order to prevent premature deg- radation. Some of the intracellularly active proteolytic enzymes are therefore enclosed in lysosomes (see p. 234). The proteinases that act there are also known as cathepsins. Another carefully regulated system for pro- tein degradation is located in the cytoplasm. This consists of large protein complexes (mass 2 106 Da), the proteasomes.Proteasomes contain a barrel-shaped core consisting of 28 subunits that has a sedimentation coef cient (see p. 200) of 20 S. Proteolytic activity (shown here by the scissors) is localized in the interior of the 20-S core and is therefore protected. The openings in the barrel are sealed by 19-S particles with a complex struc- ture that control access to the core. Proteins destined for degradation in the proteasome (e. g., incorrectly folded or old molecules) are marked by covalent linkage with chains of the small protein ubiquitin. The ubiquitin is previously activated by the introduction of reactive thioester groups. Molecules marked with ubiquitin (“ubiquiti- nated”) are recognized by the 19S particle, unfolded usingATP,and then shiftedinto the interior of the nucleus, where degradation takes place. Ubiquitin is not degraded, but is reused after renewed activation. C. Serine proteases \u0003 A large group of proteinases contain serine in their active center. The serine proteases in- clude, for example, the digestive enzymes trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase (see pp. 94 and 268), many coagulation factors (see p. 290), and the fibrinolytic enzyme plas- min and its activators (see p. 292). As described on p. 270, pancreatic protein- ases are secreted as proenzymes (zymogens). Activation of these is also based on proteolytic cleavages. This is illustrated here in detail us- ing the example of trypsinogen,the precursor of trypsin (1). Activation of trypsinogen starts with cleavage of an N-terminal hexapeptide by enteropeptidase (enterokinase), a specific serine proteinase that is located in the mem- brane of the intestinal epithelium. The cleav- age product (β-trypsin) is already catalytically active, and it cleaves additional trypsinogen moleculesat the sitesmarkedin red in the illustration (autocatalytic cleavage). The pre- cursors of chymotrypsin, elastase, and car- boxypeptidase A, among others, are also acti- vated by trypsin. The active center of trypsin is shown in Fig. 2. A serine residue in the enzyme (Ser- 195), supported by a histidine residue and an aspartate residue (His-57, Asp-102), nucle- ophilically attacks the bond that is to be cleaved(redarrow). Thecleavagesitein the substrate peptide is located on the C-terminal side of a lysine residue, the side chain of which is fixed in a special “binding pocket” of the enzyme (left) during catalysis (see p. 94). 176 Metabolism H3N COO COO H3N COO H3N A A 1 2 A.

In contrast to carbon, amino ni- trogen is not suitable for oxidative energy production. If they are not being reused for biosynthesis, the amino groups of amino acids are therefore incorporated into urea (see p. 182) andexcretedin this form. A. Transamination and deamination \u0002 Among the NH2 transfer reactions, trans- aminations (1) are particularly important. They are catalyzed by transaminases,and oc- cur in both catabolic and anabolic amino acid metabolism. During transamination, the amino group of an amino acid (amino acid 1) is transferred to a 2-oxoacid (oxoacid 2). From the amino acid, this produces a 2-oxo- acid (a), while from the original oxoacid, an amino acidisformed(b).The NH2 group is temporarily taken over by enzyme-bound pyridoxal phosphate (PLP; see p. 106), which thus becomes pyridoxamine phosphate. If the NH2 is released as ammonia, the process is referred to as deamination.There are different mechanisms for this (see p. 180). A particularly important one is oxidative deamination (2). In this reaction, the α-amino group is initially oxidized into an imino group (2a), and the reducing equivalents are trans- ferred to NAD + or NADP+. In the second step, the imino group is then cleaved by hydrolysis. As in transamination, this produces a 2-oxo- acid (C). Oxidative deamination mainly takes placein the liver, whereglutamate is broken down in this way into 2-oxoglutarate and ammonia, catalyzed by glutamate dehydro- genase. The reverse reaction initiates biosyn- thesis of the amino acids in the glutamate family (see p. 184). B. Mechanism of transamination \u0003 In the absence of substrates, the aldehyde group of pyridoxal phosphate is covalently bound to a lysine residue of the transaminase (1). This type of compound is known as an aldimine or “Schiff’s base.” During the reac- tion, amino acid 1 (A, 1a) displaces the lysine residue, and a new aldimine is formed (2). The double bond is then shifted by isomerization. The ketimine (3) is hydrolyzed to yield the 2- oxoacid and pyridoxamine phosphate (4). In the second part of the reaction (see A, 1b), these steps take place in the opposite direction: pyridoxamine phosphate and the second 2-oxoacid form a ketimine, which is isomerized into aldimine. Finally, the second amino acid is cleaved and the coenzyme is regenerated. C. NH3 metabolism in the liver \u0002 In addition to urea synthesis itself (see p. 182), the precursors NH3 and aspartate are also mainly formed in the liver. Amino nitro- gen arising in tissue is transported to the liver by the blood, mainly in the form of glutamine (Gln) and alanine (Ala; see p. 338). In the liver, Gln is hydrolytically deaminated by glutami- nase [3] into glutamate (Glu) and NH3.The amino group of the alanine is transferred by alanine transaminase [1] to 2-oxoglutarate (2- OG; formerly known as α-ketoglutarate). This transamination (A)produces another gluta- mate. NH3 is finally released from glutamate by oxidative deamination (A). This reaction is catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase [4], a typical liver enzyme. Aspartate (Asp), the sec- ond amino group donor in the urea cycle, also arises from glutamate. The aspartate transaminase [2] responsible for this reaction is found with a high level of activity in the liver, as is alanine transaminase [1]. Transaminases are also found in other tis- sues, from which they leak from the cells into the blood when injury occurs. Measurement of serum enzyme activity (serum enzyme di- agnosis;see also p. 98)is animportant method of recognizing and monitoring the course of such injuries. Transaminase activity in the blood is for instance important for di- agnosing liver disease (e. g., hepatitis) and myocardial disease (cardiac infarction). 178 Metabolism 2. 3. a b H2O PLP b a NH4 1.

NH3 metabolism in the liver 179Protein Metabolism Amino acid degradation A large number of metabolic pathways are available for amino acid degradation, and an overview of these is presented here. Further details are given on pp. 414 and 415. A. Amino acid degradation : overview \u0002 During the degradation of most amino acids, the α-amino group is initially removed by transamination or deamination.Various mechanisms are available for this, and these are discussed in greater detail in B.The carbon skeletons that are left over after deamination undergofurther degradationinvarious ways. During degradation, the 20 proteinogenic amino acids produce only seven different degradation products (highlighted in pink and violet). Five of these metabolites (2-oxo- glutarate, succinyl CoA, fumarate, oxaloace- tate, and pyruvate) are precursors for gluco- neogenesis and can therefore be converted into glucose by the liver and kidneys (see p. 154). Amino acids whose degradation sup- plies one of these five metabolites are there- fore referred to as glucogenic amino acids. The first four degradation products listed are already intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, while pyruvate can be converted into oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase and thus made available for gluconeogenesis (green arrow). With two exceptions (lysine and leucine; see below), all of the proteinogenic amino acids are also glucogenic. Quantitatively, they represent the most important precursors for gluconeogenesis. At the same time, they also have an anaplerotic effect—i. e., they re- plenish the tricarboxylic acid cycle in order to feed the anabolic reactions that originate in it (see p. 138). Two additional degradation products (ace- toacetate and acetyl CoA) cannot be chan- neled into gluconeogenesis in animal metab- olism, as there is no means of converting them into precursors of gluconeogenesis. However, they can be used to synthesize ke- tone bodies, fatty acids, and isoprenoids. Amino acids that supply acetyl CoA or aceto- acetate are therefore known as ketogenic amino acids. Only leucine and lysine are purely ketogenic. Several amino acids yield degradation products that are both glucogenic and ketogenic. This group includes phenylala- nine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and isoleucine. Degradation of acetoacetate to acetyl CoA takes place in two steps (not shown). First, acetoacetate and succinyl CoA are converted into acetoacetyl CoA and succinate (enzyme: 3-oxoacid-CoA transferase 2.8.3.5). Acetoacetyl CoAis then brokendownby β-oxidation into two molecules of acetyl CoA (see p. 164), while succinate can be further metabolized via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. B. Deamination \u0003 There are various ways of releasing ammonia (NH3) from amino acids, and these are illus- trated here using the example of the amino acids glutamine, glutamate, alanine, and ser- ine. [1] In the branched-chain amino acids (Val, Leu, Ile) and also tyrosine and ornithine, deg- radation starts with a transamination. For ala- nine and aspartate, this is actually the only degradation step. The mechanism of transa- mination is discussed in detail on p. 178. [2] Oxidative deamination,withthe forma- tion of NADH+H +, only applies to glutamate in animal metabolism. The reaction mainly takes place in the liver and releases NH3 for urea formation (see p. 178). [3] Two amino acids—asparagine and glu- tamine—contain acid–amide groups in the side chains, from which NH3 can be released by hydrolysis (hydrolytic deamination). In the blood, glutamine is the most important trans- port molecule for amino nitrogen. Hydrolytic deamination of glutamine in the liver also supplies the urea cycle with NH3. [4] Eliminating deamination takes place in the degradation of histidine and serine. H2Ois first eliminated here, yielding an unsaturated intermediate. In the case of serine, this inter- mediate is first rearranged into an imine (not shown), which is hydrolyzed in the second step into NH3 and pyruvate, with H2Obeing taken up. H2O does not therefore appear in the reaction equation. 180 Metabolism COO )(CH22 COO CHH3N 2-OG Glu Ala Gln Ser H2O Pyr 4 3 2 1 NA N ANH4 NH4 4 3 2 1 H3 H3N C C COO CO )(CH22 H2 COO CHH3N N H3N H H2 OH C C COO H3 C C COO O ) C (CH2 COO COO O 2 NADH+H NAD H B.

Ammonia is released either directly or indirectly in the process (see p. 178). The deg- radation of nucleobases also provides signifi- cant amounts of ammonia (see p. 186). Ammonia (NH3) is a relatively strong base, and at physiological pH values it is mainly present in the form of the ammonium ion NH4 + (see p. 30). NH3 and NH4 + are toxic, and at higher concentrations cause brain damage in particular. Ammonia therefore has to be effectively inactivated and excreted. This can be carried out in various ways. Aquatic ani- mals can excrete NH4 + directly. For example, fish excrete NH4 + via the gills (ammonotelic animals). Terrestrial vertebrates, including humans, hardly excrete any NH3,and instead, most ammonia is converted into urea before excretion (ureotelic animals). Birds and rep- tiles, by contrast, form uric acid, which is mainly excreted as a solid in order to save water (uricotelic animals). The reasons for the neurotoxic effects of ammonia have not yet been explained. It may disturb the metabolism of glutamate and its precursor glutamine in the brain (see p. 356). A. Urea cycle \u0002 Urea (H2N–CO–NH2) is the diamide of car- bonic acid. In contrast to ammonia, it is neu- tral and therefore relatively non-toxic.The reason for the lack of basicity is the molecule’s mesomeric characteristics. The free electron pairs of the two nitrogen atoms are delocal- ized over the whole structure, and are there- fore no longer able to bind protons. As a small, uncharged molecule, urea is able to cross bio- logical membranes easily. In addition, it is easily transported in the blood and excreted in the urine. Urea is produced only in the liver, in a cyclic sequence of reactions (the urea cycle)that starts in the mitochondria and continues in the cytoplasm. The two nitrogen atoms are derived from NH4+ (the second has previously been incorporated into aspartate; see below). The keto group comes from hydrogen carbo- nate (HCO3–), or CO2 that is in equilibrium with HCO3–. [1] In the first step, carbamoyl phosphate is formed in the mitochondria from hydrogen carbonate (HCO3–)and NH4+,with two ATP molecules being consumed. In this com- pound, the carbamoyl residue (–O–CO–NH2) is at a high chemical potential. In hepatic mitochondria, enzyme [1] makes up about 20% of the matrix proteins. [2] In the next step, the carbamoyl residue is transferred to the non-proteinogenic amino acid ornithine,convertingitinto citrulline, which is also non-proteinogenic. This is passed into the cytoplasm via a transporter. [3] The second NH2 group of the later urea molecule is provided by aspartate,which condenses with citrulline into argininosucci- nate. ATP is cleaved into AMP and diphos- phate (PPi) for this endergonic reaction. To shift the equilibrium of the reaction to the side of the product, diphosphate is removed from the equilibrium by hydrolysis. [4] Cleavage of fumarate from argininosuc- cinate leads to the proteinogenic amino acid arginine, which is synthesized in this way in animal metabolism. [5] In the final step, isourea is released from the guanidinium group of the arginine by hydrolysis (not shown), and is immedi- ately rearranged into urea. In addition, orni- thine is regenerated and returns via the orni- thine transporter into the mitochondria, whereitbecomes availablefor thecycle once again. The fumarate produced in step [4] is con- verted via malate to oxaloacetate [6, 7], from which aspartate is formed again by transami- nation [9]. The glutamate required for reac- tion [9] is derived from the glutamate dehy- drogenase reaction [8], which fixes the sec- ond NH4+ in an organic bond. Reactions [6] and [7] also occur in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, in urea formation they take place in the cytoplasm, where the appropriate isoenzymes are available. The rate of urea formation is mainly con- trolled by reaction [1]. N-acetyl glutamate,as an allosteric effector, activates carbamoyl- phosphate synthase. In turn, the concentration of acetyl glutamate depends on arginine and ATP levels, as well as other factors. 182 Metabolism NH4 A PP P P NA N A N A PP A P A PP P A PP P 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 7 2 2 6 8 HCO3 NH4 H2O P 4 3 9 5 H2O COO C CH2 CH2 CH2 N CH HH3N NH2 HN C H COOCH2OOC C H2N ONH2 H2O COO C C COO H H COO C CH2 CH2 CH2 N H HH HH3N COO C CH2 CH2 CH2 N CH HH3N NH2 H2N C NH2 O COO C CH2 CH2 CH2 N CH HH3N NH2 O COO CH2 C COO HOH COO CH2 C COO O CH2 CH2 C COO NH3 COO H CH2 CH2 C COO O COO COO CH2 C COO NH3H Transporter Ornithine carbamoyltransferase 2.1.3.3 Carbamoyl phosphate synthase (NH3) 6.3.4.16 Argininosuccinate synthase 6.3.4.5 Argininosuccinate lyase 4.3.2.1 Arginase 3.5.3.1 Fumarate hydratase 4.2.1.2 Malate dehydrogenase 1.1.1.37 Glutamate dehydrogenase 1.4.1.2 Aspartate transaminase [PLP]CytoplasmMitochondrion A.

Symbiotic nitrogen fixation \u0003 Practically unlimited quantities of elementary nitrogen (N2) are present in the atmosphere. However, before it can enter the natural nitro- gen cycle, it has to be reduced to NH3 and incorporated into amino acids (“fixed”). Only a few species of bacteria and bluegreen algae are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. These exist freely in the soil, or in symbiosis with plants. The symbiosis between bacteria of the genus Rhizobium and legumes (Fabales)—such as clover, beans, and peas—is of particular economic importance. These plants are high in protein and are therefore nutritionally valuable. In symbiosis with Fabales,bacteria liveas bacteroids in root nodules inside the plant cells. The plant supplies the bacteroids with nutrients, but it also benefits from the fixed nitrogen that the symbionts make available. The N2-fixing enzyme used by the bacteria is nitrogenase. It consists of two components: an Fe protein that contains an [Fe4S4]cluster as a redox system (see p. 106), accepts elec- trons from ferredoxin, and donates them to the second component, the Fe–Mo protein. This molybdenum-containing protein trans- fers the electrons to N2 and thus, via various intermediate steps, produces ammonia (NH3). Some of the reducing equivalents are trans- ferred in a side-reaction to H +. In addition to NH3, hydrogen is therefore always produced as well. B. Amino acid biosynthesis: overview \u0002 The proteinogenic amino acids (see p. 60) can be divided into five families in relation to their biosynthesis. The members of each fam- ily are derived from common precursors, which are all produced in the tricarboxylic acid cycle or in catabolic carbohydrate metab- olism. An overview of the biosynthetic path- ways is shown here; further details are given on pp. 412 and 413. Plants and microorganisms are able to syn- thesize all of the amino acids from scratch, but during the course of evolution, mammals have lost the ability to synthesize approxi- mately half of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids. These essential amino acids therefore have to be supplied in food. For example, animal metabolism is no longer capable of carrying out de-novo synthesis of the aro- matic amino acids (tyrosine is only non-es- sential because it can be formed from phenyl- alanine when there is an adequate supply available). The branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, isoleucine, and threonine) as well as methionine and lysine,also belongto the essential amino acids. Histidine and argi- nine are essential in rats; whether the same applies in humans is still a matter of debate. A supply of these amino acids in food appears to be essential at least during growth. The nutritional value of proteins (see p. 360) is decisively dependent on their es- sential amino acid content. Vegetable pro- teins—e. g., those from cereals—are low in ly- sine and methionine, while animal proteins contain all the amino acids in balanced pro- portions. As mentioned earlier, however, there are also plants that provide high-value protein. These include the soy bean, one of the plants that is supplied with NH3 by symbiotic N2 fixers (A). Non-essential amino acids are those that arise by transamination from 2-oxoacids in the intermediary metabolism. These belong to the glutamate family (Glu, Gln, Pro, Arg, derived from 2-oxoglutarate), the aspartate family (only Asp and Asn in this group, de- rived from oxaloacetate), and alanine,which can be formed by transamination from pyru- vate. The amino acids in the serine family (Ser, Gly, Cys) and histidine,which arise from in- termediates of glycolysis, can also be synthe- sized by the human body. 184 Metabolism 4 2 per 8 H N2 H2 P P A A PP P P N A N A 2 NH3 2 4 e * * * * * * * * * Vascular bundle Root nodule Bacteroids Ferredoxin Fe-Protein [Fe4S4] Nitrogenase 1.18.6.1 Iron-molyb- denum cofactor Host cell FeMo-Protein [Fe4S4], [FeMoCo] Air Soil N2 Ammonia A.

Nucleotide biosynthesis is elab- orate and requires a high energy input (see p. 188). Understandably, therefore, bases and nucleotides are not completely degraded, but instead mostly recycled. This is particularly true of the purine bases adenine and guanine. In the animal organism, some 90% of these bases are converted back into nucleoside monophosphates by linkage with phosphori- bosyl diphosphate (PRPP) (enzymes [1] and [2]). The proportion of pyrimidine bases that are recycled is much smaller. A. Degradation of nucleotides \u0002 The principles underlying the degradation of purines (1) and pyrimidines (2) differ. In the human organism, purines are degraded into uric acid and excreted in this form. The purine ring remains intact in this process. In contrast, the ring of the pyrimidine bases (uracil, thy- mine, and cytosine) is broken down into small fragments, which can be returned to the me- tabolism or excreted (for further details, see p. 419). Purine (left). Thepurinenucleotide guano- sine monophosphate (GMP, 1)is degradedin two steps—first to the guanosine and then to guanine (Gua). Guanine is converted by de- amination into another purine base, xanthine. In the most important degradative path- way for adenosine monophosphate (AMP), it is thenucleotidethatdeaminated, and inosine monophosphate (IMP) arises. In the same way as in GMP, the purine base hypoxanthine is released from IMP. A single enzyme, xanthine oxidase [3], then both converts hypoxanthine into xanthine and xanthine into uric acid.An oxo group is introduced into the substrate in each of these reaction steps. The oxo group is derived from molecular oxygen; another reac- tion product is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is toxic and has to be removed by peroxidases. Almost all mammals carry out further deg- radation of uric acid with the help of uricase, with further opening of the ring to allantoin, which is then excreted. However, the pri- mates, including humans, are not capable of synthesizing allantoin. Uric acid is therefore the form of the purines excreted in these species. Thesameapplies to birds and many reptiles. Most other animals continue purine degradation to reach allantoic acid or urea and glyoxylate. Pyrimidine (right). In the degradation of pyrimidine nucleotides (2), thefreebases ura- cil (Ura) and thymine (Thy) are initially re- leased as important intermediates. Both are further metabolized in similar ways. The pyri- midine ring is first reduced and then hydro- lytically cleaved. In the next step, -alanine arises by cleavage of CO2 and NH3 as the degradation product of uracil. When there is further degradation, -alanine is broken down to yield acetate, CO2,and NH3. Propio- nate, CO2,and NH3 arise in a similar way from -aminoisobutyrate, the degradation product of thymine(seep. 419). B. Hyperuricemia \u0003 The fact that purine degradation in humans already stops at the uric acid stage can lead to problems, since—in contrast to allantoin—uric acid is poorly soluble in water.When large amounts of uric acid are formed or uric acid processing is disturbed, excessive concentra- tions of uric acid can develop in the blood (hyperuricemia). This canresult inthe accu- mulation of uric acid crystals in the body. Deposition of these crystals in the joints can cause very painful attacks of gout. Most cases of hyperuricemia are due to disturbed uric acid excretion via the kidneys (1). A high-purine diet (e. g., meat) may also have unfavorable effects (2). A rare hereditary disease, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, results from a defect in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl- transferase (A,enzyme[1]). Theimpaired re- cycling of the purine bases caused by this leads to hyperuricemia and severe neurolog- ical disorders. Hyperuricemia can be treated with allopurinol, a competitive inhibitor of xan- thine oxidase. This substrate analogue differs from the substrate hypoxanthine only in the arrangement of the atoms in the 5-ring. 186 Metabolism 1. 2.

Hyperuricemia (gout) 187Nucleotide Metabolism Purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis The bases occurring in nucleic acids are de- rivatives of the aromatic heterocyclic com- pounds purine and pyrimidine (see p. 80). The biosynthesis of these molecules is com- plex, but is vital for almost all cells. The syn- thesis of the nucleobases is illustrated here schematically. Complete reaction schemes are given on pp. 417 and 418. A. Components of nucleobases \u0003 The pyrimidine ring is made up of three com- ponents: the nitrogen atom N-1 and carbons C-4 to C-6 are derived from aspartate, carbon C-2 comes from HCO3-,and thesecondnitro- gen(N-3) is takenfrom the amide group of glutamine. The synthesis of the purine ring is more complex. The only major component is gly- cine, which donates C-4 and C-5, as well as N- 7. All of the other atoms in the ring are in- corporated individually. C-6 comes from HCO3–.Amide groups from glutamine provide the atoms N-3 and N-9. The amino group donor for the inclusion of N-1 is aspartate, which is converted into fumarate in the proc- ess, in thesameway as in the urea cycle (see p. 182). Finally, the carbon atoms C-2 and C-8 are derived from formyl groups in N10- formyl-tetrahydrofolate (see p. 108). B. Pyrimidine and purine synthesis \u0003 The major intermediates in the biosynthesis of nucleic acid components are the mononucleotides uridine monophosphate (UMP) in the pyrimidine series and inosine monophosphate (IMP, base: hypoxanthine) in the purines. The synthetic pathways for pyri- midines and purines are fundamentally dif- ferent. For the pyrimidines, the pyrimidine ring is first constructed and then linked to ribose 5\u0001-phosphate to form a nucleotide. By contrast, synthesis of the purines starts di- rectly from ribose 5\u0001-phosphate. The ring is then built up step by step on this carrier mol- ecule. The precursors for the synthesis of the pyrimidine ring are carbamoyl phosphate, which arises from glutamate and HCO3– (1a) and the amino acid aspartate. These two com- ponents are linked to N-carbamoyl aspartate (1b) and then converted into dihydroorotate by closure of the ring (1c). In mammals, steps 1a to 1c take place in the cytoplasm, and are catalyzed by a single multifunctional enzyme. In the next step (1d), dihydroorotate is oxi- dized to orotate by an FMN-dependent dehy- drogenase. Orotate is then linked with phos- phoribosyl diphosphate (PRPP) to form the nucleotide orotidine 5\u0001-monophosphate (OMP). Finally, decarboxylation yields uridine 5\u0001-monophosphate (UMP). Purine biosynthesis starts with PRPP (the names of the individual intermediates are givenon p. 417). Formationof the ring starts with transfer of an amino group, from which the later N-9 is derived (2a). Glycine and a formyl group from N10-formyl-THF then sup- ply the remaining atoms of the five-mem- bered ring (2b, 2c). Before the five-membered ring is closed (in step 2f), atoms N-3 and C-6 of the later six-membered ring are attached (2d, 2e). Synthesis of the ring then continues with N-1 and C-2 (2g, 2i). In the final step (2j), the six-membered ring is closed, and inosine 5\u0001-monophosphate arises. However, the IMP formed does not accumulate, but is rapidly converted into AMP and GMP. These reactions and the synthesis of the other nucleotides are discussed on p. 190. Further information The regulation of bacterial aspartate carbamoyltransferase by ATP and CTP has been particularly well studied, and is dis- cussed on p. 116. In animals, in contrast to prokaryotes, it is not ACTase but carbamoyl- phosphate synthase that is the key enzyme in pyrimidine synthesis. It is activated by ATP and PRPP and inhibited by UTP. The biosynthesis of the purines is also regulated by feedback inhibition. ADP and GDP inhibit the formation of PRRPP from ri- bose-5\u0001-phosphate. Similarly, step 2a is in- hibitedbyAMP andGMP. 188 Metabolism N 1d 1e 1f 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e, 2f 2i 2j N C C N C C C N C N C N C C C N C N C C C N C N C C N N C C C N C C N N C C N N C N C C N N C C N C C N N C C N N C C N N C C N C N C C N N C C N C N C C 2g, 2h 1a 1b 1c P R P R P P PR[NH2] HCO3 O P P RP RP RP R P P PR P R = P R C N C N C C C C C C C P R P R P R THF C N C N C C C N C N C C N N C THF THF THF COO H2C NH3 H3N OOC CH2 C H COO 1a 1 2g 2h 2f 2b CHO 2i 2c 2a2d [NH2] HCO3 Asp [NH2] [NH2] Gln Glu Gln Glu Gln Glu [NH2] [CHO] [CHO] OHC N10 HCO3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 N10 O CH2O OH OH HH HH P 5' 1' O CH2O OH OH H N H HH P CH CH C HN C O O O CH2O OH OH HH HH P C C N HC HN C N CH N O Carbamoyl phosphate Phosphoribosyl diphosphate Dihydro- orotate Orotate 5'-mono- phosphate Uridine 5'-mono- phosphate (UMP) Phosphoribosyl diphosphate 5'-Phosphoribosyl residueGlycine 2.

Pyrimidines Fumarate 189Nucleotide Metabolism Nucleotide biosynthesis De novo synthesis of purines and pyrimidines yields the monophosphates IMP and UMP, respectively (see p. 188). All other nucleotides and deoxynucleotides are synthesized from these two precursors. An overview of the pathways involved is presented here; further details are givenonp. 417. Nucleotide syn- thesis by recycling of bases (the salvage path- way) is discussed on p. 186. A. Nucleotide synthesis: overview \u0002 The synthesis of purine nucleotides (1)starts from IMP. The base it contains, hypoxanthine, is converted in two steps each into adenine or guanine. The nucleoside monophosphates AMP and GMP that are formed are then phos- phorylated by nucleoside phosphate kinases to yield the diphosphates ADP and GDP,and these are finally phosphorylated into the triphosphates ATP and GTP.The nucleoside triphosphates serve as components for RNA, or function as coenzymes (see p. 106). Con- version of the ribonucleotides into deoxyribo- nucleotides occurs at the level of the diphos- phates and is catalyzed by nucleoside diphos- phate reductase (B). The biosynthetic pathways for the pyrimi- dine nucleotides (2)are more complicated. The first product, UMP, is phosphorylated first to the diphosphate and then to the triphosphate, UTP. CTP synthase then converts UTP into CTP. Since pyrimidine nucleotides are also reduced to deoxyribonucleotides at the diphosphate level, CTP first has to be hy- drolyzed by a phosphatase to yield CDP before dCDP and dCTP can be produced. The DNA component deoxythymidine tri- phosphate (dTTP)is synthesized from UDP in several steps. The base thymine, which only occurs in DNA (see p. 80), is formed by meth- ylation of dUMP at the nucleoside monophos- phate level. Thymidylate synthase and its helper enzyme dihydrofolate reductase are important target enzymes for cytostatic drugs (see p. 402). B. Ribonucleotide reduction \u0003 2\u0001-Deoxyribose, a component of DNA, is not synthesized as a free sugar, but arises at the diphosphate level by reduction of ribonucleo- side diphosphates. This reduction is a com- plex process in which several proteins are involved. The reducing equivalents needed come from NADPH+H +. However, they are not transferred directly from the coenzyme to the substrate, but first pass through a redox series that has several steps (1). In the first step, thioredoxin reductase re- duces a small redox protein, thioredoxin,via enzyme-bound FAD. This involves cleavage of a disulfide bond in thioredoxin. The resulting SH groups in turn reduce a catalytically active disulfide bond in nucleoside diphosphate reductase (“ribonucleotide reductase”). The free SH groups formed in this way are the actual electron donors for the reduction of ribonucleotide diphosphates. In eukaryotes, ribonucleotide reductase is a tetramer consisting of two R1 and two R2 subunits. In addition to the disulfide bond mentioned, a tyrosine radical in the enzyme also participates in the reaction (2). It initially produces a substrate radical (3). This cleaves a water molecule and thereby becomes radical cation. Finally, the deoxyribose residue is pro- duced by reduction, and the tyrosine radical is regenerated. The regulation of ribonucleotide reductase is complex. The substrate-specificity and ac- tivity of the enzyme are controlled by two allosteric binding sites (a and b) in the R1 subunits. ATP and dATP increase or reduce the activity of the reductase by binding at site a. Other nucleotides interact with site b, and thereby alter the enzyme’s specificity. 190 Metabolism 1 dCDP AMP IMP GMP dGDPGDPdADP dGTPGTPdATP RNADNA ATP ADP RNA DNA RNADNA RNA DNA dUMPUMP dTMP UDP dUDP dTDP dTTPUTPCTPdCTP CDP 2 3 1 1 1 1 3 2 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 5 H2O N A P N A P S S SH SH SSHS SH NADPH +H NADP 6 2e , H 1 6 1 NDP dNDP S S S S R2R2 NTP NTP ATP dATP O O ATP dATP R1 R1 a b a b H H 2O 2 1 3 NDP dNDP O O HO OH Base HH P P O O HO H Base HH P P O OH O CH2R OH OH HH HH O CH2R OH OH HH H O CH2R OH H HH HH O CH2R OH HH H A.

Overview Base Base Base Base 191Nucleotide Metabolism Heme biosynthesis Heme, an iron-containing tetrapyrrole pig- ment, is a component of O2-binding proteins (see p. 106) and a coenzyme of various oxi- doreductases (see p. 32). Around 85% of heme biosynthesis occurs in the bone marrow, and a much smaller percentage is formed in the liver. Both mitochondria and cytoplasm are involved in heme synthesis. A. Biosynthesis of heme \u0003 Synthesis of the tetrapyrrole ring starts in the mitochondria. [1] Succinyl CoA (upper left), an intermedi- ate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, undergoes condensation with glycine and subsequent decarboxylation to yield 5-aminolevulinate (ALA). The ALA synthase responsible for this step is the key enzyme of the whole pathway. Synthesis of ALA synthase is repressed and existing enzyme is inhibited by heme, the end product of the pathway. This is a typical example of end-product or feedback inhibi- tion. [2] 5-Aminolevulinate now leaves the mi- tochondria. In the cytoplasm, two molecules condense to form porphobilinogen, acom- pound that already contains the pyrrole ring. Porphobilinogen synthase is inhibited by lead ions. This is why acute lead poisoning is asso- ciated with increased concentrations of ALA in the blood and urine. [3] The tetrapyrrole structure characteristic of the porphyrins is produced in the next steps of the synthetic pathway. Hydroxyme- thylbilane synthase catalyzes the linkage of four porphobilinogen molecules and cleavage of an NH2 group to yield uroporphyrinogen III. [4] Formation of this intermediate step re- quires a second enzyme, uroporphyrinogen III synthase. If this enzyme is lacking, the “wrong” isomer, uroporphyrinogen I, is formed. The tetrapyrrole structure of uroporphyri- nogen III is still very different from that of heme. For example, the central iron atom is missing, and the ring contains only eight of the 11 double bonds. In addition, the ring system only carries charged R side chains (four acetate and four propionate residues). As heme groups have to act in the apolar interior of proteins, most of the polar side chains have to be converted into less polar groups. [5] Initially, the four acetate residues (R1) are decarboxylated into methyl groups. The resulting coproporphyrinogen III returns to the mitochondria again. The subsequent steps are catalyzed by enzymes located either on or inside the inner mitochondrial membrane. [6] An oxidase first converts two of the propionate groups (R2)into vinyl residues. The formation of protoporphyrinogen IX com- pletes the modification of the side chains. [7] In the next step, another oxidation pro- duces the conjugated π-electron system of protoporphyrin IX. [8] Finally, a divalent iron is incorporated into the ring. This step also requires a specific enzyme, ferrochelatase. The heme b or Fe-pro- toporphyrin IX formed in this way is found in hemoglobin and myoglobin, for example (see p. 280), where it is noncovalently bound, and also in various oxidoreductases (see p. 106). Further information There are a large number of hereditary or acquired disturbances of porphyrin synthesis, known as porphyrias, some of which can causesevereclinical pictures. Several of these diseases lead to the excretion of heme pre- cursors in feces or urine, giving them a dark red color. Accumulation of porphyrins in the skin can also occur, and exposure to light then causes disfiguring, poorly healing blisters. Neurological disturbances are also common in the porphyrias. It is possible that the medieval legends about human vampires (“Dracula”) originated in the behavior of porphyria sufferers (avoid- ance of light, behavioral disturbances, and drinking of blood in order to obtain heme— which markedly improves some forms of por- phyria). 192 Metabolism 2 2 6[H] O2 2 H2O A S H2O 2 CO2 CO2 Fe2 4 CO2 4 NH4 4 31 2 (ALA) 4 2 3 2 2 1 1 5 5 2 1 8 7 6 5 2+ R A S R1 R1 R1 R3 R3 NN NN Fe 2+ R2 R1 R2 AB DC R1 R1 R1 R3 R3 NH HN HNNH R2 R1 R2 AB DC C CH2 CH2 COO O H2CCOO NH3 H2C NH3 C CH2 CH2 COO O CH2 C CH2 CH2 COO O NH3 CH3 R1 CH R2 CH2 CH2 R3 CH2 COO H2C NH3 C C N H CH C CH2CH2 OOC CH2 COO CH2 R3 CH2 COO CH2 R2 CH2 COO CH3 R1 CH2 R3 CH2 COO CH2 R2 CH2 COO CH2 R1 COO A.

Degradation of heme groups \u0003 Heme is mainly found in the human organism as a prosthetic group in erythrocyte hemoglo- bin. Around 100–200 million aged erythro- cytes per hour are brokendown inthe human organism. The degradation process starts in reticuloendothelial cells in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. [1] After the protein part (globin) has been removed, thetetrapyrroleringof hemeis oxidatively cleaved between rings A and B by heme oxygenase. This reaction requires molecular oxygen and NADPH+H +,and pro- duces green biliverdin, aswell asCO(carbon monoxide) and Fe 2+, which remains available for further use (see p. 286). [2] In another redox reaction, biliverdin is reduced by biliverdin reductase to the orange- colored bilirubin. The color change from pur- ple to green to yellow can be easily observed in vivo in a bruise or hematoma. The color of heme and the other porphyrin systems (see p. 106) results from their numer- ous conjugated double bonds. Heme contains a cyclic conjugation (highlighted in pink) that is removed by reaction [1]. Reaction [2] breaks the π system down into two smaller separate systems (highlighted in yellow). For further degradation, bilirubin is trans- ported to the liver via the blood. As bilirubin is poorly soluble, it is bound to albumin for transport. Some drugs that alsobind toalbu- min can lead to an increase in free bilirubin. [3] The hepatocytes take up bilirubin from the blood and conjugate it in the endoplasmic reticulum with the help of UDP-glucuronic acid into themoreeasilysoluble bilirubin monoglucuronides and diglucuronides.To do this, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase forms ester- type bonds between the OH group at C-1 of glucuronic acid and the carboxyl groups in bilirubin (see p. 316). The glucuronides are then excreted by active transport into the bile, where they form what are known as the bile pigments. Glucuronide synthesis is the rate-deter- mining step in hepatic bilirubin metabolism. Drugs such as phenobarbital, for example, can induce both conjugate formation and the transport process. Some of the bilirubin conjugates are bro- kendownfurther in the intestine by bacterial -glucuronidases. The bilirubin released is then reduced further via intermediate steps into colorless stercobilinogen,some of which is oxidized again into orange to yellow-col- ored stercobilin. The end products of bile pig- ment metabolism in the intestine are mostly excreted in feces, but a small proportion is resorbed (enterohepatic circulation; see p. 314). Whenhighlevels ofheme degrada- tion are taking place, stercobilinogen appears as urobilinogen in the urine, where oxidative processes darken it to form urobilin. In addition to hemoglobin, other heme pro- teins (myoglobin, cytochromes, catalases, and peroxidases; see p. 32) also supply heme groups that are degraded via the same path- way. However, these contribute only about 10–15% to a total of ca. 250 mg of bile pig- ment formed per day. Further information Hyperbilirubinemias. An elevated bilirubin level (> 10 mg L –1)is known as hyperbiliru- binemia. When this is present, bilirubin dif- fuses from the blood into peripheral tissue and gives it a yellow color (jaundice). The easiest way of observing this is in the white conjunctiva of the eyes. Jaundice can have various causes. If in- creased erythrocyte degradation (hemolysis) produces more bilirubin, it causes hemolytic jaundice. If bilirubin conjugation in the liver is impaired—e. g., due to hepatitis or liver cir- rhosis—it leads to hepatocellular jaundice, which is associated with an increase in un- conjugated (“indirect”) bilirubin in the blood. By contrast, if there is a disturbance of bile drainage (obstructive jaundice, due to gall- stones or pancreatic tumors), then conjugated (“direct”) bilirubin in the blood increases. Neo- natal jaundice (physiologic jaundice) usually resolves after a few days by itself. In severe cases, however, unconjugated bilirubin can cross the blood–brain barrier and lead to brain damage (kernicterus). 194 Metabolism 1 3 2 P N A P N A 2 3 P P U 2 CO 3 O2 P N A3 P N A3 Fe23 H2O 2 1 1 ON H C H N H C H2 N H C H N H O CH3 CH CH2 CH3 CH2 CH2OOC CH2 H2CCOO CH3 CH3 CH CH2 BC D A NN NN Fe 2 CH3 R3 CH3R1 H3C R2 AB DC COOCOO A.

Comparison of prokaryotes and eukaryotes \u0001 Present-day living organisms can be divided into two large groups—the prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The prokaryotes are represented by bacteria (eubacteria and archaebacteria). These are almost all small unicellular organ- isms only a few microns (10 –6 m) in size. The eukaryotes include fungi, plants,and animals and comprise both unicellular and multicel- lular organisms. Multicellular eukaryotes are made up of a wide variety of cell types that are specialized for different tasks. Eukaryotic cells are muchlarger thanprokaryotic ones (vol- ume ratio approximately 2000 : 1). The most important distinguishing feature of these cells in comparison with the prokaryotes is the fact that they have a nucleus (karyon in Greek—hence the term). In comparison with the prokaryotes, eu- karyotic cells have greater specialization and complexity in their structure and functioning. Eukaryotic cells are structured into compart- ments (see below). The metabolism and syn- thesis of macromolecules are distributed through these reaction spaces and are sepa- rately regulated. In prokaryotes, these func- tions are organized in a simpler fashion and are spatially closely related. Although the storage and transfer of ge- netic information function according to the same principle in the prokaryotes and euka- ryotes, there are also differences. Eukaryotic DNA consists of very long, linear molecules with a total of 10 7 to more than 10 10 base pairs (bp), only a small fraction of which are used for genetic information. In eukaryotes, the genes (20 000–50 000 per genome) are usu- ally interrupted by non-coding regions (in- trons). Eukaryotic DNA is located in the nu- cleus, where together with histones and other proteins it forms the chromatin (see p. 238). In prokaryotes, by contrast, DNA is ring- shaped, much shorter (up to 5 106 bp), and located in the cytoplasm. Almost all of it is used for information storage, and it does not contain any introns. B. Structure of an animal cell \u0001 In the human body alone, there are at least 200 different cell types. The illustration out- linesthe basicstructuresof an animal cell in an extremely simplified way. The details given regarding the proportion of the com- partments relative to cell volume (highlighted in yellow) and their numbers per cell fre- quency (blue) refer to mammalian hepato- cytes (liver cells). The figures can vary widely from cell type to cell type. The eukaryotic cell is subdivided by mem- branes. On the outside, it is enclosed by a plasma membrane. Inside the cell, there is a large space containing numerous components in solution—the cytoplasm. Additional mem- branes divide the internal space into compartments (confined reaction spaces). Welldefined compartments of this type are known as organelles. The largest organelle is the nucleus (see p. 208). It is easily recognized using the light microscope. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a closed network of shallow sacs and tubules (see pp. 226ff.), is linked with the outer mem- brane of the nucleus. Another membrane- bound organelle is the Golgi apparatus (see p. 228), which resembles a bundle of layered slices. The endosomes and exosomes are bub- ble-shaped compartments ( vesicles) that are involved in the exchange of substances be- tween the cell and its surroundings. Probably the most important organelles in the cell’s metabolism are the mitochondria, which are around the same size as bacteria (see pp. 210ff.). The lysosomes and peroxisomes are small, globular organelles that carry out specific tasks. The whole cell is traversed by a framework of proteins known as the cytoske- leton (see pp. 204ff.). In addition to these organelles, plant cells (see p. 43) also have plastids—eg., chloro- plasts, in which photosynthesis takes place (see p. 128). In their interior, there is a large, fluid-filled vacuole. Like bacteria and fungi, plant cells have a rigid cell wall consisting of polysaccharides and proteins. 196 Organelles 10-30 µm A.

Isolation of cell organelles \u0003 To investigate the individual compartments of thecell(seep. 196), various procedures have been developed to enrich and isolate cell or- ganelles. These are mainly based on the size and density of the various organelles. The isolation of cell components starts with disruption of thetissuebeing examined and subsequent homogenization of it (break- ing down the cells) in a suitable buffer (see below). Homogenization using the “Potter” (the Potter–Elvehjem homogenizer, a rotating Teflon pestle in a glass cylinder) is particularly suitable for animal tissue. This method is very gentle and is therefore used to isolate fragile structures and molecules. Other cell disrup- tion procedures include enzymatic lysis with the help of enzymes that break down the cell wall, mechanical disruption by grinding fro- zen tissue, cutting or smashing with rotating knives, large pressure changes, osmotic shock, and repeated freezing and thawing. To isolate intact organelles, it is important for the homogenization solution to be iso- tonic—i. e., theosmotic valueofthe buffer has to be the same as that of the interior of the cell. If hypotonic solutions were used, the organelles would take up water and burst, while in hypertonic solutions they would shrink. Homogenization is followed by coarse fil- tration through gauze to remove intact cells and connective-tissue fragments. The actual fractionation of cellular components is then carried out by centrifugation steps,in which the gravitational force (given as multiples of the earth’s gravity, g =9.81m s–2)is gradu- ally increased (differential centrifugation;see p. 200). Due to the different shapes and den- sities of the organelles, this leads to succes- sive sedimentation of each type out of the suspension. Nuclei alreadysedimentatlow accelera- tions that can be achieved with bench-top centrifuges. Decanting the residue (the “supernatant”) and carefully suspending the sediment (or “pellet”) inanisotonic medium yields a fraction that is enriched with nuclei. However, this fraction may still contain other cellular components as contaminants—e. g., fragments of the cytoskeleton. Particles that are smaller and less dense than the nuclei can be obtained by step-by- step acceleration of the gravity on the super- natant left over from the first centrifugation. However, this requires very powerful centri- fuges (high-speed centrifuges and ultracentri- fuges). The sequence in which the fractions are obtained is: mitochondria, membrane vesicles,and ribosomes. Finally, the superna- tant from the last centrifugation contains the cytosol with the cell’s soluble components, in addition to the buffer. The isolation steps are carried out at low temperatures on principle (usually 0–5 °C), to slow down degradation reactions—e. g., due to released enzymes and other influencing factors. The addition of thiols and chelating agents protects functional SH groups from oxidation. Isolated cell organelles quickly lose their biological activity despite these pre- cautions. Nevertheless, it is possible by work- ing carefully to isolate mitochondria that will still take up substrates for a few hours in the test tube and produce ATP via oxidative phos- phorylation. B. Marker molecules \u0003 During cell fractionation, it is very important to analyze the purity of the fractions obtained. Whetherornot the intendedorganelle is present in a particular fraction, and whether or not the fraction contains other compo- nents, can be determined by analyzing characteristic marker molecules. These are molecules that occur exclusively or predom- inantly in one type of organelle. For example, the activity of organelle-specific enzymes (marker enzymes) is often assessed. The dis- tribution of marker enzymes in the cell re- flects the compartmentation of the processes they catalyze. These reactions are discussed in greater detail here under the specific organ- elles. 198 Organelles A. Isolation of cell organelles B.

Principles of centrifugation \u0003 In a solution, particles whose density is higher than that of the solvent sink (sediment), and particles that are lighter than it float to the top. Thegreater thedifferencein density, the faster they move. If there is no difference in density (isopyknic conditions), the particles hover. To take advantage of even tiny differ- ences in density to separate various particles in a solution, gravity can be replaced with the much more powerful “centrifugal force” pro- vided by a centrifuge. Equipment. The acceleration achieved by centrifugation is expressed as a multiple of the earth’s gravitational force (g = 9.81 m s –2). Bench-top centrifuges can reach acceleration values of up to 15000 g,while highspeed refrigerated centrifuges can reach 50 000 g and ultracentrifuges, which operate with refrigeration and in a vacuum, can reach 500 000 g. Two types of rotor are available in high-powered centrifuges: fixed angle rotors and swingout rotors that have movable bucket containers. The tubes or buckets used for cen- trifugation are made of plastic and have to be very precisely adjusted to avoid any imbalan- ces that could lead to accidents. Theory. The velocity (v) of particle sedi- mentation during centrifugation depends on the angular velocity ω of the rotor, its effective radius (reff, the distance from the axis of rota- tion), and the particle’s sedimentation prop- erties. These properties are expressed as the sedimentation coef•cient S (1 Svedberg, =10 –13 s). The sedimentation coef cient de- pends on the mass M of the particle, its shape (expressed as the coef cient of friction, f), and its density (expressed as the reciprocal density v _ ,“partialspecific volume”). At the top right, the diagram shows the densities and sedimentation coef cients for biomolecules, cell organelles, and viruses. Proteins and protein-rich structures have densities of around 1.3 g cm –3, while nucleic acids show densities of up to 2 g cm –3.Equi- librium sedimentation of nucleic acids there- fore requires high-density media—e. g., con- centrated solutions of cesium chloride (CsCl). To allow comparison of S values measured in different media, they are usually corrected to values for water at 20 °C (“S20W”). B. Density gradient centrifugation \u0003 Density gradient centrifugation is used to separate macromolecules that differ only slightly in size or density. Two techniques are commonly used. In zonal centrifugation, the sample being separated (e. g., a cell extract or cells) is placed on top of the centrifugation solution as a thin layer. During centrifugation, the particles move through the solution due to their greater density. The rate of movement basi- cally depends on their molecular mass (see A, formulae). Centrifugation stops before the particles reach the bottom of the tube. Dril- ling a hole into the centrifugation tube and allowing the contents to drip out makes it possible to collect the different particles in separate fractions. During centrifugation, the solution tube is stabilized in the tube by a density gradient. Thisconsistsof solutions of carbohydrates or colloidal silica gel, the con- centration of which increases from the sur- face of the tube to the bottom. Density gra- dients prevent the formation of convection currents, which would impair the separation of the particles. Isopyknic centrifugation,which takes much longer, starts with a CsCl solution in which the sample material (e. g., DNA, RNA, or viruses) is homogeneously distributed. A density gradient only forms during centrifu- gation, as a result of sedimentation and dif- fusion processes. Each particle moves to the region corresponding to its own buoyant den- sity. Centrifugation stops once equilibrium has been reached. The samples are obtained by fractionation, and their concentration is measured using the appropriate methods. 200 Organelles 2.0 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.2 110 102 103 104 105 106 107 reff v: ω: v = ω2 · reff · s M · (1 - v · r) s = f g = ω2 · reff g: f : r : v : M: s: reff: 1 23456789 10 11 0 0.5 1 2 h 8 h0 2 4 1 234567890 Viruses Glycogen Ribosomes, Polysomes Nuclei RNA DNA Soluble proteins Mitochondria MicrosomesDensity (g · cm-3) Fixed angle rotor Swing-out bucket rotor Centrifuge bucket Swing-out centrifuge bucket Axis of rotation Sedimentation velocity (cm · s–1) Angular velocity (rad · s–1) Gravitational acceleration Coefficient of friction Density of the solution (g · cm3) Partial specific particle volume (cm3 · g–1) Molecular mass Sedimentation coefficient (S = 10–13 s) Fraction Probe Particles migrate according to S-value Sucrose density gradient After t = Fractionation Zonal centrifugation Particles distributed according to densityCentrifugation Isopyknic centrifugationConcentration Fraction Detection CsCl density gradient Centrifugation Sucrose or CsCl gradient Effective radius (cm) A.

The structure and char- acteristics of this organism have been partic- ularly well characterized. E. coli is also fre- quently used in genetic engineering (see p. 258). A. Components of a bacterial cell \u0002 Asingle E. coli cell has a volume of about 0.88 µm 3. One-sixth of this consists of mem- branes and one-sixth is DNA (known as the “nucleoid”). The rest of the internal space of the cell is known as cytoplasm (not “cytosol”; see p. 198). The main component of E. coli—as in all cells—is water (70%). The other components are macromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides), small organic molecules, and inorganic ions. The majority of the macro- molecules are proteins, which represent ca. 55% ofthe dry mass ofthe cell. When anum- ber of assumptions are made about the dis- tribution and size (average mass 40 kDa) of proteins, it can be estimated that there are approximately 250 000 protein molecules in the cytoplasm of an E. coli cell. In eukaryotic cells, which are about a thousand times larger, it is estimated that the number of protein molecules is in the order of several billion. B. Looking inside a bacterial cell \u0003 The illustration shows a schematic view in- side the cytoplasm of E. coli, magnified ap- proximately one million times. At this magni- fication, a single carbon atom would be the size of a grain of salt, and an ATP molecule would be as large as a grain of rice. The detail shown is 100 nm long, corresponding to about 1/600th of the volume of a cell in E. coli. To make the macromolecules clearer, small molecules such as water, cofactors, and metabolites have all been omitted from the illustration. The section of the cytoplasm shown contains: • Several hundred macromolecules,which are needed for protein biosynthesis—i. e., 30 ribosomes, more than 100 protein fac- tors, 30 aminoacyl–tRNA synthases, 340 tRNA molecules, 2–3 mRNAs (each of which is 10 times the length of the section shown), and six molecules of RNA polymerase. • About 330 other enzyme molecules, includ- ing 130 glycolytic enzymes and 100 en- zymes from the tricarboxylic acid cycle. • 30 000 small organic molecules with masses of 100–1000 Da—e. g., metabolites of the intermediary metabolism and coen- zymes. These are shown at a magnification 10 times higher in the bottom right corner. • And finally, 50 000 inorganic ions. The rest consists of water. The illustration shows that the cytoplasm of cells is a compartment densely packed with macromolecules and smaller organic mole- cules. The distances between organic mole- cules are small. They are only separated by a few water molecules. All of the molecules are in motion. Due to constant collisions, however, they do not ad- vance in a straight path but move in zigzags. Dueto their largemass, proteins areparticu- larly slow. However, they do cover an average of 5 nm in 1 ms—a distance approximately equal to their own length. Statistically, a pro- tein is capable of reaching any point in a bacterial cell in less than a second. C. Biochemical functions of the cytoplasm \u0002 In eukaryotes, the cytoplasm, representing slightlymorethan 50% of thecellvolume, is the most important cellular compartment. It is the central reaction space of the cell. This is where many important pathways of the inter- mediary metabolism take place—e. g., glycol- ysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the ma- jority of gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid syn- thesis. Protein biosynthesis (translation; see p. 250) also takes place in the cytoplasm. By contrast, fatty acid degradation, the tricarbox- ylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation arelocated in themitochondria (see p. 210). 202 Organelles Macromolecules A.

All of these filaments are polymers assembled from protein compo- nents. A. Actin \u0002 Actin, the most abundant protein in eukary- otic cells, is the protein component of the microfilaments (actin filaments). Actin occurs in two forms—a monomolecular form (Gactin, globular actin) and a polymer (Factin,fila- mentous actin). G actin is an asymmetrical molecule with a mass of 42 kDa, consisting of two domains. As the ionic strength in- creases, G actin aggregates reversibly to form F actin, a helical homopolymer. G actin carries a firmly bound ATP molecule that is slowly hydrolyzed in F actin to form ADP. Actin therefore also has enzyme properties (ATPase activity). As individual G actin molecules are always oriented in the same direction relative to one another, F actin consequently has polarity. It has two different ends, at which polymeriza- tion takes place at different rates. If the ends are not stabilized by special proteins (as in muscle cells), then at a critical concentration of G actin the (+) end of F actin will constantly grow, while the (–) end simultaneously de- cays. These partial processes can be blocked by fungal toxins experimentally. Phalloidin,a toxin contained in the Amanita phalloides mushroom, inhibits decay by binding to the (–) end. By contrast, cytochalasins,moldtox- ins with cytostatic effects, block polymeriza- tion by binding to the (+) end. Actin–associated proteins. The cytoplasm contains more than 50 different proteins that bind specifically to G actin and F actin. Their actin uptake has various different func- tions. This type of bonding can serve to regu- late the G actin pool (example: profilin), influ- ence the polymerization rate of G actin (vil- lin), stabilize the chain ends of F actin (fragin, –actinin), attach filaments to one another or to other cell components (villin, –actinin, spectrin), or disrupt the helical structure of F actin (gelsolin). The activity of these proteins is regulated by protein kinases via Ca 2+ and other second messengers (see p. 386). B. Intermediate filaments \u0002 The components of the intermediate fila- ments belong to five related protein families. They are specific for particular cell types. Typ- ical representatives include the cytokeratins, desmin, vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament. These proteins all have a rod–shaped basic structure in the cen- ter, which is known as a superhelix (“coiled coil”; see keratin, p. 70). The dimers are ar- ranged in an antiparallel fashion to form tet- ramers. A staggered head-to–head arrange- ment produces protofilaments. Eight protofi- laments ultimately form an intermediary fil- ament. Free protein monomers of intermediate fil- aments rarely occur in the cytoplasm, in con- trast to microfilaments and microtubules. Their polymerization leads to stable polymers that have no polarity. C. Tubulins \u0002 The basic components of the tube-shaped mi- crotubules are α–and β–tubulin (53 and 55 kDa). These form α,β-heterodimers, which in turn polymerize to form linear protofila- ments. Thirteen protofilaments form a ring- shaped complex, which then grows into a long tube as a result of further polymeriza- tion. Like microfilaments, microtubules are dy- namic structures with (+) and (–) ends. The (–) end is usually stabilized by bonding to the centrosome. The (+) end shows dynamic instability. It can either grow slowly or shorten rapidly. GTP, which is bound by the microtubules and gradually hydrolyzed into GDP, plays a role in this. Various proteins can also be associated with microtubules. 204 Organelles αβ8 nm ADP Pi ATP ADP Pi ATP A. Actin B. Intermediate filaments C.

This scaffolding has dynamic properties; it is constantly being synthe- sized and brokendowntomeet the cell’s requirements and changing conditions. • It acts as the motor for movement of animal cells. Not only muscle cells (see p. 332), but also cells of noncontractile tissues contain many different motor proteins, which they use to achieve coordinated and directed movement. Cell movement, shape changes during growth, cytoplasmic streaming, and cell division are all made possible by com- ponents of the cytoskeleton. • It serves as a transport track within the cell. Organelles and other large protein com- plexes can move along the filaments with the help of the motor proteins. A. Microfilaments and intermediate filaments \u0003 The illustration schematically shows a detail of the microvilli of an intestinal epithelial cell as an example of the structure and function of the components of the cytoskeleton (see also C1). Microfilaments of Factin traverse the mi- crovilli in ordered bundles. The microfila- ments are attached to each other by actin–as- sociated proteins, particularly fimbrin and vil- lin. Calmodulin and a myosin–like ATPase con- nect the microfilaments laterally to the plasma membrane. Fodrin, another microfila- ment–associated protein, anchors the actin fibers to each other at the base, as well as attaching them to the cytoplasmic membrane and to a network of intermediate filaments. In this example, the microfilaments have a mainly static function. In other cases, actin is also involved in dynamic processes. These in- clude muscle contraction (see p. 332), cell movement, phagocytosis by immune cells, the formation of microspikes and lamellipo- dia (cellular extensions), and the acrosomal process during the fusion of sperm with the egg cell. B. Microtubules \u0003 Only the cell’s microtubules are shown here. They radiate out in all directions from a center near the nucleus, the centrosome.The tube- shaped microtubules are constantly being synthesized and broken down at their (+) ends. In the centriole, the (–) end is blocked by associated proteins (see p. 204). The (+) end can also be stabilized by associated pro- teins—e. g., when the microtubules have reached the cytoplasmic membrane. The microtubules are involved in defining theshape of thecelland also serveas guiding tracks for the transport of organelles. To- gether with associated proteins (dynein, kine- sin), microtubules areableto carry outme- chanical work—e. g., during the transport of mitochondria, the movement of cilia (hair- like cell protrusions in the lungs, intestinal epithelium, and oviduct) and the beating of the flagella of sperm. Microtubules also play a special role in the mitotic period of cell divi- sion (see p. 394). C. Architecture \u0003 Thecomplex structureand net-like densityof the cytoskeleton is illustrated here using three examples in which the cytoskeletal components are visualized with the help of antibodies. 1. The border of an intestinal epithelial cell is seen here (see also B). There are micro- filaments (a) passing from the interior of the cell out into the microvilli. The filaments are firmly held together by spectrin (b), an asso- ciated protein, and they are anchored to in- termediate filaments (c). 2. Only microtubules are seeninthis fibro- blast cell. They originate from the microtubule organizing center (centrosome) and radiate out as far as the plasma membrane. 3. Keratin filaments are visible here in an epithelial cell. Keratin fibers belong to the group of intermediate filaments (see pp. 70, 204; d = nucleus). 206 Organelles 2. Mikrotubuli a b c d d A. Microfilaments and intermediate filaments B. Microtubules C.

Nucleus \u0001 The nucleus is the largest organelle in the eu- karyotic cell. With a diameter of about 10 µm, it is easily recognizable with the light micro- scope. This is the location for storage, replica- tion, and expression of genetic information. The nucleus is separated from the cyto- plasm by the nuclear envelope, which consists of the outer and inner nuclear membranes. Each of the two nuclear membranes has two layers, and the membranes are separated from each other by the perinuclear space. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is covered with ribosomes. The inner side of the membrane is covered with a protein layer (the nuclear lamina), in which the nuclear structures are anchored. The nucleus contains almost all of the cell’s DNA (around 1% of which is mitochondrial DNA). Together with histones and structural proteins, the nuclear DNA forms the chroma- tin (see p. 238). It is only during cell division that chromatin condenses into chromosomes, which are also visible with the light micro- scope. During this phase, the nuclear mem- brane temporarily disintegrates. During the phase between cell divisions, the interphase, it is possible to distinguish between the more densely packed hetero- chromatin and loose euchromatin using an electron microscope. Active transcription of DNA into mRNA takes place in the region of the euchromatin. A particularly electron- dense region is noticeable in many nuclei—the nucleolus (several nucleoli are sometimes present). The DNA in the nucleolus contains numerous copies of the genes for rRNAs (see p. 242). They are constantly under- going transcription, leading to a high local concentration of RNA. B. Nuclear pores \u0002 The exchange of substances between the nu- cleus and the cytoplasm is mediated by pore complexes with complicated structures, which traverse the nuclear membrane. The nuclear pores consist of numerous proteins that form several connected rings of varying diameter. Low-molecular structures and small proteins can enter the nucleus without dif - culty. By contrast, larger proteins (over 40 kDa) can only pass through the nuclear pores if they carry a nuclear localization se- quence consisting of four successive basic amino acids inside their peptide chains (see p. 228). mRNAs and rRNAs formed in the nu- cleus cross the pores into the cytoplasm as complexes with proteins (see below). C. Relationships between the nucleus and cytoplasm \u0002 Almost all of the RNA in the cell is synthesized in the nucleus. In this process, known as transcription, the information stored in DNA is transcribed into RNA (see p. 242). As men- tioned above, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is mainly produced in the nucleolus, while messenger and transfer RNA (mRNA and tRNA) are formed in the region of the euchromatin. En- zymatic duplication of DNA—replication—also only takes place in the nucleus (see p. 240). Thenucleotidecomponents requiredfor transcription and replication have to be im- ported into the nucleus from the cytoplasm. Incorporation of these components into RNA leads to primary products, which are then altered by cleavage, excision of introns, and the addition of extra nucleotides (RNA matu- ration; see p. 242). It is only once these pro- cess have been completed that the RNA mol- ecules formed in the nucleus can be exported into the cytoplasm for protein synthesis (translation;see p. 250). The nucleus is not capable of synthesizing proteins. All of the nuclear proteins therefore have to be imported—the histones with which DNA is associated in chromatin, and also the so–called non–histone proteins (DNA poly- merases and RNA polymerases, auxiliary and structural proteins, transcription factors, and ribosomal proteins). Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) already associates with proteins in the nucle- olus to form ribosome precursors. A special metabolic task carried out by the nucleus is biosynthesis of NAD +. The immedi- ate precursor of this coenzyme, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN +), arises in the cyto- plasm and is then transported into the nucle- olus, where it is enzymatically converted into the dinucleotide NAD+. Finally, NAD + then re- turns to the cytoplasm. 208 Organelles NADNMN N N A N N A Ribosomal proteins, Histones, Non-histone proteins CytoplasmNucleoplasm Nucleolus Ribosomal subunits Polysome DNA pre-tRNAshnRNAs45S-RNA rRNAs Translation NAD synthesis Replication mRNAs DNA tRNAs Processing Transcription B.

Interactions between nucleus and cytoplasm A. Nucleus 10 µm 209Nucleus Structure and functions A. Mitochondrial structure \u0002 Mitochondria are bacteria-sized organelles (about 1 × 2 µm in size), which are found in large numbers in almost all eukaryotic cells. Typically, there are about 2000 mitochondria per cell, representing around 25% of the cell volume. Mitochondria are enclosed by two membranes—a smooth outer membrane and a markedly folded or tubular inner mitochon- drial membrane,which has a large surface and encloses the matrix space.The folds of theinnermembraneare known as cristae, and tube-like protrusions are called tubules. The intermembrane space is located between the inner and the outer membranes. Thenumberand shapeof the mitochon- dria, aswell asthe numbersof cristae they have, can differ widely from cell type to cell type. Tissues with intensive oxidative meta- bolism—e. g., heart muscle—have mitochon- dria with particularly large numbers of cris- tae. Even within one type of tissue, the shape of the mitochondria can vary depending on their functional status. Mitochondria are mo- bile, plastic organelles. Mitochondria probably developed during an early phase of evolution from aerobic bac- teria that entered into symbiosis with pri- meval anaerobic eukaryotes. This endosym- biont theory is supported by many findings. For example, mitochondria have a ring- shaped DNA (four molecules per mitochon- drion) and have their own ribosomes. The mitochondrial genome became smaller and smaller during the course of evolution. In hu- mans, it still contains 16 569 base pairs, which code for two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 proteins. Only these 13 proteins (mostly sub- units of respiratory chain complexes) are pro- duced in the mitochondrion. All of the other mitochondrial proteins are coded by the nu- clear genome and have to be imported into the mitochondria after translation in the cy- toplasm (see p. 228). The mitochondrial en- velope consisting of two membranes also supports the endosymbiont theory. The inner membrane, derived from the former sym- biont, has a structure reminiscent of proka- ryotes. It contains the unusual lipid cardioli- pin (see p. 50), but hardly any cholesterol (see p. 216). Both mitochondrial membranes are very rich in proteins. Porins (see p. 214) in the outer membrane allow small molecules (< 10 kDa) to be exchanged between the cy- toplasm and the intermembrane space. By contrast, the inner mitochondrial membrane is completely impermeable even to small molecules (with the exception of O2,CO2, and H2O). Numerous transporters in the inner membrane ensure the import and export of important metabolites (see p. 212). The inner membrane also transports respiratory chain complexes, ATP synthase, and other enzymes. The matrix is also rich in enzymes (see B). B. Metabolic functions \u0002 Mitochondria are also described as being the cell’s biochemical powerhouse, since—through oxidative phosphorylation (see p. 112)—they produce the majority of cellular ATP. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the tricarboxylic acid cycle, β-oxidation of fatty acids, and parts of the urea cycle are located in the matrix. The respiratory chain, ATP synthesis,and enzymes involved in heme biosynthesis (see p. 192) are associated with the inner membrane. The inner membrane itself plays an impor- tant part in oxidative phosphorylation. As it is impermeable to protons, the respiratory chain—which pumps protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space via complexes I, III, and IV—establishes a proton gradient across the inner membrane, in which the chemical energy released during NADH oxi- dation is conserved (see p. 126). ATP synthase then uses the energy stored in the gradient to form ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. Several of the transport systems are also de- pendent on the H + gradient. In addition to the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria also function as an intracellular calcium reservoir. The mitochon- dria also play an important role in “pro- grammed cell death”—apoptosis (see p. 396). 210 Organelles 2 µm NH3 HCO3 CO2CO2 H2O O2 ATP N A A PP P A PP P H + H + H + PP A P H + H + – Ca2 Ca2 ETF PP A ADP Outer membrane Inner membrane Enzymes of lipid metabo- lism PorinNucleotide kinases Outer membrane Inner membrane ATP synthase Enzymes of oxidative metabo- lism Transporter Respi- ratory chain Matrix space Inter- membrane space Creatine kinase Cristae Matrix space Intermembrane space DNA A.

Metabolic functions Pyruvate β-Oxidation 211Mitochondria Transport systems Mitochondria are surrounded by an inner and an outer membrane (see p. 210). The outer membrane contains porins, which allow smaller molecules up to 10 kDa in size to pass. By contrast, the inner membrane is also impermeable to small molecules (with the exception of water and the gases O2,CO2, and NH3). All of the other substrates of mito- chondrial metabolism, as well as its products, therefore have to be moved through the inner membrane with the help of special transport- ers. A. Transport systems \u0002 The transport systems of the inner mitochon- drial membrane use various mechanisms. Metabolites or ions can be transported alone (uniport, U), together with a second substance (symport, S), or in exchange for another mol- ecule (antiport, A). Active transport—i. e., transport coupled to ATP hydrolysis—does not play an important role in mitochondria. The driving force is usually the proton gra- dient across theinnermembrane(blue star) or the general membrane potential (red star; see p. 126). The pyruvate (left) formed by glycolysis in the cytoplasm is imported into the matrix in antiport with OH –.The OH – ions react in the intermembrane space with the H + ions abun- dantly present there to form H2O. This main- tains a concentration gradient of OH–.The import of phosphate (H2PO4 –)is drivenin a similar way. The exchange of the ATP formed in the mitochondrion for ADP via an adenine nucleotide translocase (center) is also depen- dent on the H + gradient. ATP with a quadruple negative charge is exchanged for ADP with a triple negative charge, so that overall one negative charge is transported into the H +- rich intermembrane space. The import of ma- late by the tricarboxylate transporter,which is important for the malate shuttle (see B)is coupled to the export of citrate, with a net export of onenegative chargeto the exterior again. In the opposite direction, malate can leave the matrix in antiport for phosphate. When Ca 2+ is imported (right), the metal cat- ion follows the membrane potential. An elec- troneutral antiport for two H + or two Na + serves for Ca 2+ export. B. Malate and glycerophosphate shuttles \u0002 Two systems known as “shuttles” are avail- able to allow the import of reducing equiva- lents that arise from glycolysis in the cyto- plasm in the form of NADH+H +. There is no transporter in the inner membrane for NADH+H + itself. In the malate shuttle (left)—which operates in the heart, liver, and kidneys, for exam- ple—oxaloacetic acid is reduced to malate by malate dehydrogenase (MDH, [2a]) with the help of NADH+H +. In antiport for 2-oxogluta- rate, malate is transferred to the matrix, where the mitochondrial isoenzyme for MDH [2b] regenerates oxaloacetic acid and NADH+H +. The latter is reoxidized by complex I of the respiratory chain, while oxaloacetic acid, for which a transporter is not available in the inner membrane, is first transaminated to aspartate by aspartate aminotransferase (AST, [3a]). Aspartate leaves the matrix again, and in the cytoplasm once again supplies oxalo- acetate for step [2a] and glutamate for return transport into the matrix [3b]. On balance, only NADH+H + is moved from the cytoplasm into the matrix; ATP is not needed for this. The glycerophosphate shuttle (right) was discovered in insect muscle, but is also active in the skeletal musculature and brain in higher animals. In this shuttle, NADH+H + formed in the cytoplasm is used to reduce glycerone 3-phosphate, an intermediate of glycolysis (see p. 150) to glycerol 3-phos- phate. Via porins, this enters the intermem- brane space and is oxidized again there on the exterior side of the inner membrane by the flavin enzyme glycerol 3-phosphate dehydro- genase back into glycerone 3-phosphate. The reducing equivalents are passed on to the respiratory chain via ubiquinone (coenzyme Q). The carnitine shuttle for transporting acyl residues into the mitochondrial matrix is dis- cussed on p. 164. 212 Organelles N AGlu Asp N A Glu Asp N A 2H , O+ H2O 1 5 42a 2b 3a 3b 3a 3b 2a 1 2b Q I 4 5 H + H + (Na )+ Ca2 + Ca2 + HPO4 2 HPO4 2 ATP 4 ADP 3 ATP 4 ADP 3 H2PO4 H2PO4 OH OH H2O A U A A A A A N A + A.

Structure of the plasma membrane \u0002 Allbiologicalmembranes are constructed ac- cording to a standard pattern. They consist of a continuous bilayer of amphipathic lipids ap- proximately 5 nm thick, into which proteins are embedded. In addition, some membranes also carry carbohydrates (mono- and oligo- saccharides) on their exterior, which are bound to lipids and proteins. The proportions of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates differ markedly depending on the type of cell and membrane (see p. 216). Membrane lipids are strongly amphipathic molecules with a polar hydrophilic “head group” and an apolar hydrophobic “tail.” In membranes, they are primarily held together by the hydrophobic effect (see p. 28) and weak Van der Waals forces, and are therefore mobile relative to each other. This gives mem- branes a more or less fluid quality. The fluidity of membranes primarily de- pends on their lipid composition and on tem- perature. At a specific transition temperature, membranes pass from a semicrystalline state to a more fluid state. The double bonds in the alkyl chains of unsaturated acyl residues in the membrane lipids disturb the semicrystal- line state. The higher the proportion of unsa- turated lipids present, therefore, the lower the transition temperature. The cholesterol con- tent also influences membrane fluidity. While cholesterol increases the fluidity of semicrys- talline, closely-packed membranes, it stabil- izes fluid membranes that contain a high pro- portion of unsaturated lipids. Like lipids, proteins are also mobile within the membrane. If they are not fixed in place by special mechanisms, they float within the lipid layer as if in a two-dimensional liquid; biological membranes are therefore also de- scribedasbeing a “fluidmosaic.” Lipids and proteins can shift easily within one layer of a membrane, but switching be- tween the two layers (“flip/flop”)is not possi- ble for proteins and is only possible with dif- ficulty for lipids (with the exception of cho- lesterol). To move to the other side, phospho- lipids require special auxiliary proteins (translocators, “flipases”). B. Membrane lipids \u0002 The illustration shows amodel of asmall section of a membrane. The phospholipids are the most important group of membrane lipids. They include phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), phosphatidylethanolamine, phos- phatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and sphingomyelin (for their structures, see p. 50). In addition, membranes in animal cells also contain cholesterol (with the exception of inner mitochondrial membranes). Glycoli- pids (a ganglioside is shown here) are mainly found on the outside of the plasma mem- brane. Together with the glycoproteins, they form the exterior coating of the cell (the gly- cocalyx). C. Membrane proteins \u0002 Proteins can be anchored in or on membranes in various ways. Integral membrane proteins cross right through the lipid bilayer. The sec- tions of the peptide chains that lie within the bilayer usually consist of 20 to 25 mainly hydrophobic amino acid residues that form a right-handed α-helix. Type I and II membrane proteins only contain one transmembrane helix of this type, whiletypeIII proteins contain several. Rarely, type I and II polypeptides can aggre- gate to form a type IV transmembrane pro- tein. Several groups of integral membrane proteins—e. g., theporins (seep.212)—pene- trate the membrane with antiparallel β-sheet structures. Due to its shape, this tertiary structure is known as a “β-barrel.” Type V and VI proteins carry lipid anchors. These are fatty acids (palmitic acid, myristic acid), isoprenoids (e. g., farnesol), or glycoli- pids such as glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) that are covalently bound to the peptide chain. Peripheral membrane proteins are associ- ated with the head groups of phospholipids or with another integral membrane protein (not shown). 214 Organelles e f g h a b c da b c d e f g h N C C N Polar Outer leaflet Inner leaflet Type I Type II Type III Type IV Type V 1. α-Helical 2. β-Barrel Apolar Polar Lipid anchor C.

Membrane lipids5 nm Lipid bilayer 215Biological membranes Functions and composition The most important membranes in animal cells are the plasma membrane, the inner and outer nuclear membranes, the mem- branes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, and the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. Lysosomes, peroxi- somes, and various vesicles are also separated from the cytoplasm by membranes. In plants, additional membranes are seen in the plastids and vacuoles. All membranes show pola- rity—i. e., there is a difference in the composi- tion of the inner layer (facing toward the cytoplasm) and the outer layer (facing away from it). A. Functions of membranes \u0001 Membranes and their components have the following functions: 1. Enclosure and insulation of cells and or- ganelles. The enclosure provided by the plasma membrane protects cells from their environment both mechanically and chemi- cally. The plasma membrane is essential for maintaining differences in the concentration of many substances between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. 2. Regulated transport of substances, which determines the internal milieu and is a precondition for homeostasis—i. e., the maintenance of constant concentrations of substances and physiological parameters. Regulated and selective transport of substan- ces through pores, channels, and transporters (see p. 218) is necessary because the cells and organelles are enclosed by membrane sys- tems. 3. Reception of extracellular signals and transfer of these signals to the inside of the cell (see pp. 384ff.), as well as the production of signals. 4. Enzymatic catalysis of reactions. Impor- tant enzymes are located in membranes at the interface between the lipid and aqueous phases. This is where reactions with apolar substrates occur. Examples include lipid biosynthesis (see p. 170) and the metabolism of apolar xenobiotics (see p. 316). The most important reactions in energy conver- sion—i. e., oxidative phosphorylation (see p. 140) and photosynthesis (see p. 128)—also occur in membranes. 5. Interactions with other cells for the pur- poses of cell fusion and tissue formation, as well as communication with the extracellular matrix. 6. Anchoring of the cytoskeleton (see p. 204) to maintain the shape of cells and organelles and to provide the basis for move- ment processes. B. Composition of membranes \u0002 Biological membranes consist of lipids, pro- teins,and carbohydrates (see p. 214). These components occur in varying proportions (left). Proteins usually account for the largest proportion, at around half. By contrast, carbo- hydrates, which are only found on the side facing away from the cytoplasm, make up only a few percent. An extreme composition is seen in myelin, the insulating material in nerve cells, three-quarters of which consists of lipids. By contrast, the inner mitochondrial membrane is characterized by a very low pro- portion of lipids and a particularly high pro- portion of proteins. When the individual proportions of lipids in membranes are examined more closely (right part of the illustration), typical patterns for particular cells and tissues are also found. The illustration shows the diversity of the membrane lipids and their approximate quantitative composition. Phospholipids are predominant in membrane lipids in compar- ison with glycolipids and cholesterol.Triacyl- glycerols (neutral fats) are not found in mem- branes. Cholesterol is found almost exclusively in eukaryotic cells. Animal membranes contain substantially more cholesterol than plant membranes, in which cholesterol is usually replaced by other sterols. There is no choles- terol at all in prokaryotes (with a few excep- tions). The inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes is also low in cholesterol, while it is theonlymembranethatcontainslarge amounts of cardiolipin. These facts both sup- port the endosymbiotic theory of the devel- opment of mitochondria (see p. 210). 216 Organelles A+B C+DA A B B 1 4 5 6 3 2 * * * * * * * S * * * * Boundary Controlled metabolite transport Signal re- ception and transmission Enzymatic reactions Contact with other cells Anchor for cyto- skeleton A.

Permeability \u0001 Only small, uncharged molecules such as gases, water, ammonia, glycerol, or urea are able to pass through biological membranes by free diffusion. With increasing size,evencom- pounds of this type are no longer able to pass through. Membranes are impermeable to glu- cose and other sugars, for example. The polarity of a molecule is also impor- tant. Apolar substances, such as benzene, ethanol, diethyl ether, and many narcotic agents are able to enter biological membranes easily. By contrast, membranes are imperme- able to strongly polar compounds, particu- larly those that are electrically charged. To be able to take up or release molecules of this type, cells have specialized channels and transporters in their membranes (see below). B. Passive and active transport \u0001 Free diffusion is the simplest form of mem- brane transport. When it is supported by in- tegral membrane proteins, it is known as fa- cilitated diffusion (or facilitated transport). 1. Channel proteins have a polar pore through which ions and other hydrophilic compounds can pass. For example, there are channels that allow selected ions to pass (ion channels; see p. 222) and porins that allow molecules below a specific size to pass in a more or less nonspecific fashion (see p. 212). 2. Transporters recognize and bind the molecules to be transported and help them to pass through the membrane as a result of a conformational change. These proteins (per- meases) are thus comparable with enzy- mes—although with the difference that they “catalyze” vectorial transport rather than an enzymatic reaction. Like enzymes, they show acertain affinity for each molecule trans- ported (expressed as the dissociation constant, Kd in mol L –1)and a maximum transport capacity (V). Free diffusion and transport processes fa- cilitated by ion channels and transport pro- teins always follow a concentration gradient— i. e., the direction of transport is from the site of higher concentration to the site of lower concentration. In ions, the membrane potential also plays a role; the processes are summed up by the term “electrochemical gradient” (see p. 126). These processes there- fore involve passive transport, which runs “downhill” on the slope of a gradient. By contrast, active transport can also run “uphill”—i. e., against a concentration or charge gradient. It therefore requires an input of energy, which is usually supplied by the hydrolysis of ATP (see p. 124). The transporter first binds its “cargo” on one side of the mem- brane. ATP-dependent phosphorylation then causes a conformation change that releases the cargo on the other side of the membrane (see p. 220). A non-spontaneous transport process can also take place through coupling to another active transport process (known as secondary active transport; see p. 220). Using the transport systems in the mem- branes, cells regulate their volume, internal pH value, and ionic environment. They con- centrate metabolites that are important for energy metabolism and biosynthesis, and ex- clude toxic substances. Transport systems also serve to establish ion gradients, which are required for oxidative phosphorylation and stimulation of muscle and nerve cells, for example (see p. 350). C. Transport processes \u0002 Another classification of transport processes is based on the number of particles trans- ported and the direction in which they move. When a single molecule or ion passes through the membrane with the help of a channel or transporter, the process is de- scribed as a uniport (example: the transport of glucose into liver cells). Simultaneous transport of two different particles can take place either as a symport (example: the trans- port of amino acids or glucose together with Na + ions into intestinal epithelial cells) or as an antiport. Ions are often transported in an antiport in exchange for another similarly charged ion. This process is electroneutral and therefore more energetically favorable (example: the exchange of HCO3– for Cl – at the erythrocyte membrane). 218 Organelles 219Biological membranes Pore P P A P P A P P P P H2ONa Cl HCO3 U S A HCO3 Cl Free diffusion No membrane passage Facilitated diffusion Free diffusion Electrochemical gradient Charge gradient Channel protein Transport ATPase Active transport Passive transport Low concentration Transporter Confor- mational change Confor- mational change A.

They all belong to group III of the α-helical transmembrane proteins (see p. 214). A. Transport mechanisms \u0002 Some cells couple the “pure” transport forms discussed on p. 218—i. e., passive transport (1) and active transport (2)—and use this mech- anism to take up metabolites. In secondary active transport (3), which is used for exam- ple by epithelial cells in the small intestine and kidney to take up glucose and amino acids, there is a symport (S) located on the luminal side of the membrane, which takes up the metabolite M together with an Na+ ion. An ATP-dependent Na + transporter (Na +/K + ATPase; see p. 350) on the other side keeps the intracellular Na+ concentration low and thus indirectly drives the uptake of M. Finally, a uniport (U) releases M into the blood. B. Glucose transporter Glut-1 \u0003 The glucose transporters (Glut) are a family of related membrane proteins with varying dis- tribution in the organs. Glut-1 and Glut-3 have a relatively high af nity for glucose (Kd = 1 mM). They occur in nearly all cells, and ensure continuous glucose uptake. Glut-2 is found in the liver and pancreas. This form has alower af nity (Kd = 15–20 mM). The rate of glucoseuptakebyGlut-2istherefore strongly dependent on the blood glucose level (nor- mally 4–8 mM). Transport by Glut-4 (Kd = 5 mM), which is mainly expressed in muscle and fat cells, is controlled by insulin, which increases the number of transporters on the cell surface (see p. 388). Glut-5 mediates sec- ondary active resorption of glucose in the in- testines and kidney (see A). Glut-1 consists of a single peptide chain that spans the membrane with 12 α-helices of different lengths. The glucose is bound by the peptide loops that project on each side of the membrane. C. Aquaporin-1 \u0003 Aquaporins help water to pass through bio- logical membranes. They form hydrophilic pores that allow H2O molecules, but not hy- drated ions or larger molecules, to pass through. Aquaporins are particularly impor- tant in the kidney, where they promote the reuptake of water (see p. 328). Aquaporin-2 in the renal collecting ducts is regulated by antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin), which via cAMP leads to shifting of the chan- nels from the ER into the plasma membrane. Aquaporin-1, shown here, occurs in the proximal tubule and in Henle’s loop. It con- tains eight transmembrane helices with dif- ferent lengths and orientations. The yellow- colored residues form a narrowing that only H2O molecules can overcome. D. Sarcoplasmic Ca 2+ pump \u0003 Transport ATPases transport cations—they are “ion pumps.” ATPases of the Ftype—e. g., mito- chondrial ATP synthase (see p. 142)—use H + transport for ATP synthesis. Enzymes of the V type, using up ATP, “pump” protons into lyso- somes and other acidic cell compartments (see p. 234). Ptype transport ATPases are particu- larly numerous. These are ATP-driven cation transporters that undergo covalent phosphor- ylation during the transport cycle. The Ca2+ ATPase shown also belongs to the P type. In muscle, its task is to pump the Ca 2+ released into the cytoplasm to trigger muscle contraction back into the sarcoplasmic retic- ulum (SR; see p. 334). The molecule (1)con- sists of a single peptide chain that is folded into various domains. In the transmembrane part, which is formed by numerous α-helices, there are binding sites for two Ca 2+ ions (blue) ATP is bound to the cytoplasmic N domain (green). Four different stages can be distinguished in the enzyme’s catalytic cycle (2). First, bind- ing of ATP to the N domain leads to the uptake of two Ca 2+ into the transmembrane part (a). Phosphorylation of an aspartate residue in the Pdomain (b) and dissociation of ADP then causes a conformation change that releases the Ca 2+ ions into the SR (c). Finally, dephos- phorylation of the aspartate residue restores the initial conditions (d). 220 Organelles M N NC H2O Na MM M E S U a) b) c) d) ATP PP A A PP P P+ PP A A PP P P+ PP A A PP P P P PP A Ca2 P A PP P NC Na M P N β A.

Some ion channels open and close depending on the membrane potential (voltage-gated channels, A) or in response to specific ligands (ligand- gated channels, B). Other channels operate passively. In these cases, transport depends only on the concentration gradient (C). A. Voltage-gated Na + channel \u0003 Voltage-gated Na + channels play a decisive part in the conduction of electrical impulses in the nervous system (see p. 350). These channels open when the membrane potential in their environment reverses. Due to the high equilibrium potential for Na + (see p. 126), an inflow of Na + ions takes place, resulting in local depolarization of the membrane, which propagates by activation of neighboring volt- age-dependent Na + channels. A spreading de- polarization wave of this type is known as an action potential (see p. 350). Externally di- rected K+ channels are involved in the repola- rization of the membrane. In their function- ing, these resemble the much more simply structured K+ channels shown in C.The Ca 2+ channels that trigger exocytosis of vesicles (see p. 228) are also controlled by the action potential. The voltage-gated Na + channels in higher animals are large complexes made up of sev- eral subunits. The α-subunit shown here me- diates Na + transport. It consists of a very long peptide chain (around 2000 amino acid resi- dues), which is folded into four domains, each with six transmembrane helices (left). The S6 helices of all the domains (blue) together form a centrally located hydrophilic pore which can be made narrow or wide depend- ing on the channel’s functional status. The six S4 helices (green) function as voltage sensors. The current conception of the way in which the opening and closing mechanism functions is shown in a highly simplified form on the right. For the sake of clarity, only one of the four domains (domain IV) is shown. The S4 helices contain several positively charged res- idues. When the membrane is polarized (a), the surplus negative charges on the inner side keep the helix in the membrane. If this attrac- tion is removed as a result of local depolariza- tion, the S4 helices are thought to snap up- wardslike springsand thus open the central pore (b). B. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor \u0003 Many receptors for neurotransmitters func- tion as ligand-gated channels for Na +,K+ and/or Ca 2+ ions (see p. 354). The ones that have been studied in the greatest detail are the nicotinic receptors for acetylcholine (see p. 352). These consist of five separate but structurally closely related subunits. Each forms four transmembrane helices, the sec- ond of which is involved in the central pore in each case. The type of monomer and its ar- rangement in the complex is not identical in all receptors of this type. In the neuromuscu- lar junction (see p. 334), the arrangement αβγαδ is found (1). In the interior of the structure, acetylcho- line binds to the two α-subunits and thus opens the pore for a short time (1–2 ms). Negatively charged residues are arranged in threegroups in a ring shapeinsideit. They are responsible for the receptor’s ion specificity. It is thought that binding of the neurotransmit- ter changes the position of the subunits in such a way that the pore expands (3). The bound acetylcholine dissociates again and is hydrolytically inactivated (see p. 356). The receptor is thus able to function again. C. K+ channel in Streptomyces lividans \u0003 The only detailed structures of ion channels established so far are those of potassium channels like that of an outwardly directed K + channel in the bacterium Streptomyces liv- idans. It consists of four identical subunits (blue, yellow, green, and red), each of which contains two long α-helices and one shorter one. In the interior of the cell (bottom), the K+ ions (violet) enter the structure’s central channel. Before they are released to the out- side, they have to pass through what is known as a “selectivity filter.” In this part of the channel, several C=O groups in the peptide chain form a precisely defined opening that is only permeable to non-hydrated K + ions. 222 Organelles I II III IV NC a b δβ αLHα K DBA C Na 1 23 4 56 1 2 3 4 5 6 NC γδ αα β Na 12 3 5 64 C.

Many of these are integral membrane proteins in the plasma membrane, where they receive signals from their surroundings. Other receptor proteins are located in inter- cellular membranes. The receptors for lipo- philic hormones are among the few that func- tion in a soluble form. They regulate gene transcription in the nucleus (see p. 378). A. Principle of receptor action \u0001 Membrane-located receptors can be divided into three parts, which have different tasks. The receptor domain reacts specifically to a given signal. Signals of this type can be of a purely physical nature. For example, many organisms react to light. In this way, plants adapt growth and photosynthesis to light conditions, while animals need light recep- tors for visual processing (C; see p. 358). Me- chanoreceptors are involved in hearing and in pressure regulation, among other things. Channels that react to action potentials (see p. 350) can be regarded as receptors for elec- trical impulses. However, most receptors do not react to physical stimuli, but rather to signal mole- cules. Receptors for these chemical signals containbinding sites inthe receptor domain that are complementary to each ligand. In this respect, they resemble enzymes (see p. 94). As the effector domain of the receptor is usu- ally separated by a membrane, a mechanism for signal transfer between the domains is needed. Little is yet known regarding this. It is thought that conformation changes in the receptor protein play a decisive part. Some receptors dimerize after binding of the ligand, thereby bringing the effector domains of two molecules into contact (see p. 392). The way in which the effector works differs from case to case. By binding or interconver- sion, many receptors activate special media- tor proteins, which then trigger a signal cas- cade (signal transduction; see p. 384). Other receptors function as ion channels.This is particularly widespread in receptors for neu- rotransmitters (see p. 354). B. Insulin receptor \u0002 The receptor for the hormone insulin (see p. 76) belongs to the family of 1-helix recep- tors. These molecules span the membrane with only one α-helix. The subunits of the dimeric receptor (red and blue) each consist of two polypeptides (α and β)bound by disulfide bonds. The α-chains together bind the insulin, while the β-chains contain the transmem- brane helix and, at the C-terminus, domains with tyrosine kinase activity. In the activated state, the kinase domains phosphorylate themselves and also mediator proteins (re- ceptor substrates) that set in motion cascades of further phosphorylations (see pp. 120 and 388). C. 7-helix receptors \u0002 A large group of receptors span the mem- brane with α-helices seven times. These are known as 7-helix receptors. Via their effector domains, they bind and activate trimeric pro- teins, which in turn bind and hydrolyze GTP and are therefore called G proteins. Most G proteins, in turn, activate or inhibit enzymes that create secondary signaling molecules (second messengers; see p. 386). Other G pro- teins regulate ion channels. The illustration shows the complex of the light receptor rho- dopsin, with the associated G protein trans- ducin (see p. 358). The GTP-binding α-subunit (green) and the γ-subunit (violet) of transdu- cin are anchored in the membrane via lipids (see p. 214). The β-subunit is shown in detail on p. 72. D. T-cell receptor \u0002 The cells of theimmunesystem communicate with each other particularly intensively. The T-cell receptor plays a central role in the acti- vation of T lymphocytes (see p. 296). The cell at the top has been infected with a virus, and it indicates this by presenting a viral peptide (violet) with the help of a class I MHC protein (yellow and green). The combination of the two molecules is recognized by the dimeric T-cell receptor (blue) and converted into a signal that activates the T cell (bottom) and thereby enhances the immune response to the virus. 224 Organelles GTP α2 α1 β2 β1 P P P P α2 α1 β2 β1 GDP GDP Chemical signals Metabolites Hormones Neurotransmitters Mediators Odorants Tastants Other molecules Inorganic ions Physical signals Light Electrical impulses Mechanical stimuli Activator Protein kinase Ion channel A.

In the area of the nucleus, the ER turns into the external nuclear membrane. Morphologically, a dis- tinction is made between the rough ER (rER) and the smooth ER (sER). Large numbers of ribosomes are found on the membranes of the rER, whichare lackingonthe sER. On the other hand, the sER is rich in membrane- bound enzymes, which catalyze partial reac- tions in the lipid metabolism as well as bio- transformations. A. Rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus \u0002 The rER (1)is a site of active protein biosynthesis. This is where proteins destined for membranes, lysosomes, and export from the cell are synthesized. The remaining pro- teins are produced in the cytoplasm on ribo- somes that are not bound to membranes. Proteins synthesized at the rER (1)are folded and modified after translation (protein maturation; see p. 230). They remain either in the rER as membrane proteins, or pass with the help of transport vesicles (2)to the Golgi apparatus (3). Transport vesicles are formed by buddingfrom existingmembranes,and they disappear again by fusing with them (see p. 228). The Golgi apparatus (3)is a complexnet- work, also enclosed, consisting of flattened membrane saccules (“cisterns”), which are stacked on top of each other in layers. Pro- teins maturehereand aresorted and packed. A distinction is made between the cis, medial, and trans Golgi regions, aswell asa trans Golgi network (tGN). The post–translational modification of proteins, which starts in the ER, continues in these sections. From the Golgi apparatus, the proteins are transported by vesicles to various targets in the cells—e. g., to lysosomes (4), the plasma membrane (6), and secretory vesicles (5)that release their contents into the extracellular space by fusion with the plasma membrane (exocytosis; see p. 228). Protein transport can either proceed continuously (constitutive), or it can be regulated by chemical signals. The decision regarding which pathway a protein will take and whether its transport will be constitutive or regulated depends on the sig- nal sequences or signal structures that pro- teins carry with them like address labels (see p. 228). In addition to proteins, the Golgi ap- paratus also transports membrane lipids to their targets. B. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum \u0002 Regions of the ER that have no bound ribo- somesare known asthe smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER). In most cells, the proportion representedbythe sER is small. AmarkedsER is seen in cells that have an active lipid me- tabolism, such as hepatocytes and Leydig cells. The sER is usually made up of branching, closed tubules. Membrane-located enzymes in the sER catalyze lipid synthesis. Phospholipid synthe- sis (see p. 170) is located in the sER, for exam- ple, and several steps in cholesterol biosyn- thesis (see p. 172) also take place there. In endocrine cells that form steroid hormones, a large proportion of the reaction steps in- volved also take place in the sER (see p. 376). In the liver’s hepatocytes, the proportion represented by the sER is particularly high. It contains enzymes that catalyze so-called biotransformations. These are reactions in which apolar foreign substances, as well as endogenous substances—e. g., steroid hormo- nes—are chemically altered in order to inacti- vate them and/or prepare them for conjuga- tion with polar substances (phase I reactions; see p. 316). Numerous cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in these conversions (see p. 318) and can therefore be regarded as the major molecules of the sER. The sER also functions as an intracellular calcium store, which normally keeps the Ca 2+ level in the cytoplasm low. This function is particularly marked in the sarcoplasmic retic- ulum, a specialized form of the sER in muscle cells (see p. 334). For release and uptake of Ca 2+, the membranes of the sER contain sig- nal-controlled Ca 2+ channels and energy-de- pendent Ca 2+ ATPases (seep.220). In thelu- men of the sER, the high Ca 2+ concentration is buffered by Ca 2+-binding proteins. 226 Organelles Ca2 + Morphological structures Biochemical processes 2. Transport 2. vesicle 3.

Protein sorting \u0002 The biosynthesis of all proteins starts on free ribosomes (top). However, the paths that the proteins follow soon diverge, depending on which target they are destined for. Proteins that carry a signal peptide for the ER (1) follow the secretory pathway (right). Proteins that do not have this signal follow the cytoplasmic pathway (left). Secretory pathway. Ribosomes that syn- thesize a protein with a signal peptide for the ER settle on the ER (see p. 228). The pep- tide chain is transferred into the lumen of the rER. Thepresenceorabsence of other signal sequences and signal regions determines the subsequent transport pathway. Proteins that have stop-transfer sequences (4) remain as integral membrane proteins in the ER membrane. They then pass into other membranes via vesicular transport (see p. 226). From the rER, their pathway then leads to the Golgi apparatus and then on to the plasma membrane. Proteins destined to remain in the rER—e. g., enzymes—find their way back from the Golgi apparatus to the rER with the help of a retention signal (2). Other proteins move from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosomes (3; see p. 234), to the cell membrane (integral membrane proteins or constitutive exocytosis), or are transported out of the cell (9; signal-regulated exocytosis) by secretory vesicles (8). Cytoplasmic pathway. Proteins that do not have a signal peptide for the ER are synthe- sizedinthe cytoplasm onfree ribosomes,and remain in that compartment. Special signals mediate further transport into the mitochon- dria (5; see p. 232), the nucleus (6; see p. 208) or peroxisomes (7). B. Translocation signals \u0003 Signal peptides are short sections at the N or C terminus, or within the peptide chain. Areas on the protein surface that are formed by varioussectionsof the chain orbyvarious chains are known as signal regions.Signal peptides and signal regions are structural sig- nals that are usually recognized by receptors on organelles (see A). They move the proteins, with the help of additional proteins, into the organelles (selective protein transfer). Struc- tural signals can also activate enzymes that modify the proteins and thereby determine their subsequent fate. Examples include lyso- somal proteins (see p. 234) and membrane proteins with lipid anchors (see p. 214). After they have been used, signal peptides at the N terminus are cleaved off by specific hydrolases (symbol: scissors). In proteins that contain several successive signal sequences, this process can expose the subsequent sig- nals. By contrast, signal peptides that have to be read several times are not cleaved. C. Exocytosis \u0003 Exocytosis is a term referring to processes that allow cells to expel substances (e. g., hor- mones or neurotransmitters) quickly and in large quantities. Using a complex protein ma- chinery, secretory vesicles fuse completely or partially with the plasma membrane and re- lease their contents. Exocytosis is usually regulated by chemical or electrical signals. As an example, the mechanism by which neuro- transmitters are released from synapses (see p. 348) is shown here, although only the most important proteins are indicated. The decisive element in exocytosis is the interaction between proteins known as SNAREs that are located on the vesicular membrane (v-SNAREs) and on the plasma membrane (t-SNAREs). In the resting state (1), the v-SNARE synaptobrevin is blocked by the vesicular protein synaptotagmin. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic membrane, voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels open (see p. 348). Ca 2+ flows in and triggers the machinery by conformational changes in proteins. Contact takes place between synap- tobrevin and the t-SNARE synaptotaxin (2). Additional proteins known as SNAPs bind to the SNARE complex and allow fusion between the vesicle and the plasma membrane (3). The process is supported by the hydrolysis of GTP by the auxiliary protein Rab. Thetoxin of thebacterium Clostridium bot- ulinum, one of the most poisonous substances there is, destroys components of the exocyto- sis machinery in synapses through enzymatic hydrolysis, and in this way blocks neurotrans- mission. 228 Organelles Rough ER H 3N * R RR + + 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 * Ca2 + * * H2N-SKL -KDEL + 1. 2. 3. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 P Ca2 Ca2 ...LEDK....

Protein synthesis in the rER \u0002 With all proteins, protein biosynthesis (Translation; for details, see p. 250) starts on free ribosomes in the cytoplasm (1). Proteins that are exported out of the cell or into lyso- somes, and membrane proteins of the ER and the plasma membrane, carry a signal peptide for the ER at their N-terminus. This is a section of 15–60 amino acids in which one or two strongly basic residues (Lys, Arg) near the N- terminus are followed by a strongly hydro- phobic sequence of 10–15 residues (see p. 228). As soon as the signal peptide (red) appears on the surface of the ribosome (2), an RNA- containing signal recognition particle (SRP, green) binds to the sequence and initially interrupts translation (3). The SRP then binds to an SRP receptor in the rER membrane, and in this way attaches the ribosome to the ER (4). After this, the SRP dissociates from the signal peptide and from the SRP receptor and is available again for step 3. This ender- gonic process is driven by GTP hydrolysis (5). Translation now resumes. The remainder of the protein, still unfolded, is gradually intro- duced into a channel (the translocon)inthe lumen of the rER (6), where a signal peptidase located in the inner ER membrane cleaves the signal peptide while translation is still taking place (7). This converts the preprotein into a proprotein,from which thematureprotein finally arises after additional post-transla- tional modifications (8) inthe ER and inthe Golgi apparatus. If the growing polypeptide contains a stop- transfer signal (see p. 228), then this hydro- phobic section of the chain remains stuck in themembraneoutside the translocon, andan integral membrane protein arises. In the course of translation, an additional signal se- quence can re-start the transfer of the chain through the translocon. Several repetitions of this process produce integral membrane pro- teins with several transmembrane helices (see p. 214). B. Protein glycosylation \u0003 Most extracellular proteins contain covalently bound oligosaccharide residues. For example, all plasma proteins with the exception of al- bumin are glycosylated. Together with glyco- lipids, numerous glycoproteins on the cell surface form the glycocalyx. Inside the ER, the carbohydrate parts of the glycoproteins are cotranslationally transferred to the grow- ing chain, and are then converted into their final form while passing through the ER and Golgi apparatus. N-bound oligosaccharides (see p. 44) are always bound to the acid-amide group of as- paragine residues. If a glycosylation sequence (–Asn–X–Ser(Thr)–, where X can be any amino acid) appears in the growing peptide chain, then a transglycosylase in the ER mem- brane [1] transfers a previously produced core oligosaccharide consisting of 14 hexose residues en-bloc from the carrier molecule dolichol diphosphate to the peptide. Dolichol is a long-chain isoprenoid (see p. 52) consisting of 10–20 isoprene units, whichis embedded inthe ER membrane. A hydroxyl group at the end of the molecule is bound to diphosphate, on which the nuclear oligosaccharide is built up in an extended reaction sequence (not shown here in detail). The core structure consists of two residues of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), a branched group of nine mannose residues (Man) and three terminal glucose resides (Glc). As the proprotein passes through the ER, glycosidases [2] removethe glucoseresidues completely and the mannoses partially (“trimming”), thereby producing the man- nose-rich type of oligosaccharide residues. Subsequently, various glycosyltransferases [3] transfer additional monosaccharides (e. g., GlcNAc,galactose,fucose, andN-acetylneura- minic acid; see p. 38) to the mannose-rich intermediate and thereby produce the com- plex type of oligosaccharide. The structure of the final oligosaccharide depends on the type and activity of the glycosyltransferases pre- sent in the ER of the cell concerned, and is therefore genetically determined (although indirectly). 230 Organelles H2O GDP+Pi GTP 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 P P 3 3 UDP GDP Dol Dol P P 1 Asn Asn Asn Asn 2 A.

During this process they are supported by various auxiliary proteins. A. Protein folding in the rER \u0001 To prevent incorrect folding of the growing protein during protein biosynthesis, chaper- ones (see B) inthe lumenof the rER bind to the peptide chain and stabilize it until trans- lation has been completed. Binding protein (BiP) is an important chaperone in the ER. Many secretory proteins—e. g., pancreatic ribonuclease (RNAse; see p. 74)—contain sev- eral disulfide bonds that are only formed ox- idatively from SH groups after translation. The eight cysteine residues of the RNAse can in principle form 105 different pairings, but only the combination of the four disulfide bonds shown on p. 75 provides active en- zyme. Incorrect pairings can block further foldingorlead tounstableorinsoluble con- formations. The enzyme protein disulfide iso- merase [1] accelerates the equilibration be- tween paired andunpairedcysteineresidues, so that incorrect pairs can be quickly split before the protein finds its final conformation. Most peptide bonds in proteins take on the trans conformation (see p. 66). Only bonds with proline residues (–X–Pro–) can be present in both cis and trans forms. In the protein’s native conformation, every X–Pro bond has to have the correct conforma- tion (cis or trans). As the uncatalyzed transi- tion between the two forms is very slow, there is a proline cis–trans isomerase [2] in the ER that accelerates the conversion. B. Chaperones and chaperonins \u0001 Most proteins fold spontaneously into their native conformation, even in the test tube. In thecell, wherethere arevery high concen- trations of proteins (around 350 g L –1), this is more dif cult. In the unfolded state, the apolar regions of the peptide chain (yellow) tend to aggregate—due to the hydrophobic effect (see p. 28)—with other proteins or with each other to form insoluble products (2). In addition, unfolded proteins are suscep- tible to proteinases. To protect partly folded proteins, there are auxiliary proteins called chaperones because they guard immature proteins against damaging contacts. Chaper- ones are formed increasingly during tempera- ture stress and are therefore also known as heat-shock proteins (hsp). Several classes of hsp are distinguished. Chaperones of the hsp70 type (Dna K in bacteria) are common, as are type hsp60 chaperonins (GroEL/ES in bacteria). Class hsp90 chaperones have spe- cial tasks (see p. 378). While small proteins canoften reachtheir native conformation without any help (1), larger molecules require hsp70 proteins for protection against aggregation which bind as monomers and can dissociate again, depend- ent on ATP (3). By contrast, type hsp60 chap- eronins form large, barrel-shaped complexes with 14 subunits in which proteins can fold independently while shielded from their en- vironment (4). The function of hsp60 has been investigated in detail in the bacterial chaperonin GroEL (right). The barrel has two chambers, which are closed with a lid (GroES) during folding of the guest protein. Driven by ATP hydrolysis, the chambers open and close alternately—i. e., the release of the fully folded protein from one chamber is coupled to the uptake of an unfolded peptide in the second chamber. C. Protein import in mitochondria \u0001 Class hsp70 chaperones are also needed for translocation of nuclear-coded proteins from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria (see p. 228). As two membranes have to be crossed to reach the matrix, there are two translocator complexes: TOM (“transport outer membrane”) and TIM (“transport inner membrane”). For transport, proteins are un- folded in the cytoplasm and protected by hsp70. TOM recognizes the positively charged signal sequence at the protein’s N terminus (see p. 228) and with the help of the mem- brane potential threads the chains through the central pores of the two complexes. Inside TIM, further hsp70 molecules bind and pull the chain completely into the matrix. As with import into the ER, the signal peptide is pro- teolytically removed by a signal peptidase during translocation. 232 Organelles 1 2 S S S S SH S S S SSH S S S SSH 1 2 1. 2. 3.

Structure and contents \u0002 Animal lysosomes are organelles with a diam- eter of 0.2–2.0 µm with various shapes that are surrounded by a single membrane. There are usually several hundred lysosomes per cell. ATP-driven V-type proton pumps are ac- tive in their membranes (see p. 220). As these accumulate H + in the lysosomes, the content of lysosomes with pH values of 4.5–5 is much more acidic than the cytoplasm (pH 7–7.3). The lysosomes are the cell’s “stomach,” serving to break down various cell compo- nents. For this purpose, they contain some 40 different types of hydrolases,which are capable of breaking down every type of mac- romolecule. The marker enzyme of lysosomes is acid phosphatase. The pH optimum of lyso- somal enzymes is adjusted to the acid pH value and is also in the range of pH 5. At neutral pH, as in the cytoplasm, lysosomal enzymes only have low levels of activity. This appears to be a mechanism for protecting the cells from di- gesting themselves in case lysosomal enzymes enter the cytoplasm at any time. In plants and fungi, the cell vacuoles (see p. 43) have the function of lysosomes. B. Functions \u0002 Lysosomes serve for enzymatic degradation of macromolecules and cell organelles, which are supplied in various ways. The example shows the degradationofanoveraged mito- chondrion by autophagy. To accomplish this, the lysosome encloses the organelle (1). Dur- ingthis process,the primary lysosome con- verts into a secondary lysosome, in which the hydrolytic degradation takes place (2). Finally, residual bodies contain the indigestible resi- dues of the lysosomal degradation process. Lysosomes are also responsible for the degra- dation of macromolecules and particles taken up by cells via endocytosis and phagocyto- sis—e. g., lipoproteins, proteohormones, and bacteria (heterophagy). In the process, lyso- somes fuse with the endosomes (3)in which the endocytosed substances are supplied. C. Synthesis and transport of lysosomal proteins \u0002 Primary lysosomes arise in the region of the Golgi apparatus. Lysosomal proteins are syn- thesized in the rER and are glycosylated there as usual (1; see p. 228). The next steps are specific for lysosomal proteins (right part of the illustration). In a two-step reaction, ter- minal mannose residues (Man) are phos- phorylated at the C–6 position of the man- nose. First, N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate is transferred to the OH group at C-6 in a terminal mannose residue, and N-acetylglu- cosamine is then cleaved again. Lysosomal proteins therefore carry a terminal mannose 6–phosphate (Man6–P; 2). The membranes of the Golgi apparatus contain receptor molecules that bind Man 6–P. They recognize lysosomal proproteins by this residue and bind them (3). With the help of clathrin, the receptors are concen- trated locally. This allows the appropriate membrane sections to be pinched off and transported to the endolysosomes with the help of transport vesicles (4), from which pri- mary lysosomes arise through maturation (5). Finally, the phosphate groups are removed from Man 6–P (6). The Man 6–P receptors arereused. Thefall in the pH value in the endolysosomes releases the receptors from the bound proteins (7) which are then transported back to the Golgi apparatus with the help of transport vesicles. Further information Many hereditary diseases are due to genetic defects in lysosomal enzymes. The metabo- lism of glycogen (\u0001 glycogenoses), lipids (\u0001 lipidoses), and proteoglycans (\u0001 mucopoly- saccharidoses) is particularly affected. As the lysosomal enzymes are indispensable for the intracellular breakdown of macromolecules, unmetabolized macromolecules or degrada- tion products accumulate in the lysosomes in these diseases and lead to irreversible cell damage over time. In the longer term, en- largement takes place, and in severe cases there may be failure of the organ affected— e. g., the liver. 234 Organelles 1 2 3 AA P P P PP PH H U P 1 2 P U P -GlcNAc 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 H2O GlcNAc 2 P O HO OH H HO H H CH2 H OH O R O HO OH NH H H H CH2 H OH O P CO CH3 O O O CH2 O HO OH H HO H H H O R O HO OH CH2 O HO R O Secondary lysosome Secondary lysosome Endosome Primary lysosome Endocytotic vesicle Residual body Cell Macro- molecules, particles Enzymatic degradation Overaged mitochondrion A.

The decisive factor involved is their ability to enter into specific base pairings with each other (see p. 84). The individual processes in- volved,which aresummedup inanoverview here, are discussed in more detail on the fol- lowing pages. A. Expression and transmission of genetic information \u0001 Storage. The genetic information of all cells is stored in the base sequence of their DNA (RNA only occurs as a genetic material in viruses; see p. 404). Functional sections of DNA that code for inheritable structures or functions are referred to as genes. The 30 000–40 000 human genes represent only a few percent of the genome, which consists of approximately 5 109 base pairs (bp). Most genes code for proteins—i. e., they contain the information for the sequence of amino acid residues of a protein (its sequence). Every amino acid res- idue is representedin DNA by a codeword(a codon) consisting of a sequence of three base pairs (a triplet). At the level of DNA, codons are defined as sequences of the sense strand read in the 5\u0001\u00013\u0001 direction (see p. 84). A DNA codon for the amino acid phenylalanine, for example, is thus TTC (2). Replication. During cell division, all of the genetic information has to be passed on to the daughter cells. To achieve this, the whole of the DNA is copied during the S phase of the cell cycle (see p. 394). In this process, each strandservesasamatrix forthe synthesis of a complementary second strand (1;see p. 240). Transcription. For expression of a gene—i. e., synthesis of the coded protein—the DNA se- quence information has to be converted into a protein sequence. As DNA itself is not in- volved in protein synthesis, the information is transferred from the nucleus to the site of synthesis in the cytoplasm. To achieve this, the template strand in the relevant part of the gene is transcribed into an RNA (hnRNA). Thesequenceofthis RNA is thus complemen- tary to that of the template strand (3), but— with the exception of the exchange of thy- mine for uracil—it is identical to that of the sense strand. In this way, the DNA triplet TTC gives rise in hnRNA to the RNA codon UUC. RNA maturation. In eukaryotes, the hnRNA initially formed is modified several times be- fore it can leave the nucleus as messenger RNA (mRNA, 4). During RNA maturation, superfluous (“intervening”) sequences (in- trons) are removed from the molecule, and both ends of the transcript are protected by the addition of further nucleotides (see p. 246). Translation. Mature mRNA enters the cyto- plasm, where it binds to ribosomes,which convert the RNA information into a peptide sequence. The ribosomes (see p. 250) consist of more than 100 proteins and several RNA molecules (rRNA;see p. 82). rRNAplays a role as a ribosomal structural element and is also involved in the binding of mRNA to the ribo- some and the formation of the peptide bond. The actual information transfer is based on the interaction between the mRNA codons and another type of RNA, transfer RNA (tRNA; see p. 82). tRNAs, of which there are numerous types, always provide the correct amino acid to the ribosome according to the sequence information in the mRNA. tRNAs are loaded with an amino acid residue at the 3\u0001 end. Approximately in the middle, they presentthe tripletthatiscomplementary to each mRNA codon, known as the anticodon (GAA in the example shown). If the codon UUC appears on the mRNA, the anticodon binds a molecule of Phe-t-RNA Phe to the mRNA (5) and thus brings the phenylalanine residue at the other end of the molecule into a position in which it can take over the growing poly- peptide chain from the neighboring tRNA (6). Amino acid activation. Before binding to the ribosomes, tRNAs are loaded with the correct amino acids by specific ligases (7; see p. 248). It is the amino acid tRNA ligases that carry out the transfer (translation) of the genetic information from the nucleic acid level to the protein level. 236 Molecular genetics 5' 3' 3' 5' NT C G NT NNA A N N 5' 3' 3' 5' NT C G NT NNA A N N N N Phe 5' 3' 3' 5' NNT C G NT NN N AA N N 5' 3' 3' 5' NNU C G NU NNN A A N N 5' 3' NNU CNU N 5' 3' 5' NNU C G NU NN A A N N N Phe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 N N A P A.

Chromatin \u0002 In thenuclei ofeukaryotes (seep. 196), DNA is closely associated with proteins and RNA. These nucleoprotein complexes, with a DNA proportion of approximately one-third, are known as chromatin.Itisonlyduringcell division (see p. 394) that chromatin con- denses into chromosomes that are visible under light microscopy. During interphase, most of the chromatin is loose, and in these conditions a morphological distinction can be made between tightly packed heterochroma- tin and the less dense euchromatin.Euchro- matin is the site of active transcription. The proteins contained in chromatin are classified as either histone or non-histone proteins. Histones (B) are small, strongly basic proteins that are directly associated with DNA. They contribute to the structural organ- ization of chromatin, and their basic amino acids also neutralize the negatively charged phosphate groups, allowing the dense pack- ing of DNA in the nucleus. This makes it pos- siblefor the46DNA moleculesof the diploid human genome, with their 5 10 9 base pairs (bp) and a total length of about 2 m, to be accommodated in a nucleus with a diameter of only 10 µm. Histones also play a central role in regulating transcription (see p. 244). Two histone molecules each of types H2A (blue), H2B (green), H3 (yellow), and H4 (red) form an octameric complex, around which 146 bp of DNA are wound in 1.8 turns. These particles, with a diameter of 7 nm, are re- ferred to as nucleosomes. Another histone (H1) binds to DNA segments that are not di- rectly in contact with the histone octamers (“linker” DNA). It covers about 20 bp and sup- ports the formation of spirally wound super- structures with diameters of 30 nm, known as solenoids. When chromatin condenses into chromosomes, the solenoids form loops about 200 nm long, which already contain about 80 000 bp. The loops are bound to a protein framework (the nuclear scaffolding), which in turn organizes some 20 loops to form mini- bands. A large number of stacked minibands finally produces a chromosome. In the chro- mosome, the DNA is so densely packed that the smallest human chromosome already contains more than 50 million bp. The non-histone proteins are very hetero- geneous. This group includes structural pro- teins of the nucleus, as well as many enzymes and transcription factors (see p. 118), which selectively bind to specific segments of DNA and regulate gene expression and other pro- cesses. B. Histones \u0003 The histones are remarkable in several ways. With their high proportions of lysine and ar- ginine (blue shading), they are strongly basic, as mentioned above. In addition, their amino acid sequence has hardly changed at all in the course of evolution. This becomes clear when one compares the histone sequences in mam- mals, plants, and fungi (yeasts are single- celled fungi; see p. 148). For example, the H4 histones in humans and wheat differ only in a single amino acid residue, and there are only a few changes between humans and yeast. In addition, all of these changes are “conservative”—i. e., thesizeand polarity barely differ. It can be concluded from this that the histones were already “optimized” when the last common predecessor of ani- mals, plants, and fungi was alive on Earth (more than 700 million years ago). Although countless mutations in histone genes have taken place since, almost all of these evidently led to the extinction of the organisms con- cerned. The histones in the octamer carry N-termi- nal mobile “tails” consisting of some 20 amino acid residues that project out of the nucleo- somes and are important in the regulation of chromatin structure and in controlling gene expression (see A2; only two of the eight tails are shown in full length). For example, the condensation of chromatin into chromo- somes is associated with phosphorylation (P) of the histones, while the transcription of genes is initiated by acetylation (A) of lysine residues in the N-terminal region (see p. 244). 238 Molecular genetics VDMATVTKV Y A L K R Q G R T L Y G F G G VDMATVTKV Y A L K R Q G R T L Y G F G G VDLSTVTKV Y A L K R Q G R T L Y G F G G 10080 90 VKLVGRTEF L E N V I R D A V T Y T E H A K R IKLVGRTEF L E N V I R D A V T Y T E H A R R SKLVARVEF L E S V I R D S V T Y T E H A K R 60 70 IAPKTIGQR R L A R R G G V K R I S G L I Y E IAPKTIGQR R L A R R G G V K R I S G L I Y E IAPKTIGQR R L A R R G G V K R I S G L I Y E 30 40 50 A MP A MA A A AP KGGKGRGSG L G K G G A K R H R K V L R D N I KGGKGRGSG L G K G G A K R H R K V L R D N I KGGKGRGSG L G K G G A K R H R K I L R D N I 10 A.

This processisknown as DNA replication. A. Mechanism of DNA polymerases \u0002 Replication is catalyzed by DNA–dependent DNA polymerases. Theseenzymes requirea single strand of DNA, known as the tem- plate. Beginning at a short starting sequence of RNA (the primer), they synthesize a second complementary strand on the basis of this template, and thus create a complete DNA double helix again. The substrates of the DNA polymerases are the four deoxynucleo- side triphosphates dATP, dGTP, dCTP,and dTTP. In each step, base pairing first binds the nucleotide that is complementary to the current base in the template strand. The α–phosphate residue of the newly bound nu- cleoside triphosphate is then subjected to nu- cleophilic attack by the 3\u0001–OH group of the nucleotide incorporated immediately previ- ously. This is followed by the elimination of diphosphate and the formation of a new phosphoric acid diester bond. These steps are repeated again for each nucleotide. The mechanism described means that the matrix can only be read in the 3\u0001\u00015\u0001 direction. In other words, the newly synthesized strand always grows in the 5\u0001\u00013\u0001 direction.The same mechanism is also used in transcription by DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (see p. 242). Most DNAand RNApolymerases con- sist of more than 10 subunits, the role of which is still unclear to some extent. B. Replication in E. coli \u0002 Although replication in prokaryotes is now well understood, many details in eukaryotes are still unclear. However, it is certain that the process is in principle similar. A simplified scheme of replicationinthe bacterium Escherichia coli is shown here. In bacteria, replication starts at a specific point in the circular DNA—the origin of repli- cation—and proceeds in both directions. This results in two diverging replication forks,in which the two strands are replicated simulta- neously. Numerous proteins are involved in theprocesses taking placeinthis typeoffork, and only the most important are shown here. The two strands of the initial DNA (1)are shown in blue and violet, while the newly formed strands are pink and orange. Each fork (2) contains two molecules of DNA polymerase III and a number of helper proteins. The latter include DNA topoisomer- ases and single–strand-binding proteins. Topoisomerases are enzymes that unwind the superhelical DNA double strand (gyrase, topoisomerase II) and then separate it into the two individual strands (helicase, topoisomer- ase I). Since the template strand is always read from 3\u0001 to 5\u0001 (see above), only one of the strands (known as the leading strand; violet/ pink) can undergo continuous replication. For the lagging strand (light blue), the reading direction is the opposite of the direction of movement of the fork. In this matrix, the new strand is first synthesized in individual pieces, which are known as Okazaki frag- ments after their discoverer (green/orange). Each fragment starts with a short RNA pri- mer (green), which is necessary for the func- tioning of the DNA polymerase and is synthe- sized by a special RNA polymerase (“primase,” not shown). The primer is then extended by DNA polymerase III (orange). After 1000–2000 nucleotides have been included, synthesis of the fragment is interrupted and a new one is begun, starting with another RNA primer that has been synthesized in the interim. The in- dividual Okazaki fragments are initially not bound to one another and still have RNA at the 5\u0001 end (3). At some distance from the fork, DNA polymerase I therefore starts to remove the RNA primer and replace it with DNA com- ponents. Finally, the gaps still remaining are closed by a DNA ligase. In DNA double helices formed in this way, only one of the strands has been newly synthesized—i. e., replication is semiconservative. In bacteria, some 1000 nucleotides are re- plicated per second. In eukaryotes, replication takes place more slowly (about 50 nucleotides s–1)and thegenomeis larger. Thousands of replication forks are therefore active simulta- neously in eukaryotes. 240 Molecular genetics A T T A G G G C A T T A G G G C G C C PP PPP PPP 3' 5' 3' 5' 5' 5' Gua AdeHO HO HO HO PP OF1 OF2 1. 2. 3.

DNA only serves as a template and is not altered in any way by the transcription process. Transcribable segments of DNA that code for a defined product are called genes. It is estimated that the mamma- lian genome contains 30 000–40 000 genes, which together account for less than 5% of the DNA. A. Transcription and maturation of RNA: overview \u0002 Transcription is catalyzed by DNA–dependent RNA polymerases. These act in a similar way to DNA polymerases (see p. 240), except that they incorporate ribonucleotides instead of deoxyribonucleotides into the newly synthe- sized strand; also, they do not require a pri- mer. Eukaryotic cells contain at least three different types of RNA polymerase. RNA poly- merase I synthesizes an RNA with a sedimen- tation coef cient (see p. 200) of 45 S, which serves as precursor for three ribosomal RNAs. The products of RNA polymerase II are hnRNAs, from which mRNAs later develop, as well as precursors for snRNAs. Finally, RNA polymerase III transcribes genes that code for tRNAs, 5S rRNA, and certain snRNAs. These precursors giveriseto functionalRNA molecules by a process called RNA maturation (see p. 246). Polymerases II and III are inhib- ited by –amanitin, a toxin in the Amanita phalloides mushroom. B. Organization of the PEP-CK gene \u0003 The way in which a typical eukaryotic gene is organized is illustrated here using a gene that codes for a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis (see p. 154)—the phosphoenolpyruvate car- boxykinase (PEP-CK). In the rat, the PEP-CK gene is nearly 7 kbp (kilobase pairs) long. Only 1863 bp, distrib- uted over 10 coding segments (exons,dark blue) carry the information for the protein’s 621 amino acids. The remainder is allotted to the promoter (pink) and intervening sequen- ces (introns,light blue). Thegene’s promoter region (approximately 1 kbp) serves for reg- ulation (see p. 188). Transcription starts at the 3\u0001 end of the promoter (“transcription start”) and continues until the polyadenylation se- quence (see below) is reached. The primary transcript (hnRNA) still has a length of about 6.2 kbp. During RNA maturation, the non- coding sequences corresponding to the in- trons are removed, and the two ends of the hnRNA are modified. The translatable mRNA still has half the length of the hnRNA and is modified at both ends (see p. 246). In many eukaryotic genes, the proportion of introns is even higher. For example, the gene for dihydrofolate reductase (see p. 402) is over 30 kbp long. The information is dis- tributed over six exons, which together have a length of only about 6 kbp. C. Transcription process \u0002 As mentioned above, RNA polymerase II (green) binds to the 3\u0001 end of the promoter region. A sequence that is important for this binding is known as the TATA box—a short A– and T–rich sequence that varies slightly from gene to gene. A typical base sequence (“con- sensus sequence”) is ...TATAAA... Numerous proteins known as basal transcription factors are necessary for the interaction of the poly- merase with this region. Additional factors can promote or inhibit the process (transcrip- tional control; see p. 244). Together with the polymerase, they form the basal transcription complex. At the end of initiation (2), the polymerase is repeatedly phosphorylated, frees itself from the basal complex, and starts moving along the DNA in the 3\u0001 direction. The enzyme sep- arates a short stretch of the DNA double helix into two single strands. The complementary nucleoside triphosphates are bound by base pairing in the template strand and are linked step by step to the hnRNA as it grows in the 5\u0001\u00013\u0001 direction (3). Shortly after the begin- ning of elongation,the 5\u0001 end of the transcript is protected by a “cap” (see p. 246). Once the polyadenylation sequence has been reached (typical sequence: ...AATAA...), the transcript is released (4). Shortly after this, the RNA polymerase stops transcribing and dissociates from the DNA. 242 Molecular genetics P P P 45S rRNA 28S rRNA 18S rRNA 5.8S rRNA mRNA 5S rRNA tRNA snRNA ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP snRNA 3' DNA mRNA hn RNA ...TATAAA.. ..AATAAA.. 1. 2. 3. 3' 5' 3' 5' 3' 5' 3' 5' 4. 3'5' 3'5' 3'5' P P P C.

Transcription and maturation of RNA: overview 100 Bases AUG UAA 243Transcription Transcriptional control Although all cells contain the complete ge- nome, they only use a fraction of the informa- tion in it. The genes known as “housekeeping genes,” which code for structural molecules and enzymes of intermediate metabolism, are the only ones that undergo constant tran- scription. The majority of genes are only ac- tive in certain cell types, in specific metabolic conditions, or during differentiation. Which genes are transcribed and which are not is regulated by transcriptional control (see also p. 118). This involves control elements (cis- active elements) in the gene’s promoter re- gion and gene-specific regulatory proteins (transcription factors, trans -active factors), which bind to the control elements and thereby activate or inhibit transcription. A. Initiation of transcription \u0003 In the higher organisms, DNA is blocked by histones (see p. 238) and is therefore not ca- pable of being transcribed without special positive regulation. In eukaryotes, it is there- fore histones that play the role of repressors (see p. 118). For transcription to be set in mo- tion at all, the chromatin first has to be re- structured. In the resting state, the lysine residues in the N-terminal “tail” of the histones (see p. 238) are not acetylated. In this state, which can be produced by histone deacetylases [1], the nucleosomes are stable. It is only the in- teraction of activator and regulator proteins with their control elements that allows the binding of coactivator complexes that have histone acetylase activity [2]. They acetylate the histone tails and thereby loosen the nu- cleosome structure suf ciently for the basal transcription complex to form. This consists of DNA-dependent RNA poly- merase II and basal transcription factors (TFIIX, X = A – H). First, the basal factor TFIID binds to the promoter. TFIID, a large complex of numerous proteins, contains TATA box- binding protein (TBP) and so-called TAFs (TBP-associated factors). Thepolymeraseis attached to this core with the help of TFIIB. Before transcription starts, additional TFs have to bind, including TFIIH, which has heli- case activity and separates the two strands of DNA during elongation. In all, some 35 differ- ent proteins are involved in the basal com- plex. This alone, however, is still not suf cient for transcription to start. In addition, positive signals have to be emitted by more distant trans-active factors, integrated by the coacti- vator/mediator complex, and passed on to the basal complex (see B). Theactualsignalfor starting elongation consists of the multiple phosphorylation of a domain in the C-terminal region of the poly- merase. In phosphorylated form, it releases itself from the basal complex along with a few TFs and starts to synthesize hnRNA. B. Regulation of PEP-CK transcription \u0003 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK), a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is regulated by several hormones, all of which affect the transcription of the PEP-CK gene. Cortisol, glucagon, and thyroxin induce PEP-CK, while insulin inhibits its induction (see p. 158). More than ten control elements (dark red), distributed over approximately 1 kbp, have so far been identified in the promoter of the PEP- CK gene (top). These include response ele- ments for the glucocorticoid receptor (GRE; seep. 378),for thethyroxin receptor(TRE), and for the steroid-like retinoic acid (AF-1). Additional control elements (CRE, cAMP-re- sponsive element) bind the transcription fac- tor C/EBP, which is activated by cAMP-de- pendent protein kinase A through phosphor- ylation. This is the way in which glucagon, which raises the cAMP level (see p. 158), works. Control element P1 binds the hor- mone-independent factor NF-1 (nuclear fac- tor-1). All proteins that bind to the control elements mentioned above are in contact with a coactivator/mediator complex (CBP/ p300), which integrates their input like a computer and transmits the result in the form of stronger or weaker signals to the basal transcription complex. Inhibition of PEP-CK transcription by insulin is mediated by an insulin-responsive element (IRE) in the vicin- ity of the GRE. Binding of an as yet unknown factor takes place here, inhibiting the binding of the glucocorticoid receptor to the GRE. 244 Molecular genetics PI3K GR TR PK-A C/EBP 1 1 4 3 2 2 AF-1 IRE GRE TRE P4 CRE P1 CRE RAR ?

Even during tran- scription, the two ends of the transcript have additional nucleotides added (A). The sections that correspond to the intervening gene se- quences in the DNA (introns) are then cut out (splicing; see B). Other transcripts—e. g., the 45 S precursor of rRNA formed by polymerase I (seep. 242)—arebroken down into smaller fragments by nucleases before export into the cytoplasm. A. 5\u0001 and 3\u0001 modification of mRNA \u0002 Shortly after transcription begins in eukary- otes, the end of the growing RNA is blocked in several reaction steps by a structure known as a“cap.” In hnRNAs, this consists of a GTP residuethatismethylatedatN-7 of thegua- nine ring. The β-phosphate residue of the cap is linked to the free 5\u0001-OH group of the ter- minal ribose via an ester bond. After the “polyadenylation signal” has been reached (typical sequence: ...AAUAAA...; see p. 242), a polyadenylate “tail” consisting of up to 200 AMP nucleotides is also added at the free 3\u0001 end of the transcript. This reaction is cata- lyzed by a special polyadenylate polymerase. It is only at this point that the mRNA leaves the nucleus as a complex with RNA-binding proteins. Both the cap and the poly-A tail play a vital part in initiating eukaryotic translation (see p. 250). They help position the ribosome cor- rectly on the mRNA near to the starting co- don. The protection which the additional nu- cleotides provide against premature enzy- matic degradation appears to be of lesser im- portance. B. Splicing of hnRNA \u0002 Immediately after transcription, the hnRNA introns are removed and the exons are linked to form a continuous coding sequence. This process, known as splicing,is supported by complicated RNA–protein complexes in the nucleus, the so-called spliceosomes.The com- ponents of these macromolecular machines are called snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleo- protein particles, pronounced “snurps”). SnRNPs occur in five different forms (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6). They consist of numerous proteins and one molecule of snRNA each (see p. 82). To ensure that the RNA message is not destroyed, splicing has to take place in a very precise fashion. The start and end of the hnRNA introns are recognized by a char- acteristic sequence (...AGGT... at the 5\u0001 end or ...[C,U]AGG... at the 3\u0001 end). Another impor- tant structure is the so-called branching point inside the intron. Its sequence is less con- served than the terminal splicing sites, but it always contains one adenosine residue (A). During splicing, the 2\u0001-OH group of this resi- due—supported by the spliceosome (see C)—attacks the phosphoric acid diester bond at the 5\u0001 endof the intron andcleaves it (b). Simultaneously, an unusual 2\u0001\u00015\u0001 bond is formed inside the intron, which thereby takes on a lasso shape (c; see formula). In the second step of the splicing process, the free 3\u0001-OH group at the end of the 5\u0001 terminal exon at- tacks the A–G bond at the 3\u0001 end of the intron. As a result, the two exons are linked and the intron is released, still in a lasso shape (d). C. Spliceosome \u0003 As described above, it is residues of the hnRNA that carry out bond cleavage and bond formation during the splicing process. It is therefore not a protein enzyme that acts as a catalyst here, but rather an RNA. Catalytic RNAs of this type are called ribozymes (see also p. 88). The task of the spliceosomes is to fix and orientate the reacting groups by es- tablishing base pairings between snRNAs and segments of the hnRNA. The probable situa- tion before the adenosine attack at the branching point on the 5\u0001 splicing site (see B,Fig. b) is shown schematically on the right side of the illustration. In this phase, the U1 snRNA fixes the 5\u0001 splicing site, U2 fixes the branching site, and U5 fixes the ends of the two exons. 246 Molecular genetics ...AGGU... ...C AGG... 3' 5' 5' 5' 5' 3' 3' 3' U G G A A 5' . ..

The genetic code \u0002 Most of the genetic information stored in the genome codes for the amino acid sequences of proteins. For these proteins to be ex- pressed, a text in “nucleic acid language” therefore has to be translated into “protein language.” This is the origin of the use of the term translation to describe protein biosyn- thesis. The dictionary used for the translation is the genetic code. As there are 20 proteinogenic amino acids (see p. 60), the nucleic acid language has to contain at least as many words (codons). However, there are only four letters in the nucleic acid alphabet (A, G, C, and U or T). To obtain 20 different words from these, each word has to be at least three letters long (with two letters, there would only be 4 2 =16 possibilities). And in fact the codons do consist of three sequential bases (triplets). Figure 1 shows the standard code in “DNA language” (i. e., as a sequence of triplets in the sense strand of DNA, read in the 5\u0001\u00013\u0001 direc- tion; see p. 84), represented as a circular dia- gram. The scheme is read from the inside to the outside. For example, the triplet CAT codes for the amino acid histidine. With the excep- tion of the exchange of U for T, the DNA co- dons are identical to those of mRNA. As thegeneticcodeprovides 4 3 =64 co- dons for the 20 amino acids, there are several synonymous codons for most amino acids— thecodeis degenerate. Three triplets do not code for amino acids, but instead signal the end of translation (stop codons).Another special codon, the start codon,marks thestart of translation. The code shown here is almost universally applicable; only the mitochondria (see p. 210) and a few microorganisms devi- ate from it slightly. As an example of the way in which the code is read, Fig. 2 shows small sections from the normal and a mutated form of the β-globin gene (see p. 280), as well as the cor- responding mRNA and protein sequences. The point mutation shown, which is relatively fre- quent, leads to replacement of a glutamate residue in position 6 of the β-chain by valine (GAG \u0001 GTG). As a consequence, the mutated hemoglobin tends to aggregate in the deoxy- genated form. This leads to sickle-shaped dis- tortions of the erythrocytes and disturbances of O2 transport (sickle-cell anemia). B. Amino acid activation \u0002 Some 20 different amino acid tRNA ligases in thecytoplasm each bind onetypeoftRNA (see p. 82) with the corresponding amino acid. This reaction, known as amino acid acti- vation, is endergonic and is therefore coupled to ATP cleavage in two steps. First, the amino acid is bound by the en- zymeand reacts therewith ATP to form di- phosphate and an “energy–rich” mixed acid anhydride (aminoacyl adenylate). In the sec- ond step, the 3\u0001-OH group (in other ligases it is the 2\u0001-OH group) of the terminal ribose residue of the tRNA takes over the amino acid residue from the aminoacyl adenylate. In aminoacyl tRNAs, the carboxyl group of the amino acid is therefore esterified with theriboseresidue of theterminaladenosine of thesequence...CCA-3\u0001. The accuracy of translation primarily de- pends on the specificity of the amino acid tRNA ligases, as incorrectly incorporated amino acid residues are not recognized by theribosomelater. A “proofreading mecha- nism” in the active center of the ligase there- fore ensures that incorrectly incorporated amino acid residues are immediately re- moved again. On average, an error only occurs once every 1300 amino acid residues. This is a surprisingly low rate considering how similar some amino acids are—e. g., leucine and iso- leucine. C. Asp–tRNA ligase (dimer) \u0003 Theillustration shows theligaseresponsible for the activation of aspartate. Each subunit of the dimeric enzyme (protein parts shown in orange) binds one molecule of tRNA Asp (blue). Theactivecenters can belocated by the boundATP (green). They areassociatedwith the 3\u0001 end of the tRNA. Another domain in the protein (upper left) is responsible for “recog- nition” of the tRNA anticodon. 248 Molecular genetics Pro Val Glu 5' 3' 5' CA CCU C Glu C C T G GGA G GGA C A C C T C TCCT G A G G A G GGA C T C C T C C C U G U GGA GCU G A G G A G 5' 3' 5' Val Pro Glu Glu CG A C TG A G C T A C T G C T A G AC T Phe Pro Val Glu Gln Leu Ser Tyr Stop Stop Cys Trp Leu His ArgIle Thr Asn Lys Ser Ala Asp Gly Arg Met T C A G T C AG T C A G T C A G T C A G T C A G TC A G T C A G T C A G T C A G T C A GTCAGTCAGTC A G T C A G T C A G AC T His= 1 2 PP ATP AMP tRNA RC C O OH3N H P P OCH2 O Ade HH HO OH HH P 5' 3' 2' PO CH2 O Ade HH HO OH HH 5' 3' 1' 2' CC O R H3N H O HO OH H AdeCH2OP O OH HH 1' 5' 3' 2' 4' O H Cyt HH H 1' 3' 2' 4' O OOH H AdeCH2OP O O OH H Cyt HH HH H 1' 1' 5' 3' 2' 3' 2' 4' 4' CC O R H3N H Normal globin gene (β-chain) Sickle-cell globin gene (β-chain) mRNA Val- tRNA Glu- tRNA C.

Start 249Genetic code Translation I: initiation Like amino acid activation (see p. 248), pro- tein biosynthesis (translation) takes place in the cytoplasm. It is catalyzed by complex nucleoprotein particles, the ribosomes,and mainly requires GTP to cover its energy re- quirements. A. Structure of the eukaryotic ribosome \u0002 Ribosomes consist of two subunits of different size, made up of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and nearly 80 proteins (the number of proteins applies to rat liver ribosomes). It is customary to give the sedimentation coef cients (see p. 200) of ribosomes and their components instead of theirmasses. Forexample,the eu- karyotic ribosome has a sedimentation coef- ficient of 80 Svedberg units (80 S), while the sedimentation coef cients of its subunits are 40 S and 60 S (S values are not additive). The smaller 40 S subunit consists of one molecule of 18 S rRNA and 33 protein mole- cules. The larger 60 S subunit contains three types of rRNA with sedimentation coef cients of 5S, 5.8 S, and 28S and 47 proteins. In the presence of mRNA, the subunits assemble to form the complete ribosome, with a mass about 650 times larger than that of a hemo- globin molecule. The arrangement of the individual compo- nents of a ribosome has now been deter- mined for prokaryotic ribosomes. It is known that filamentous mRNA passes through a cleft between the two subunits near the charac- teristic “horn” on the small subunit. tRNAs also bind near this site. The illustration shows thesizeof a tRNA molecule forcomparison. Prokaryotic ribosomes have a similar struc- ture, but are somewhat smaller than those of eukaryotes (sedimentation coef cient 70 S for the complete ribosome, 30 S and 50 S for the subunits). Mitochondrial and chloroplast ribosomes are comparable to prokaryotic ones. B. Polysomes \u0002 In cells that are carrying out intensive protein synthesis, ribosomes are often found in a lin- ear arrangement like a string of pearls; these are known as polysomes. This arrangement arises because several ribosomes are translat- ing a single mRNA molecule simultaneously. The ribosome first binds near the start codon (AUG; see p. 248) at the 5\u0001 end of the mRNA (top). During translation, the ribosome moves in the direction of the 3\u0001 end until it reaches a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA). At this point, the newly synthesized chain is released, and the ribosome dissociates again into its two subunits. C. Initiation of translation in E. coli \u0002 Protein synthesis in prokaryotes is in princi- ple the same as in eukaryotes. However, as the process is simpler and has been better studied in prokaryotes, the details involved in trans- lation are discussed here and on p. 252 using the example of the bacterium Escherichia coli. Thefirst phaseoftranslation, initiation,in- volves several steps. First, two proteins, ini- tiation factors IF–1 and IF–3, bind to the 30 S subunit (1). Another factor, IF–2, binds as a complex with GTP (2). This allows the subunit to associate with the mRNA and makes it possible for a special tRNA to bind to the start codon (3). In prokaryotes, this starter tRNA carries the substituted amino acid N- formylmethionine (fMet). In eukaryotes, it car- ries an unsubstituted methionine. Finally, the 50 S subunit binds to the above complex (4). During steps 3 and 4, the initiation factors are released again, and the GTP bound to IF–2 is hydrolyzed to GDP and Pi. In the 70 S initiation complex,formylme- thionine tRNA is initially located at a binding site known as the peptidyl site (P).A second binding site, the acceptor site (A),is not yet occupied during this phase of translation. Sometimes, a third tRNA binding site is de- fined as an exit site (E), from which uncharged tRNAs leave the ribosome again (see p. 252; not shown). 250 Molecular genetics N25 nm 3'60S 40S N N N C IF-2 GTP f-Met IF-1 2 1 3CAGGAAAGAGCUAUGUCCU P mRNA IF-3 tRNA- IF-3 IF-1 IF-3 IF-1IF-2PA GTP f-MetUAC IF-1 IF-2 GDP 4 5 IF-3 IF-1 IF-2 GTP f-Met A.

A. Elongation and termination of protein biosynthesis in E. coli \u0002 Elongation can be divided into four phases: [1] Binding of aminoacyl tRNA. First, the peptidyl site (P) of the ribosome is occupied by a tRNA that carries at its 3\u0001 end the com- plete peptide chain formed up to this point (top left). A second tRNA, loaded with the next amino acid (Val–tRNA Val in the example shown), then binds via its complementary anticodon (see p. 82) to the mRNA codon ex- posed at the acceptor site (in this case GUG). The tRNA binds as acomplex with aGTP- containing protein, the elongation factor Tu (EF–Tu) (1a). It is only after the bound GTP has been hydrolyzed to GDP and phosphate that EF–Tu dissociates again (1b). As the bind- ing of the tRNA to the mRNA is still loose before this, GTP hydrolysis acts as a delaying factor,makingit possible to check whether the correct tRNA has been bound. A further protein, the elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts), later catalyzesthe exchange of GDPfor GTPand in this way regenerates the EF–Tu GTP com- plex. EF-Tu is related to the G proteins in- volved in signal transduction (see p. 384). [2] Synthesis of the peptide bond takes place in the next step. Ribosomal peptidyl- transferase catalyzes (without consumption of ATP or GTP) the transfer of the peptide chain from the tRNA at the P site to the NH2 group of the amino acid residue of the tRNA at the A site. The ribosome’s peptidyltransferase activity is not located in one of the ribosomal proteins, but in the 28 S rRNA. Catalytically active RNAs of this type are known as ribo- zymes (cf. p. 246). It is thought that the few surviving ribozymes are remnants of the “RNA world”—an early phase of evolution in which proteins were not as important as they are today. [3] After the transfer of the growing pep- tide to the A site, the free tRNA at the P site dissociates and another GTP–containing elon- gation factor (EF-G GTP) binds to the ribo- some. Hydrolysis of the GTP in this factor provides the energy for translocation of the ribosome. During this process, the ribosome moves three bases along the mRNA in the direction of the 3\u0001 end. The tRNA carrying the peptide chain is stationary relative to the mRNA and reaches the ribosome’s P site during translocation, while the next mRNA codon (in this case GUG) appears at the A site. [4] The uncharged Val-tRNA then dissoci- ates from the E site. The ribosome is now ready for the next elongation cycle. When oneofthe threestop codons (UAA, UAG, or UGA) appears at the A site, termi- nation starts. [5] There are no complementary tRNAs for the stop codons. Instead, two releasing factors bind to the ribosome. One of these factors (RF–1) catalyzes hydrolytic cleavage of the ester bond between the tRNA and the C–ter- minus of the peptide chain, thereby releasing the protein. [6] Hydrolysis of GTP by factor RF–3 sup- plies the energy for the dissociation of the whole complex into its component parts. Energy requirements in protein synthesis are high. Four energy-rich phosphoric acid anhydride bonds are hydrolyzed for each amino acid residue. Amino acid activation uses up two energy-rich bonds per amino acid (ATP \u0001 AMP + PP; see p. 248), and two GTPs are consumed per elongation cycle. In addition, initiation and termination each re- quire one GTP per chain. Further information In eukaryotic cells, the number of initiation factors is larger and initiation is therefore more complex than in prokaryotes. The cap at the 5\u0001 end of mRNA and the polyA tail (see p. 246) play important parts in initiation. However, the elongation and termination processes are similar in all organisms. The individual steps of bacterial translation can be inhibited by antibiotics (see p. 254). 252 Molecular genetics COO 3' 5' 5' 3' 3' PPAPAPACCUGUG EF-G GTP EF-G GDPPAGUG EF-Tu GDP PPAGUGUAG 6 RF-3 GTPPA RF-3 GDP P RF-1 RF-1 Val Pro ProProCCUGUGCCUGUGCCU NH3 NH3 ValPro NH3 ValPro NH3 EF-Tu GTP Val 4 1a 1b 2 5 NH3 NH3 Val ValPro 5' 3' GDP EF-Ts EF-Ts GTP 1 3 5' 50S subunit mRNA 30S subunitTermination factors Stop codon If stop codon in A site Valine codon Peptidyl transferase 2.3.2.12 Elongation A. Elongation and termination of protein biosynthesis in E. coli Val-tRNA tRNA tRNA Protein Termination 253Protein biosynthesis Antibiotics A. Antibiotics: overview \u0002 Antibiotics are substances which, even at low concentrations, inhibit the growth and repro- duction of bacteria and fungi. The treatment of infectious diseases would be inconceivable today without antibiotics. Substances that only restrict the reproduction of bacteria are described as having bacteriostatic effects (or fungistatic for fungi). If the target cells are killed, then the term bactericidal (or fungici- dal) is used. Almost all antibiotics are pro- duced by microorganisms—mainly bacteria of the genus Streptomyces and certain fungi. However, there are also synthetic antibacte- rial substances, such as sulfonamides and gy- rase inhibitors. A constantly increasing problem in antibi- otic treatment is the development of resistant pathogens that no longer respond to the drugs available. The illustration shows a few of the therapeutically important antibiotics and their sites of action in the bacterial me- tabolism. Substances known as intercalators,suchas rifamycin and actinomycin D (bottom) are de- positedin the DNA double helix andthereby interfere with replication and transcription (B). As DNA is the same in all cells, intercalat- ing antibiotics are also toxic for eukaryotes, however. They are therefore only used as cy- tostatic agents (see p. 402). Synthetic inhib- itors of DNA topoisomerase II (see p. 240), known as gyrase inhibitors (center), restrict replication and thus bacterial reproduction. A large group of antibiotics attack bacterial ribosomes. These inhibitors of translation (left) include the tetracyclines—broad-spec- trum antibiotics that are effective against a large number of different pathogens. The ami- noglycosides,ofwhich streptomycin is the best-known, affect all phases of translation. Erythromycin impairs the normal functioning of the large ribosomal subunit. Chlorampheni- col, one of the few natural nitro compounds, inhibits ribosomal peptidyltransferase. Fi- nally, puromycin mimics an aminoacyl tRNA and therefore leads to premature interruption of elongation. The –lactam antibiotics (bottom right) are also frequently used. The members of this group, the penicillins and cephalosporins, are synthesizedbyfungi andhavea reactive β- lactam ring. They are mainly used against Gram-positive pathogens, in which they in- hibit cell wall synthesis (C). The first synthetic antibiotics were the sulfonamides (right). As analogues of p–ami- nobenzoic acid, these affect the synthesis of folic acid, an essential precursor of the coen- zyme THF (see p. 108). Transport antibiotics (top center) have the properties of ion chan- nels (see p. 222). When they are deposited in the plasma membrane, it leads to a loss of ions that damages the bacterial cells. B. Intercalators \u0003 The effects of intercalators (see also p. 262) areillustrated hereusing theexample of the daunomycin–DNA complex,in which two daunomycin molecules (red) are inserted in the double helix (blue). The antibiotic’s ring system inserts itself between G/C base pairs (bottom), while the sugar moiety occupies the minor groove in the DNA (above). This leads to a localized change of the DNA conforma- tion that prevents replication and transcrip- tion. C. Penicillin as a “suicide substrate” \u0003 Thesiteofaction inthe β–lactam antibiotics is muramoylpentapeptide carboxypeptidase, an enzyme that is essential for cross–linking of bacterial cell walls. The antibiotic resembles the substrate of this enzyme (a peptide with the C-terminal sequence D-Ala–D–Ala) and is therefore reversibly bound in the active cen- ter. This brings the β–lactam ring into prox- imity with an essential serine residue of the enzyme. Nucleophilic substitution then re- sults in the formation of a stable covalent bond between the enzyme and the inhibitor, blocking theactivecenter (seep. 96).In divid- ing bacteria, the loss of activity of the enzyme leads to the formation of unstable cell walls and eventually death. 254 Molecular genetics 6 5 4 3 2 1 R' R'' HO O OH O C NH2 O OH OH H NCH3HO H3CCH3 SH2NNH O O N S NO2 HO N H C CHCl2 O OH H H C C H N CN S NH3 H O O CH3 CH3 H COO H3CO O OH OOH C CH3 O HO OH O HO H HH CH3 H H H3N H CN S O CH3 CH3 H COO R HO C HN S CH3 CH3 H COO R O O A.

Changes in the DNA bases or their sequence therefore have mutagenic effects. Mutagens often also damage growth regulation in cells, and they are then also carcinogenic (see p. 400). Gene alterations (mutations)are one of the decisive positive factors in biological evolution. On the other hand, an excessive mutation frequency would threaten the survival of individual organisms or entire species. For this reason, every cell has repair mechanisms that eliminate most of the DNA changes arising from mutations (C). A. Mutagenic agents \u0002 Mutations can arise as a result of physical or chemical effects, or they can be due to acci- dental errors in DNA replication and recombi- nation. The principal physical mutagen is ionizing radiation (α, β,and γ radiation, X-rays). In cells, it produces free radicals (molecules with unpaired electrons), which are ex- tremely reactive and can damage DNA. Short-wavelength ultraviolet light (UV light) also has mutagenic effects, mainly in skin cells (sunburn). The most common chemical change due to UV exposure is the formation of thymine dimers, in which two neighboring thymine bases become covalently linked to one another (2). This results in errors when the DNA is readduringreplication andtranscription. Only a few examples of the group of chem- ical mutagens are shown here. Nitrous acid (HNO2;salt: nitrite) and hydroxylamine (NH2OH) both deaminate bases; they convert cytosine to uracil and adenine to inosine. Alkylating compounds carry reactive groups that can form covalent bonds with DNA bases (see also p. 402). Methylnitro- samines (3) release the reactive methyl cation (CH3+), which methylates OH and NH2 groups in DNA. The dangerous carcinogen benzo [a]pyrene is an aromatic hydrocarbon that is only converted into the active form in the organism (4;see p. 316). Multiplehydroxyla- tion of one of the rings produces a reactive epoxide that can react with NH2 groups in guanine residues, for example. Free radicals of benzo[a ]pyrene also contribute to its tox- icity. B. Effects \u0002 Nitrous acid causes point mutations (1). For example, C is converted to U, which in the next replication pairs with A instead of G. The alteration thus becomes permanent. Mu- tations in which a number of nucleotides not divisible by three are inserted or removed lead to reading errors in whole segments of DNA, as they move the reading frame (frame- shift mutations). This is shown in Fig. 2 using a simple example. From the inserted C on- wards, the resulting mRNA is interpreted dif- ferently during translation, producing a com- pletely new protein sequence. C. Repair mechanisms \u0003 An important mechanism for the removal of DNA damage is excision repair (1). In this process, a specific excision endonuclease re- moves a complete segment of DNA on both sides of the error site. Using the sequence of the opposite strand, the missing segment is then replaced by a DNA polymerase. Finally, a DNA ligase closes the gaps again. Thymine dimers can be removed by photoreactivation (2). A specific photolyase binds at the defect and, when illuminated, cleaves the dimertoyield twosingle bases again. A third mechanism is recombination repair (3, shown in simplified form). In this process, the defect is omitted during replication. The gap is closed by shifting the corresponding sequence from the correctly replicated second strand. The new gap that results is then filled by polymerases and ligases. Finally, the orig- inal defect is corrected by excision repair as in Fig. 1 (not shown). 256 Molecular genetics 1. 2. Thymine dimer α, β, γ X [CH3 ] O 3. 4.

Effects 257Mutation and repair DNA cloning The growth of molecular genetics since 1970 has mainly been based on the development and refinement of methods of analyzing and manipulating DNA. Genetic engineering has practical applications in many fields. For ex- ample, it hasprovided new methodsof diag- nosing and treating diseases, and it is now also possible to create targeted changes in specific characteristics of organisms. Since bi- ological risks cannot be completely ruled out with these procedures, it is particularly im- portant to act responsibly when dealing with genetic engineering. A short overview of im- portant methods involved in genetic engi- neering is provided here and on the following pages. A. Restriction endonucleases \u0002 In many genetic engineering procedures, de- fined DNA fragments have to be isolated and then newly combined with other DNA seg- ments. For this purpose, enzymes are used that can cut DNA and join it together again inside the cell. Of particular importance are restriction endonucleases—a group of bacterial enzymes that cleavethe DNA doublestrandin a sequence–specific way. The numerous re- strictionenzymes knownare named using abbreviations based on the organism from which they originate. The example used here is EcoRI, a nuclease isolated from the bacterium Escherichia coli. Like many other restriction endonucleases, EcoRI cleaves DNA at thesiteofa palin- drome—i. e., a short segment of DNA in which both the strand and counter-strand have the same sequence (each read in the 5\u0001\u00013\u0001 direc- tion). In this case, the sequence is 5\u0001-GAATTC- 3\u0001. EcoRI, a homodimer, cleaves the phos- phoric acid diester bonds in both strands be- tween G and A. This results in the formation of complementary overhanging or “sticky” ends (AATT), which are held together by base pair- ing. However, they are easily separated—e. g. by heating. When the fragments are cooled, the overhanging ends hybridize again in the correct arrangement. The cleavage sites can then be sealed again by a DNA ligase. B. DNA cloning \u0003 Most DNA segments—e. g., genes—occur in very small quantities in the cell. To be able to work with them experimentally, a large number of identical copies (“clones”)first have to be produced. The classic procedure for cloning DNA takes advantage of the ability of bacteria to take up and replicate short, circular DNA fragments known as plasmids. The segment to be cloned is first cut out of the original DNA using restriction endonu- cleases (see above; for the sake of simplicity, cleavage using EcoRI alone is shown here, but in practice two different enzymes are usually used). As a vehicle (“vector”), a plasmid is needed that has only one EcoRI cleavage site. The plasmid rings are first opened by cleavage with EcoRI and then mixed with the isolated DNA fragments. Since the fragment and the vector have the same overhanging ends, some of the molecules will hybridize in such a way that the fragment is incorporated into the vector DNA. When thecleavagesites are now closed again using DNA ligase, anewly combined (“recombinant”) plasmid arises. By pretreating a large number of host cells, onecan cause someofthem to takeupthe plasmid (a process known as transformation) and replicate it along with their own genome when reproducing. To ensure that only host bacteria that contain the plasmid replicate, plasmids are used that give the host resistance to a particular antibiotic. When the bacteria are incubated in the presence of this antibi- otic, only the cells containing the plasmid will replicate. The plasmid is then isolated from these cells, cleaved with EcoRI again, and the fragments are separated using agarose gel electrophoresis (see p. 262). The desired frag- ment can be identified using its size and then extracted from the gel and used for further experiments. 258 Molecular genetics HH OH HH POO O H2C O H H 3' 5' 3' POO O H2C O H 5' 3' O OH H HH H 3' 5' 3' 3' 5' G AT C G AT CT T A A G AT C G AT CT T A A G AT C G AT CT T A A 3' 5' 3' 5' 5' 3' 5' 3' 3.1.21.4 6.5.1.1 GCTTAA G CTTAA CGAATTCGAATT C T T A A G G A AT T C G A G A Overhanging ends A.

Gene libraries \u0003 It is often necessary in genetic engineering to isolate a DNA segment when its details are not fully known—e. g., in order to determine its nucleotide sequence. In this case, one can use what are known as DNA libraries.A DNAli- brary consists of a large number of vector DNA molecules containing different fragments of foreign DNA. For example, it is possible to take all of the mRNA molecules present in a cell and transcribe them into DNA. These DNA frag- ments(known ascopyDNA or cDNA)are then randomly introduced into vector molecules. Alibrary of genomic DNA canbe estab- lished by cleaving the total DNA from a cell into small fragments using restriction endo- nucleases (see p. 258), and then incorporating these into vector DNA. Suitable vectors for gene libraries include bacteriophages,for ex- ample (“phages” for short). Phages are viruses that only infect bacteria and are replicated by them (see p. 404). Gene libraries have the advantage that they can be searched for spe- cific DNA segments, using hybridization with oligonucleotides. The first step is to strongly dilute a small part of the library (105–106 phages in a small volume), mix it with host bacteria, and plate out the mixture onto nutrient medium. The bacteria grow and form a continuous cloudy layer of cells. Bacteria infected by phages grow more slowly. In their surroundings, the bacterial “lawn” is less dense, and a clearer circular zone known as a plaque forms. The bacteria in this type of plaque exclusively contain the offspring of a single phage from the library. The next step is to make an impression of the plate on a plastic foil, which is then heated. This causes the phage DNA to adhere to the foil. When the foil is incubated with a DNA fragment that hybridizes to the DNA seg- ment of interest (a gene probe), the probe binds to the sites on the imprint at which the desired DNA is attached. Binding of the gene probe can be detected by prior radio- active or other labeling of the probe. Phages from the positive plaques in the original plate are then isolated and replicated. Restriction cleavage finally provides large amounts of the desired DNA. B. Sequencing of DNA \u0003 Thenucleotidesequenceof DNA is nowadays usually determined using the so-called chain termination method.In single-strand se- quencing, the DNA fragment (a)is cloned into the DNA of phage M13 (see p. 404), from which the coded single strand can be easily isolated. This is hybridized with a pri- mer—a short, synthetically produced DNA fragment that binds to 3\u0001 end of the intro- duced DNA segment (b). Based on this hybrid, the missing second strand can now be generated in the test tube by adding the four deoxyribonucleoside tri- phosphates (dNTP)and a suitable DNA poly- merase (c). The trick lies in also adding small amounts of dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTP). Incorporating a ddNTP leads to the termination of second-strand synthesis. This can occur whenever the corresponding dNTP oughtto beincorporated. Theillustration shows this in detail using the example of ddGTP. In this case, fragments are obtained that each include the primer plus three, six, eight, 13, or 14 additional nucleotides. Four separate reactions, each with a different ddNTP, are carried out (c), and the products areplaced sideby sideon a supporting mate- rial. The fragments are then separated by gel electrophoresis (see p. 76), in which they move in relation to their length. Following visualization (d), thesequenceof the fragments in the individual lanes is simply read frombottomto top (e)to directly obtain thenucleotidesequence. A detailfrom sucha sequencing gel and the corresponding protein sequence are shown in Fig. 2. In a more modern procedure, the four ddNTPs are covalently marked with fluores- cent dyes, which produce a different color for each ddNTP on laser illumination. This allows the sequence in which the individual frag- ments appear at the lower end of the gel to be continuously recorded and directly stored in digital form. 260 Molecular genetics 5' 3' 3' 5' + 4 dNTP + 4 dNTP + 4 dNTP + 4 dNTP G = ddG C T T Phe C A T Tyr T C G Ala T C A Thr A A G Glu A A G Glu G T A Met 5' 3' + ddGTP + ddATP + ddTTP + ddCTP GA T C GA T C GA T C a b c d e f N5' 3' N A.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) \u0002 Thepolymerasechain reaction (PCR)is an important procedure in genetic engineering that allows any DNA segment to be replicated (amplified) without the need for restriction enzymes, vectors, or host cells (see p. 258). However, thenucleotidesequenceof the seg- ment has to be known. Two oligonucleotides (primers) are needed, which each hybridize with one of the strands at each end of the DNA segment to be amplified; also needed are suf- ficient quantities of the four deoxyribonucleo- side triphosphates and a special heat-tolerant DNA polymerase. The primers are produced by chemical synthesis, and the polymerase is obtained from thermostable bacteria. First, the starter is heated to around 90 °C to separate the DNA double helix into single strands (a; cf. p. 84). The mixture is then cooled to allow hybridization of the primers (b). Starting from the primers, complemen- tary DNA strands are now synthesized in both directions by the polymerase (c). This cycle (cycle 1) is repeated 20–30 times with thesamereaction mixture (cycle 2 and sub- sequent cycles). The cyclic heating and cool- ing are carried out by computer-controlled thermostats. After only the third cycle, double strands start to form with a length equal to the dis- tance between the two primers. The propor- tion of these approximately doubles during each cycle, until almost all of the newly syn- thesized segments have the correct length. B. DNA electrophoresis \u0003 The separation of DNA fragments by electro- phoresis is technically simpler than protein electrophoresis (see p. 78). The mobility of molecules in an electrical field of a given strength depends on the size and shape of the molecules, as well as their charge. In con- trast to proteins, in which all three factors vary, the ratio of mass to charge in nucleic acids is constant, as all of the nucleotide com- ponents have similar masses and carry one negative charge. When electrophoresis is car- ried out in a wide-meshed support material that does not separate according to size and shape, the mobility of the molecules depends on their mass alone. The supporting material generally used in genetic engineering is a gel of the polysaccharide agarose (see p. 40). Agarosegelsare notverystableand arethere- fore poured horizontally into a plastic cham- ber in which they are used for separation (top). To make the separated fragments visible, after running the procedure the gels are placed in solutions of ethidium bromide. This is an intercalator (see p. 254) that shows strong fluorescence in UV light after binding to DNA, although it barely fluoresces in an aqueous solution. The result of separating two PCR amplificates (lanes 1 and 2) is shown in the lower part of the illustration. Compar- ing their distances with those of poly- nucleotides of known lengths (lane 3; bp = base pairs) yields lengths of approximately 800 bp for fragment 1 and 1800 bp for frag- ment 2. After staining, the bands can be cut outof the geland theDNA canbeextracted from them and used for further experiments. C. Overexpression of proteins \u0002 To treat some diseases, proteins are needed that occur in such small quantities in the or- ganism that isolating them on a large scale would not be economically feasible. Proteins of this type can be obtained by overexpression in bacteria or eukaryotic cells. To do this, the corresponding gene is isolated from human DNA and cloned into an expression plasmid as described on p. 258. In addition to the gene itself, the plasmid also has to contain DNA segments that allow replication by the host cell and transcription of the gene. After trans- formation and replication of suitable host cells, induction is used in a targeted fashion to trigger ef cient transcription of the gene. Translation of the mRNA formed in the host cell then gives rise to large amounts of the desired protein. Human insulin (see p. 76), plasminogen activators for dissolving blood clots (see p. 292), and the growth hormone somatotropin are among the proteins pro- duced in this way. 262 Molecular genetics 2 1 3 a b c cba cbaInduction 12 3 bp b a 1857 1058 929 383 N H3C NH2 Br Sample C.

New genetic approaches to the treatment of severe dis- eases are still in the developmental stage (“gene therapy,” D). A. DNA fingerprinting \u0003 DNA fingerprinting is used to link small amounts of biological material—e. g., traces from thesiteof a crime—to a specificperson. Theprocedure now usedis based on thefact that the human genome contains non-coding repetitive DNA sequences, the length of which varies from individual to individual. Short tandem repeats (STRs) thus exist in which dinucleotides (e. g., -T-X-) are frequently re- peated. EachSTR canoccur infive to15 differ- ent lengths (alleles), of which one individual possesses only one or two. When the various allele combinations for several STRs are de- termined after PCR amplification of the DNA being investigated, a “genetic fingerprint” of the individual from whom the DNA originates is obtained. Using comparative material—e. g., saliva samples—definite identification is then possible. B. Diagnosis of sickle-cell anemia using RFLP \u0003 This example illustrates a procedure for diag- nosing a point mutation in the β-globin gene that leads to sickle-cell anemia (see p. 248). The mutationinthe first exonofthe gene destroys a cleavage site for the restriction endonuclease MstII (see p. 258). When the DNA of healthy and diseased individuals is cleaved with MstII, different fragments are produced in the region of the β-globin gene, which can be separated by electrophoresis and then demonstrated using specific probes (see p. 260). In addition, heterozygotic car- riers of the sickle-cell gene can be distin- guished from homozygotic ones. C. Identification of viral DNA using RT-PCR \u0003 In viral infections, it is often dif cult to deter- mine the species of the pathogen precisely. RT-PCR can be used to identify RNA viruses. In this procedure, reverse transcriptase (see p. 404) is used to transcribe the viral RNA into dsDNA, and then PCR is employed to amplify a segment of this DNA with virus- specific primers. In this way, an amplificate with a characteristic length can be obtained for each pathogen and identified using gel electrophoresis as described above. D. Gene therapy \u0002 Many diseases, such as hereditary metabolic defects and tumors, can still not be ad- equately treated. About 10 years ago, projects were therefore initiated that aimed to treat diseases of this type by transferring genes into the affected cells (gene therapy). The illustration combines conceivable and already implemented approaches to gene therapy for metabolic defects (left) and tumors (right). None of these procedures has yet become established in clinical practice. If a mutation leads to failure of an enzyme E1 (left), its substrate B will no longer be converted into C and will accumulate. This can lead to cell damage by B itself or by a toxic product formed from it. Treatment with intact E1 is not possible, as the proteins arenot capableof passing through the cell membrane. By contrast, it is in principle pos- sible to introduce foreign genes into the cell using viruses as vectors (adenoviruses or ret- roviruses are mainly used). Their gene prod- ucts could replace the defective E1 or convert B into a harmless product. Another approach uses the so-called antisense DNA (bottom right). This consists of polynucleotides that hybridize with the mRNA for specific cellular proteins and thereby prevent their transla- tion. In the case shown, the synthesis of E2 could be blocked, for example. The main problem in chemotherapy for tumors is the lack of tumor-specificity in the highly toxic cytostatic agents used (see p. 402). Attempts are therefore being made to introduce into tumor cells genes with prod- ucts that are only released from a precursor to form active cytostatics once they have reached their target (left). Other gene prod- ucts are meant to force the cells into apoptosis (see p. 396) or make them more susceptible to attack by the immune system. To steer the viral vectors to the tumor (targeting), at- tempts are being made to express proteins on the virus surface that are bound by tu- mor-specific receptors. Fusion with a tumor- specific promoter could also help limit the effect of the foreign gene to the tumor cells. 264 Molecular genetics B.

It is only after they have beenbrokendowninto smaller molecules that the organism can take up the essential nutrients. Digestion re- fers to the mechanical and enzymatic break- down of food and the resorption of the result- ing products. A. Hydrolysis and resorption of food components \u0001 Following mechanical fragmentation of food during chewing in the mouth, the process of enzymatic degradation starts in the stomach. For this purpose, the chyme is mixed with digestive enzymes that occur in the various digestive secretions or in membrane-bound form on the surface of the intestinal epithe- lium (see p. 268). Almost all digestive en- zymes are hydrolases (class 3 enzymes; see p. 88); they catalyze the cleavage of compo- site bonds with the uptake of water. Proteins are first denatured by the stomach’s hydrochloric acid (see p. 270), mak- ing them more susceptible to attack by the endopeptidases (proteinases) present in gas- tric and pancreatic juice. The peptides re- leased by endopeptidases are further de- graded into amino acids by exopeptidases.Fi- nally, the amino acids are resorbed by the intestinal mucosa in cotransport with Na + ions (see p. 220). There are separate transport systems for each of the various groups of amino acids. Carbohydrates mainly occur in food in the form of polymers (starches and glycogen). They are cleaved by pancreatic amylase into oligosaccharides and are then hydrolyzed by glycosidases, whichare located onthe surface of the intestinal epithelium, to yield mono- saccharides. Glucose and galactose are taken up into the enterocytes by secondary active cotransport with Na + ions (see p. 220). In ad- dition, monosaccharides also have passive transport systems in the intestine. Nucleic acids are brokendownintotheir components by nucleases from the pancreas and small intestine (ribonucleases and deoxy- ribonucleases). Further breakdown yields the nucleobases (purine and pyrimidine deriva- tives), pentoses (ribose and deoxyribose), phosphate, and nucleosides (nucleobase pen- tose). These cleavage products are resorbed by the intestinal wall in the region of the jejunum. Lipids are a special problem for digestion, as they are not soluble in water. Before enzy- maticbreakdown, they haveto beemulsified by bile salts and phospholipids in the bile (see p. 314). At the water–lipid interface, pancre- atic lipase then attacks triacylglycerols with the help of colipase (see p. 270). The cleavage products include fatty acids, 2–monoacylgly- cerols, glycerol, and phosphate from phospho- lipid breakdown. After resorption into the epithelial cells, fats are resynthesized from fatty acids, glycerol and 2–monoacylglycerols and passed into the lymphatic system (see p. 272). The lipids in milk are more easily digested, as they are already present in emul- sion; on cleavage, they mostly provide short- chain fatty acids. Inorganic components such as water, elec- trolytes, and vitamins are directly absorbed by the intestine. High-molecular-weight indigestible com- ponents, such as the fibrous components of plant cell walls, which mainly consist of cel- lulose and lignin, pass through the bowel un- changed and form the main component of feces, in addition to cells shed from the intes- tinal mucosa. Dietary fiber makes a positive contribution to digestion as a ballast material by binding water and promoting intestinal peristalsis. The food components resorbed by the epi- thelialcells of theintestinalwallinthe region of the jejunum and ileum are transported directly to the liver via the portal vein.Fats, cholesterol, and lipid–soluble vitamins are exceptions. These are first released by the enterocytes in the form of chylomicrons (see p. 278) into the lymph system, and only reach the blood via the thoracic duct. 266 Tissues and organs HCl A.

Digestive juices \u0002 Saliva. The salivary glands produce a slightly alkaline secretion which—in addition to water and salts—contains glycoproteins (mucins) as lubricants, antibodies, and enzymes. –Amylase attacks polysaccharides, and a li- pase hydrolyzes a small proportion of the neutral fats. α–Amylase and lysozyme, amu- rein-cleaving enzyme (see p. 40), probably serveto regulatethe oral bacterial flora rather than for digestion (see p. 340). Gastric juice. In the stomach, the chyme is mixed with gastric juice. Due to its hydro- chloric acid content, this secretion of the gas- tric mucosa is strongly acidic (pH 1–3; see p. 270). It also contains mucus (mainly glyco- proteins known as mucins), which protects the mucosa from the hydrochloric acid, salts, and pepsinogen—the proenzyme (“zymogen”) of the aspartate proteinase pepsin (see pp. 176, 270). In addition, the gastric mucosa secretes what is known as “intrinsic factor”—a glycoprotein needed for resorption of vitamin B12 ( “extrinsic factor”) in the bowel. In the stomach, pepsin and related en- zymes initiate the enzymatic digestion of pro- teins, which takes 1–3 hours. The acidic gas- tric contents are then released into the duo- denum in batches, where they are neutralized by alkaline pancreatic secretions and mixed with cystic bile. Pancreatic secretions. In the acinar cells, the pancreas forms a secretion that is alkaline due to its HCO3– content, the buffer capacity of which is suf cient to neutralize the stom- ach’s hydrochloric acid. The pancreatic secre- tion also contains many enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of high–molecular-weight food components. All of these enzymes are hydro- lases with pH optimums in the neutral or weakly alkaline range. Many of them are formed and secreted as proenzymes and are only activated in the bowel lumen (see p. 270). Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase are en- dopeptidases that belong to the group of ser- ine proteinases (see p. 176). Trypsin hydro- lyzesspecificpeptide bondson the Cside of the basic amino acids Arg and Lys, while chy- motrypsin prefers peptide bonds of the apolar amino acids Tyr, Trp, Phe, and Leu (see p. 94). Elastase mainly cleaves on the C side of the aliphatic amino acids Gly, Ala, Val, and Ile. Smaller peptides are attacked by carboxy- peptidases, which as exopeptidases cleave in- dividual amino acids from the C–terminal end of thepeptides (seep. 176). –Amylase, the most important endoglyco- sidase in the pancreas, catalyzes the hydroly- sis of α1\u00014 bonds in the polymeric carbohy- drates starch and glycogen. This releases mal- tose, maltotriose, and a mixture of other oli- gosaccharides. Various pancreatic enzymes hydrolyze lip- ids, including lipase with its auxiliary protein colipase (see p. 270), phospholipase A2,and sterol esterase. Bile salts activate the lipid- cleaving enzymes through micelle formation (see below). Several hydrolases—particularly ribo- nuclease (RNAse) and deoxyribonuclease (DNAse)—break down the nucleic acids con- tained in food. Bile. The liver forms a thin secretion (bile) that is stored in the gallbladder after water and salts have been extracted from it. From the gallbladder, it is released into the duode- num. The most important constituents of bile are water and inorganic salts, bile acids and bile salts (see p. 314), phospholipids, bile pig- ments, and cholesterol. Bile salts, together with phospholipids, emulsify insoluble food lipids and activate the lipases. Without bile, fats would be inadequately cleaved, if at all, resulting in “fatty stool” (steatorrhea). Re- sorption of fat-soluble vitamins would also be affected. Small-intestinal secretions. The glands of thesmall intestine(theLieberkühn and Brun- ner glands) secrete additional digestive en- zymes into the bowel. Together with enzymes on the microvilli of the intestinal epithelium (peptidases, glycosidases, etc.), these en- zymes ensurealmostcompletehydrolysis of the food components previously broken down by the endoenzymes. 268 Tissues and organs A.

The parietal cells produce hydrochloric acid, chief cells release pepsinogen, and acces- sory cells form a mucin-containing mucus. A. Formation of hydrochloric acid \u0002 The secretion of hydrochloric acid (H + and Cl –) by the parietal cells is an active process that uses up ATP and takes place against a concen- tration gradient (in the gastric lumen, with a pH of 1, the H + concentration is some 106 times higher than in the parietal cells, which have a pH of 7). The precursors of the exported H + ions are carbon dioxide (CO2)and water (H2O). CO2 diffuses from the blood into the parietal cells, and in a reaction catalyzed by carbonate de- hydratase (carbonic anhydrase [2]), it reacts with H2OtoformH + and hydrogen carbonate (HCO3–). The H + ions are transported into the gastric lumen in exchange for K + by a mem- brane-bound H+/K+-exchanging ATPase [1] (a transport ATPase of the P type; see p. 220). The remaining hydrogen carbonate is re- leased into the interstitium in electroneutral antiport in exchange for chloride ions (Cl –), andfrom thereinto the blood. TheCl – ions follow the secreted protons through a chan- nel into the gastric lumen. The hydrochloric acid in gastric juice is important for digestion. It activates pepsin- ogen to form pepsin (see below) and creates an optimal pH level for it to take effect. It also denatures food proteins so that they are more easily attacked by proteinases, and it kills micro-organisms. Regulation. HCl secretion is stimulated by the peptide hormone gastrin, the mediator histamine (see p. 380), and—via the neuro- transmitter acetylcholine—by the autonomous nervous system. The peptide somatostatin and certain prostaglandins (see p. 390) have inhibitory effects. Together with cholecysto- kinin, secretin, and other peptides, gastrin belongs to the group of gastrointestinal hor- mones (see p. 370). All of these are formed in the gastrointestinal tract and mainly act in the vicinity of thesitewhere they areformed— i. e.,they are paracrinehormones (seep. 372). While gastrin primarily enhances HCl secretion, cholecystokinin and secretin mainly stimulate pancreatic secretion and bile re- lease. B. Zymogen activation \u0002 To prevent self–digestion, the pancreas re- leases most proteolytic enzymes into the du- odenum in an inactive form as proenzymes (zymogens). Additional protection from the effects of premature activation of pancreatic proteinasesisprovidedby proteinase inhibi- tors in the pancreatic tissue, which inactivate active enzymes by complex formation (right). Trypsinogen plays a key role among the proenzymes released by the pancreas. In the bowel, it is proteolytically converted into ac- tive trypsin (see p. 176) by enteropeptidase,a membrane enzyme on the surface of the en- terocytes. Trypsin then autocatalytically acti- vates additional trypsinogen molecules and the other proenzymes (left). C. Fat digestion \u0002 Dueto the “hydrophobic effect” (seep. 28), water-insoluble neutral fats in the aqueous environment of the bowel lumen would ag- gregate into drops of fat in which most of the molecules would not be accessible to pancre- atic lipase. The amphipathic substances in bile (bile acids, bile salts, phospholipids) create an emulsion in which they occupy the surface of the droplets and thereby prevent them from coalescing into large drops. In addition, the bile salts, together with the auxiliary protein colipase, mediate binding of triacylglycerol lipase [1] to the emulsified fat droplets. Acti- vation of the lipase is triggered by a confor- mation change in the C-terminal domain of the enzyme, which uncovers the active center. During passage through the intestines, the active lipase breaks down the triacylglycerols in the interior of the droplets into free fatty acids and amphipathic monoacylglycerols. Over time, smaller micelles develop (see p. 28), in the envelope of which monoacylgly- cerols are present in addition to bile salts and phospholipids. Finally, the components of the micelles are resorbed by the enterocytes in ways that have not yet been explained. Monoacylglycerols and fatty acids are re- assembled into fats again (see p. 272), while the bile acids return to the liver (enterohe- patic circulation; see p. 314). 270 Tissues and organs H HCO3 CO2 H2O Cl CO2 K Cl HCO3 H K ≈ 0.1 mol · l-1 A PP P A PPP 2 Cl 21 1 1 1 H Cl 1 Anion exchanger A.

Resorption of the cleavage prod- ucts takes place primarily in the small intes- tine. Only ethanol and short–chain fatty acids are already resorbed to some extent in the stomach. The resorption process is facilitated by the large inner surface of the intestine, with its brush–border cells. Lipophilic molecules pen- etrate the plasma membrane of the mucosal cells by simple diffusion, whereas polar mol- ecules require transporters (facilitated diffu- sion; see p. 218). In many cases, carrier-medi- ated cotransport with Na + ions can be ob- served. In this case, the difference in the con- centration of the sodium ions (high in the intestinal lumen and low in the mucosal cells) drives the import of nutrients against a con- centration gradient (secondary active trans- port; see p. 220). Failure of carrier systems in the gastrointestinal tract can result in dis- eases. A. Monosaccharides \u0002 The cleavage of polymeric carbohydrates by –amylase [1] leads to oligosaccharides, which are broken down further by exoglyco- sidases (oligosaccharidases and disacchari- dases [2]) on the membrane surface of the brush border. The monosaccharides released in this way then pass with the help of various sugar–specific transporters into the cells of intestinal epithelium. Secondary active transport serves for the uptake of glucose and galactose, which are transported against a concentration gradient in cotransport with Na +.The Na + gradient is maintained on the basal side of the cells by Na +/K +-ATPase [3]. Another passive transporter then releases glucose and galactose into the blood. Fructose is taken up by a special type of trans- porter using facilitated diffusion. Amino acids (not illustrated) Protein degradation is initiated by proteina- ses—bypepsins in thestomach andbytrypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase in the small intes- tine. The resulting peptides are then further hydrolyzed by various peptidases into amino acids. Individual amino acid groups have group–specific amino acid transporters, some of which transport the amino acids into the enterocytes in cotransport with Na + ions (sec- ondary active transport), while others trans- port them in an Na +–independent manner through facilitated diffusion. Small peptides can also be taken up. B. Lipids \u0002 Fats and other lipids are poorly soluble in water. The larger the accessible surface is—i. e., the better the fat is emulsified—the easier it is for enzymes to hydrolyze it (see p. 270). Due to the special properties of milk, milk fats already reach the gastrointestinal tract in emulsified form. Digestion of them therefore already starts in the oral cavity and stomach, where lipases in the saliva and gastric juice are available. Lipids that are less accessible—e. g., from roast pork—are emulsi- fied in the small intestine by bile salts and bile phospholipids. Only then are they capable of being attacked by pancreatic lipase [4] (see p. 270). Fats (triacylglycerols) are mainly attacked by pancreatic lipase at positions 1 and 3 of the glycerol moiety. Cleavage of two fatty acid residues gives rise to fatty acids and 2-mono- acylglycerols, which are quantitatively the most important products. However, a certain amount of glycerol is also formed by complete hydrolysis. These cleavage products are re- sorbed by a non-ATP-dependent process that has not yet been explained in detail. In the mucosal cells, long-chain fatty acids are resynthesized by an ATP-dependent ligase [5] to form acyl-CoA and then triacylglycerols (fats; see p. 170). The fats are released into the lymph in the form of chylomicrons (see p. 278) and, bypassing the liver, are deposited in thethoracic duct—i. e., theblood system. Cholesterol also follows this route. By contrast, short-chain fatty acids (with chain lengthsof lessthan 12Catoms) pass directly into the blood and reach the liver via the portal vein. Resorbed glycerol can also take this path. 272 Tissues and organs 3x 2x 80% ATP ADP Pi 2 K 2 K 3 Na * 20% 3 * 3 4 4 4 5 4 PP P A PPP A P 5 Na Na 1 2 A S A S 1 2 Intestinal lumenTriacyl- glycerol Diacyl- glycerol 2-Mono- acyl- glycerol Fatty acids Glyco- lysis Thoracic duct Portal vein Fat synthesis Lymph Blood Poly- saccharides α-Amylase Oligo- saccharides Glucose transporter Liver Glucose Galactose Glucose Galactose Na glucose symporter Portal vein Fructose Other mono- saccharides Fructose Other mono- saccharides Glycerol Stimulated by bile salts, phospholipids, colipase and Ca2 Triacylglycerol lipase 3.1.1.3 Fatty acid-CoA ligase 6.2.1.3 Secondary-active transport Facilitated diffusion α-Amylase 3.2.1.1 Disaccharidases Oligosaccharidases Na /K -exchanging ATPase 3.6.1.37 Fat synthesis Short-chain fatty acids Resorption Liver A.

It consists of cells and cell frag- ments inanaqueous medium,the blood plasma. The proportion of cellular elements, known as hematocrit, in the total volume is approximately 45%. A. Functions of the blood \u0001 The blood is the most important transport medium in the body. It serves to keep the “internal milieu” constant (homeostasis) and it plays a decisive role in defending the body against pathogens. Transport. The gases oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported in the blood. The blood mediates theexchangeofsubstances between organs and takes up metabolic end products from tissues in order to transport them to the lungs, liver, and kidney for excre- tion. The blood also distributes hormones throughout the organism (see p. 370). Homeostasis. The blood ensures that a bal- anced distribution of water is maintained be- tween the vascular system, the cells (intra- cellular space), and the extracellular space. The acid–base balance is regulated by the blood in combination with the lungs, liver, and kidneys (see p. 288). The regulation of body temperature also depends on the con- trolled transport of heat by the blood. Defense. The body uses both non-specific and specific mechanisms to defend itself against pathogens. The defense system in- cludes the cells of the immune system and certain plasma proteins (see p. 294). Self-protection. To prevent blood loss when a vessel is injured, the blood has sys- tems for stanching blood flow and coagulat- ing the blood (hemostasis; see p. 290). The dissolution of blood clots (fibrinolysis) is also managed by the blood itself (see p. 292). B. Cellular elements \u0002 Thesolid elements in theblood arethe eryth- rocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white bloodcells), andthrombocytes(platelets). The erythrocytes provide for gas transport in the blood. They are discussed in greater detail on pp. 280–285. The leukocytes include various types of granulocyte, monocyte, and lymphocyte. All of these have immune defense functions (see p. 294). The neutrophil granulocytes¸ mono- cytes, and the macrophages derived from monocytes are phagocytes. They can ingest and degrade invading pathogens. The lympho- cytes are divided into two groups, B lympho- cytes and T lymphocytes. B lymphocytes produce antibodies, while T lymphocytes reg- ulate the immune response and destroy virus- infected cells and tumor cells. Eosinophilic and basophilic granulocytes have special tasks for defense against animal parasites. Thrombocytes are cell fragments that arise in thebonemarrow from large precursor cells, the megakaryocytes. Their task is to promote hemostasis (see p. 290). C. Blood plasma: composition \u0002 The blood plasma is an aqueous solution of electrolytes, nutrients, metabolites, proteins, vitamins,trace elements,and signalingsub- stances. The fluid phase of coagulated blood is known as blood serum.Itdiffers from the plasma in that it lacks fibrin and other coag- ulation proteins (see p. 290). Laboratory assessment of the composition of the blood plasma is often carried out in clinical chemistry. Among the electrolytes, there is a relatively high concentration of Na +,Ca 2+,and Cl – ions in the blood in compar- ison with the cytoplasm. By contrast, the con- centrations of K+,Mg 2+,and phosphate ions are higher in the cells. Proteins also have a higher intracellular concentration. The elec- trolyte composition of blood plasma is similar to that of seawater, due to the evolution of early forms of life in the sea. The solution known as “physiological saline” (NaCl at a con- centration of 0.15 mol L–1)is almostisotonic with blood plasma. A list of particularly important metabolites in the blood plasma is given on the right. 274 Tissues and organs 123456123456 Transport Homeostasis Defense Self defense Water balance Acid-base balance Blood gases: Hormones Nutrients Metabolites Metabolic wastes Extracellular space Body temperature Immune cells Antibodies Blood clotting and fibrinolysis A.

With concentrations of be- tween 60 and 80 g L –1,they constitute ap- proximately 4% of the body’s total protein. Their tasks include transport, regulation of the water balance, hemostasis, and defense against pathogens. A. Plasma proteins \u0002 Some 100 different proteins occur in human bloodplasma. Basedon their behavior during electrophoresis (see below), they are broadly divided into five fractions: albumins and α1–, α2–, β–and γ-globulins. Historically, the dis- tinction between the albumins and globulins was based on differences in the proteins’ solubility –albumins are soluble in pure water, whereas globulins only dissolve in thepresenceof salts. The most frequent protein in the plasma, at around 45 g L –1,is albumin. Due to its high concentration, it plays a crucial role in main- taining the blood’s colloid osmotic pressure and represents an important amino acid re- serve for the body. Albumin has binding sites forapolarsubstancesand thereforefunctions as a transport protein for long-chain fatty acids, bilirubin, drugs, and some steroid hor- mones and vitamins. In addition, serum albu- min binds Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ions. It is the only important plasma protein that is not glycosy- lated. The albumin fraction also includes trans- thyretin (prealbumin), which together with other proteins transports the hormone thy- roxine and its metabolites. The table also lists important globulins in blood plasma, with their mass and function. The α-and β-globulins are involved in the transport of lipids (lipoproteins; see p. 278), hormones, vitamins, and metal ions. In addi- tion, they provide coagulation factors, pro- tease inhibitors, and the proteins of the com- plement system (see p. 298). Soluble antibod- ies (immunoglobulins; see p. 300) make up the γ-globulin fraction. Synthesis and degradation. Most plasma proteins are synthesized by the liver. Excep- tions to this include the immunoglobulins, which are secreted by B lymphocytes known as plasma cells (see p. 302) and peptide hor- mones, which derive from endocrine gland cells. With the exception of albumin, almost all plasma proteins are glycoproteins. They carry oligosaccharides in N-and O-glycosidic bonds (see p. 44). N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid; see p. 38) often occurs as a terminal carbohydrate among sugar residues. Neuraminidases (sialidases) on the surface of the vascular endothelia gradually cleave the sialic acid residues and thereby release ga- lactoseunits on thesurfaces ofthe proteins. These asialoglycoproteins (“asialo-” = without sialic acid) are recognized and bound by gal- actose receptors on hepatocytes. In this way, the liver takes up aged plasma proteins by endocytosis and breaks them down. The oli- gosaccharides on the protein surfaces thus determine the half-life of plasma proteins, which is a period of days to weeks. In healthy individuals, the concentration of plasma proteins is constant. Diseases in or- gans that are involved in protein synthesis and breakdown can shift the protein pattern. For example, via cytokines (see p. 392), se- vere injuries trigger increased synthesis of acute-phase proteins, which include C-reac- tive protein, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, comple- ment factor C-3, and others. The concentra- tions of individual proteins are altered in some diseases (known as dysproteinemias). B. Carrier electrophoresis \u0002 Proteins and other electrically charged mac- romolecules can be separated using electro- phoresis (see also pp. 78, 262). Among the various procedures used, carrier electropho- resis on cellulose acetate foil (CAF) is partic- ularly simple. Using this method, serum pro- teins—which at slightly alkaline pH values all move towards the anode, due to their excess of negative charges—can be separated into the five fractions mentioned. After the pro- teins have been stained with dyes, the result- ing bands can be quantitatively assessed us- ing densitometry. 276 Tissues and organs DensitometryLight absorption Albumins α1- α2- β- γ-Globulins Electro- phoresis Staining Anode Cathode + – Serum sample Cellulose-acetate sheet Cellulose-acetate sheet soaked with buffer Buffer-saturated strip of filter paper 52-58% 2.4-4.4% 6.1-10.1% 10-21% 8.5-14.5% + – Mr in kDa FunctionGroup Protein IgG IgA IgM IgD IgE γ-Globulins: 150 162 900 172 196 Late antibodies Mucosa-protecting antibodies Early antibodies B-lymphocyte receptors Reagins Albumins: Transthyretin Albumin: 45 g · l-1 50-66 67 Transport of thyroxin and triiodothyronin Maintenance of osmotic pressure; transport of fatty acids, bilirubin, bile acids, steroid hor- mones, pharmaceuticals and inorganic ions.246810m 2.000-4.500 80 340 65 38 110 β-Globulins: Lipoprotein (LDL) Transferrin Fibrinogen Sex hormone- binding globulin Transcobalamin C-reactive protein Transport of lipids Transport of iron ions Coagulation factor I Transport of testosterone and estradiol Transport of vitamin B12 Complement activation Transport of copper ions Inhibition of blood clotting Binding of hemoglobin Cleavage of choline esters Precursor of plasmin (3.4.21.7), breakdown of blood clots Binding of proteases, transport of zinc ions Transport of vitamin A Transport of calciols α2-Globulins: Ceruloplasmin Antithrombin III Haptoglobin Cholinesterase (3.1.1.8) Plasminogen Macroglobulin Retinol-binding protein Vitamin D-binding protein 135 58 100 ca. 350 90 725 21 52 α1-Globulins: Antitrypsin Antichymotrypsin Lipoprotein (HDL) Prothrombin Transcortin Acid glycoprotein Thyroxin-binding globulin 51 58-68 200-400 72 51 44 54 Inhibition of trypsin and other proteases Inhibition of chymotrypsin Transport of lipids Coagulation factor II, thrombin precursor (3.4.21.5) Transport of cortisol, corticosterone and progesterone Transport of progesterone Transport of iodothyronins A. Plasma proteins B. Electrophoresis 277Blood Lipoproteins Most lipids are barely soluble in water, and many have amphipathic properties. In the blood, free triacylglycerols would coalesce into drops that could cause fat embolisms. By contrast, amphipathic lipids would be de- positedin the bloodcells’membranes and would dissolve them. Special precautions are therefore needed for lipid transport in the blood. While long-chain fatty acids are bound to albumin and short-chain ones are dissolved in the plasma (see p. 276), other lipids are transported in lipoprotein complexes,of which there several types in the blood plasma, with different sizes and composition. A. Composition of lipoprotein complexes \u0002 Lipoproteins are spherical or discoid aggre- gates of lipids and apoproteins.They consist of a nucleus of apolar lipids (triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters) surrounded by a sin- gle-layered shell approximately 2 nm thick of amphipathic lipids (phospholipids and cho- lesterol; the example shown here is LDL). The shell, in which the apoproteins are also deposited, gives the surfaces of the particles polar properties and thereby prevents them from aggregating into large particles. The larger the lipid nucleus of a lipoprotein is—i. e., the larger the number of apolar lipids it contains—the lower its density is. Lipoproteins are classified into five groups. In order of decreasing size and increasing density, these are: chylomicrons, VLDLs (very-low-density lipoproteins), IDLs (inter- mediate-density lipoproteins), LDLs (low- density lipoproteins), and HDLs (high-density lipoproteins). The proportions of apoproteins range from 1% in chylomicrons to over 50% in HDLs. These proteins serve less for solubility purposes, but rather function as recognition molecules for the membrane receptors and enzymes that are involved in lipid exchange. B. Transport functions The classes of lipoproteins differ not only in their composition, but also in the ways in which they originate and function. The chylomicrons take care of the transport of triacylglycerols from the intestine to the tissues. They are formed in the intestinal mu- cosa and reach the blood via the lymphatic system (see p. 266). In the peripheral vessel- s—particularly in muscle and adipose tis- sue—lipoprotein lipase [1] on the surface of the vascular endothelia hydrolyzes most of the triacylglycerols. Chylomicron breakdown is activated by the transfer of apoproteins E and C from HDL. While the fatty acids released and the glycerol are taken up by the cells, the chylomicrons gradually become converted into chylomicron remnants,which areulti- mately removed from the blood by the liver. VLDLs, IDLs,and LDLs are closely related to one another. VLDLs formed in the liver (see p. 312) transport triacylglycerols, cholesterol, and phospholipids to other tissues. Like chy- lomicrons, they are gradually converted into IDL and LDL under the influence of lipoprotein lipase [1]. This process is also stimulated by HDL. Cells that have a demand for cholesterol bind LDL through an interaction between their LDL receptor and ApoB-100, and then take up the complete particle through recep- tor-mediated endocytosis. This type of trans- port is mediated by depressions in the mem- brane (“coated pits”), the interior of which is lined with the protein clathrin. After LDL binding, clathrin promotes invagination of the pits and pinching off of vesicles (“coated vesicles”). The clathrin then dissociates off and is reused. After fusion of the vesicle with ly- sosomes, the LDL particles are broken down (see p. 234), and cholesterol and other lipids are used by the cells. The HDLs also originate in the liver. They return the excess cholesterol formed in the tissues to the liver. While it is being trans- ported, cholesterol is acylated by lecithin cho- lesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). The cholesterol esters formed are no longer amphipathic and can betransported in thecoreof the lipopro- teins. In addition, HDLs promote chylomicron and VLDL turnover by exchanging lipids and apoproteins with them (see above). 278 Tissues and organs * * ** 21 1 2 + + * * 1 Apo-B-100 Lipoprotein coat Lipoprotein core Composition Characteristic apoproteins Apoprotein Free cholesterol Phospholipid Cholesterol ester Triacylglycerols Lipoprotein Density (g · cm-3) Chylomicrons VLDL IDL LDL HDL 0.950 – 1.006 1.006 – 1.019 1.019 – 1.063 1.063 – 1.210 <0.95Chylomicron B.

To achieve this, the higher organisms require a special transport system, since O2 is poorly soluble in water. For exam- ple, only around 3.2 mL O2 is soluble in 1 L blood plasma. By contrast, the protein hemo- globin (Hb), contained in the erythrocytes, can bind a maximum of 220 mL O2 per liter—70 times the physically soluble amount. The Hb content of blood, at 140–180 g L –1 in men and 120–160 g L –1 in women, is twice as high as that of the plasma proteins (50–80 g L –1). Hb is therefore also responsi- ble for the majority of the blood proteins’ pH buffer capacity (see p. 288). A. Hemoglobin: structure \u0002 In adults, hemoglobin (HbA;see below) is a heterotetramer consisting of two α-chains and two β-chains, each with masses of 16 kDa. The α-and β-chains have different sequences, but are similarly folded. Some 80% of the amino acid residues form -helices, which are identified using the letters A–H. Each subunit carries a heme group (for- mula on p. 106), with a central bivalent iron ion.When O2 binds to the heme iron (Oxygenation of Hb) and when O2 is released (Deoxygenation), the oxidation stage of the iron does not change. Oxidation of Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ only occurs occasionally. The oxidized form, methemoglobin, is then no longer able to bind O2. The proportion of Met-Hb is kept low by reduction (see p. 284) and usually amounts to only 1–2%. Four of the six coordination sites of the iron in hemoglobin areoccupied by thenitrogen atoms of the pyrrol rings, and another is oc- cupied by a histidine residue of the globin (the proximal histidine). The iron’s sixth site is coordinated withoxygeninoxyhemoglobin and with H2Oin deoxyhemoglobin. B. Hemoglobin: allosteric effects \u0002 Like aspartate carbamoyltransferase (see p. 116), Hb can exist in two different states (conformations), known as the T form and the R form. The Tform (for tense; left) and has a much lower O2 af nity than the R form (for relaxed; right). Binding of O2 to one of the subunits of the T form leads to a local conformational change that weakens the association between the subunits. Increasing O2 partial pressure thus means that more and more molecules convert to the higher–af nity R form. This coopera- tive interaction between the subunits in- creases the O2 af nity of Hb with increasing O2 concentrations—i. e., the O2 saturation curve is sigmoidal (see p. 282). Various allosteric effectors influence the equilibrium between the T and R forms and thereby regulate the O2 binding behavior of hemoglobin (yellow arrows). The most impor- tant effectors are CO2,H+, and 2,3-bisphospho- glycerate (see p. 282). Further information As mentioned above, hemoglobin in adults consists of two α-and two β-chains. In addi- tiontothis mainform (HbA1, α2β2), adult blood also contains small amounts of a second form with a higher O2 af nity in which the β- chains are replaced by δ-chains (HbA2, α2δ2). Two other forms occur during embryonic and fetal development. In the first three months, embryonic hemoglobins are formed, with the structure ζ2ε2 and α2ε2.Up to the time of birth, fetal hemoglobin then predominates (HbF, α2γ2), and it is gradually replaced by HbA during the first few months of life. Em- bryonic and fetal hemoglobins have higher O2 af nities than HbA, as they have to take up oxygen from the maternal circulation. 280 Tissues and organs αα ββ αα ββ O2 TR β α A E F B G D C H A E F BG DC H α β A.

Due to its poor solubility, O2 is bound to hemoglobin for transport in the blood (see p. 280). This not only increases the oxygen transport capacity, but also allows regulation of O2 uptake in the lungs and O2 release into tissues. A. Regulation of O2 transport \u0002 When an enzyme reacts to effectors (sub- strates, activators, or inhibitors) with confor- mational changes that increase or reduce its activity, it is said to show allosteric behavior (see p. 116). Allosteric enzymes are usually oligomers with several subunits that mutually influence each other. Although hemoglobin is not an enzyme (it releases the bound oxygen without changing it), it has all the characteristics of an allosteric protein. Its effectors include oxygen, which as a positive homotropic effector promotes its own binding. The O2 saturation curve of he- moglobin is therefore markedly sigmoidal in shape (2, curve 2). The non-sigmoidal satura- tion curve of the muscular protein myoglobin is shown for comparison (curve 1). The struc- ture of myoglobin (see p. 336) is similar to that of a subunit of hemoglobin, but as a monomer it does not exhibit any allosteric behavior. CO2,H +, and a special metabolite of ery- throcytes—2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG)— act as heterotropic effectors of hemoglobin. BPG is synthesized from 1,3–bisphosphogly- cerate, an intermediate of glycolysis (see p. 150), and it can be returned to glycolysis again by breakdown into 2–phosphoglycerate (1), with loss of an ATP. BPG binds selectively to deoxy–Hb, thereby increasing its amount of equilibrium. The re- sult is increased O2 release at constant pΟ2.In the diagram, this corresponds to a right shift of the saturation curve (2,curve 3).CO2 and H + act inthe same directionas BPG. Their influence on the position of the curve has long been known as the Bohr effect. The effects of CO2 and BPG are additive. In thepresenceofboth effectors, the saturation curve of isolated Hb is similar to that of whole blood (curve 4). B. Hemoglobin and CO2 transport \u0002 Hemoglobin is also decisively involved in the transport of carbon dioxide (CO2)from the tissues to the lungs. Some 5% of the CO2 arising in the tissues is covalently bound to the N terminus of hemo- globin and transported as carbaminohemoglo- bin (not shown). About 90% of the CO2 is first converted in the periphery into hydrogen car- bonate (HCO3–), which is more soluble (bot- tom). In the lungs (top), CO2 is regenerated again from HCO3– and canthenbe exhaled. These two processes are coupled to the oxygenation and deoxygenation of Hb. Deoxy–Hb is a stronger base than oxy–Hb. It therefore binds additional protons (about 0.7 H + per tetramer), which promotes the for- mation of HCO3– from CO2 in the peripheral tissues. The resulting HCO3– is released into the plasma via an antiporter in the erythro- cyte membrane in exchange for Cl –,and passes from the plasma to the lungs. In the lungs, the reactions described above then proceed in reverse order: deoxy-Hb is oxy- genated and releases protons. The protons shift the HCO3/CO2 equilibrium to the left and thereby promote CO2 release. O2 binding to Hb is regulated by H + ions (i. e., by thepHvalue)via thesamemecha- nism. High concentrations of CO2 such as those in tissues with intensive metabolism locally increase the H + concentration and thereby reduce hemoglobin’s O2 af nity (Bohr effect; see above). This leads to in- creased O2 release and thus to an improved oxygen supply. The adjustment of the equilibrium be- tween CO2 and HCO3– is relatively slow in the uncatalyzed state. It is therefore acceler- ated in the erythrocytes by carbonate dehy- dratase (carbonic anhydrase) [1])—an enzyme that occurs in high concentrations in the erythrocytes. 282 Tissues and organs CO2 Cl Cl CO2 HCO3 Cl HCO3 CO2 Cl HCO3 HCO3 CO2 CO2 H2O [H2CO3] H - Hb Hb -O2 H - Hb Hb - O2 H2O [H2CO3] + ++ + + + 1 1 O2 O2 O2 O2 [H2CO3] [H2CO3] CO2 1 CO2 O2 P 1 2 2 1 010 20304050 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 pH = 7.40 1234 ADP ATP CO H2C C OO O PH P A.

On the other hand, O2 constantly gives rise to small quantities of toxic substances known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). These substances are powerful oxidation agents or extremely reactive free radicals (see p. 32), which damage cellular structures and functional molecules. Due to their role in O2 transport, the erythrocytes are constantly exposed to high concentrations of O2 and are therefore particularly at risk from ROS. A. Reactive oxygen species \u0002 Thedioxygen molecule(O2)contains two un- paired electrons—i. e., it is a diradical. Despite this, O2 is relatively stable due to its special electron arrangement. However, if the mole- cule takes up an extra electron (a), the highly reactive superoxide radical ( O2–) arises. An- other reduction step (b)leads to the peroxide anion (O22–), which easily binds protons and thus becomes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In- clusion of a third electron (c)leads to cleavage of the molecule into the ions O 2– and O –. While O 2– can form water by taking up two protons, protonation of O – provides the ex- tremely dangerous hydroxy radical ( OH). A fourth electron transfer and subsequent pro- tonation also convert O – into water. The synthesis of ROS can be catalyzed by iron ions, for example. Reaction of O2 with FMN or FAD (see p. 32) also constantly pro- duces ROS. By contrast, reduction of O2 by cytochrome c-oxidase (see p. 140) is “clean,” as theenzymedoes not releasethe intermedi- ates. In addition to antioxidants (B), enzymes also provide protection against ROS: superox- ide dismutase [1] breaks down (“dispropor- tionates”) two superoxide molecules into O2 and the less damaging H2O2. The latter is in turn disproportionated into O2 and H2Oby heme-containing catalase [2]. B. Biological antioxidants \u0002 To protect them against ROS and other radi- cals, all cells contain antioxidants.These are reducing agents that react easily with oxida- tive substances and thus protect more impor- tant molecules from oxidation. Biological antioxidants include vitamins C and E (see pp. 364, 368), coenzyme Q (see p. 104), and several carotenoids (see pp. 132, 364). Biliru- bin, which is formed during heme degrada- tion (see p. 194), also serves for protection against oxidation. Glutathione, a tripeptide that occurs in high concentrations in almost all cells, is par- ticularly important. Glutathione (sequence: Glu–Cys–Gly) contains an atypical γ-peptide bond between Glu and Cys. The thiol group of the cysteine residue is redox-active. Two mol- ecules of the reduced form (GSH, top) are bound to the disulfide (GSSG, bottom) during oxidation. C. Erythrocyte metabolism \u0002 Erythrocytes also have systems that can in- activate ROS (superoxide dismutase, catalase, GSH). They are also able to repair damage caused by ROS. This requires products that are supplied by the erythrocytes’ mainte- nance metabolism, which basically only in- volves anaerobic glycolysis (see p. 150) and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP; see p. 152). The ATP formed during glycolysis serves mainly to supply Na +/K +-ATPase, which main- tains the erythrocytes’ membrane potential. The allosteric effector 2,3-BPG (see p. 282) is also derived from glycolysis. The PPP supplies NADPH+H+, which is needed to regenerate glutathione (GSH) from GSSG with the help of glutathione reductase [3]. GSH, the most important antioxidant in the erythrocytes, serves as a coenzyme for glutathione peroxi- dase [5]. This selenium-containing enzyme detoxifies H2O2 and hydroperoxides, which arise during the reaction of ROS with unsatu- rated fatty acids in the erythrocyte mem- brane. The reduction of methemoglobin (Hb Fe3+)to Hb (Hb Fe 2+,[4]) is carried out by GSH or ascorbate by a non-enzymatic pathway; however, there are also NAD(P)H- dependent Met-Hb reductases. 284 Tissues and organs N A P A PPP PP A P N A P Hb 3 4 N A P N A P 3 5 R-O-O-R' R -OH R'-OH O2 BPG 43 5 2+23+2 2 GSH GSSG 2 GSH GSSG 3 Na 2 K O2 H2O2 O2 e e e e O2 2 2H H2O 2H H OOH 21 2 1 O2 a b c d Glu Cys Gly H COOC NH3 (CH2)2 CN O C H C H CH2 SH N O CH2 H COO S H COOC NH3 (CH2)2 CN O C H C H CH2 S N O CH2 H COO 32 H COOC NH (CH2)2 CN O C H C H CH N O CH2 H COO A.

Distribution of iron \u0002 Iron (Fe) is quantitatively the most important trace element (see p. 362). The human body contains 4–5g iron, which is almost exclusively present in protein-bound form. Approximately three-quarters of the total amount is found in heme proteins (see pp. 106, 192), mainly he- moglobin and myoglobin. About 1% of the iron is bound in iron–sulfur clusters (see p. 106), which function as cofactors in the respiratory chain, in photosynthesis, and in other redox chains. The remainder consists of iron in transport and storage proteins (transferrin, ferritin; see B). B. Iron metabolism \u0002 Iron can onlybe resorbedbythe bowel in bivalent form (i. e., as Fe 2+). For this reason, reducing agents in food such as ascorbate (vitamin C; see p. 368) promote iron uptake. Via transporters on the luminal and basal side of the enterocytes, Fe 2+ enters the blood, where it is bound by transferrin. Part of the iron that is taken up is stored in the bowel in the form of ferritin (see below). Heme groups can also be resorbed by the small intestine. Most of the resorbed iron serves for the formation of red blood cells in the bone mar- row (erythropoiesis,top). As discussed on p. 192, it is only in the final step of hem bio- synthesis that Fe2+ is incorporated by ferro- chelatase into the previously prepared tetra- pyrrol framework. In the blood, 2.5–3.0 g of hemoglobin iron circulates as a component of the erythrocytes (top right). Over the course of several months, the flexibility of the red blood cells constantly declines due to damage to the membrane and cytoskeleton. Old erythrocytes of this type are taken up by macrophages in the spleen and other organs and broken down. The organic part of the heme is oxidized into bilirubin (see p. 194), while the iron returns to the plasma pool. The quantity of heme iron recycled per day is much larger than the amount resorbed by the intestines. Transferrin,a β-globulin with a mass of 80 kDa, serves to transport iron in the blood. This monomeric protein consists of two sim- ilar domains, each of which binds an Fe2+ ion very tightly. Similar iron transport proteins are found in secretions such as saliva, tears, and milk; these are known as lactoferrins (bottom right). Transferrin and the lactofer- rins maintain the concentration of free iron in body fluidsatvaluesbelow 10 –10 mol L –1. This low level prevents bacteria that require free iron as an essential growth factor from proliferating in the body. Like LDLs (see p. 278), transferrin and the lactoferrins are taken up into cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Excess iron is incorporated into ferritin and stored in this form in the liver and other organs. The ferritin molecule consists of 24 subunits and has the shape of a hollow sphere (bottom left). It takes up Fe2+ ions, which in the process are oxidized to Fe3+ and then deposited in the interior of the sphere as fer- rihydrate. Each ferritin molecule is capable of storing several thousand iron ions in this way. In addition to ferritin, there is another storage form, hemosiderin, the function of which is not yet clear. Further information Disturbances of the iron metabolism are fre- quent and can lead to severe disease pictures. Iron deficiency is usually due to blood loss, or more rarely to inadequate iron uptake. During pregnancy, increased demand can also cause iron deficiency states. In severe cases, reduced hemoglobin synthesis can lead to anemia (“iron-deficiency anemia”). In thesepatients, theerythrocytes are smaller and have less hemoglobin. As their membrane is also altered, they are prematurely elimi- nated in the spleen. Disturbances resulting from raised iron concentrations are less frequent. Known as hemochromatoses, these conditions can have genetic causes, or may be due to re- peated administration of blood transfusions. As the body has practically no means of ex- creting iron, more and more stored iron is deposited in the organs over time in patients with untreated hemochromatosis, ultimately leading to severe disturbances of organ func- tion. 286 Tissues and organs XH2 Fe3+ Fe2+ Fe2+ Fe2+ Fe2+ X O2 A.

Hydrogen ion concentration in the blood plasma \u0002 The H + concentration in the blood and ex- tracellular space is approximately 40 nM (4 10–8 mol L –1). This corresponds to a pH of 7.40. The body triesto keepthisvalue con- stant, as large shifts in pH are incompatible with life. The pH value is kept constant by buffer systems that cushion minor disturbances in the acid–base balance (C). In the longer term, the decisive aspect is maintaining a balanced equilibrium between H + production and up- take and H + release. If the blood’s buffering capacity is not suf cient, or if the acid–base balance is not in equilibrium—e. g., in kidney disease or during hypoventilation or hyper- ventilation—shifts in the plasma pH value can occur. A reduction by more than 0.03 unitsisknown as acidosis, and an increase is called alkalosis. B. Acid–base balance \u0002 Protons are mainly derived from two sour- ces—free acids in the diet and sulfur–contain- ing amino acids. Acids takenup withfood— e. g., citric acid, ascorbic acid, and phosphoric acid—already release protons in the alkaline pH of the intestinal tract. More important for proton balance, however, are the amino acids methionine and cysteine,which arisefrom protein degradation in the cells. Their S atoms are oxidized in the liver to form sulfuric acid, which supplies protons by dissociation into sulfate. During anaerobic glycolysis in the muscles and erythrocytes, glucose is converted into lactate, releasing protons in the process (see p. 338). The synthesis of the ketone bodies acetoacetic acid and 3–hydroxybutyric acid in the liver (see p. 312) also releases protons. Normally, the amounts formed are small and of little influence on the proton balance. If acids are formed in large amounts, however (e. g., during starvation or in diabetes mellitus; see p. 160), they strain the buffer systems and can lead to a reduction in pH (metabolic acidoses; lactacidosis or ketoacidosis). Only the kidney is capable of excreting pro- tons in exchange for Na + ions (see p. 326). In the urine, the H + ions are buffered by NH3 and phosphate. C. Buffer systems in the plasma \u0002 The buffering capacity of a buffer system de- pends on its concentration and its pKa value. The strongest effect is achieved if the pH value corresponds to the buffer system’s pKa value(seep.30).For this reason,weakacids with pKa values of around 7 are best suited for buffering purposes in the blood. The most important buffer in the blood is the CO2/bicarbonate buffer. Thisconsistsof water, carbon dioxide (CO2,the anhydrideof carbonic acid H2CO3), and hydrogen carbo- nate (HCO3–,bicarbonate). Theadjustment of the balance between CO2 and HCO3– is accelerated by the zinc-containing enzyme carbonate dehydratase (carbonic anhydrase [1]; seealso p. 282). At thepH value of the plasma, HCO3– and CO2 are present in a ratio of about 20 : 1. However, the CO2 in solution in the blood is in equilibrium with the gaseous CO2 in the pulmonary alveoli. The CO2/HCO3– system is therefore a powerful open buffer system, despite having a not entirely optimal pKa valueof 6.1.Fasterorslowerrespiration increases or reduces CO2 release in the lungs. This shifts the CO2/HCO3– ratio and thus the plasma pH value (respiratory acidosis or alka- losis). In this way, respiration can compensate to a certain extent for changes in plasma pH values. However, it does not lead to the ex- cretion of protons. Due to their high concentration, plasma proteins—and hemoglobin in the erythro- cytes in particular—provide about one-quar- ter of the blood’s buffering capacity. The buf- fering effect of proteins involves contribu- tions from all of the ionizable side chains. At the pH value of blood, the acidic amino acids (Asp, Glu) and histidine are particularly effec- tive. The second dissociation step in phosphate (H2PO4/HPO42–) also contributes to the buf- fering capacity of the blood plasma. Although the pKa value of thissystemisnearly optimal, its contribution remains small due to the low total concentration of phosphate in the blood (around 1 mM). 288 Tissues and organs 75% 24% HCO3 /CO2 + H2O 1%HPO4 2 /H 2 PO 4 pKa = 6.8 H2PO4 + HHPO4 2 pKa = 4 – 12 Prot · H Prot + H CO2 + H2O pKa = 6.1 H2 CO3 H + HCO31 Fatty acids HCO2 + H2O HCO3 + pH 7.2 7.4 7.6 60 50 40 30 20nM [H ] 1 Hyperventilation increased H excretion Urine (~60 mmol H /day) A.

Initially, thrombocyte activation leads to contraction of the injured vessel and the formation of a loose clot consisting of thrombocytes (hemostasis). Slightly later, the action of the enzyme thrombin leads to the formation and deposition in the thrombus of polymeric fi- brin (coagulation, blood clotting). The coagu- lation process is discussed here in detail. A. Blood clotting \u0002 The most important reaction in blood clotting is the conversion, catalyzed by thrombin, of the soluble plasma protein fibrinogen (factor I) into polymeric fibrin, which is deposited as a fibrous network in the primary thrombus. Thrombin (factor IIa) is a serine proteinase (see p. 176) that cleaves small peptides from fibrinogen. This exposes binding sites that spontaneously allow the fibrin molecules to aggregate into polymers. Subsequent covalent cross-linking of fibrin by a transglutaminase (factor XIII) further stabilizes the thrombus. Normally, thrombin is present in the blood as an inactive proenzyme (see p. 270). Pro- thrombin is activated in two different ways, both of which represent cascades of enzy- matic reactions in which inactive proenzymes (zymogens, symbol: circle) are proteolytically converted into active proteinases (symbol: sector of a circle). The proteinases activate the next proenzyme in turn, and so on. Sev- eral steps in the cascade require additional protein factors (factors III, Va and VIIIa) as well as anionic phospholipids (PL; see below) and Ca 2+ ions. Both pathways are activated by injuries to the vessel wall. In the extravascular pathway (right), tissue thromboplastin (factor III), a membrane pro- tein in the deeper layers of the vascular wall, activates coagulation factor VII. The activated form of this (VIIa) autocatalytically promotes its own synthesis and also generates the ac- tive factors IXa and Xa from their precursors. With the aid of factor VIIIa, PL, and Ca 2+,factor IXa produces additional Xa, which finally— with the support of Va, PL, and Ca 2+—releases active thrombin. The intravascular pathway (left) is prob- ably also triggered by vascular injuries. It leads in five steps via factors XIIa, XIa, IXa, and Xa to the activation of prothrombin. The significance of this pathway in vivo has been controversial since it was found that a genetic deficiency in factor XII does not lead to coag- ulation disturbances. Both pathways depend on the presence of activated thrombocytes,onthe surfaceof which several reactions take place. For exam- ple, the prothrombinase complex (left) forms when factors Xa and II, with the help of Va, bind via Ca 2+ ions to anionic phospholipids in the thrombocyte membrane. For this to hap- pen, factors II and X have to contain the non- proteinogenic amino acid -carboxygluta- mate (Gla; see p. 62), which is formed in the liver by post-translational carboxylation of the factors. The Gla residues are found in groups in special domains that create contacts to the Ca 2+ ions. Factors VII and IX are also linked to membrane phospholipids via Gla residues. Substances that bind Ca 2+ ions (e. g., citrate) prevent Gla-containing factors from attaching to themembraneand thereforeinhibit coagulation. Antagonists of vitamin K, which is needed for synthesis of the Gla residues (see p. 364) also have anticoagulatory effects. These include dicumarol, for example. Active thrombin not only converts fibrino- gen into fibrin, but also indirectly promotes its own synthesis by catalyzing the activation of factors V and VIII. In addition, it catalyzes the activation of factor XIII and thereby trig- gers the cross-linking of the fibrin. Regulation of blood clotting (not shown). To prevent the coagulation reaction from be- coming excessive, the blood contains a num- ber of anticoagulant substances, including highly effective proteinase inhibitors. For example, antithrombin III binds to various ser- ine proteinases in the cascade and thereby inactivates them. Heparin, an anticoagulant glycosaminoglycan (see p. 346), potentiates the effect of antithrombin III. Thrombomodu- lin, which is located on the vascular endothe- lia, also inactivates thrombin. A glycoprotein known as Protein C ensures proteolytic deg- radation of factors V and VIII. As it is activated by thrombin, coagulation is shut down in this way. 290 Tissues and organs XIII XIIIa IIa XIIa XIa IXa VIIa VII XII XI IX X Xa II ~3 min ~10 s III Ca2 Ca2 Ca2 Ca2 Va Thrombin IIaXa EGF2 EGF1 K2 K1 II I V PLCa2Va + VIII PLCa2VIIIa + ?

Fibrinolysis \u0002 The fibrin thrombus resulting from blood clotting (see p. 290) is dissolved again by plasmin, a serine proteinase found in the blood plasma. For this purpose, the pre- cursor plasminogen first has to be proteolyti- cally activated by enzymes from various tis- sues. This group includes the plasminogen activator from the kidney (urokinase)and tis- sue plasminogen activator (t-PA) from vascular endothelia. By contrast, the plasma protein α2-antiplasmin, which binds to active plasmin and thereby inactivates it, inhibits fibrinoly- sis. Urokinase, t-PA, and streptokinase, a bac- terial proteinase with similar activity, are used clinically to dissolve thrombi following heart attacks. All of these proteins are ex- pressed recombinantly in bacteria (see p. 262). B. Blood groups: the ABO system \u0002 During blood transfusions, immune reactions can occur that destroy the erythrocytes trans- fused from the donor. These reactions result from the formation of antibodies (see p. 300) directed to certain surface structures on the erythrocytes. Known as blood group antigens, these are proteins or oligosaccharides that can differ from individual to individual. More than 20 different blood group systems are now known. The ABO system and the Rh system are of particular clinical importance. In the ABO system, the carbohydrate parts of glycoproteins or glycolipids act as antigens. In this relatively simple system, there are four blood groups (A,B,AB, and0). In individuals with bloodgroupsAand B, theantigens con- sist of tetrasaccharides that only differ in their terminal sugar (galactose or N-acetylgalactos- amine). Carriers of the AB blood group have both antigens (A and B). Blood group 0 arises from an oligosaccharide (the H antigen) that lacks the terminal residue of antigens A and B. The molecular causes for the differences be- tween blood groups are mutations in the gly- cosyl transferases that transfer the terminal sugar to the core oligosaccharide. Antibodies are only formed against anti- gens that the individual concerned does not possess. For example, carriers of blood group A form antibodies against antigen B (“anti-B”), while carriers of group B form antibodies against antigen A (“anti-A”). Individuals with blood group 0 form both types, and those with blood group AB do not form any of these antibodies. If blood from blood group A is transfused into the circulation of an individual with blood group B, for example, then the anti-A present there binds to the A antigens. The donor erythrocytes marked in this way are recognized and destroyed by the complement system (see p. 298). In the test tube, aggluti- nation of the erythrocytes can be observed when donor and recipient blood are incom- patible. The recipient’s serum should not contain any antibodies against the donor erythro- cytes, and the donor serum should not con- tain any antibodies against the recipient’s erythrocytes. Donor blood from blood group 0 is unproblematic, as its erythrocytes do not possess any antibodies and therefore do not react with anti-A or anti-B in the recipient’s blood. Conversely, blood from the AB group can only be administered to recipients with theAB group,as these arethe only ones with- out antibodies. In the Rh system (not shown), proteins on the surface of the erythrocytes act as antigens. These are known as“rhesus factors,”asthe system was first discovered in rhesus mon- keys. The rhesusD antigen occursin 84% of all white individuals, who are therefore “Rh-pos- itive.” If an Rh-positive child is born to an Rh- negative mother, fetal erythrocytes can enter the mother’s circulation during birth and lead to the formation of antibodies (IgG) against the D antigen. This initially has no acute ef- fects on the mother or child. Complications only arise when there is a second pregnancy with an Rh-positive child, as maternal anti-D antibodies cross the placenta to the fetus even before birth and can trigger destruction of the child’s Rh-positive erythrocytes (fetal erythro- blastosis). 292 Tissues and organs 1 GDP GDP GP GP GP GP 1 GP UDP UDP 23 UDP UDP 2 3 40% 16% 4% 40% H H H H H H H H H A A B B AAB B BB B B B B B B A A A A A AA A Soluble proteins B.

The immune system is supported by physiological changes in infected tissue, known as inflammation.This reaction makes it easier for the immune cells to reach the site of infection. Two different systems are involved in the immune response. The innate immune system is based on receptors that can distinguish between bacterial and viral surface structures or foreign proteins (known as antigens)and those that are endogenous. With the help of these receptors, phagocytes bind to the patho- gens, absorb them by endocytosis, and break them down. The complement system (see p. 298) is also part of the innate system. The acquired (adaptive) immune system is based on the ability of the lymphocytes to form highly specific antigen receptors “on suspicion,” without ever having met the cor- responding antigen. In humans, there are sev- eral billion different lymphocytes, each of whichcarries adifferent antigenreceptor. If this type of receptor recognizes “its” cognate antigen, the lymphocyte carrying it is acti- vated and then plays its special role in the immune response. In addition, a distinction is made between cellular and humoral immune responses. The Tlymphocytes (T cells) are responsible for cel- lular immunity. They are named after the thy- mus, in which the decisive steps in their dif- ferentiation take place. Depending on their function, another distinction is made be- tween cytotoxic T cells (green) and helper T cells (blue). Humoral immunity is based on the activity of the B lymphocytes (B cells, light brown), which mature in the bone marrow. After activation by T cells, B cells are able to release soluble forms of their specific antigen receptors, known as antibodies (see p. 300), into the blood plasma. The immune system’s “memory” is represented by memory cells. These are particularly long–lived cells that can arise from any of the lymphocyte types described. A. Simplified diagram of the immune response \u0002 Pathogens that have entered the body—e. g., viruses (top)—are taken up by antigen-pre- senting cells (APCs) and proteolytically de- graded (1). The viral fragments produced in this way are then presented on the surfaces of these cells with the help of special membrane proteins (MHC proteins; see p. 296) (2). The APCs include B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells such as the skin’s Langer- hans cells. The complexes of MHC proteins and viral fragments displayed on the APCs are recog- nized by T cells that carry a receptor that matches the antigen (“T-cell receptors”; see p. 296) (3). Binding leads to activation of the T cell concerned and selective replication of it (4, “clonal selection”). The proliferation of im- mune cells is stimulated by interleukins (IL). These are a group of more than 20 signaling substances belonging to the cytokine family (see p. 392), with the help of which immune cells communicate with each other. For exam- ple, activated macrophages release IL-1 (5), while T cells stimulate their own replication and that of other immune cells by releasing IL-2 (6). Depending on their type, activated T cells have different functions. Cytotoxic T cells (green) are able to recognize and bind virus- infected body cells or tumor cells (7). They then drive the infected cells into apoptosis (see p. 396) or kill them with perforin, apro- tein that perforates the target cell’s plasma membrane (8). B lymphocytes, which as APCs present viral fragments on their surfaces, are recognized by helper T cells (blue) or their T cell receptors (9). Stimulated by interleukins, selective clo- nal replication then takes place of B cells that carry antigen receptors matching those of the pathogen (10). Thesematureinto plasma cells (11) and finally secrete large amounts of soluble antibodies (12). 294 Tissues and organs IL- 2 10 IL IL- 1 IL- 2 1 22 33 44 5 6 6 9 11 12 8 7 IL- 1 Plasma cell Activated helper cells Activated cytotoxic T cells Memory cells Virus MHC protein (class I) MacrophageB lymphocyte Antibody (IgM) MHC protein (class II) with virus fragment MHC protein (class I) with viral peptide T lymphocytes T cell receptor for MHC-protein (class II) Resting helper cells Activated helper cell Resting cytotoxic T cells Antibody (IgG) Any body cell MHC protein (class II) IL = interleukin Macrophage A. Simplified scheme of the immune response Antigen-presenting cells 295Immune response T-cell activation For the selectivity of the immune response (see p. 294), the cells involved must be able to recognize foreign antigens and proteins on other immune cells safely and reliably. To do this, they have antigen receptors on their cell surfaces and co-receptors that support recog- nition. A. Antigen receptors \u0003 Many antigen receptors belong to the immu- noglobulin superfamily. The common charac- teristic of these proteins is that they are made up from “immunoglobulin domains.” These are characteristically folded substructures consisting of 70–110 amino acids, which are also found in soluble immunoglobulins (Ig; see p. 300). The illustration shows schemati- cally a few of the important proteins in the Ig superfamily. They consist of constant regions (brown or green) and variable regions (or- ange). Homologous domains are shown in the same colors in each case. All of the recep- tors have transmembrane helices at the C terminus, which anchor them to the mem- branes. Intramolecular and intermolecular di- sulfide bonds are also usually found in pro- teins belonging to the Ig family. Immunoglobulin M (IgM), a membrane proteinonthe surface of B lymphocytes, serves to bind free antigens to the B cells. By contrast, T cell receptors only bind antigens when they are presented by another cell as a complexwithanMHC protein(see below). Interaction between MHC-bound antigens and T cell receptors is supported by co-recep- tors. This group includes CD8, a membrane protein that is typical in cytotoxic T cells. T helper cells use CD4 as a co-receptor instead (not shown). The abbreviation “CD” stands for “cluster of differentiation.” It is the term for a large group of proteins that are all located on the cell surface and can therefore be identi- fied by antibodies. In addition to CD4 and CD8, there are many other co-receptors on immune cells (not shown). The MHC proteins are named after the “major histocompatibility complex”—the DNA segmentthatcodes for them. Human MHC proteins are also known as HLA antigens (“hu- man leukocyte-associated” antigens). Their polymorphism is so large that it is unlikely that any two individuals carry the same set of MHC proteins—except for monozygotic twins. Class I MHC proteins occur in almost all nucleated cells. They mainly interact with cy- totoxic T cells and are the reason for the re- jection of transplanted organs. Class I MHC proteins are heterodimers (αβ). The β subunit is also known as β2-microglobulin. Class II MHC proteins also consist of two peptide chains, which are related to each other. MHC II molecules are found on all anti- gen-presenting cells in the immune system. They serve for interaction between these cells and CD4-carrying T helper cells. B. T-cell activation \u0002 The illustration shows an interaction between a virus-infected body cell (bottom) and a CD8- carrying cytotoxic T lymphocyte (top). The infected cell breaks down viral proteins in its cytoplasm (1) and transports the peptide fragments into the endoplasmic reticulum with the help of a special transporter (TAP) (2). Newly synthesized class I MHC proteins on the endoplasmic reticulum are loaded with one of the peptides (3)and then trans- ferred to the cell surface by vesicular trans- port (4). The viral peptides are bound on the surface of the α2 domain of the MHC protein in a depressionformed by aninsertion as a “floor” and two helices as “walls” (see smaller illustration). Supported by CD8 and other co-receptors, a T cell with a matching T cell receptor binds to the MHC peptide complex (5; cf. p. 224). This binding activates protein kinases in the interior of the T cell, which trigger a chain of additional reactions (signal transduction; see p. 388). Finally, destruction of the virus-in- fected cell by the cytotoxic T lymphocytes takes place. 296 Tissues and organs Aufsicht α1α2••• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • ••••••• α3 • • • • • • • • • • • ••• • ••• • • • • • • • • • • • • • ••• 1 23 4 5 ATP ADP + P H chain L chain Cytotoxic T cell CD8 T cell receptor Virus-infected body cell T cell activity β2 Micro- globulin 12 kDa MHC protein (class I) MHC protein (class II) T cell receptor α Chain 44 kDa IgM Characteristic domain of the superfamily β Chain 28 kDa α Chain 33 kDa C terminus α Chain 44 kDa β Chain 37 kDa CD8 Ig domain A.

It supports non- specific defense against microorganisms. The system consists of some 30 different proteins, the “complement factors,” which are found in the blood and represent about 4% of all plasma proteins there. When inflammatory reactions occur, the complement factors enter the infected tissue and take effect there. The complement system works in three different ways: Chemotaxis. Various complement factors attract immune cells that can attack and phagocytose pathogens. Opsonization. Certain complement factors (“opsonins”) bind to the pathogens and thereby mark them as targets for phagocytos- ing cells (e. g., macrophages). Membrane attack. Other complement fac- tors are deposited in the bacterial membrane, wherethey createpores that lyse the patho- gen (see below). A. Complement activation \u0002 Thereactions that take placein the comple- ment system can be initiated in several ways. During the early phase of infection, lipopoly- saccharides and other structures on the sur- face of the pathogens trigger the alternative pathway (right). If antibodies against the pathogens become available later, the anti- gen–antibody complexes formed activate the classic pathway (left). Acute-phase proteins (see p. 276) are also able to start the comple- ment cascade (lectin pathway, not shown). Factors C1 to C4 (for “complement”) belong to the classic pathway, while factors B and D form the reactive components of the alterna- tive pathway. Factors C5 to C9 are responsible for membrane attack. Other components not shown here regulate the system. As in blood coagulation (see p. 290), the early components in the complement system are serine proteinases, which mutually acti- vate each other through limited proteolysis. They create a self-reinforcing enzyme cas- cade.Factor C3, the products of which are involved in several functions, is central to the complement system. The classic pathway is triggered by the for- mation of factor C1 at IgG or IgM on the sur- face of microorganisms (left). C1 is an 18-part molecular complex with three different com- ponents (C1q, C1r, and C1s). C1q is shaped like a bunch of tulips, the “flowers” of which bind to the Fc region of antibodies (left). This acti- vates C1r, a serine proteinase that initiates the cascade of the classic pathway. First, C4 is proteolytically activated into C4b, which in turn cleaves C2 into C2a and C2b. C4B and C2a together form C3 convertase [1], which finally catalyzes the cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. Small amounts of C3b also arise from non-enzymatic hydrolysis of C3. The alternative pathway starts with the binding of factors C3b and B to bacterial lipo- polysaccharides (endotoxins). The formation of this complex allows cleavage of B by factor D, giving rise to a second form of C3 conver- tase (C3bBb). Proteolytic cleavage of factor C3 provides two components with different effects. The reaction exposes a highly reactive thioester group in C3b, which reacts with hydroxyl or aminogroups. This allows C3b tobind cova- lently to molecules on the bacterial surface (opsonization, right). In addition, C3b initiates a chain of reactions leading to the formation of the membrane attack complex (see below). Together with C4a and C5a (see below), the smaller product C3a promotes the inflamma- tory reaction and has chemotactic effects. The “late” factors C5 to C9 are responsible for the development of the membrane attack complex (bottom). They create an ion-perme- able pore in the bacterial membrane, which leads to lysis of the pathogen. This reaction is triggered by C5 convertase [2]. Depending on the type of complement activation, this en- zyme has the structure C4b2a3b or C3bBb3b, and it cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. The com- plex of C5b and C6 allows deposition of C7 in the bacterial membrane. C8 and numerous C9 molecules—which form the actual pore—then bind to this core. 298 Tissues and organs C3 C3a C3b SC O NH SH C O SC O C1 C4 C2 C4b C2a B Bb D C3b’ 1 1 C3a C3 C3b 1 NH2H2O C6 C7 C8 C9 C5 C5b 2 C2b C2aC4b C3bBb 2 A.

They are also members of the im- munoglobulin family (Ig; see p. 296). Anti- bodies are an important part of the humoral immune defense system. They have no anti- microbial properties themselves, but support the cellular immune system in various ways: 1. They bind to antigens on the surface of pathogens and thereby prevent them from interacting with body cells (neutralization; see p. 404, for example). 2. They link single-celled pathogens into aggregates (immune complexes), which are more easily taken up by phagocytes (aggluti- nation). 3. They activate the complement system (see p. 298) and thereby promote the innate immune defense system (opsonization). In addition, antibodies have become indis- pensable aids in medical and biological diag- nosis (see p. 304). A. Domain structure of immunoglobulin G \u0002 Type G immunoglobulins (IgG)are quantita- tively the most important antibodies in the blood, where they form the fraction of γ-glob- ulins(see p. 276). IgGs (mass150 kDa) are tetramers with two heavy chains (H chains; redororange) andtwo light chains (L chains; yellow). Both H chains are glycosylated (vio- let; see also p. 43). The proteinase papain cleaves IgG into two Fab fragments and one Fc fragment. The Fab (“antigen-binding”) fragments, which each consist of one L chain and the N-terminal part of an H chain, are able to bind antigens. The Fc (“crystallizable”) fragment is made up of the C-terminal halves of the two H chains. This segment serves to bind IgG to cell sur- faces, for interaction with the complement system and antibody transport. Immunoglobulins are constructed in a modular fashion from several immunoglobu- lin domains (shown in the diagram on the right in Ω form). The H chains of IgG contain four of these domains (V H, C H1, C H2, and C H3) and the L chains contain two (C L and V L). The letters C and V designate constant or variable regions. Disulfide bonds link the two heavy chains to each other and also link the heavy chains to the light chains. Inside the domains, there are also disulfide bonds that stabilize the tertiary structure. The domains are approximately 110 amino acids (AA) long and are homologous with each other. The antibody structure evi- dently developed as a result of gene duplica- tion. In its central region, known as the “hinge” region, the antibodies are highly mo- bile. B. Classes of immunoglobulins \u0002 Human immunoglobulins are divided into five classes. IgA (with two subgroups), IgD, IgE, IgG (with four subgroups), and IgM are defined by their H chains, which are desig- nated by the Greek letters α, δ, ε, γ,and µ.By contrast, there are only two types of Lchain (κ and λ). IgD and IgE (like IgG) are tetramers with the structure H2L2. By contrast, soluble IgA and IgM are multimers that are held together by disulfide bonds and additional Jpeptides (joining peptides). The antibodies have different tasks. IgMs are the first immunoglobulins formed after contact with a foreign antigen. Their early forms are located on the surface of B cells (see p. 296), whilethe later forms arese- creted from plasma cells as pentamers. Their action targets microorganisms in particular. Quantitatively, IgGs are the most important immunoglobulins (see the table showing se- rum concentrations). They occur in the blood and interstitial fluid. As they can pass the placenta with the help of receptors, they can be transferred from mother to fetus. IgAs mainly occur in the intestinal tract and in body secretions. IgEs are found in low con- centrations in the blood. As they can trigger degranulation of mast cells (see p. 380), they play an important role in allergic reactions. The function of IgDs is still unexplained. Their plasma concentration is also very low. 300 Tissues and organs VH VL CH1 CL CH2 CH3 FcSSSSSSSSSSSS S S S S S S S SSSSS S S S SSSSSFab S S S S J S S S S S S αδ ε γ µ S S S S S SJ H L S S S S (α2 κ2)nJ δ2 κ2 (α2 λ2)nJ δ2 λ2 ε2 κ2 ε2 λ2 γ2 κ2 γ2 λ2 (µ2 κ2)5 J (µ2 λ2)5 J Heavy chain (450 AA) Antigen- binding site C-terminal end Light chain (212 AA) Variable domain Disulfide bond “Hinge” region Cleavage site for papain 3.4.22.2 Fab fragmentFc fragment Light chain Heavy chain Oligo- saccharide A.

Classes of immunoglobulins Oligo- saccharide 301Immune response Antibody biosynthesis The acquired (adaptive) immune system (see p. 294) is based on the ability of the lympho- cytes to keep an extremely large repertoire of antigen receptors and soluble antibodies ready for use, so that even infections involv- ing new types of pathogen can be combated. The wide range of immunoglobulins (Ig) are produced by genetic recombination and addi- tional mutations during the development and maturation of the individual lymphocytes. A. Variability of immunoglobulins \u0002 It is estimated that more than 10 8 different antibody variants occur in every human being. This variability affects both the heavy and the light chains of immunoglobulins. There are five different types of heavy (H) chain, according to which the antibody classes are defined (α, δ, ε, γ, µ), and two types of light (L) chain (κ and λ;see p. 300).The various Ig types that arise from combinations of these chains are known as isotypes. During immu- noglobulin biosynthesis, plasma cells can switch from one isotype to another (“gene switch”). Allotypic variation is based on the existence of various alleles of the same gene—i. e., genetic differences between indi- viduals. The term idiotypic variation refers to the fact that the antigen binding sites in the Fab fragments can be highly variable. Idiotypic variation affects the variable domains (shown here in pink) of the light and heavy chains. At certain sites—known as the hypervariable re- gions (shown here in red)—variation is partic- ularly wide; these sequences are directly in- volved in the binding of the antigen. B. Causes of antibody variety \u0002 There are three reasons for the extremely wide variability of antibodies: 1. Multiple genes. Various genes are avail- able to code for the variable protein domains. Only one gene from among these is selected and expressed. 2. Somatic recombination. The genes are divided into several segments, of which there are various versions. Various (“untidy”) com- binations of the segments during lymphocyte maturation give rise to randomly combined new genes (“mosaic genes”). 3. Somatic mutation. During differentiation of B cells into plasma cells, the coding genes mutate. In this way, the “primordial” germ- line genes can become different somatic genes in the individual B cell clones. C. Biosynthesis of a light chain \u0003 We can look at the basic features of the ge- netic organization and synthesis of immuno- globulins using the biosynthesis of a mouse κ chain as an example. The gene segments for this light chain are designated L, V, J, and C. They are located on chromosome 6 in the germ-line DNA (on chromosome 2 in humans) and are separated from one another by in- trons (see p. 242) of different lengths. Some 150 identical Lsegments code for the signal peptide (“leader sequence,” 17–20 amino acids) for secretion of the product (see p. 230). The Vsegments,of which there are 150 different variants, code for most of the variable domains (95 of the 108 amino acids). L and V segments always occur in pairs—in tandem, so to speak. By contrast, there are only five variants of the Jsegments (joining segments) at most. These code for a peptide with 13 amino acids that links the variable part of the κ chains to the constant part. A single Csegment codes for the constant part of the light chain (84 amino acids). During the differentiation of B lympho- cytes, individual V/J combinations arise in each B cell. One of the 150 L/V tandem seg- ments is selected and linked to one of the five J segments. This gives rise to a somatic gene that is much smaller than the germline gene. Transcription of this gene leads to the forma- tion of the hnRNA for the κ chain, from which intronsand surplusJ segments are removed by splicing (see p. 246). Finally, the completed mRNA still contains one each of the L–V–J–C segments and after being transported into the cytoplasm is available for translation. The subsequent steps in Ig biosynthesis follow the rules for the synthesis of membrane- bound or secretory proteins (see p. 230). 302 Tissues and organs V1 V2 V3 Vn J1 J2 J3 J4LL L L CV1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V....

Monoclonal antibodies \u0003 Monoclonal antibodies (MABs) are secreted by immune cells that derive from a single antibody-forming cell (from a single cell clone). This is why each MAB is directed against only one specific epitope of an immu- nogenic substance, known as an “antigenic determinant.” Large molecules contain several epitopes, against which various antibodies are formed by various B cells. An antiserum con- taining a mixture of all of these antibodies is described as being polyclonal. To obtain MABs, lymphocytes isolated from the spleen of immunized mice (1)are fused with mouse tumor cells (myeloma cells, 2). This is necessary because antibody-secreting lymphocytes in culture have a lifespan of only a few weeks. Fusion of lymphocytes with tu- mor cells gives rise to cell hybrids, known as hybridomas, which are potentially immortal. Successful fusion (2) is a rare event, but the frequency can be improved by adding poly- ethylene glycol (PEG). To obtain only success- fully fused cells, incubation is required for an extended period in a primary culture with HAT medium (3), which contains hypoxan- thine, aminopterin, and thymidine. Amino- pterin, an analogue of dihydrofolic acid, com- petitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and thus inhibits the synthesis of dTMP (see p. 402).AsdTMPisessential forDNA synthe- sis, myeloma cells cannot survive in the pres- ence of aminopterin. Although spleen cells areableto circumventthe inhibitory effect of aminopterin by using hypoxanthine and thymidine, they have a limited lifespan and die. Only hybridomas survive culture in HAT medium, because they possess both the im- mortality of the myeloma cells and the spleen cells’ metabolic side pathway. Only a few fused cells actually produce antibodies. To identify these cells, the hybrid- omas have to be isolated and replicated by cloning (4). After the clones have been tested for antibody formation, positive cultures are picked out and selected by further cloning (5). This results in hybridomas that synthesize monoclonal antibodies. Finally, MAB produc- tion is carried out in vitro using a bioreactor, or in vivo by producing ascites fluid in mice (6). B. Immunoassay \u0003 Immunoassays are semiquantitative proce- dures for assessing substances with low con- centrations. In principle, immunoassays can be used to assess any compound against which antibodies are formed. The basis for this procedure is the anti- gen–antibody “reaction”—i. e., specific binding of an antibody to the molecule being assayed. Among the many different immunoassay techniques that have been developed—e. g., radioimmunoassay (RIA), and chemolumines- cence immunoassay (CIA)—a version of the enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) is shown here. The substance to be assayed—e. g., the hor- mone thyroxine in a serum sample—is pipet- ted into a microtiter plate (1), the walls of which are coated with antibodies that specif- ically bind the hormone. At the same time, a small amount of thyroxine is added to the incubation to which an enzyme known as the “tracer” (1) has been chemically coupled. The tracer and the hormone being assayed competefor thesmall number of antibody binding sites available. After binding has taken place (2), all of the unbound molecules are rinsed out. The addition of a substrate solution for the enzyme (a chromogenic solu- tion) then triggers an indicator reaction (3), the products of which can be assessed using photometry (4). The larger the amount of enzyme that can bind to the antibodies on the container’s walls, the larger the amount of dye that is produced. Conversely, the larger the amount of the substance being assayed that is present in the sample, the smaller the amount of tracer that can be bound by the antibodies. Quantitative analysis can be carried out through parallel measurement using stan- dards with a known concentration. 304 Tissues and organs C C C B A B C B A B C B C C C C C C C A AA E C F C F AntikörperE EE C C C C CC FF F E E E A.

Although it only represents 2–3% of the body’s mass, it ac- counts for 25–30% of oxygen consumption. A. Diagram of a hepatocyte \u0002 The 3 10 11 cells in the liver—particularly the hepatocytes, which makeup90% of thecell mass—are the central location for the body’s intermediary metabolism. They are in close contact with the blood, which enters the liver from the portal vein and the hepatic arteries, flows through capillary vessels known as si- nusoids, and is collected again in the central veins of the hepatic lobes. Hepatocytes are particularly rich in endoplasmic reticulum, as they carry out intensive protein and lipid synthesis. The cytoplasm contains granules of insoluble glycogen. Between the hepatocytes, there are bile capillaries through which bile components are excreted. B. Functions of the liver \u0001 The most important functions of the liver are: 1. Uptake of nutrients supplied by the in- testines via the portal vein. 2. Biosynthesis of endogenous compounds and storage, conversion, and degradation of them into excretable molecules (metabolism). In particular, the liver is responsible for the biosynthesis and degradation of almost all plasma proteins. 3. Supply of the body with metabolites and nutrients. 4. Detoxification of toxic compounds by biotransformation. 5. Excretion of substances with the bile. C. Hepatic metabolism \u0001 The liver is involved in the metabolism of practically all groups of metabolites. Its func- tions primarily serve to cushion fluctuations in the concentration of these substances in the blood, in order to ensure a constant sup- ply to the peripheral tissues (homeostasis). Carbohydrate metabolism. The liver takes up glucose and other monosaccharides from theplasma. Glucoseisthen eitherstoredin the form of the polysaccharide glycogen or converted into fatty acids. When there is a drop in the blood glucose level, the liver re- leases glucose again by breaking down glyco- gen. If the glycogen store is exhausted, glu- cose can also be synthesized by gluconeogen- esis from lactate, glycerol, or the carbon skel- eton of amino acids (see p. 310). Lipid metabolism. The liver synthesizes fatty acids from acetate units. The fatty acids formed arethen usedto synthesizefats and phospholipids, which are released into the blood in the form of lipoproteins. The liver’s special ability to convert fatty acids into ke- tone bodies and to release these again is also important (see p. 312). Like other organs, the liver also synthesizes cholesterol, which is transported to other tis- sues as a component of lipoproteins. Excess cholesterol is converted into bile acids in the liverordirectly excretedwith the bile (see p. 314). Amino acid and protein metabolism. The liver controls the plasma levels of the amino acids. Excessamino acidsare broken down. With the help of the urea cycle (see p. 182), the nitrogen from the amino acids is con- verted into urea and excreted via the kidneys. The carbonskeletonofthe aminoacids enters the intermediary metabolism and serves for glucose synthesis or energy production. In addition, most of the plasma proteins are syn- thesized or broken down in the liver (see p. 276). Biotransformation. Steroid hormones and bilirubin, as well as drugs, ethanol, and other xenobiotics are taken up by the liver and in- activated and converted into highly polar me- tabolites by conversion reactions (see p. 316). Storage. The liver not only stores energy reserves and nutrients for the body, but also certain mineral substances, trace elements, and vitamins, including iron, retinol, and vi- tamins A, D, K, folic acid, and B12. 306 Tissues and organs 2 3 1 5 4 * * * ** * * * * * A.

The body receives these metabolites with food, but the supply is irregular and in varying amounts. The liver acts here along with other organs, particularly adipose tissue, as a balancing buffer and storage organ. In the metabolism, a distinction is made between the absorptive state (well-fed state) immediately after a meal and the postabsorb- tive state (state of starvation),which starts later and can merge into hunger. The switch- ing of the organ metabolism between the two phases depends on the concentration of en- ergy-bearing metabolites in the blood (plas- ma level). This is regulated jointly by hor- mones and by the autonomic nervous system. A. Absorptive state \u0002 The absorptive state continues for 2–4 hours after food intake. As a result of food digestion, the plasma levels of glucose, amino acids, and fats (triacylglycerols) temporarily increase. The endocrine pancreas responds to this by altering its hormone release—there is an in- crease in insulin secretion and a reduction in glucagon secretion. The increase in the insu- lin/glucagon quotient and the availability of substrates trigger an anabolic phase in the tissues—particularly liver, muscle, and adi- pose tissues. The liver forms increased amounts of gly- cogen and fats from the substrates supplied. Glycogen is stored, and the fat is released into the blood in very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs). Muscle also refills its glycogen store and synthesizes proteins from the amino acids supplied. Adipose tissue removes free fatty acids from the lipoproteins, synthesizes triacylgly- cerols from them again, and stores these in the form of insoluble droplets. During the absorptive state, the heart and neural tissue mainly use glucose as an energy source, but they are unable to establish any substantial energy stores. Heart muscle cells arein a sense“omnivorous,” as they can also use other substances to produce energy (fatty acids, ketone bodies). By contrast, the central nervous system (CNS) is dependent on glu- cose. It is only able to utilize ketone bodies after a prolonged phase of hunger (B). B. Postabsorptive state \u0002 When the food supply is interrupted, the postabsorbtive state quickly sets in. The pan- creatic A cells now release increased amounts of glucagon, while the B cells reduce the amount of insulin they secrete. The reduced insulin/glucagon quotient leads to switching of the intermediary metabolism. The body now falls back on its energy reserves. To do this, it breaks down storage substances (gly- cogen, fats, and proteins) and shifts energy- supplying metabolites between the organs. The liver first empties its glycogen store (glycogenolysis; see p. 156). It does not use the released glucose itself, however, but sup- plies the other tissues with it. In particular, the brain, adrenal gland medulla, and eryth- rocytes depend on a constant supply of glu- cose, as they have no substantial glucose re- serves themselves. When the liver’s glycogen reserves are exhausted after 12–24 hours, gluconeogenesis begins (see p. 154). The pre- cursors for this are derived from the muscu- lature (amino acids) and adipose tissue (glyc- erol from fat degradation). From the fatty acids that are released (see below), the liver starts to form ketone bodies (ketogenesis; see p. 312). These are released into the blood and serve as important energy suppliers during the hunger phase. After 1–2 weeks, the CNS also starts to use ketone bodies to supply part of its energy requirements, in order to save glucose. In muscle, the extensive glycogen reserves are exclusively used for the muscles’ own requirements (see p. 320). The slowly initi- ated protein breakdown in muscle supplies amino acids for gluconeogenesis in the liver. In adipose tissue, glucagon triggers lipoly- sis, releasing fatty acids and glycerol. The fatty acids are used as energy suppliers by many types of tissue (with the exception of brain and erythrocytes). An important recipient of the fatty acids is the liver, which uses them for ketogenesis. 308 Tissues and organs Liver Intestine Muscle Nervous tissue Heart Do not have energy reserves Ketone bodies Glucose Gluconeogenesis ProteinsAmino acids Glycogen Fatty acids Adipose tissue Pancreas Insulin Glucagon Triacylglycerols Glucose amino acids Glycogen Erythrocytes Liver Intestine Heart Nervous tissue Muscle Adipose tissue Triacylglycerols Glucose Fat Glycogen Amino acids Proteins Glycogen High blood glucose level Storage compound Insulin Glucagon Glucose Amino acids Pancreas A. Absorptive state B. Postabsorptive state Fat 309Liver Carbohydrate metabolism Besides fatty acids and ketone bodies, glucose is the body’s most important energy supplier. The concentration of glucose in the blood (the “blood glucose level”) is maintained at 4–6 mM (0.8–1.0 g L –1) by precise regula- tion of glucosesupplying and glucose-utilizing processes. Glucose suppliers include the in- testines (glucose from food), liver, and kid- neys. The liver plays the role of a “glucostat” (see p. 308). The liver is also capable of forming glucose by converting other sugars—e. g., fructose and galactose—or by synthesizing from other me- tabolites. The conversion of lactate to glucose in the Cori cycle (see p. 338) and the conver- sion of alanine to glucose with the help of the alanine cycle (see p. 338) are particularly im- portant for the supply of erythrocytes and muscle cells. Transporters in the plasma membrane of hepatocytes allow insulin-independent trans- port of glucose and other sugars in both di- rections. In contrast to muscle, the liver pos- sesses the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which can release glucose from glucose-6- phosphate. A. Gluconeogenesis: overview \u0002 Regeneration of glucose (up to 250 g per day) mainly takes place in the liver. The tubule cells of the kidney are also capable of carrying out gluconeogenesis, but due to their much smaller mass, their contribution only repre- sents around 10% of total glucose formation. Gluconeogenesis is regulated by hormones. Cortisol, glucagon, and epinephrine promote gluconeogenesis, while insulin inhibits it (see pp. 158, 244). The main precursors of gluconeogenesis in the liver are lactate from anaerobically work- ing muscle cells and from erythrocytes, glucogenic amino acids from the digestive tract and muscles (mainly alanine), and glycerol from adipose tissue. The kidney mainly uses amino acids for gluconeogenesis (Glu, Gln; see p. 328). In mammals, fatty acids and other suppli- ers of acetyl CoA are not capable of being used for gluconeogenesis, as the acetyl residues formed during β-oxidation in the tricarbox- ylic acid cycle (see p. 132) are oxidized to CO2 and therefore cannot be converted into oxalo- acetic acid, the precursor for gluconeogenesis. B. Fructose and galactose metabolism \u0002 Fructose is mainly metabolized by the liver, which channels it into glycolysis (left half of the illustration). Aspecial ketohexokinase [1] initially phos- phorylates fructose into fructose 1-phos- phate. Thisisthen cleaved by an aldolase [2], which is also fructose-specific, to yield glycerone 3-phosphate (dihydroxyacetone phosphate) and glyceraldehyde.Glycerone 3-phosphate is already an intermediate of glycolysis (center), while glyceraldehyde can be phosphorylated into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by triokinase [3]. To a smaller extent, glyceraldehyde is also reduced to glycerol [4] or oxidized to glycer- ate, which can be channeled into glycolysis following phosphorylation (not shown). The reduction of glyceraldehyde [4] uses up NADH. As the rate of degradation of alcohol in the hepatocytes is limited by the supply of NAD +, fructose degradation accelerates alco- hol degradation (see p. 320). Outside of the liver, fructose is channeled into the sugar metabolism by reduction at C-2 to yield sorbitol and subsequent dehydration at C-1 to yield glucose (the polyol pathway; not shown). Galactose is also broken down in the liver (right side of the illustration). As is usual with sugars, the metabolism of galactose starts with a phosphorylation to yield galactose 1-phosphate [5]. The connection to the glu- cose metabolism is established by C-4 epime- rization to form glucose 1-phosphate.How- ever, thisdoesnot take place directly. Instead, a transferase [6] transfers a uridine 5\u0001-mono- phosphate (UMP) residue from uridine di- phosphoglucose (UDPglucose) to galactose 1-phosphate. This releases glucose 1-phos- phate, while galactose 1-phosphate is con- verted into uridine diphosphogalactose (UDP- galactose). This then is isomerized into UDP- glucose. The biosynthesis of galactose also fol- lows this reaction pathway, which is freely reversible up to reaction [5]. Genetic defects of enzymes [5] or [6] can lead to the clinical picture of galactosemia. 310 Tissues and organs ATP ATP ADPNAD + NADH+H + ADP ATP ADP 2 3 4 5 6 71 2 4 51 6 7 10% 90% O H OH OH H H HO H OH HOCH2 3 P P A.

Most of these products are released into the blood. In con- trast, the triacylglycerols synthesized in adi- pose tissue are also stored there. A. Lipid metabolism \u0002 Lipid metabolism in the liver is closely linked to the carbohydrate and amino acid metabo- lism. When there is a good supply of nutrients in the resorptive (wellfed) state (see p. 308), the liver converts glucose via acetyl CoA into fatty acids.The livercan also take up fatty acids from chylomicrons, which are supplied by the intestine, or from fatty acid–albumin complexes (see p. 162). Fatty acids from both sources are converted into fats and phospho- lipids. Together with apoproteins, they are packed into very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs; see p. 278) and then released into the blood by exocytosis. The VLDLs supply extrahepatic tissue, particularly adipose tis- sue and muscle. In the postresorptive state (see p. 292)— particularly during fasting and starva- tion—the lipid metabolism is readjusted and the organism falls back on its own reserves. In theseconditions, adiposetissuereleases fatty acids. They are taken up by the liver and are mainly converted into ketone bodies (B). Cholesterol can be derived from two sour- ces—food or endogenous synthesis from ace- tyl-CoA. A substantial percentage of endo- genous cholesterol synthesis takes place in the liver. Some cholesterol is required for the synthesis of bile acids (see p. 314). In ad- dition, it serves as a building block for cell membranes (see p. 216), or can be esterified with fatty acids and stored in lipid droplets. The rest is released together into the blood in the form of lipoprotein complexes (VLDLs) and supplies other tissues. The liver also con- tributes to the cholesterol metabolism by tak- ing up from the blood and breaking down lipoproteins that contain cholesterol and cho- lesterol esters (HDLs, IDLs, LDLs; see p. 278). B. Biosynthesis of ketone bodies \u0002 At high concentrations of acetyl-CoA in the liver mitochondria, two molecules condense to form acetoacetyl CoA [1]. The transfer of another acetyl group [2] gives rise to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG CoA), which after release of acetyl CoA [3] yields free acetoacetate (Lynen cycle). Acetoacetate can be converted to 3-hydroxybutyrate by reduction [4], or can pass into acetone by nonenzymatic decarboxylation [5]. These three compounds are together referred to as “ketone bodies,” although in fact 3-hydroxy- butyrate is not actually a ketone. As reaction [3] releases an H + ion, metabolic acidosis can occur as a result of increased ketone body synthesis (see p. 288). Theketonebodies are released by theliver into the blood, in which they are easily solu- ble. Blood levels of ketone bodies therefore rise during periods of hunger. Together with free fatty acids, 3-hydroxybutyrate and ace- toacetate are then the most important energy suppliers in many tissues (including heart muscle). Acetone cannot be metabolized and is exhaled via the lungs or excreted with urine. To channel ketone bodies into the energy metabolism, acetoacetate is converted with the help of succinyl CoA into succinic acid and acetoacetyl CoA, whichis brokendown by β-oxidation into acetyl CoA (not shown; see p.180). If the production of ketone bodies exceeds the demand for them outside the liver, there is an increase in the concentration of ketone bodies in the plasma (ketonemia)and they are also eventually excreted in the urine (ketonu- ria). Both phenomena are observed after pro- longed starvation and in inadequately treated diabetes mellitus. Severe ketonuria with ke- toacidosis can cause electrolyte shifts and loss of consciousness, and is therefore life- threatening (ketoacidotic coma). 312 Tissues and organs 4 N A N A CO2 5 3 1 2 3 5 1 2 4 A S A S13 13 A S H + H C H CC O C OH H H H CHH COO H C H CH O H C H CC O C OH H H H C H HCC O H H H H C H COOCC O H H H H C H COOCC OH H H HH Acetyl-CoA-C-acyltransferase 2.3.1.16 Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 4.1.3.5 Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase 4.1.3.4 3-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1.1.1.30 Nonenzymatic reaction Acetacetate Acetone Acetyl CoA CoA Acetyl CoA CoA A.

It promotes the digestion of fats from food by emulsifying them in the small intestine (see p. 2770). The emulsifying com- ponents of bile, apart from phospholipids, mainly consist of bile acids and bile salts (see below). The bile also contains free cho- lesterol, which is excreted in this way (see p. 312). A. Bile acids and bile salts \u0002 Bile acids are steroids consisting of 24 C atoms carrying one carboxylate group and several hydroxyl groups. They are formed from cho- lesterol in the liver via an extensive reaction pathway (top). Cytochrome P450 enzymes in the sER of hepatocytes are involved in many of the steps (seep. 318). Initially, the choles- terol double bond is removed. Monooxyge- nases then introduce one or two additional OH groups into the sterane framework. Fi- nally, the side chain is shortened by three C atoms, and the terminal C atom is oxidized to acarboxylate group. It is importantthatthe arrangementof the Aand Brings is altered from trans to cis dur- ing bile acid synthesis (see p. 54). The result of this is that all of the hydrophilic groups in thebileacids lie on one side of the molecule. Cholesterol, which is weakly amphipathic (top), has a small polar “head” and an ex- tended apolar “tail.” By contrast, the much more strongly amphipathic bile acid mole- cules (bottom) resemble disks with polar top sides and apolar bottom sides. At physiolog- ical pH values, the carboxyl groups are almost completely dissociated and therefore nega- tively charged. Cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, known as the primary bile acids,are quanti- tatively the most important metabolites of cholesterol. After being biosynthesized, they are mostly activated with coenzyme A and then conjugated with glycine or the non-pro- teinogenic amino acid taurine (see p. 62). The acid amides formed in this way are known as conjugated bile acids or bile salts.They are even more amphipathic than the primary products. Deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid are only formed in the intestine by enzymatic cleavage of the OH group at C-7 (see B). They are therefore referred to as secondary bile acids. B. Metabolism of bile salts \u0002 Bile salts are exclusively synthesized in the liver (see A). The slowest step in their biosyn- thesis is hydroxylation at position 7 by a 7-- hydroxylase. Cholic acid and other bile acids inhibit this reaction (end-product inhibition). In this way, the bile acids present in the liver regulate the rate of cholesterol utilization. Before leaving the liver, a large proportion of thebileacids areactivated with CoAand then conjugated with the amino acids glycine or taurine (2;cf. A). In this way, cholic acid gives rise to glycocholic acid and taurocholic acid. The liver bile secreted by the liver be- comes denser in the gallbladder as a result of the removal of water (bladder bile; 3). Intestinal bacteria produce enzymes that can chemically alter the bile salts (4). The acid amide bond in the bile salts is cleaved, and dehydroxylation at C-7 yields the corre- sponding secondary bile acids from the pri- mary bile acids (5). Most of the intestinal bile acids are resorbed again in the ileum (6)and returned to the liver via the portal vein (en- terohepatic circulation). In the liver, the sec- ondary bile acids give rise to primary bile acids again, from which bile salts are again produced. Of the 15–30g bile salts that are released with the bile per day, only around 0.5g therefore appears in the feces. This ap- proximately corresponds to the amount of daily de novo synthesis of cholesterol. Further information Thecholesterol excreted with thebileis poorly water-soluble. Together with phos- pholipids and bile acids, it forms micelles (see p. 270), which keep it in solution. If the proportions of phospholipids, bile acids and cholesterol shift, gallstones can arise. These mainly consist of precipitated cholesterol (cholesterol stones), but can also contain Ca 2+ salts of bile acids and bile pigments (pig- ment stones). 314 Tissues and organs R 6 5 4 3 2 1 37 12 3 HO OH OH C NCOO O H HO OH OH C N O H SO3 CD AB HO CD AB HO COO OH OH A.

These substances can be natural in origin, or may have been synthetically pro- duced by humans. Many of these substances are toxic, particularly at high concentrations. However, thebodyhas effectivemechanisms for inactivating and then excreting foreign substances through biotransformations. The mechanisms of biotransformation are similar to those with which endogenous substances such as bile pigments and steroid hormones are enzymatically converted. Biotransforma- tions mainly take place in the liver. A. Biotransformations \u0002 Phase I reactions (interconversion reactions). Type I reactions introduce functional groups into inert, apolar molecules or alter functional groups that are already present. In many cases, this is what first makes it possible for foreign substances to conjugate with polar molecules via phase II reactions (see below). Phase I reactions usually reduce the biological activity or toxicity of a substance (“detoxifica- tion”). However, some substances only be- come biologically active as a result of the interconversion reaction (see, for example, benzo[a]pyrene, p. 256) or become more toxic after interconversion than the initial sub- stance (“toxification”). Important phase I biotransformation reac- tions include: • Hydrolytic cleavages of ether,ester,and peptide bonds. Example (1)shows hydrol- ysis of the painkiller acetylsalicylic acid. • Oxidations. Hydroxylations, epoxide for- mation, sulfoxide formation, dealkylation, deamination. For example, benzene is oxi- dized into phenol, and toluene (methylben- zene) is oxidized into benzoic acid. • Reductions. Reduction of carbonyl, azo-, or nitro- compounds, dehalogenation. • Methylations. Example (2) illustrates the inactivation of the catecholamine norepi- nephrine by methylation of a phenolic OH group (see p. 334). • Desulfurations. Thereactions take placein the hepatocytes on the smooth endoplas- mic reticulum. Most oxidation reactions are catalyzed by cytochrome P450 systems (see p. 318). These monooxygenases are induced by their substrates and show wide specificity. The substrate-specific enzymes of the ste- roid metabolism (see p. 376) are exceptions to this. Phase II reactions (conjugate formation). Type II reactions couple their substrates (bilirubin, steroid hormones, drugs, and products of phase I reactions) via ester or amide bonds to highly polar negatively charged molecules. Theenzymes involved aretransferases, and their products are known as conjugates. The most common type of conjugate for- mation is coupling with glucuronate (GlcUA) as an O-or N-glucuronide. The coenzyme for the reaction is uridine diphosphate glucuro- nate, the “active glucuronate” (see p. 110). Coupling with the polar glucuronate makes an apolar (hydrophobic) molecule more strongly polar, and it becomes suf ciently water-soluble and capable of being excreted. Example (3) shows the glucuronidation of tetrahydrocortisol, a metabolite of the gluco- corticoid cortisol (see p. 374). The biosynthesis of sulfate esters with the help of phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS), the “active sulfate”, (see p. 110) and amide formation with glycine and glutamine also play a role in conjugation. For example, benzoic acid is conjugated with glycine to form themoresoluble and less toxic hippuric acid (N-benzoylglycine; see p. 324). In contrast with unconjugated compounds, theconjugates aremuch morewater-soluble and capable of being excreted. The conjugates are eliminated from the liver either by the biliary route—i. e., by receptor-mediated ex- cretion into the bile—or by the renal route, via the blood and kidneys by filtration. Further information To detoxify heavy metals,the livercontains metallothioneins, a group of cysteine-rich pro- teins with a high af nity for divalent metal ions such as Cd2+,Cu2+,Hg 2+,and Zn 2+.These metal ions also induce the formation of metal- lothioneins via a special metal-regulating el- ement (MRE) in the gene's promoter (see p. 244). 316 Tissues and organs 1 2 H2OCH3-COOH 1 2 3 3 O C CH3 O COO OH COO CH CH2H3N HO OH OH HO CO H HO CH2OH OH O CO H HO CH2OH OH O HO OH OH H H H H COO H CH CH2H3N HO OCH3 OH UDP-GlcUA UDP Conjugate formation: Glucuronidation Esterification with sulfate Amidation with Gly and Glu Foreign substances: Drugs Preservatives Plasticizers Pigments Pesticides etc. Endogenous substances Steroid hormones and other low molecular weight substances Bile pigments Transformation reactions: Hydrolytic cleavage, Epoxide formation Dealkylation Deamination Reduction Methylation Desulfuration Bile Urine Phase II reactions Phase I reactions Transformation product Conjugate Poorly soluble, biologically active, some toxic Water soluble, inactive, non-toxic Substrate induction 1.

Biotransformations Substrate induction 317Liver Cytochrome P450 systems During the first phase of biotransformation in the liver, compounds that are weakly chemi- cally reactive are enzymatically hydroxylated (see p. 316). This makes it possible for them to be conjugated with polar substances. The hy- droxylating enzymes are generally mono- oxygenases that contain a heme as the redox- active coenzyme (see p. 106). In the reduced form, the heme can bind carbon monoxide (CO), and it then shows characteristic light absorption at 450 nm. This was what led to this enzyme group being termed cytochrome P450 (Cyt P450). Cyt P450 systems are also involved in many other metabolic processes—e. g., the biosyn- thesis of steroid hormones (see p. 172), bile acids (see p. 314), and eicosanoids (see p. 390), as well as the formation of unsatu- rated fatty acids (see p. 409). The liver’s red- dish-brown color is mainly due to the large amountsof P450 enzymesitcontains. A. Cytochrome P450-dependent mono oxy- genases: reactions \u0002 Cyt P450-dependent monooxygenases cata- lyze reductive cleavage of molecular oxygen (O2). One of the two oxygen atoms is trans- ferred to the substrate, while the other is re- leased as a water molecule. The necessary re- ducing equivalents are transferred to the actual monooxygenase by an FAD-containing auxili- ary enzyme from the coenzyme NADPH+H +. Cyt P450 enzymes occur in numerous forms in the liver, steroid-producing glands, and other organs. The substrate specificity of liver enzymes is low. Apolar compounds con- taining aliphatic or aromatic rings are partic- ularly easily converted. These include endog- enoussubstancessuch assteroid hormones, as well as medical drugs, which are inacti- vated by phase I reactions. This is why Cyt P450 enzymes are of particular interest in pharmacology. The degradation of ethanol in the liver is also partly catalyzed by Cyt P450 enzymes (the “microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system”; see p. 304). As alcohol and drugs are brokendownby the same enzyme system, the effects of alcoholic drinks and medical drugscan sometimesbe mutually en- hancing—even sometimes to the extent of becoming life-threatening. Only a few examples of the numerous Cyt P450-dependent reactions are shown here. Hydroxylation of aromatic rings (a)plays a central part in the metabolism of medicines and steroids. Aliphatic methyl groups can also be oxidized to hydroxyl groups (b). Epoxi- dation of aromatics (c)by Cyt P450 yields products that are highly reactive and often toxic. For example, the mutagenic effect of benzo[a]pyrene (see p. 244) is based on this type of interconversion in the liver. In Cyt P450 dependent dealkylations (d), alkyl sub- stituents of O, N, or S atoms are released as aldehydes. B. Reaction mechanism \u0003 The course of Cyt P450 catalysis is in principle well understood. The most important func- tion of the heme group consists of converting molecular oxygen into an especially reactive atomic form, which is responsible for all of the reactions described above. [1] In the resting state, the heme iron is trivalent. Initially, the substrate binds near the heme group. [2] Transfer of an electron from FADH2 re- duces the iron to the divalent form that is able to bind an O2 molecule (2). [3] Transfer of a second electron and a change in the valence of the iron reduce the bound O2 to the peroxide. [4] A hydroxyl ion is now cleaved from this intermediate. Uptake of a proton gives rise to H2Oand the reactiveform of oxygen men- tioned above. In this ferryl radical, the iron is formally tetravalent. [5] The activated oxygen atom inserts itself into a C–H bond in the substrate, thereby forming an OH group. [6] Dissociation of the product returns the enzyme to its initial state. 318 Tissues and organs HO AF P AN S Fe3 O OH S Fe3 O O S Fe2 S Fe3 H OS Fe4 H O S Fe3 AF P AN e e H O2 H 1 2 34 5 6 H H H AF OO P AN AF P AN H Fe 2H 1 H2O (H ) O O R O CH3 O CH2 R HO C R HO O O CH2 O H O R O H 1 H H2O A.

Reaction mechanism 319Liver Ethanol metabolism A. Blood ethanol level \u0002 Ethanol (EtOH, “alcohol”) naturally occurs in fruit in small quantities. Alcoholic drinks containmuchhigher concentrations. Their alcohol content is usually given as percent by volume. To estimate alcohol uptake and the blood alcohol level, it is useful to convert the amount to grams of ethanol (density 0.79 kg L –1). For example, a bottle of beer (0.5 L at 4% v/v alcohol) contains 20 mL = 16 g of ethanol, while a bottle of wine (0.7 L at 12% v/v alcohol) contains 84 mL = 66 g ethanol. Ethanol is membrane-permeable and is quickly resorbed. The maximum blood level is already reached within 60–90 min after drinking. The resorption rate depends on var- ious conditions, however. An empty stomach, a warm drink (e. g., mulled wine), and the presence of sugar and carbonic acid (e. g., in champagne) promote ethanol resorption, whereas a heavy meal reduces it. Ethanol is rapidly distributed throughout the body. A largeamountis taken up by themuscles and brain, but comparatively little by adipose tis- sue and bones. Roughly 70% of the body is accessible to alcohol. Complete resorption of the ethanol contained in one bottle of beer (16 g) by a person weighing 70 kg (distribu- tion in 70 kg 70/100 = 49 kg) leads to a blood alcohol level of 0.33 per thousand (7.2 mM). The lethal concentration of alcohol is approximately 3.5 per thousand (76 mM). B. Ethanol metabolism \u0002 The major site of ethanol degradation is the liver, although the stomach is also able to me- tabolize ethanol. Most ethanol is initially oxi- dized by alcohol dehydrogenase to form etha- nal (acetaldehyde). A further oxidization, cata- lyzed by aldehyde dehydrogenase, leads to ace- tate. Acetate is then converted with the help of acetate-CoA ligase to form acetyl CoA,using ATP and providing a link to the intermediary metabolism. In addition to cytoplasmic alco- hol dehydrogenase, catalase and inducible microsomal alcohol oxidase (“MEOS”; see p. 318) also contribute to a lesser extent to etha- nol degradation. Many of the enzymes men- tioned above are induced by ethanol. The rate of ethanol degradation in the liver is limited by alcohol dehydrogenase activity. The amount of NAD + available is the limiting factor. As the maximum degradation rate is already reached at low concentrations of ethanol, the ethanol level therefore declines at a constant rate (zero-order kinetics). The calorific value of ethanol is 29.4 kJ g–1.Alco- holic drinks—particularly in alcoholics—can therefore represent a substantial proportion of dietaryenergyintake. C. Liver damage due to alcohol \u0002 Alcohol is a socially accepted drug of abuse in Western countries. Due to the high potential for addiction to develop, however, it is ac- tually a “hard” drug and has a much larger number of victims than the opiate drugs, for example. In the brain, ethanol is deposited in membranes due to its amphipathic proper- ties, and it influences receptors for neuro- transmitters (see p. 352). The effect of GABA is enhanced, while that of glutamate declines. High ethanol consumption over many years leads to liver damage. For a healthy man, the limit is about 60 g per day, and for a woman about 50 g. However, these values are strongly dependent on body weight, health status, and other factors. Ethanol-related high levels of NADH+H + and acetyl-CoA in the liver lead to increased synthesis of neutral fats and cholesterol. However, since the export of these in the form of VLDLs (see p. 278) is reduced due to alcohol, storage of lipids occurs (fatty liver). This increase in the fat content of the liver (from less than 5% to more than 50% of the dry weight) is initially reversible. However, in chronic alcoholism the hepatocytes are in- creasingly replaced by connective tissue. When liver cirrhosis occurs, the damage to the liver finally reaches an irreversible stage, characterized by progressive loss of liver functions. 320 Tissues and organs PP P A P A P P A S N A PP N A O2 2 H2O N A N AN AN A ‚MEOS‘ [Cyt P-450] A S Vol.% 10 6 0,0 [‰] 1,0 0,5 54321 [h] 20 30 40 C O CH H H HC C O H H H H H HC C H H O H O C O CH H H 1 2 3 1 2 3 Water A.

Liver damage due to alcohol 321Liver Kidney: functions A. Functions of the kidneys \u0001 The kidneys’ main function is excretion of water and water-soluble substances (1). This is closely associated with their role in regulat- ing the body’s electrolyte and acid–base bal- ance (homeostasis, 2; see pp. 326 and 328). Both excretion and homeostasis are subject to hormonal control. The kidneys are also in- volved in synthesizing several hormones (3; see p. 315). Finally, the kidneys also play a role in the intermediary metabolism (4), particu- larly in amino acid degradation and gluconeo- genesis (see p. 154). The kidneys are extremely well-perfused organs, with about 1500 L of blood flowing through them every day. Approximately 180 L of primary urine is filtered out of this. Re- moval of water leads to extreme concentra- tion of the primary urine (to approximately one-hundredth of the initial volume). As a result, only a volume of 0.5–2.0 L of final urine is excreted per day. B. Urine formation \u0002 The functional unit of the kidney is the neph- ron. It is made up of the Malpighian bodies or renal corpuscles (consisting of Bowman’s cap- sules and the glomerulus), the proximal tu- bule, Henle’s loop, and the distal tubule, which passes into a collecting duct. The hu- man kidney contains around one million nephrons. The nephrons form urine in the following three phases. Ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltration of the blood plasma in the glomerulus gives rise to primary urine, which is isotonic with plasma. The pores in the glomerular basal membrane, which are made up of type IV collagen (see p. 344), have an effective mean diameter of 2.9 nm. This al- lows all plasma components with a molecular mass of up to about 15 kDa to pass through unhindered. At increasing masses, molecules are progressively held back; at masses greater than 65 kDa, they are completely unable to enter the primary urine. This applies to almost all plasma proteins—which in addition, being anions, are repelled by the negative charge in the basal membrane. Resorption. All low-molecular weight plasma components enter the primary urine via glomerular filtration. Most of these are transported back into the blood by resorption, to prevent losses of valuable metabolites and electrolytes. In the proximal tubule, organic metabolites (e. g., glucose and other sugars, amino acids, lactate, and ketone bodies) are recovered by secondary active transport (see p. 220). There are several group-specific transport systems for resorbing amino acids, with which hereditary diseases can be associated (e. g., cystinuria, glycinuria, and Hartnup’s disease). HCO3–,Na +,phophate, and sulfate are also resorbed by ATP-depend- ent (active) mechanisms in the proximal tu- bule. The later sections of the nephron mainly serve for additional water recovery and regu- lated resorption of Na + and Cl – (see pp. 326, 328). These processes are controlled by hor- mones (aldosterone, vasopressin). Secretion. Some excretable substances are released into the urine by active transport in the renal tubules. These substances include H + and K+ ions, urea, and creatinine, as well as drugssuch aspenicillin. Clearance. Renal clearance is used as a quan- titative measure of renal function. It is defined as the plasma volume cleared of a given sub- stance per unit of time. Inulin, a fructose poly- saccharide with a mass of ca. 6 kDa (see p. 40) that is neither actively excreted nor resorbed butisfreely filtered, hasa clearanceof 120mL min –1 in healthy individuals. Further information Concentrating urine and transporting it through membranes are processes that re- quire large amounts of energy. The kidneys therefore have very high energy demands. In the proximal tubule, the ATP needed is ob- tained from oxidative metabolism of fatty acids, ketone bodies, and several amino acids. To a lesser extent, lactate, glycerol, and citric acid arealso used. In thedistaltubuleand Henle’s loop, glucose is the main substrate for the energy metabolism. The endothelial cells in the proximal tubule are also capable of gluconeogenesis. The substrates for this are mainly the carbohydrate skeletons of amino acids. Their amino groups are used as ammo- nia for buffering urine (see p. 311). Enzymes for peptide degradation and the amino acid metabolism occur in the kidneys at high lev- els of activity (e. g., amino acid oxidases, amine oxidases, glutaminase). 322 Tissues and organs HV NH3 Resorption Regulated secretion Secretion Regulated resorption Ultra- filtration All solute plasma components smaller than 3 nm = 15 kDa Glomerulus Bowman’s capsule Efferent arteriole Afferent arteriole Ultrafiltration Secretion Drugs Uric acid Creatinine K H Resorption Glucose Amino acids Lactate 2-Oxoacids Na , K , Ca2 , Mg2 Water, etc. Cl , SO4 , HPO4, 22 Erythropoietin Calcitriol 4.

Urine \u0002 Water and water-soluble compounds are ex- creted with the urine. The volume and com- position of urine are subject to wide variation anddependon foodintake, body weight, age, sex, and living conditions such as tempera- ture, humidity, physical activity, and health status. As there is a marked circadian rhythm in urine excretion, the amount of urine and its composition are usually given relative to a 24- hour period. A human adult produces 0.5–2.0 L urine per day, around 95% of which consists of water. The urine usually has a slightly acidic pH value (around 5.8). However, the pH value of urine is strongly affected by metabolic sta- tus. After ingestion of large amounts of plant food, it can increase to over 7. B. Organic components \u0002 Nitrogen-containing compounds are among the most important organic components of urine. Urea, which is mainly synthesized in the liver (urea cycle; see p. 182), is the form in which nitrogen atoms from amino acids are excreted. Breakdown of pyrimidine bases also produces a certain amount of urea (see p. 190). When the nitrogen balance is con- stant, as much nitrogen is excreted as is taken up (see p. 174), and the amount of urea in the urine therefore reflects protein degradation: 70 g protein in food yields approximately 30 g urea in the urine. Uric acid is the end product of the purine metabolism. When uric acid excretion via the kidneysisdisturbed, gout can develop(see p. 190). Creatinine is derived from the muscle metabolism, where it arises spontaneously and irreversibly by cyclization of creatine and creatine phosphate (see p. 336). Since the amount of creatinine an individual ex- cretes per day is constant (it is directly pro- portional to muscle mass), creatinine as an endogenous substance can be used to mea- sure the glomerular filtration rate. The amount of amino acids excreted in free form is strongly dependent on the diet and on the ef ciency of liver function. Amino acid deriv- atives are also found in the urine (e. g., hippu- rate, a detoxification product of benzoic acid). Modified amino acids, which occur in special proteins such as hydroxyproline in collagen and 3-methylhistidine in actin and myosin, can be used as indicators of the degradation of these proteins. Other components of the urine are conju- gates with sulfuric acid, glucuronic acid, gly- cine, and other polar compounds that are synthesized in the liver by biotransformation (see p. 316). In addition, metabolites of many hormones (catecholamines, steroids, seroto- nin) also appear in the urine and can provide information about hormone production. The proteohormone chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, mass ca. 36 kDa), which is formed at the onset of pregnancy, appears in the urine due to its relatively small size. Evidence of hCG in the urine providesthe basisfor an immunological pregnancy test. The yellow color of urine is due to uro- chromes, which are related to the bile pig- ments produced by hemoglobin degradation (see p. 194). If urine is left to stand long enough, oxidation of the urochromes may lead to a darkening in color. C. Inorganic components \u0002 The main inorganic components of the urine are the cations Na +,K+,Ca 2+,Mg 2+,and NH4+ and the anions Cl –,SO42–,and HPO42–,as well as traces of other ions. In total, Na + and Cl – represent about two-thirds of all the electro- lytes in the final urine. Calcium and magne- sium occur in the feces in even larger quanti- ties. The amounts of the various inorganic components of the urine also depend on the composition of the diet. For example, in acidosis there can be a marked increase in the excretion of ammonia (see p. 326). Excre- tion of Na+,K+,Ca 2+,and phosphatevia the kidneysissubject to hormonal regulation (see p. 330). Further information Shifts in the concentrations of the physiolog- ical components of the urine and the appear- ance of pathological urine components can be used to diagnose diseases. Important exam- ples are glucose and ketone bodies, which are excreted to a greater extent in diabetes mellitus (see p. 160). 324 Tissues and organs Cl 120-240 2HPO4 10-40 2SO4 30-60 NH4 30-50 Na 100 -150 K 60-80 Mg2 3-6 Ca2 4-11 C C N H C HN C N H C H N O O O C N H COO O NH2 O C H2C N C NH2 O H3C C O N CN H2C H3CNH2 H2N C NH2 O 24-h urine A.

Organic constituents Ketone bodies < 3 g Dissociation dependent on pH 325Kidney Functions in the acid–base balance Along with the lungs, the kidneys are partic- ularly involved in keeping the pH value of the extracellular fluid constant (see p. 288). The contribution made by the kidneys particularly involves resorbing HCO3– and actively excret- ing protons. A. Proton excretion \u0002 The renal tubule cells are capable of secreting protons (H +) from the blood into the urine against a concentration gradient, despite the fact that the H + concentrationinthe urine is up to a thousand times higher than in the blood. To achieve this, carbon dioxide (CO2) is taken up from the blood and—together with water (H2O) and with the help of carbonate dehydratase (carbonic anhydrase, [1])—con- verted into hydrogen carbonate (“bicarbo- nate,” HCO3–)and one H+. Formally, this yields carbonic acid H2CO3 as an intermediate, but it is not released during the reaction. The hydrogen carbonate formed in car- bonic anhydrase returns to the plasma, where it contributes to the blood’s base reserve. The proton is exported into the urine by secondary active transport in antiport for Na + (bottom right). The driving force for proton excretion, as in other secondary active processes, is the Na + gradient established by the ATPase in- volved in the Na +/K + exchange (“Na +/K + AT- Pase”, see p. 220). This integral membrane proteinonthe basalside (towards the blood) of tubule cells keeps the Na + concentration in the tubule cell low, thereby maintaining Na + inflow. In addition to this secondary active H + transport mechanism, there is a V-type H +- transporting ATPase in the distal tubule and collecting duct (see p. 220). An important function of the secreted H + ions is to promote HCO3- resorption (top right). Hydrogen carbonate, the most impor- tant buffering base in the blood, passes into the primary urine quantitatively, like all ions. In the primary urine, HCO3– reacts with H+ ions to form water and CO2,which returns by free diffusion to the tubule cells and from there into the blood. In this way, the kidneys also influence the CO2/HCO3– buffering bal- ance in the plasma. B. Ammonia excretion \u0002 Approximately 60 mmol of protons are ex- creted with the urine every day. Buffering systems in the urine catch a large proportion of the H + ions, so that the urine only becomes weakly acidic (down to about pH 4.8). An important buffer in the urine is the hydrogen phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate system (HPO42–/H2PO4–). In addition, ammo- nia also makes a vital contribution to buffer- ing the secreted protons. Since plasma concentrations of free am- monia are low, the kidneys release NH3 from glutamine and other amino acids. At 0.5–0.7 mM, glutamine is the most important amino acid in the plasma and is the preferred form for ammonia transport in the blood. The kidneys take up glutamine, and with the help of glutaminase [4], initially release NH3 from the amide bond hydrolytically. From the glu- tamate formed, a second molecule of NH3 can be obtained by oxidative deamination with the help of glutamate dehydrogenase [5] (see p. 178). The resulting 2-oxoglutarate is fur- ther metabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Several other amino acids—alanine in particular, as well as serine, glycine, and aspartate—can also serve as suppliers of am- monia. Ammonia can diffuse freely into the urine through the tubule membrane, while the am- monium ions that are formed in the urine are charged and can no longer return to the cell. Acidic urine therefore promotes ammonia ex- cretion, which is normally 30–50 mmol per day. In metabolic acidosis (e. g., during fasting or in diabetes mellitus), after a certain time increased induction of glutaminase occurs in the kidneys, resulting in increased NH3 excre- tion. This in turn promotes H + release and thus counteracts the acidosis. By contrast, when the plasma pH value shifts towards alkaline values (alkalosis), renal excretion of ammonia is reduced. 326 Tissues and organs H2O NH3 NH3 HCO3 CO2 CO2 HCO3 H H2O H2O N A NH4 3Na 2K A PPP A PP P 3Na 2K H NH4 3 4 1 2 4 3 H2O N A NaNa H HCO3 CO2 1 1 2 H Na /K -exchanging ATPase 3.6.1.37 Secondary active transport of H Blood plasma Tubule cell From the final urine Tricarboxylic acid cycle Diffusion Ala Ser Gly Asp Amino acid with the highest plasma concentration 2-Oxoglutarate Glutamine Glutamine Glutamate Glutamate Glutaminase 3.5.1.2 Glutamat- Dehydrogenase 1.4.1.2 Excretion of 30 – 50 mmol/day A.

Electrolyte and water recycling \u0002 Electrolytes and other plasma components with low molecular weights enter the primary urine by ultrafiltration (right). Most of these substances are recovered by energy-depen- dent resorption (see p. 322). The extent of the resorption determines the amount that ultimately reaches the final urine and is ex- creted. The illustration does not take into ac- count the zoning of transport processes in the kidney (physiology textbooks may be referred to for further details). Calcium and phosphate ions. Calcium (Ca 2+) and phosphate ions are almost com- pletely resorbed from the primary urine by active transport (i. e., inanATP-dependent fashion). The proportion of Ca2+ resorbed is over 99%, while for phosphate the figure is 80–90%. The extent to which these two elec- trolytes are resorbed is regulated by the three hormones parathyrin, calcitonin, and calci- triol. The peptide hormone parathyrin (PTH), which is produced by the parathyroid gland, stimulates Ca 2+ resorption in the kidneys and at thesametime inhibits the resorption of phosphate. In conjunction with the effects of this hormone in the bones and intestines (see p. 344), this leads to an increase in the plasma level of Ca 2+ and a reductioninthe levelof phosphate ions. Calcitonin, a peptide produced in the C cells of the thyroid gland, inhibits the resorption of both calcium and phosphate ions. The result is an overall reductioninthe plasma level of both ions. Calcitonin is thus a parathyrin antago- nist relative to Ca 2+. The steroid hormone calcitriol, which is formed in the kidneys (see p. 304), stimulates the resorption of both calcium and phosphate ions and thus increases the plasma level of both ions. Sodium ions. Controlled resorption of Na + from the primary urine is one of the most important functions of the kidney. Na + resorp- tion is highly effective, with more than 97% being resorbed. Several mechanisms are in- volved: some of the Na + is taken up passively in theproximal tubulethrough thejunctions between the cells (paracellularly). In addition, there is secondary active transport together with glucose and amino acids (see p. 322). These two pathways are responsible for 60–70% of total Na + resorption. In the ascend- ingpartofHenle’s loop,there is another transporter (shown at the bottom right), which functions electroneutrally and takes up one Na + ion and one K+ ion together with two Cl – ions. This symport is also dependent on the activity of Na +/K + ATPase [2], which pumps the Na + resorbed from the primary urine back into the plasma in exchange for K +. The steroid hormone aldosterone (see p. 55) increases Na + reuptake, particularly in the distal tubule, while atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) originating from the cardiac atrium reduces it. Among other effects, aldo- sterone induces Na +/K + ATPase and various Na + transporters on the luminal side of the cells. Water. Water resorption in the proximal tubule is a passive process in which water follows the osmotically active particles, par- ticularly the Na+ ions. Fine regulation of water excretion (diuresis) takes place in the collect- ing ducts, where the peptide hormone vaso- pressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) operates. This promotes recovery of water by stimulat- ing the transfer of aquaporins (see p. 220) into the plasma membrane of the tubule cells via V2 receptors. A lack of ADH leads to the disease picture of diabetes insipidus, in which up to 30 L of final urine is produced per day. B. Gluconeogenesis \u0002 Apart from the liver, the kidneys are the only organs capable of producing glucose by neosynthesis (gluconeogenesis; see p. 154). The main substrate for gluconeogenesis in the cells of the proximal tubule is glutamine. In addition, other amino acids and also lac- tate, glycerol,and fructose can be used as precursors. As in the liver, the key enzymes for gluconeogenesis are induced by cortisol (see p. 374). Since the kidneys also have a high level of glucose consumption, they only release very little glucose into the blood. 328 Tissues and organs Ca2Ca2 Ca2 NH3 A PPP A PP P H2O NH3 H NH4 H2PO4 H2PO4 H2PO4 1 H2O 3Na 3Na 2K 2K A PP P A PPP 2 Na 2 Cl K 2 Cl 1 2 Free diffusion Blood plasma Tubule cell Urine Gluconeogenesis Glucose Cortisol Glutamine Glycerol Fructose Amino acids Glucose Water follows osmotic gradientVasopressin (adiuretin) 2-Oxoglutarate Glutamine A.

Renal hormones \u0002 In addition to their involvement in excretion and metabolism, the kidneys also have endo- crine functions. They produce the hormones erythropoietin and calcitriol and play a deci- sive part in producing the hormone angioten- sin II by releasing the enzyme renin. Renal prostaglandins (see p. 390) have a local effect on Na + resorption. Calcitriol (vitamin D hormone, 1α,25-dihy- droxycholecalciferol) is a hormone closely re- lated to the steroids that is involved in Ca2+ homeostasis (see p. 342). In the kidney, it is formed from calcidiol by hydroxylation at C-1. The activity of calcidiol-1-monooxygenase [1] is enhanced by the hormone parathyrin (PTH). Erythropoietin is a peptide hormone that is formed predominantly by the kidneys, but also by the liver. Together with other factors known as “colony-stimulating factors” (CSF; see p. 392), it regulates the differentiation of stem cells in thebonemarrow. Erythropoietin release is stimulated by hy- poxia (low pO2). Within hours, the hormone ensures that erythrocyte precursor cells in the bone marrow are converted to erythrocytes, so that their numbers in the blood increase. Renal damage leads to reduced erythropoie- tin release, whichinturnresults in anemia. Forms of anemia with renal causes can now be successfully treated using erythropoietin produced by genetic engineering techniques. The hormone is also administered to dialysis patients. Among athletes and sports profes- sionals, there have been repeated cases of erythropoietin being misused for doping pur- poses. B. Renin–angiotensin system \u0002 The peptide hormone angiotensin II is not synthesized in a hormonal gland, but in the blood. The kidneys take part in this process by releasing the enzyme renin. Renin [2] is an aspartate proteinase (see p. 176). Itisformedby the kidneysasapre- cursor (prorenin), which is proteolytically activated into renin and released into the blood. In the blood plasma, renin acts on angiotensinogen, a plasma glycoprotein in the α2-globulin group (see p. 276), which like almost all plasma proteins is synthesized in the liver. The decapeptide cleaved off by renin is called angiotensin I. Further cleavage by peptidyl dipeptidase A (angiotensin-con- verting enzyme, ACE), a membrane enzyme located on the vascular endothelium in the lungs and other tissues, gives rise to the octapeptide angiotensin II [3], which acts as a hormone and neurotransmitter. The lifespan of angiotensin II in the plasma is only a few minutes, as it is rapidly broken down by other peptidases (angiotensinases [4]), which occur in many different tissues. The plasma level of angiotensin II is mainly determined by therateatwhich renin is re- leased by the kidneys. Renin is synthesized by juxtaglomerular cells, which release it when sodium levels decline or there is a fall in blood pressure. Effects of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II has effects on the kidneys, brain stem, pituitary gland, adrenal cortex, blood vessel walls, and heart via membrane-located receptors. It in- creases blood pressure by triggering vasocon- striction (narrowing of the blood vessels). In the kidneys, it promotes the retention of Na+ and water and reduces potassium secretion. In the brain stem and at nerve endings in the sympathetic nervous system, the effects of angiotensin II lead to increased tonicity (neu- rotransmitter effect). In addition, it triggers the sensation of thirst. In the pituitary gland, angiotensin II stimulates vasopressin release (antidiuretic hormone) and corticotropin (ACTH) release. In the adrenal cortex, it in- creases the biosynthesis and release of aldo- sterone, which promotes sodium and water retention in the kidneys. All of the effects of angiotensin II lead directly or indirectly to increased blood pressure, as well as increased sodium and water retention. This important hormonal system for blood pressure regula- tion can be pharmacologically influenced by inhibitors at various points: • Using angiotensinogen analogs that inhibit renin. • Using angiotensin I analogs that competi- tively inhibit the enzyme ACE [3]. • Using hormone antagonists that block the binding of angiotensin II to its receptors. 330 Tissues and organs pO2 1 25 31 OH HO CH2 OH A.

In addition to the skeletal muscles, which can be contracted voluntarily, there are also the autonomically activated heart muscle and smooth muscle, which is also involuntary. In all types of muscle, contraction is based on an interplay between the proteins actin and myosin. A. Organization of skeletal muscle \u0002 Striated muscle consists of parallel bundles of muscle fibers. Each fiber is a single large mul- tinucleate cell. The cytoplasm in these cells contains myofibrils 2–3 µm thick that can ex- tend over the full length of the muscle fiber. The striation of themusclefibers is charac- teristic of skeletal muscle. It results from the regular arrangement of molecules of differing density. The repeating contractile units, the sarcomeres, are bounded by Z lines from which thin filaments of F-actin (see p. 204) extend on each side. In the A bands, there are also thick parallel filaments of myosin. The H bands in the middle of the A bands only contain myosin, while only actin is found on each size of the Z lines. Myosin is quantitatively the most impor- tant protein in the myofibrils, representing 65% of the total. It is shaped like a golf club (bottom right). The molecule is a hexamer consisting of two identical heavy chains (2 × 223 kDa) and four light chains (each about 20 kDa). Each of the two heavy chains has a globular “head” at its amino end, which extends into a “tail” about 150 nm long in which the two chains are intertwined to form a superhelix. The small subunits are at- tached in the head area. Myosin is present as a bundle of several hundred stacked molecules in the form of a “thick myosin filament.” The head portion of the molecule acts as an ATPase, the activity of which is modulated by the small subunits. Actin (42 kDa) is the most important com- ponent of the “thin filaments.” It represents ca. 20–25% of the muscle proteins. F-actin is also an important component of the cytoskeleton (see p. 204). This filamentous polymer is held in equilibrium with its monomer, G-actin. The other protein components of muscle include tropomyosin and troponin. Tropomyosin (64 kDa) attaches to F-actin as a rod-like dimer and connects approximately seven ac- tin units with each other. The heterotrimer troponin (78 kDa) is bound to one end of tropomyosin. In addition to the above proteins, a number of other proteins are also typical of muscle—including titin (the largest known protein), - and -actinin, desmin, and vimentin. B. Mechanism of muscle contraction \u0002 The sliding filament model describes the mechanism involved in muscle contraction. In this model, sarcomeres become shorter when the thin and thick filaments slide along- side each other and telescope together, with ATP being consumed. During contraction, the following reaction cycle is repeated several times: [1 ] In the initial state, the myosin heads are attached to actin. When ATP is bound, the heads detach themselves from the actin (the “plasticizing” effect of ATP). [2 ] The myosin head hydrolyzes the bound ATP to ADP and Pi, but initially withholds the two reaction products. ATP cleavage leads to allosteric tension in the myosin head. [3 ] The myosin head now forms a new bond with a neighboring actin molecule. [4 ] The actin causes the release of the Pi, and shortly afterwards release of the ADP as well. This converts the allosteric tension in the myosin head into a conformational change that acts like a rowing stroke. Thecycle can berepeated for as long as ATP is available, so that the thick filaments are constantly moving along the thin filaments in the direction of the Z disk. Each rowing stroke of the 500 or so myosin heads in a thick filament produces a contraction of about 10 nm.Duringstrongcontraction,the process is repeated about five times per second. This leads to the whole complex of thin filaments moving together; the H band becomes shorter and the Z lines slide closer together. 332 Tissues and organs OOC OOC NH3 NH3 ZZ Z P P A A PP P P H2O ATP A.

Neuromuscular junction \u0002 Muscle contraction is triggered by motor neurons that release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (see p. 352). The transmitter dif- fuses through the narrow synaptic cleft and binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the plasma membrane of the muscle cell (the sarcolemma), thereby opening the ion channels integrated into the receptors (see p. 222). This leads to an inflow of Na +,which triggers an action potential (see p. 350) in the sarcolemma. The action potential propagates from the end plate in all directions and con- stantly stimulates the muscle fiber. With a delay of a few milliseconds, the contractile mechanism responds to this by contracting themusclefiber. B. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) \u0002 The action potential (A) produced at the neu- romuscular junction is transferred in the muscle cell into a transient increase in the Ca 2+ concentrationinthe cytoplasm of the muscle fiber (the sarcoplasm). In the resting state, the Ca 2+ level in the sarcoplasm is very low (less than 10 –7 M). By contrast, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which corresponds to the ER, contains Ca2+ ions at a concentration of about 10 –3 M. The SR is a branched organelle that surrounds the myofibrils like a net stocking inside the muscle fibers (illustrated at the top using the example of a heart muscle cell). The high Ca 2+ level in the SR is maintained by Ca 2+- transporting ATPases (see p. 220). In addition, the SR also contains calsequestrin, aprotein (55 kDa) thatisabletobindnumerousCa 2+ - ions via acidic amino acid residues. The transfer of the action potential to the SR is made possible by transverse tubules (T tu- bules), which are open to the extracellular space and establish a close connection with the SR. There is a structure involved in the contact be- tween the T tubule and the SR that was formerly known as the “SR foot” (it involves parts of the ryanodine receptor; see p. 386). At the point of contact with the SR, the action potential triggers the opening of the Ca 2+ channels on the surface of the sarco- lemma. Calcium ions then leave the SR and enter the sarcoplasm, where they lead to a rapid increase in Ca 2+ concentrations. This in turn causes the myofibrils to contract (C). C. Regulation by calcium ions \u0002 In relaxed skeletal muscle, the complex con- sisting of troponin and tropomyosin blocks the access of the myosin heads to actin (see p. 332). Troponin consists of three different subunits (T, C,and I). The rapid increase in cytoplasmic Ca 2+ concentrations caused by opening of the calcium channels in the SR leads to binding of Ca 2+ to the C subunit of troponin, which closely resembles calmodulin (see p. 386). This produces a conformational change in troponin that causes the whole tro- ponin–tropomyosin complex to slip slightly and expose a binding site for myosin (red). This initiates the contraction cycle. After con- traction, the sarcoplasmic Ca 2+ concentration is quickly reduced again by active transport back into the SR. This results in troponin los- ing the bound Ca 2+ ions and returning to the initial state, in which the binding site for my- osin on actin isblocked. It isnot yet clear whether the mechanism described above is the only one that triggers binding of myosin to actin. When triggering of contraction in striated muscle occurs, the following sequence of processesthustakes place: 1. The sarcolemma is depolarized. 2. The action potential is signaled to Ca 2+ channels in the SR. 3. The Ca 2+ channels open and the Ca 2+ level in the sarcoplasm increases. 4. Ca 2+ bindstotroponin C andtriggersa conformational change. 5. Troponin causes tropomyosin to slip, and the myosin heads bind to actin. 6. The actin–myosin cycle takes place and the muscle fibers contract. Conversely, at the end of contraction,the fol- lowing processes take place: 1. The Ca 2+ level in the sarcoplasm declines due to transport of Ca 2+ back into the SR. 2. Troponin C loses Ca 2+ and tropomyosin re- turns to its original position on the actin molecule. 3. The actin–myosin cycle stops and the muscle relaxes. 334 Tissues and organs P P A PA PP P Ca2 Ca2 =10-3M P P A PA PP P P P A P A PP P T C I T I Ca2 Ca2 A. Neuromuscular junction C.

With- out constant resynthesis, the amount of ATP available in the resting state would be used up in less than 1 s of contraction. A. Energy metabolism in the white and red muscle fibers \u0002 Muscles contain two types of fibers, the pro- portions of which vary from one type of muscle to another. Red fibers (type I fibers) are suitable for prolonged effort. Their metab- olism is mainly aerobic and therefore depends on an adequate supply of O2. White fibers (type II fibers) are better suited for fast, strong contractions. These fibers are able to form suf cient ATP even when there is little O2 available. With appropriate training, athletes and sports participants are able to change the proportions of the two fiber types in the mus- culature and thereby prepare themselves for the physiological demands of their disciplines in a targeted fashion. The expression of func- tional muscle proteins can also change during thecourseof training. Red fibers provide for their ATP require- ments mainly (but not exclusively) from fatty acids,which arebrokendown via β-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the respira- tory chain (right part of the illustration). The red color in these fibers is due to the mono- meric heme protein myoglobin,which they use as an O2 reserve. Myoglobin has a much higher af nity for O2 than hemoglobin and therefore only releases its O2 when there is asevere drop in O2 partial pressure (cf. p. 282). At a high level of muscular effort—e. g., during weightlifting or in very fast contrac- tionssuch asthose carried out by the eye muscles—the O2 supply from the blood quickly becomes inadequate to maintain the aerobic metabolism. White fibers (left part of the illustration) therefore mainly obtain ATP from anaerobic glycolysis. They have supplies of glycogen from which they can quickly re- lease glucose-1-phosphate when needed (see p. 156). By isomerization, this gives rise to glucose-6-phosphate, the substrate for glycol- ysis. The NADH+H + formed during glycolysis has to be reoxidized into NAD+ in order to maintain glucose degradation and thus ATP formation. If there is a lack of O2,this is achieved by the formation of lactate,which is released into the blood and is resynthesized into glucose in the liver (Cori cycle; see p. 338). Muscle-specific auxiliary reactions for ATP synthesis exist in order to provide additional ATP in case of emergency. Creatine phosphate (see B) acts as a buffer for the ATP level. Another ATP-supplying reaction is catalyzed by adenylate kinase [1] (see also p. 72). This disproportionates two molecules of ADP into ATP and AMP. The AMP is deaminated into IMP in a subsequent reaction [2] in order to shift the balance of the reversible reaction [1] in the direction of ATP formation. B. Creatine metabolism \u0002 Creatine (N-methylguanidoacetic acid) and its phosphorylated form creatine phosphate (a guanidophosphate) serve as an ATP buffer in muscle metabolism. In creatine phosphate, the phosphate residue is at a similarly high chemical potential as in ATP and is therefore easily transferred to ADP. Conversely, when there is an excess of ATP, creatine phosphate can arise from ATP and creatine. Both proce- sses are catalyzed by creatine kinase [5]. In resting muscle, creatine phosphate forms due to the high level of ATP. If there is a risk of a severe drop in the ATP level during contraction, the level can be maintained for a short time by synthesis of ATP from creatine phosphate and ADP. In a nonenzymatic reac- tion [6], small amounts of creatine and crea- tine phosphate cyclize constantly to form cre- atinine, which can no longer be phosphory- lated and is therefore excreted with the urine (see p. 324). Creatine does not derive from the muscles themselves, but is synthesized in two steps in the kidneys and liver (left part of the illustra- tion). Initially, the guanidino group of argi- nine is transferred to glycine in the kidneys, yielding guanidino acetate [3]. In the liver, N-methylation of guanidino acetate leads to the formation of creatine from this [4]. The coenzyme in this reaction is S-adenosyl methi- onine (SAM; see p.110). 336 Tissues and organs A PP P CO2 2+ H2O 2+ N A ATP ADP NADH + H + CO2 1 2 ADPADP N A N A NADH + H + NAD + O2 O2 P P A P A AMP IMP P I NH3 2 4 5 6 3 4 A PP P P P A 6 6 5 1 3 Orn Arg N H2C C O NH C HN 3C P O OHO N H2C C O NH2 C NH2 H3C O N H2C C O NH2 C NH2 H O N H2C C N O C H3CNH2 H O Tricarboxylic acid cycle Cori cycle (liver) Ketone bodies Liver β-Oxidation Myoglobin Glucose Glycolysis A.

Cori and alanine cycle \u0002 Whitemusclefibers(see p. 336) mainlyob- tain ATP from anaerobic glycolysis—i. e., they convert glucose into lactate. The lactate aris- ing in muscle and, in smaller quantities, its precursor pyruvate are released into the blood and transported to the liver, where lac- tate and pyruvate are resynthesized into glu- cose again via gluconeogenesis, with ATP being consumed in the process (see p. 154). The glucose newly formed by the liver returns via the blood to the muscles, where it can be used as an energy source again. This circula- tion system is called the Cori cycle,after the researchers who first discovered it. There is also a very similar cycle for erythrocytes, which do not have mitochondria and there- fore produce ATP by anaerobic glycolysis (see p. 284). The muscles themselves are not capable of gluconeogenesis. Nor would this be useful, as gluconeogenesis requires much more ATP than is supplied by glycolysis. As O2 deficien- cies do not arise in the liver even during in- tensive musclework, thereis always suf - cient energy there available for gluconeogen- esis. There is also a corresponding circulation system for the amino acid alanine. The alanine cycle in the liver not only provides alanine as a precursor for gluconeogenesis, but also transports to the liver the amino nitrogen arising in muscles during protein degrada- tion. In the liver, it is incorporated into urea for excretion. Most of the amino acids that arise in muscle during proteolysis are converted into glutamate and 2-oxo acids by transamination (not shown; cf. p.180). Again by transamina- tion, glutamate andpyruvategiveriseto ala- nine, which after glutamine is the second im- portant form of transport for amino nitrogen in the blood. In the liver, alanine and 2-oxo- glutarate are resynthesized into pyruvate and glutamate(seep. 178). Glutamatesupplies the urea cycle (see p. 182), while pyruvate is available for gluconeogenesis. B. Protein and amino acid metabolism \u0002 The skeletal muscle is the most important site for degradation of the branched-chain amino acids (Val, Leu, Ile; see p. 414), but other amino acids are also broken down in the muscles. Alanine and glutamine are resynthesized from the components and released into the blood. They transport the nitrogen that arises during amino acid breakdown to the liver (alanine cycle; see above) and to the kidneys (see p. 328). During periods of hunger, muscle proteins serve as an energy reserve for the body. They are broken down into amino acids, which are transported to the liver. In the liver, the car- bon skeletons of the amino acids are con- verted into intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle or into acetoacetyl-CoA (see p. 175). These amphibolic metabolites are then avail- able to the energy metabolism and for gluco- neogenesis. After prolonged starvation, the brain switches to using ketone bodies in order to save muscle protein (see p. 356). The synthesis and degradation of muscle proteins are regulated by hormones. Cortisol leads to muscle degradation, while testo- sterone stimulates protein formation. Syn- thetic anabolics with a testosterone-like ef- fect have repeatedly been used for doping purposes or for intensive muscle-building. Further information Smooth muscle differs from skeletal muscle in various ways. Smooth muscles—which are found, for example, in blood vessel walls and in the walls of the intestines—do not contain any muscle fibers. In smooth-muscle cells, which are usually spindle-shaped, the contractile proteins are arranged in a less reg- ular patternthaninstriated muscle. Contrac- tion in this type of muscle is usually not stimulated by nerve impulses, but occurs in alargely spontaneousway. Ca 2+ (in the form of Ca 2+-calmodulin; see p. 386) also activates contraction in smooth muscle; in this case, however, it does not affect troponin, but acti- vates a protein kinase that phosphorylates the light chains in myosin and thereby increases myosin’s ATPase activity. Hormones such as epinephrine and angiotensin II (see p. 330) are able to influence vascular tonicity in this way, for example. 338 Tissues and organs 6 ATP 2 ATP 3 1 2 4 1 2 4 2 N A N A N A N A 33 Testosterone Anabolic agents Glucose 6 Glucose 6 Liver Blood Muscle Glucose Glucose 3.70-5.18 mM Pyruvate 0.02-0.07 mM Lactate 0.74-2.40 mM Amino acids Alanine Alanine 0.33-0.61 mM Glycolysis Transamination Lactate dehydrogenase 1.1.1.27 Gluconeogenesis Storage Glycogen NADH/NAD+ quotient high NADH/NAD+ quotient low Alanine cycle Cori cycle Protein A.

They are spe- cialized to secrete extracellular proteins, par- ticularly collagens, and mineral substances, which they use to build up the extracellular matrix (see p. 346). By contrast, osteoclasts dissolve bone matter again by secreting H + and collagenases (see p. 342). A. Bone \u0002 Bone is an extremely dense, specialized form of connective tissue. In addition to its suppor- tive function, it serves to store calcium and phosphate ions. In addition, blood cells are formed in thebonemarrow. Themost impor- tant mineral component of bone is apatite,a form of crystalline calcium phosphate. Apatites are complexes of cationic Ca 2+ matched by HPO42–,CO32–,OH –,orF – as anions. Depending on the counter-ion, apatite can occur in the forms carbonate apatite Ca10(PO4)6CO3,as hydroxyapatite Ca10(PO4)6 (OH)2,or fluoroapatite Ca10(PO4)6F2.In addi- tion, alkaline earth carbonates also occur in bone. In adults, more than 1 kg calcium is stored in bone. Osteoblast and osteoclast activity is con- stantly incorporating Ca 2+ into bone and re- moving it again. There are various hormones that regulate these processes: calcitonin in- creases deposition of Ca 2+ in thebonematrix, while parathyroid hormone (PTH) promotes the mobilization of Ca 2+,and calcitriol im- proves mineralization (for details, see p. 342). The most important organic components of bone are collagens (mainly type I; see p. 344) and proteoglycans (see p. 346). These form the extracellular matrix into which the apa- tite crystals are deposited (biomineralization). Various proteins are involved in this not yet fully understood process of bone formation, including collagens and phosphatases. Alka- line phosphatase is found in osteoblasts and acid phosphatase in osteoclasts. Both of these enzymes serve as marker enzymes for bone cells. B. Teeth \u0002 The illustration shows a longitudinal section through an incisor, one of the 32 permanent teethinhumans. The majority ofthe tooth consists of dentine. The crown of the tooth extends beyond the gums, and it is covered in enamel. By contrast, the root of the tooth is coated in dental cement. Cement, dentin, and enamel are bone-like substances. The high proportion of inorganic matter they contain (about 97% in the dental enamel) gives them their characteristic hard- ness. The organic components of cement, dentin, and enamel mainly consist of collagens and proteoglycans; their most important min- eral component is apatite, as in bone (see above). A widespread form of dental disease, ca- ries, is caused by acids that dissolve the min- eral part of the teeth by neutralizing the neg- atively charged counter-ions in apatite (see A). Acids occur in food, or are produced by microorganisms that live on the surfaces of the teeth (e. g., Streptococcus mutans). The main product of anaerobic degradation of sugars by these organisms is lactic acid. Other products of bacterial carbohydrate me- tabolism include extracellular dextrans (see p. 40)—insoluble polymers of glucose that help bacteria to protect themselves from their environment. Bacteria and dextrans are com- ponents of dental plaque, which forms on in- adequately cleaned teeth. When Ca 2+ salts and other minerals are deposited in plaque as well, tartar is formed. The most important form of protection against caries involves avoiding sweet sub- stances(foodscontaining saccharose, glucose, and fructose). Small children in particular should not have very sweet drinks freely available to them. Regular removal of plaque by cleaning the teeth and hardening of the dental enamel by fluoridization are also im- portant. Fluoride has a protective effect be- cause fluoroapatite (see A)is particularly re- sistant to acids. 340 Tissues and organs Ca2 Calcitonin Parathyroid hormone Hormones of the calcium metabolism A.

Functions of calcium \u0001 The human body contains 1–1.5 kg Ca 2+,most of which (about 98%) is located in the mineral substance of bone(seep. 362). In addition to its role as a bone component, calcium functions as a signaling substance. Ca 2+ ions act as second messengers in signal transduction pathways (see p. 386), they trigger exocytosis (see p. 228) and muscle contraction (see p. 334), and they are indis- pensable as cofactors in blood coagulation (see p. 290). Many enzymes also require Ca 2+ for their activity. The intracellular and extracel- lular concentrations of Ca 2+ are strictly regu- lated in order to make these functions possi- ble (see B, C, and p. 388). Proteins bind Ca 2+ via oxygen ligands, par- ticularly carboxylate groups and carbonyl groups of peptide bonds. This also applies to the structure illustrated here, in which a Ca2+ ionis coordinated by the oxygenatoms of carboxylate and acid amide groups. B. Bone remodeling \u0002 Deposition of Ca 2+ in bone (mineralization) and Ca 2+ mobilization from bone are regu- lated by at least 15 hormones and hormone- like signaling substances. These mainly influ- ence the maturation and activity of bone cells. Osteoblasts (top) deposit collagen, as well as Ca 2+ and phosphate, and thereby create new bone matter, while osteoclasts (bottom) secrete H + ions and collagenases that locally dissolve bone (bone remodeling). Osteoblasts and osteoclasts mutually activate each other by releasing cytokines (see p. 392) and growth factors. This helps keep bone forma- tion and bone breakdown in balance. The Ca 2+-selective hormones calcitriol, par- athyroid hormone, and calcitonin influence this interaction in the bone cells. Parathyroid hormone promotes Ca 2+ release by promoting the release of cytokines by osteoblasts. In turn, the cytokines stimulate the develop- ment of mature osteoclasts from precursor cells (bottom). Calcitonin inhibits this process. At thesametime, it promotes thedevelop- ment of osteoblasts (top). Osteoporosis, which mainly occurs in women following the men- opause, is based (at least in part) on a reduc- tion in estrogen levels. Estrogens normally inhibit the stimulation of osteoclast differen- tiation by osteoblasts. If the effects of estrogen decline, the osteoclasts predominate and ex- cess bone removal occurs. The effects of the steroid hormone calcitriol (see p. 330)in boneare complex. On theone hand, it promotes bone formation by stimu- lating osteoblast differentiation (top). This is particularly important in small children, in whom calcitriol deficiency can lead to miner- alization disturbances (rickets; see p. 364). On the other hand, calcitriol increases blood Ca 2+ levels through increased Ca 2+ mobilization from bone. An overdose of vitamin D (chole- calciferol), the precursor of calcitriol, can therefore have unfavorable effects on the skeleton similar to those of vitamin deficiency (hypervitaminosis; see p. 364). C. Calcium homeostasis \u0002 Ca 2+ metabolism is balanced in healthy adults. Approximately 1g Ca 2+ is taken up per day, about 300 mg of which is resorbed. The same amount is also excreted again. The amounts of Ca 2+ released from bone and deposited in it per day are much smaller. Milk and milk prod- ucts, especially cheese, are particularly rich in calcium. Calcitriol and parathyroid hormone, on the one hand, and calcitonin on the other, ensure a more or less constant level of Ca 2+ in the blood plasma and in the extracellular space (80–110 mg 2.0–2.6 mM). The peptide para- thyroid hormone (PTH; 84 AA) and the steroid calcitriol (see p. 374) promote direct or indi- rect processes that raise the Ca 2+ level in blood. Calcitriol increases Ca 2+ resorption in the intestines and kidneys by inducing trans- porters. Parathyroid hormone supports these processes by stimulating calcitriol biosynthe- sisin the kidneys(see p. 330). In addition, it directly promotes resorption of Ca 2+ in the kidneys (see p. 328) and Ca 2+ release from bone (see B). The PTH antagonist calcitonin (32 AA) counteracts these processes. 342 Tissues and organs CO2 Ca2 HCO3 H H2O H Ca2 Ca2 Ca2 A.

They form insoluble tensile fibers that occur as structural elements of the ex- tracellular matrix and connective tissue throughout the body. Their name (which lit- erally means “glue-producers”) is derived from the gelatins that appear as a decompo- sition product when collagen is boiled. A. Structure of collagens \u0002 Nineteen different collagens are now known, and they are distinguished using roman nu- merals. They mostly consist of a dextro- rotatory triple helix made up of three poly- peptides (α-chains) (see p. 70). The triplet Gly-X-Y is constantly repeated in the sequence of the triple-helical regions— i. e., every third amino acid in such sequences is a glycine. Proline (Pro) is frequently found in positions X or Y; the Y position is often occu- pied by 4-hydroxyproline (4Hyp), although 3-hydroxyproline (3Hyp) and 5-hydroxylysine (5Hyl) also occur. These hydroxylated amino acids are characteristic components of colla- gen. They are only produced after protein biosynthesis by hydroxylation of the amino acids in the peptide chain (see p. 62). The formation of Hyp and Hyl residues in procollagen is catalyzed by iron-containing oxygenases (“proline and lysine hydrox- ylase,” EC 1.14.11.1/2). Ascorbate is required to maintain their function. Most of the symp- toms of the vitamin C deficiency disease scurvy (see p. 368) are explained by disturbed collagen biosynthesis. Thehydroxyprolineresidues stabilize the triple helix by forming hydrogen bonds be- tween the α-chains, while the hydroxyl groups of hydroxylysine are partly glycosy- lated with a disaccharide (–Glc–Gal). The various types of collagen consist of different combinations of α-chains (α1to α3 and other subtypes). Types I, II, and III repre- sent 90% of collagens. The type I collagen shown here has the structure [α1(I)]2α2(1). Numerous tropocollagen molecules (mass 285 kDa, length 400 nm) aggregate extracell- ularly into a defined arrangement, forming cylindrical fibrils (20–500 nm in diameter). Under the electron microscope, these fibrils are seen to have a characteristic banding pat- tern of elements that are repeated every 64–67 nm. Tropocollagen molecules are firmly linked together, particularly at their ends, by cova- lent networks of altered lysine side chains. The number of these links increases with age. Type IV collagens form networks with a defined mesh size. The size-selective filtering effect of the basal membranes in the renal glomeruli is based on this type of structure (see p. 322). B. Biosynthesis \u0002 The precursor molecule of collagen (prepro- collagen), formed in the rER, is subject to extensive post-translational modifications (see p. 232) in the ER and Golgi apparatus. Cleavage of the signal peptide gives rise to procollagen, which still carries large propep- tides at each end [1]. During this phase, most proline residues and some lysine residues of procollagen are hydroxylated [2]. The procol- lagen is then glycosylated at hydroxylysine residues [3]. Intramolecular and intermolecu- lar disulfide bonds form in the propeptides [4], allowing correct positioning of the pep- tide strands to form a triple helix [5]. It is only after these steps have been completed that procollagen is secreted into the extracellular space by exocytosis. This is where the N-and C-terminal propeptides are removed proteo- lytically [6], allowing the staggered aggrega- tion of the tropocollagen molecules to form fibrils [7]. Finally, several ε-amino groups in lysine residues are oxidatively converted into aldehyde groups [8]. Covalent links between the molecules then form as a result of con- densation [9]. In this way, the fibrils reach their final structure, which is characterized by its high tensile strength and proteinase re- sistance. 344 Tissues and organs – Gly – X – Y – Gly – X – Y – Gly – X – Y – N CH C C C CO H2 H2 HO H N CH C C C H2 H2 H2 CO CH2 NH HN CO CCH CO 2 CH2 C CH2 NH3 OH H Gene Pre-procollagen Intracellular protein modification Collagen fibril Procollagen-proline 4-dioxygenase 1.14.11.2 [ascorbate, Fe] Procollagen-lysine 5-dioxygenase 1.14.11.4 [ascorbate, Fe] Protein-lysine 6-oxidase 1.4.3.13 [Cu] Exocytosis Procollagen Transcription Translation A.

Extracellular matrix \u0002 The space between the cells (the interstitium) is occupied by asubstance with acomplex composition known as the extracellular matrix (ECM). In many types of tissue—e. g., muscle and liver—the ECM is only a narrow border between the cells, while in others it forms a larger space. In connective tissue, cartilage, and bone, the ECM is particularly strongly marked and is actually the functional part of thetissue(see p. 340). Theillustration shows the three main constituents of the ex- tracellular matrix in a highly schematic way: collagen fibers, network-forming adhesive proteins, and space-filling proteoglycans. The ECM has a very wide variety of func- tions: it establishes mechanical connections between cells; it creates structures with spe- cial mechanical properties (as in bone, carti- lage, tendons, and joints); it creates filters (e. g., in the basal membrane in the renal cor- puscles; see p. 322); it separates cells and tis- sues from each other (e. g., to allow the joints to move freely); and it provides pathways to guide migratory cells (important for embry- onic development). The chemical composi- tion of the ECM is justasdiverse as itsfunc- tions. Collagens (see p. 344), of which there are at least 19 different varieties, form fibers, fi- brils, networks, and ligaments. Their charac- teristic properties are tensile strength and flexibility. Elastin is a fiber protein with a high degree of elasticity. Adhesive proteins provide the connections between the various components of the ex- tracellular matrix. Important representatives include laminin and fibronectin (see B). These multifunctional proteins simultaneously bind to several other types of matrix component. Cells attach to the cell surface receptors in the ECM with the help of the adhesive proteins. Due to their polarity and negative charge, proteoglycans (see C) bind water molecules and cations. As a homogeneous “cement,” they fill the gaps between the ECM fibers. B. Fibronectins \u0003 Fibronectins are typical representatives of adhesive proteins. They are filamentous dimers consisting of two related peptide chains (each with a mass of 250 kDa) linked to each other by disulfide bonds. The fibro- nectin molecules are divided into different domains, which bind to cell-surface receptors, collagens, fibrin, and various proteoglycans. This is what gives fibronectins their “molec- ular glue” characteristics. The domain structure in fibronectins is made up of a few types of peptide module that are repeated numerous times. Each of the more than 50 modules is coded for by one exon in the fibronectin gene. Alternative splicing (see p. 246) of the hnRNA transcript of the fibronectin gene leads to fibronectins with different compositions. The module that cau- ses adhesion to cells contains the characteristic amino acid sequence –Arg–Gly–Asp–Ser–. It is these residues that enable fibronectin to bind to cell-surface receptors, known as integrins. C. Proteoglycans \u0002 Proteoglycans are giant molecule complexes consisting of carbohydrates (95%) and pro- teins (5%), with masses of up to 2 106 Da. Their bottlebrush-shaped structure is pro- duced by an axis consisting of hyaluronate. This thread-like polysaccharide (see p. 44) has proteins attached to it, from which in turn long polysaccharide chains emerge. Like the central hyaluronate, these terminal poly- saccharides belong to the glycosaminoglycan group (see p. 44). The glycosaminoglycans are made up of repeating disaccharide units, each of which consists of one uronic acid (glucuronic acid or iduronic acid) and one amino sugar (N- acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine) (see p. 38). Many of the amino sugars are also esterified with sulfuric acid (sulfated), further increasing their polarity. The proteoglycans bind large amounts of water and fill the gaps between the fibrillar components of the ECM in the form of a hydrated gel. This inhibits the spread of pathogens in the ECM, for example. 346 Tissues and organs 100 nm GlcUA GlcNAc GlcNAc GlcUA GalUA IduUA GalNAc GalNAc –Arg–Gly–Asp–Ser– N C N C ss ss O OH OH H H HO HN H H HO H HHH OO H2CCOO CCH3 O OSO3 O OH HN H H HO OH H H HO HH O H COO O H2C CCH3 O OSO3 O OH OH H H HO HN H H O H HHH O CH2OHH CCH3 O COO O3S O O OH OH H H HO HN H H H H HHHO O CH2OHCOO CCH3 O O 33 O OH O H H HH O OH HN H H HH H2CCOO SO O O OSO3 SO Collagens (at least 19 different types) Cell membrane Cell surface receptors (Integrins) Adhesive proteins: Elastin, laminin, fibronectin Proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid A.

Structure of nerve cells \u0001 Nerve cells (neurons) are easily excitable cells that produce electrical signals and can react to such signals as well. Their structure is mark- edly different from that of other types of cell. Numerous branching processes project from their cell body (soma). Neurons are able to receive signals via dendrites and to pass them on via axons.The axons, which can be up to 1 m long, are usually surrounded by Schwann cells, which cover them with a lipid-rich myelin sheath to improve their electrical insulation. The transfer of stimuli occurs at the synapses, which link the individual neurons to each other as well as linking neurons func- tionally to muscle fibers. Neurotransmitters (see p. 352) are stored in the axonal nerve endings. These signaling substances are re- leased in response to electrical signals in or- der to excite neighboring neurons (or muscle cells). It is estimated that eachneuroninthe brain is in contact via synapses with approx- imately 10 000 other neurons. There is a noticeably high proportion of lipids in the composition of nerve cells, rep- resenting about 50% of their dry weight. In particular, there is a very wide variety of phospholipids, glycolipids, and sphingolipids (see p. 216). B. Neurotransmitters and neurohormones \u0002 Neurosecretions are classed into two groups: neurotransmitters are released into the syn- aptic cleft in order to influence neighboring cells (C). They have a short range and a short lifespan. By contrast, neurohormones are re- leased into the blood, allowing them to cover larger distances. However, the distinction be- tween the two groups is a fluid one; some neurotransmitters simultaneously function as neurohormones. C. Synaptic signal transmission \u0002 All chemical synapses function according to a similar principle. In the area of the synapse, the surface of the signaling cell (presynaptic membrane) is separated from the surface of the receiving cell (postsynaptic membrane) only by a narrow synaptic cleft. When an ac- tion potential (see p. 350) reaches the presyn- aptic membrane, voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels integrated into the membrane open and trigger exocytosis of the neurotransmitter stored in the presynaptic cell (for details, see p. 228). Each neuron usually releases only one type of neurotransmitter. Neurons that release dopamine are referred to as “dopaminergic,” for example, while those that release acetyl- choline are “cholinergic,” etc. The transmit- ters that are released diffuse through the synapticcleft andbindon the othersideto receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. These receptors are integral membrane pro- teins that have binding sites for neurotrans- mitters on their exterior (see p. 224). The receptors for neurotransmitters are divided into two large groups according to the effect produced by binding of the trans- mitter (for details, see p. 354). Ionotropic receptors (bottom left) are ligand-gated ion channels. When they open as a result of the transmitter’s influence, ions flow in due to the membrane potential (see p. 126). If the inflowing ions are cations (Na +,K +,Ca 2+), depolarization of the mem- brane occurs and an action potential is trig- gered on the surface of the postsynaptic cell. This is the way in which stimulatory trans- mitters work (e. g., acetylcholine and gluta- mate). By contrast, if anions flow in (mainly Cl –), the result is hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, which makes the production of a postsynaptic action potential more dif cult. The action of inhibitory trans- mitters such as glycine and GABA is based on this effect. A completely different type of effect is ob- served in metabotropic receptors (bottom right). After binding of the transmitter, these interact on the inside of the postsynaptic membrane with Gproteins (see p. 384), which in turn activate or inhibit the synthesis of second messengers. Finally, second messen- gers activate or inhibit protein kinases,which phosphorylate cellular proteins and thereby alter the behavior of the postsynaptic cells (signal transduction; see p. 386). 348 Tissues and organs 4 Ca2 Ca2 Ca2 1 2 3 3 2 Na 5 6 Cl SM Action potential Voltage-gated Ca2 channel Synaptic vesicle with transmitter Presynaptic membrane Action potential Opens voltage- gated calcium channels Synaptic cleft Neurotransmitter Neurohormone Blood capillaryErythrocyte Postsynaptic cell Neuronal axon Receptor Myelin sheath Node of Ranvier Dendrite Axon Synapses Schwann cell Nucleus Axon terminals A.

Synaptic signal transmission 349Brain and sensory organs Resting potential and action potential A. Resting potential \u0002 A characteristic property of living cells is the uneven distribution of positively and nega- tively charged ions on the inside and outside of the plasma membrane. This gives rise to a membrane potential (see p. 126)—i. e., there is electrical voltage between the two sides of the membrane, which can only balance out when ion channels allow the unevenly distrib- uted ions to move. At rest, the membrane potential in most cells is –60 to –90 mV. It mainly arises from the activity of Na +/K + transporting ATPase (“Na +/K + ATPase”), which occurs on practically all animal cells. Using up ATP, this P-type enzyme (see p. 220) “pumps” three Na + ions out of the cell in exchange for two K + ions. Some of the K + ions, following the concentra- tion gradient, leave the cell again through potassium channels. As the protein anions that predominate inside the cell cannot fol- lowthem, and inflowofCl – ions from the outside is not possible, the result is an excess of positive charges outside the cell, while anions predominate inside it. An equilibrium potential exists for each of the ions involved. This is the value of the membrane potential at which there is no net inflow or outflow of the ions concerned. For K + ions, the resting potential lies in the range of the membrane potential, while for Na+ ions it is much higher at +70 mV. At the first op- portunity, Na + ions will therefore spontane- ously flow into the cell. The occurrence of action potentials is based on this (see B). Nerve cell membranes contain ion chan- nels for Na +,K +,Cl –,and Ca 2+. These channels are usually closed and open only briefly to let ions pass through. They can be divided into channels that are regulated by membrane po- tentials (“voltage-gated”—e. g., fast Na + chan- nels; see p. 222) and those regulated by ligands (“ligand-gated”—e. g., nicotinic acetyl- choline receptors; see p. 222). B. Action potential \u0002 Action potentials are special signals that are used to transmit information in the nervous system. They are triggered by chemical stim- uli (or more rarely electrical stimuli). Binding of a neurotransmitter to an ionotropic recep- tor results in a brief local increase in the membrane potential from –60 mV to about +30 mV. Although the membrane potential quickly returns to the initial value within a few milliseconds (ms) at its site of origin, the depolarization is propagated because neigh- boring membrane areas are activated during this time period. [1] The process starts with the opening of voltage-gated Na + channels (see p. 222). Due to their high equilibrium potential (see A), Na + ions flow into the cell and reverse the local membrane potential (depolarization). [2] The Na + channels immediately close again, so that the inflow of positive charges is only very brief. [3] Due to the increase in the membrane potential, voltage-dependent K + channels open and K + ions flow out. In addition, Na +/ K + ATPase (see A) pumps the Na+ ions that have entered back out again. This leads to repolarization of the membrane. [4] The two processes briefly lead to the charge even falling below the resting poten- tial (hyperpolarization). The K+ channels also close after a few milliseconds. The nerve cell is then ready for re-stimulation. Generally, it is always only a very small part of the membrane that is depolarized dur- ing an action potential. The process can there- fore be repeated again after a short refractory period, when the nerve cell is stimulated again. Conduction of the action potential on the surface of the nerve cell is based on the fact that the local increase in the membrane potential causes neighboring voltage-gated ion channels to open, so that the membrane stimulation spreads over the whole cell in the form of a depolarization wave. 350 Tissues and organs K ClNa K ClNa P P AA PP P P -60 mV-60 mV 1 1 (mV) 12 3 +40 +20 0 -20 -40 -60 -80 1 2 3 4 Na K Na K 1 Na K Na 2 * * Na K Na3 Na K Na4 12 3 K Na K KK 1 2 3 4 11 11 Chloride channel Extracellular space Cytoplasm Organic anions Potassium channel Na /K ATPase 3.6.1.37 Sodium channel Often open Usually closed A.

At the post- synaptic membrane, they bind to special re- ceptors and affect their activity. A. Important neurotransmitters \u0002 Neurotransmitters can be classified into sev- eral groups according to their chemical struc- ture. The table lists the most important rep- resentatives of this family, which has more than 100 members. Acetylcholine, the acetic acid ester of the cationic alcohol choline (see p. 50) acts at neuromuscular junctions, where it triggers muscle contraction (see p. 334), and in certain parts of the brain and in the autonomous nervous system. Several proteinogenic amino acids (see p. 60) have neurotransmitter effects. A partic- ularly important one is glutamate, which acts as a stimulatory transmitter in the CNS. More than half of the synapses in the brain are glutaminergic. The metabolism of glutamate and that of the amine GABA synthesized from it (see below) are discussed in more detail on p. 356. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmit- ter with effects in the spinal cord and in parts of the brain. Biogenic amines arise from amino acids by decarboxylation (see p. 62). This group in- cludes 4-aminobutyrate (γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA), which is formed from glutamate and is the most important inhibitory trans- mitter in the CNS. The catecholamines norepi- nephrine and epinephrine (see B), serotonin, which is derived from tryptophan, and hista- mine also belong to the biogenic amine group. All of them additionally act as hormones or mediators (see p. 380). Peptides make up the largest group among the neurosecretions. Many peptide hormo- nes—e. g., thyroliberin (TRH) and angiotensin II—simultaneously act as transmitters. Most neuropeptides are small (3–15 AA). At their N-terminus, many of them have a glutamate residue that has been cyclized to form pyroglutamate (5-oxoproline, <G), while the C-terminus is often an acid amide (–NH2). This provides better protection against break- down by peptidases. Endorphins, dynorphins, and enkephalins are a particularly interesting group of neuro- peptides. They act as “endogenous opiates” by producing analgetic, sedative, and euphoriant effects in extreme situations. Drugs such as morphine and heroin activate the receptors for these peptides (see p. 354). Purine derivatives with neurotransmitter function are all derived from adenine-con- taining nucleotides or nucleosides. ATP is re- leased along with acetylcholine and other transmitters, and among other functions it regulates the emission of transmitters from its synapse of origin. The stimulatory effect of caffeine is mainly based on the fact that it binds to adenosine receptors. B. Biosynthesis of catecholamines \u0002 The catecholamines are biogenic amines that have a catechol group. Their biosynthesis in the adrenal cortex and CNS starts from tyro- sine. [1] Hydroxylation of the aromatic ring ini- tially produces dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl- alanine). This reaction uses the unusual coenzyme tetrahydrobiopterin (THB). Dopa (cf. p. 6) is also used in the treatment of Par- kinson’s disease. [2] Decarboxylation of dopa yields dopa- mine, an important transmitter in the CNS. In dopaminergic neurons, catecholamine syn- thesis stopsatthispoint. [3] The adrenal gland and adrenergic neu- rons continue the synthesis by hydroxylating dopamine into norepinephrine (noradrena- line). Ascorbic acid (vitamin C; see p. 368) acts as a hydrogen-transferring coenzyme here. [4] Finally, N-methylation of norepineph- rine yields epinephrine (adrenaline). The coenzyme for this reaction is S-adenosylme- thionine (SAM; see p.110). The physiological effects of the catechol- amines are mediated by a large number of different receptors that are of particular inter- est in pharmacology. Norepinephrine acts in the autonomic nervous system and certain areas of the brain. Epinephrine is also used as a transmitter by some neurons. 352 Tissues and organs 2 4 31 42 CO2 O2 H2O 3 O2 H2O N A P N A P 1 THB P P AA PP P P A A CH2 CH2 CH2H3N COO N H CH2 CH2H3N HO N N H CH2 CH2H3N C H COO (CH ) NH COO CHH3N COO CH2 OH CHH3N COO CH2 OH OH CH2H3N CH2 OH OH CH2H3N CH OH OH HO CH2H2N CH OH OH HO CH3 C N H C C N OCH2 NH N H N C O O C O NH2 H 22 3 CH2H3N COO H3CC O O CH2 CH2 NCH3 CH3 CH3 B.

Important neurotransmitters 353Brain and sensory organs Receptors for neurotransmitters Like all signaling substances, neurotrans- mitters (see p. 352) act via receptor proteins. The receptors for neurotransmitters are inte- grated into the membrane of the postsynaptic cell, where they trigger ion inflow or signal transduction processes (see p. 348). A. Receptors for neurotransmitters \u0002 A considerable number of receptors for neu- rotransmitters are already known and new ones are continuing to be discovered. The table only lists the most important examples. They are classified into two large groups ac- cording to their mode of action. Ionotropic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels (left halfofthe table). The receptors for stimulatory transmitters (indicated in the table by a ⊕) mediate the inflow of cations (mainly Na+). When these open after binding of the transmitter, local depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane occurs. By contrast, inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA and gly- cine) allow Cl – to flow in. This increases the membrane’s negative resting potential and hinders the action of stimulatory transmitters (hyperpolarization, O-). Metabotropic receptors (right half of the table) are coupled to G proteins (see p. 386), through which they influence the synthesis of second messengers. Receptors that work with type Gs proteins (see p. 386) increase the cAMP level in the postsynaptic cell ([cAMP]\u0002), while those that activate Gi pro- teins reduce it ([cAMP]\u0003). Via type Gq pro- teins, other receptors increase the intracellu- lar Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+]\u0002). There are several receptor subtypes for most neurotransmitters. These are distin- guished numerically (e. g., D1 to D5)or are named after their agonists—i. e., after mole- cules experimentally found to activate the receptor. For example, one specific subtype of glutamate receptors reacts to NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), while another sub- type reacts to the compound AMPA, etc. B. Acetylcholine receptors \u0002 Acetylcholine (ACh) was the neurotransmitter first discovered, at the beginning of the last century. It binds to two types of receptor. The nicotinic ACh receptor responds to the alkaloid nicotine contained in tobacco (many of the physiological effects of nicotine are based on this). The nicotinic receptor is iono- tropic. Its properties are discussed in greater detail on p. 222. The muscarinic ACh receptors (of which thereare at leastfivesubtypes) aremetabo- tropic. Their name is derived from the alkaloid muscarine, which is found in the fly agaric mushroom (Amanita muscaria), for ex- ample. Like ACh, muscarine is bound at the receptor, but in contrast to ACh (see C), it is not broken down and therefore causes per- manent stimulation of muscle. The muscarinic ACh receptors influence the cAMP level in the postsynaptic cells (M1,M3 and M5 increase it, while subtypes M2 and M4 reduce it). C. Metabolism of acetylcholine \u0002 Acetylcholine is synthesized from acetyl-CoA and choline in the cytoplasm of the presynap- tic axon [1] and is stored in synaptic vesicles, each of which contains around 1000–10 000 ACh molecules. After it is released by exocy- tosis (see p. 228), the transmitter travels by diffusion to the receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. Catalyzed by acetylcholinesterase, hydrolysis of ACh to acetate and choline im- mediately starts in the synaptic cleft [2], and within a few milliseconds, the ACh released has been eliminated again. The cleavage products choline and acetate are taken up again by the presynaptic neuron and reused for acetylcholine synthesis [3]. Substances that block the serine residue in the active center of acetylcholinesterase [2]—e. g., the neurotoxin E605 and other organophosphates—prevent ACh degradation and thus cause prolonged stimulation of the postsynaptic cell. This impairs nerve conduc- tion and muscle contraction. Curare, apara- lyzing arrow-poison used by South American Indians, competitively inhibits binding of ACh to its receptor. 354 Tissues and organs P P P A A PP P A S H2O 2 1 2 3 A S A S 3 1 Ca2 βα αγ Na GTP Acetyl- Synaptic vesicle Acetate Presynaptic membrane Acetate Choline Neurotoxins Synaptic cleft Postsynaptic membrane Storage Packing Acetylcholine Receptor C.

Although the brain only represents about2% of the body’s mass,itconsumes around 20% of the metabolized oxygen and ca. 60% of the glucose. The neurons’ high en- ergy requirements are mainly due to ATP-de- pendent ion pumps (particularly Na +/K+ AT- Pase) and other active transport processes that are needed for nerve conduction (see p. 350). A. Energy metabolism of the brain \u0001 Glucose is normally the only metabolite from which the brain is able to obtain adequate amounts of ATP through aerobic glycolysis and subsequent terminal oxidation to CO2 and H2O. Lipids are unable to pass the blood– brain barrier, and aminoacids are alsoonly available in the brain in limited quantities (see B). As neurons only have minor glycogen reserves, they are dependent on a constant supply of glucose from the blood. A severe drop in the blood glucose level—as can occur after insulin overdosage in diabetics, for ex- ample—rapidly leads to a drop in the ATP level in the brain. This results in loss of conscious- ness and neurological deficits that can lead to death. Oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) also fint affects the brain. The effects of a brief period of hypoxia are still reversible, but as time progresses irreversible damage increasingly occurs and finally complete loss of function (“brain death”). During periods of starvation, the brain after a certain time acquires the ability to use ke- tone bodies (see p. 312) in addition to glucose to form ATP. In the first weeks of a starvation period, there is a strong increase in the activ- ities of the enzymes required for this in the brain. The degradation of ketone bodies in the CNS saves glucose and thereby reduces the breakdown of muscle protein that maintains gluconeogenesis in the liver during starva- tion. After a few weeks, the extent of muscle breakdown therefore declines to one-third of the initial value. B. Glutamate, glutamine, and GABA \u0002 The proteinogenic amino acid glutamate (Glu) and the biogenic amine 4-aminobuty- rate derived from it are among the most im- portant neurotransmitters in the brain (see p. 352). They are both synthesized in the brain itself. In addition to the neurons, which use Glu or GABA as transmitters, neuroglia are also involved in the metabolism of these sub- stances. Since glutamate and GABA as transmitters must not appear in the extracellular space in an unregulated way, the cells of the neuroglia (center) supply “glutaminergic” and “GABAer- gic” neurons with the precursor glutamine (Gln), which they produce from glutamate with the help of glutamine synthetase [1]. GABA neurons (left) and glutamate neu- rons (right) initially hydrolyze glutamine with the help of glutaminase [1] to form glu- tamate again. The glutamate neurons store this in vesicles and release it when stimu- lated. The GABA neurons continue the degra- dation process by using glutamate decarbox- ylase [3] to convert glutamate into the trans- mitter GABA. Both types of neuron take up their trans- mitter again. Some of it also returns to the neuroglia, where glutamate is amidated back into glutamine. Glutamate can also be produced again from GABA. The reaction sequence needed for this, known as the GABA shunt, is characteristic of the CNS. A transaminase [4] first converts GABA and 2-oxoglutarate into glutamate and succinate semialdehyde (–OOC–CH2–CH2– CHO). InanNAD +-dependent reaction, the aldehyde is oxidized to succinic acid [5], from which 2-oxoglutarate can be regener- ated again via tricarboxylic acid cycle reac- tions. The function of glutamate as a stimulatory transmitter in the brain is the cause of what is known as the “Chinese restaurant syndrome.” In sensitive individuals, the monosodium glu- tamate used as a flavor enhancer in Chinese cooking can raise the glutamate level in the braintosuchanextent that transient mild neurological disturbances can occur (dizzi- ness, etc.). 356 Tissues and organs GABA- Rezeptor Glutamat- Rezeptor 2K 3 Na CO2 + H2O O2 P P A A PP P P O2 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 H2O CO2 A PP P P P A P N A N A 1 2 4 1 NH4 H2O NH4 NH4 5 3 GABA neuron Glia cell Glutamate neuron Amino acids Small amount Glycolysis Tricarboxylic acid cycle Respiratory chain Ketone bodies Na /K -exchanging ATPase 3.6.1.37 A.

Rods are sensitive to low levels of light, while the cones are responsible for color vision at higher light intensities. Signaling substances and many proteins are involved in visual processes. Initially, a light-induced cis–trans isomerization of the pigment retinal triggers a conformational change in themembraneprotein rhodopsin. Via the G protein transducin, which is associ- ated with rhodopsin, an enzyme is activated that breaks down the second messenger cGMP. Finally, the cGMP deficiency leads to hyperpolarization of the light-sensitive cell, which is registered by subsequent neurons as reduced neurotransmitter release. A. Photoreceptor \u0002 The cell illustrated opposite, a rod,has a structure divided by membrane discs into which the 7-helix receptor rhodopsin is inte- grated (see p. 224). In contrast to other recep- tors in the 7-helix class (see p. 384), rhodop- sin is a light-sensitive chromoprotein. Its pro- tein part, opsin,contains the aldehyde retinal (see p. 364)—an isoprenoid which is bound to the ε-amino group of a lysine residue as an aldimine. The light absorption of rhodopsin is in the visible range, with a maximum at about 500 nm. The absorption properties of the vis- ual pigment are thus optimally adjusted to the spectral distribution of sunlight. Absorption of a photon triggers isomeriza- tion from the 11-cis form of retinal to all- trans-retinal (top right). Within milliseconds, this photochemical process leads to an allos- teric conformational change in rhodopsin. Theactiveconformation (rhodopsin*)binds and activates the G protein transducin.The signal cascade (B) that now follows causes the rod cells to release less neurotransmitter (glutamate) at their synapses. The adjoining bipolar neurons register this change and transmit it to the brain as a signal for light. There are several different rhodopsins in the cones. All of them contain retinal mole- cules as light-sensitive components, the ab- sorption properties of which are modulated by the different proportions of opsin they containinsucha way that colors can also be perceived. B. Signal cascade \u0002 Dark (bottom left). Rod cells that are not exposed to light contain relatively high con- centrations (70 µM) of the cyclic nucleotide cGMP (3\u0001,5\u0001-cycloGMP; cf. cAMP, p. 386), which is synthesized by a guanylate cyclase ([2], see p. 388). The cGMP binds to an ion channel in the rod membrane (bottom left) and thus keeps it open. The inflow of cations (Na +,Ca 2+) depolarizes the membrane and leads to release of the neurotransmitter glu- tamate at the synapse (see p. 356). Light (bottom right). When the G protein transducin binds to light-activated rhodop- sin* (see A, on the structure of the complex; see p. 224), it leads to the GDP that is bound to the transducin being exchanged for GTP. In transducin* that has been activated in this way, the GTP-containing α-subunit breaks off from the rest of the molecule and in turn activates a membrane cGMP phosphodiester- ase [1]. This hydrolyzes cGMP to GMP and thus reduces the level of free cGMP within milliseconds. As a consequence, the cGMP bound at the ion channel dissociates off and the channel closes. As cations are constantly being pumped out of the cell, the membrane potential falls and hyperpolarization of the cell occurs, which interrupts glutamate re- lease. Regeneration. After exposure to light, several processes restore the initial conditions: 1. The α-subunit of transducin* inactivates itself by GTP hydrolysis and thus termi- nates the activation of cGMP esterase. 2. The reduced Ca 2+ concentration causes ac- tivation of guanylate cyclase, which in- creases the cGMP level until the cation channels reopen. 3. An isomerase [3] transfers all-trans -retinal to the 11-cis -form, in which it is available for the next cycle. A dehydrogenase [4] can also allow retinal to be supplied from vita- min A (retinol). 358 Tissues and organs ca.50 µm 12 11 Na ATP ADP P GMPGTP H2O P P GTP α GDP α P β γ GTP Transducin* GDP GDP GTP GDP * cGMP cGMP 3N A N A 4 2 1 3 4 2 1 Ca2Na Ca 2Na Ca 2 Ca2Na CH3 CH3 H3C HC NH CH3H3C CH3 CH3CH3H3C CH3 H C NH Opsin A.

These include proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals (including water), and vitamins. These sub- stances can occur in widely varying amounts and proportions, depending on the type of diet. As several components of the diet are essential for life, they have to be regularly ingested with food. Recommended daily min- imums for nutrients have been published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and a number of national expert committees. A. Energy requirement \u0001 The amount of energy required by a human is expressed in kJ d–1 (kilojoule per day). An older unit is the kilocalorie (kcal; 1 kcal = 4.187 kJ). The figures given are recommended values for adults with a normal body weight. However, actual requirements are based on age, sex, body weight, and in particular on physical activity. In those involved in compet- itive sports, for example, requirements can increase from 12 000 to 17 000 kJ d –1. It is recommended that about half of the energy intake should be in the form of carbo- hydrates, a third at most in the form of fat, and the rest as protein. The fact that alcoholic bever- ages can make a major contribution to daily energy intake is often overlooked. Ethanol has a caloric value of about 30 kJ g –1 (see p. 320). B. Nutrients \u0001 Proteins provide the body with amino acids, which are used for endogenous protein bio- synthesis. Excess amino acids are broken down to provideenergy (seep. 174). Most amino acids are glucogenic—i. e., they can be converted into glucose (see p. 180). Proteins are essential components of the diet, as they provide essential amino acids that the human body is not capable of pro- ducing on its own (see the table). Some amino acids, including cysteine and histidine, are not absolutely essential, but promote growth in children. Some amino acids are able to sub- stitute for each other in the diet. For example, humans can form tyrosine, which is actually essential, by hydroxylation from phenylala- nine, and cysteine from methionine. The minimum daily requirement of protein is 37 gfor men and 29 gfor women, butthe recommendedamounts areabout twicethese values. Requirements in pregnant and breast- feeding women are even higher. Not only the quantity, but also the quality of protein is important. Proteins that lack several essential amino acids or only contain small quantities of them are considered to be of low value, and larger quantities of them are therefore needed. For example, pulses only contain small amounts of methionine, while wheat and corn proteins are poor in lysine. In con- trast to vegetable proteins, most animal pro- teins are high-value (with exceptions such as collagen and gelatin). Carbohydrates serve as a general and easily available energy source. In the diet, they are present as monosaccharides in honey and fruit, or as disaccharides in milk and in all foods sweetened with sugar (sucrose). Meta- bolically usable polysaccharides are found in vegetable products (starch) and animal prod- ucts (glycogen). Carbohydrates represent a substantial proportion of the body’s energy supply, but they are not essential. Fats are primarily important energy suppli- ers in the diet. Per gram, they provide more than twice asmuch energy asproteinsand carbohydrates. Fats are essential as suppliers of fat-soluble vitamins (see p. 364) and as sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are needed to biosynthesize eicosanoids (see pp. 48, 390). Mineral substances and trace elements,a very heterogeneous group of essential nu- trients, are discussed in more detail on p. 362. They are usually divided into macro- minerals and microminerals. Vitamins are also indispensable compo- nents of the diet. The animal body requires them in very small quantities in order to syn- thesize coenzymes and signaling substances (see pp. 364–369). 360 Nutrition Quantity in body (kg) Energy content Daily requirement (g) General function in metabolism Essential constituentskJ · g-1 (kcal · g-1)a b c A.

Minerals \u0002 Water is the most important essential inor- ganic nutrient in the diet. In adults, the body has a daily requirement of 2–3 L of water, which is supplied from drinks, water con- tained in solid foods, and from the oxidation water produced in the respiratory chain (see p. 140). The special role of water for living processes is discussed in more detail else- where(seep. 26). The elements essential for life can be div- ided into macroelements (daily requirement >100 mg) and microelements (daily require- ment < 100 mg). The macroelements include the electrolytes sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg), and the nonmetals chlorine (Cl), phosphorus (P), sul- fur (S), and iodine (I). The essential microelements are only re- quired in trace amounts (see also p. 2). This group includes iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn),copper(Cu), cobalt (Co),chromium (Cr), selenium (Se), and molybdenum (Mo). Fluo- rine (F) is not essential for life, but does pro- mote healthy bones and teeth. It is still a matter of controversy whether vanadium, nickel,tin,boron,and silicon also belongto the essential trace elements. The second column in the table lists the average amounts of mineral substances in the body of an adult weighing 65 kg. The daily requirements listed in the fourth column also apply to an adult, and are average values. Children, pregnant and breast-feeding wo- men, and those who are ill generally have higher mineral requirements relative to body weight than men. As thehuman body is able to storemany minerals, deviations from the daily ration are balanced out over a given period of time. Minerals stored in the body include water, which is distributed throughout the whole body; calcium, stored in the form of apatite in the bones (see p. 340); iodine, stored as thyroglobulin in the thyroid; and iron, stored in the form of ferritin and hemosiderin in the bone marrow, spleen, and liver (see p. 286). The storage site for many trace elements is the liver. In many cases, the metabolism of minerals is regulated by hormones—for exam- ple, the uptake and excretion of H2O, Na +, Ca 2+, and phosphate (see p. 328), and storage of Fe 2+ and I –. Resorption of the required mineral sub- stances from food usually depends on the body’s requirements, and in several cases also on the composition of the diet. One ex- ample of dietary influence is calcium (see p. 342). Its resorption as Ca 2+ is promoted by lactate and citrate, but phosphate, oxalic acid, and phytol inhibit calcium uptake from food dueto complex formation and theproduction of insoluble salts. Mineral deficiencies are not uncommon and can have quite a variety of causes—e. g., an unbalanced diet, resorption disturbances, and diseases. Calcium deficiency can lead to rickets, osteoporosis, and other disturbances. Chloride deficiency is observed as a result of severe Cl – losses due to vomiting. Due to the low content of iodine in food in many regions of central Europe, iodine deficiency is wides- preadthere andcan lead to goiter. Magnesium deficiency can be caused by digestive disor- ders or an unbalanced diet—e. g., in alco- holism. Trace element deficiencies often re- sult in a disturbed blood picture—i. e., forms of anemia. The last columninthe table lists some of the functions of minerals. It should be noted that almost all of the macroelements in the body function either as nutrients or electro- lytes. Iodine (as a result of its incorporation into iodothyronines) and calcium act as sig- naling substances. Most trace elements are cofactors for proteins, especially for enzymes. Particularly important in quantitative terms are the iron proteins hemoglobin, myoglobin, andthe cytochromes(see p. 286),aswell as more than 300 different zinc proteins. 362 Nutrition Mineral Content (g) Major source Daily requirement Functions/Occurrence* Water 35 000- 40 000 1200 900 300g Solvent, cellular buil- ding block, dielectric, coolant, medium for transport, reaction partner Macroelements (daily requirement >100 mg) Na 100 Table salt 1.1-3.3 Osmoregulation, membrane potential, mineral metabolism K 150 Vegetables, fruit, cereals 1.9-5.6 Membrane potential, mineral metabolism Ca 1 300 Milk, milk products 0.8 Bone formation, blood clotting, signal molecule Mg Cl P S 20 100 650 Green vegetables 0.35 Bone formation, cofactor for enzymes 1.7-5.1 Mineral metabolism Meat, milk, cereals, vegetables 0.8 Bone formation, energy metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism S-containing amino acids (Cys and Met) Lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, conjugate formation Microelements (trace elements) Fe 4-5 Meat, liver, eggs, vegetables, potatoes, cereals 10 Hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochromes, Fe/S clusters Zn 2-3 Meat, liver, cereals 15 Zinc enzymes Mn Cu Co Cr Se Mo I F 0.02 0.1-0.2 0.02 0.03 Found in many foodstuffs Meat, vegetables, fruit, fish Meat Vegetables, meat Cereals, nuts, legumes Seafood, iodized salt, drinking water 2-5 2-3 Enzymes Oxidases Traces Vitamin B12 0.05-0.2 Not clear 0.05-0.2 Selenium enzymes 0.15-0.5 Redox enzymes 0.15 Thyroxin Requirement not known Drinking water (fluoridated), tea, milk 0.0015-0.004 Bones, dental enamel * Content in the body of a 65 kg adult Drinks Water in solid foods From metabolism (mg (g) Metals Non-metals <0.01 <0.01 200 0.2 Table salt A. Minerals 363Nutrients Lipid-soluble vitamins Vitamins are essential organic compounds that the animal organism is not capable of forming itself, although it requires them in small amounts for metabolism. Most vitamins are precursors of coenzymes;in somecases, they are also precursors of hormones or act as antioxidants. Vitamin requirements vary from species to species and are influenced by age, sex, and physiological conditions such as pregnancy, breast-feeding, physical exercise, and nutrition. A. Vitamin supply \u0001 A healthy diet usually covers average daily vitamin requirements. By contrast, malnutri- tion, malnourishment (e. g., an unbalanced diet in older people, malnourishment in alco- holics,ready meals),orresorptiondisturban- ces lead to an inadequate supply of vitamins from which hypovitaminosis, or in extreme cases avitaminosis, can result. Medical treat- ments that kill the intestinal flora—e. g., anti- biotics—can also lead to vitamin deficiencies (K, B12, H) due to the absence of bacterial vitamin synthesis. Since only a few vitamins can be stored (A, D, E, B12), a lack of vitamins quickly leads to deficiency diseases. These often affect the skin, blood cells, and nervous system. The causes of vitamin deficiencies can be treated by improving nutrition and by administering vitamins in tablet form. An overdose of vita- mins only leads to hypervitaminoses,with toxic symptoms, in the case of vitamins A and D. Normally, excess vitamins are rapidly excreted with the urine. B. Lipid-soluble vitamins \u0002 Vitamins are classified as either lipid-soluble or water-soluble. The lipid-soluble vitamins includevitamins A,D,E,and K, allofwhich belong to the isoprenoids (see p. 52). Vitamin A (retinol) is the parent substance of the retinoids, which include retinal and retinoic acid. Theretinoids also can besynthe- sized by cleavage from the provitamin β-car- otene. Retinoids are found in meat-containing diets, whereas β-carotene occurs in fruits and vegetables (particularly carrots). Retinal is in- volved in visual processes as the pigment of the chromoprotein rhodopsin (see p. 358). Retinoic acid, like the steroid hormones, in- fluences the transcription of genes in the cell nucleus. It acts as a differentiation factor in growth and development processes. Vitamin A deficiency can result in night blindness, vis- ual impairment, and growth disturbances. Vitamin D (calciol, cholecalciferol) is the precursor of the hormone calcitriol (1α,25-di- hydroxycholecalciferol; see p. 320). Together with two other hormones (parathyrin and calcitonin), calcitriol regulates the calcium metabolism (see p. 342). Calciol can be syn- thesized in the skin from 7-dehydrocholes- terol, an endogenous steroid, by a photo- chemical reaction. Vitamin D deficiencies only occur when the skin receives insuf cient exposure to ultraviolet light and vitamin D is lacking in the diet. Deficiency is observed in the form of rickets in children and osteomala- cia in adults. In both cases, bone mineraliza- tion is disturbed. Vitamin E (tocopherol) and related com- pounds only occur in plants (e. g., wheat germ). They contain what is known as a chro- man ring. In the lipid phase, vitamin E is mainly located in biological membranes, where as an antioxidant it protects unsatu- rated lipids against ROS (see p. 284) and other radicals. Vitamin K (phylloquinone) and similar sub- stances with modified side chains are in- volved in carboxylating glutamate residues of coagulation factors in the liver (see p. 290). The form that acts as a cofactor for carboxylase is derived from the vitamin by enzymatic reduction. Vitamin K antagonists (e. g., coumarin derivatives) inhibit this reduc- tion and consequently carboxylation as well. This fact is used to inhibit blood coagulation in prophylactic treatment against thrombosis. Vitamin K deficiency occurs only rarely, as the vitamin is formed by bacteria of the intestinal flora. 364 Nutrition * Adult daily * requirement Provitamin Vegetables Fruit 1 Milk Liver Egg yolk uv 0.01 Cod liver oil Milk Egg yolk Functional form Visual pigments Coenzyme Signal molecule Important for Sight Sugar transport Development Differentiation Hormone Calcium metabolism Anti- oxidant 10 Cereals Liver Eggs Seed oil Blood clotting (carboxylation of plasma proteins)0.08 Intestinal bacteria Vegetables Liver β-Carotene Retinol Cholesterol Calciol Tocopherols Phylloquinones Retinal Retinol Retinoic acid Calcitriol Tocopherols Phyllohydro- quinones Reducing agent A D E K CH3 CH3CH3H3C CH3 CH2OH H3C H3CCH3 CH3 CH2 HO O CH3 HO H3C CH3 H CH3 CH3 3 O O CH3 H CH3 4 Healthy nutrition Vitamin require- ment satisfied Poor nutrition Malnutrition Antibiotics Disturbed resorption Vitamin intake Urine Excess vitamins Vitamin A and D Vitamin poisoning Hypo- vitaminosis Diseases Hypervitaminosis Overdose A. Vitamin supply B. Lipid-soluble vitamins 365Vitamins Water-soluble vitamins I The B group of vitamins covers water-soluble vitamins, all of which serve as precursors for coenzymes. Their numbering sequence is not continuous, as many substances that were originally regarded as vitamins were not later confirmed as having vitamin characteristics. A. Water-soluble vitamins I \u0002 Vitamin B1 (thiamine) contains two heterocy- clic rings—a pyrimidine ring (a six-membered aromatic ring with two Ns) and a thiazole ring (a five-membered aromatic ring with N and S), which are joined by a methylene group. Theactiveform of vitamin B1 is thiamine diphosphate (TPP), which contributes as a coenzyme to the transfer of hydroxyalkyl res- idues (active aldehyde groups). The most im- portant reactions of this type are oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxoacids (see p. 134) and the transketolase reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway (see p. 152). Thiamine was the first vitamin to be discovered, around 100 years ago. Vitamin B1 deficiency leads to beriberi, a disease with symptoms that in- clude neurological disturbances, cardiac in- suf ciency, and muscular atrophy. Vitamin B2 is a complex of several vita- mins: riboflavin, folate, nicotinate, and pan- tothenic acid. Riboflavin (from the Latin flavus, yellow) serves in the metabolism as a component of the redox coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD; see p.104). As prosthetic groups, FMN and FAD are cofactors for various oxidoreductases (see p. 32). No specific disease due to a deficiency of this vitamin is known. Folate, the anion of folic acid, is made up of three different components—a pteridine derivative, 4-aminobenzoate, and one or more glutamate residues. After reduction to tetrahydrofolate (THF), folate serves as a coenzyme in the C1 metabolism (see p. 418). Folate deficiency is relatively common, and leads to disturbances in nucleotide biosynthe- sis and thus cell proliferation. As the precur- sors for blood cells divide particularly rapidly, disturbances of the blood picture can occur, with increased amounts of abnormal precur- sors for megalocytes (megaloblastic anemia). Later, general damage ensues as phospholipid synthesis and the amino acid metabolism are affected. In contrast to animals, microorganisms are able to synthesize folate from their own com- ponents. The growth of microorganisms can therefore be inhibited by sulfonamides, which competitively inhibit the incorporation of 4- aminobenzoate into folate (see p. 254). Since folate is not synthesized in the animal organ- ism, sulfonamides have no effect on animal metabolism. Nicotinate and nicotinamide, together re- ferred to as “niacin,” are required for biosyn- thesis of the coenzymes nicotinamide ad- enine dinucleotide (NAD +) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP +). These both serve in energy and nutrient me- tabolism as carriers of hydride ions (see pp. 32, 104). The animal organism is able to convert tryptophan into nicotinate, but only with a poor yield. Vitamin deficiency there- fore only occurs when nicotinate, nicotin- amide, and tryptophan are all simultaneously are lacking in the diet. It manifests in the form of skin damage (pellagra), digestive distur- bances, and depression. Pantothenic acid is an acid amide consist- ing of β-alanine and 2,4-dihydroxy-3,3\u0001-di- methylbutyrate (pantoic acid). It is a precur- sor of coenzyme A, which is required for acti- vation of acyl residues in the lipid metabolism (see pp. 12, 106). Acyl carrier protein (ACP; see p.168) also contains pantothenic acid as part of its prosthetic group. Due to the widespread availability of pantothenic acid in food (Greek pantothen = “from everywhere”), deficiency diseases are rare. Further information The requirement for vitamins in humans and other animals is the result of mutations in the enzymes involved in biosynthetic coenzymes. As intermediates of coenzyme biosynthesis are available in suf cient amounts in the diet of heterotrophic animals (see p. 112), the lack of endogenous synthesis did not have unfavorable effects for them. Microor- ganisms and plants whose nutrition is mainly autotrophic have to produce all of these com- pounds themselves in order to survive. 366 Nutrition F A B1 CoA THF TPP NA A S NA P NADP NAD FAD FMN B2 F Glu N N HN NO O CH2 CH3 CH3 C C OHH C OHH CH2OH OHH N N N NH2N CH2 OH HN C NH O CH COO CH2 CH2 COO N COO N NH2 O CC N H COO HO OH OCH3H3C CH NH2 N NH3C N S 3 CH2 CH2OH Thiamine diphosphate A.

Water-soluble vitamins II \u0002 Vitamin B6 consists of three substituted pyr- idines—pyridoxal, pyridoxol,and pyrid- oxamine. The illustration shows the structure of pyridoxal, which carries an aldehyde group (–CHO) at C-4. Pyridoxol is the corresponding alcohol (–CH2OH), and pyridoxamine the amine (–CH2NH2). The active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal phosphate, is the most important coenzyme in the amino acid metabolism (see p. 106). Almost all conversion reactions involving amino acids require pyridoxal phosphate, in- cluding transaminations, decarboxylations, dehydrogenations, etc. Glycogen phosphory- lase, theenzymefor glycogen degradation, also contains pyridoxal phosphate as a cofac- tor. Vitamin B6 deficiency is rare. Vitamin B12 (cobalamine) is one of the most complex low-molecular-weight substances occurring in nature. The core of the molecule consists of a tetrapyrrol system (corrin), with cobalt as the central atom (see p. 108). The vitamin is exclusively synthesized by micro- organisms. It is abundant in liver, meat, eggs, and milk, but not in plant products. As the intestinal flora synthesize vitamin B12, strict vegetarians usually also have an adequate supply of the vitamin. Cobalamine can only be resorbed in the small intestine when the gastric mucosa se- creteswhatisknown as intrinsic factor—a glycoprotein that binds cobalamine (the ex- trinsic factor) and thereby protects it from degradation. In the blood, the vitamin is bound to a special protein known as trans- cobalamin. The liver is able to store vitamin B12 in amounts suf cient to last for several months. Vitamin B12 deficiency is usually due to an absence of intrinsic factor and the resulting resorption disturbance. This leads to a disturbance in blood formation known as pernicious anemia. In animal metabolism, derivatives of cobal- amine are mainly involved in rearrangement reactions. For example, they act as coenzymes in the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (see p. 166), and in the formation of methionine from homocysteine (see p. 418). In prokaryotes, cobalamine derivatives also play a part in the reduction of ribonucleotides. Vitamin C is L-ascorbic acid (chemically: 2-oxogulonolactone). The two hydroxyl groups have acidic properties. By releasing a proton, ascorbic acid therefore turns into its anion, ascorbate. Humans, apes, and guinea pigs require vitamin C because they lack the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase (1.1.3.8), which catalyzes the final step in the conver- sion of glucose into ascorbate. Vitamin C is particularly abundant in fresh fruit and vegetables. Many soft drinks and foodstuffs also have synthetic ascorbic acid added to them as an antioxidant and flavor enhancer. Boiling slowly destroys vitamin C. In the body, ascorbic acid serves as a reducing agent in variations reactions (usually hydrox- ylations). Among the processes involved are collagen synthesis, tyrosine degradation, cate- cholamine synthesis, and bile acid biosynthesis. The daily requirement for ascorbic acid is about 60 mg, a comparatively large amount for a vitamin. Even higher doses of the vita- min have a protective effect against infec- tions. However, the biochemical basis for this effect has not yet been explained. Vitamin C deficiency only occurs rarely nowadays; it becomes evident after a few months in the form of scurvy, with connective-tissue dam- age, bleeding, and tooth loss. Vitamin H (biotin) is present in liver, egg yolk, and other foods; it is also synthesized by the intestinal flora. In the body, biotin is co- valently attached via a lysine side chain to enzymes that catalyze carboxylation reac- tions. Biotin-dependent carboxylases include pyruvate carboxylase (see p. 154) and acetyl- CoA carboxylase (see p. 162). CO2 binds, using up ATP, to one of the two N atoms of biotin, from which it is transferred to the acceptor (see p. 108). Biotin binds with high af nity (Kd =10 –15 M) and specificity to avidin,a pro- tein found in egg white. Since boiling dena- tures avidin, biotin deficiency only occurs when egg whites are eaten raw. 368 Nutrition B6 B12 C H PLP B A S A S H3CN HO C OH CH2OH O HO O C CH2OH HHO HO O HN NH S COO HCCC H COO H H O HC C C H H H COO O H2N N C CH2N O O N N N CH3 H3C C NH2 O C O NH2 H3C H3C C H2N O CHN OH2C CHH3C O POO O H3C CH3 CH3 Co2 CH3 O HO CH2 N N CH3 CH3 HO X C O NH2 A.

They are synthesized in specialized cells that are often associated to form endocrine glands. Hormones are released into the blood and transportedwith the bloodto their effector organs. In the organs, the hormones carry out physiological and biochemical regulatory functions. In contrast to endocrine hormones, tissue hormones areonlyactivein the imme- diate vicinity of the cells that secrete them. The distinctions between hormones and other signaling substances (mediators, neuro- transmitters, and growth factors) are fluid. Mediators is the term used for signaling sub- stances that do not derive from special hor- mone-forming cells, but are form by many cell types. They have hormone-like effects in their immediate surroundings. Histamine (see p. 352) and prostaglandins (see p. 390) are important examples of these substances. Neurohormones and neurotransmitters are signaling substances that are produced and released by nerve cells (see p. 348). Growth factors and cytokines mainly promote cell proliferation and cell differentiation (see p. 392). A. Hormones: overview \u0001 The animal organism contains more than 100 hormones and hormone-like substances, which can be classified either according to their structure or according to their function. In chemical terms, most hormones are amino acid derivatives, peptides or proteins, or ste- roids. Hormones regulate the following pro- cesses: • Growth and differentiation of cells, tissues, and organs Theseprocesses includecellproliferation, embryonic development, and sexual dif- ferentiation—i. e., processes that require a prolonged time period and involve proteins de novo synthesis. For this reason, mainly steroid hormones which function via tran- scription regulation are active in this field (see p. 244). • Metabolic pathways Metabolic regulation requires rapidly act- ing mechanisms. Many of the hormones involved therefore regulate interconversion of enzymes (see p. 120). The main processes subject to hormonal regulation are the up- take and degradation of storage substances (glycogen, fat), metabolic pathways for bio- synthesis and degradation of central me- tabolites (glucose, fatty acids, etc.), and the supply of metabolic energy. • Digestive processes Digestive processes are usually regulated by locally acting peptides (paracrine; see p. 372), but mediators, biogenic amines, and neuropeptides are also involved (see p. 270). • Maintenance of ion concentrations (ho- meostasis) Concentrations of Na +,K+,and Cl – in body fluids, and the physiological variables de- pendent on these (e. g. blood pressure), are subject to strict regulation. The principal site of action of the hormones involved is the kidneys, where hormones increase or reduce the resorption of ions and recovery of water (see pp. 326–331). The concentra- tions of Ca 2+ and phosphate, which form the mineral substance of bone and teeth, are also precisely regulated. Many hormones influence the above pro- cesses only indirectly by regulating the syn- thesis and release of other hormones (hormo- nal hierarchy; see p. 372). B. Hormonal regulation system \u0001 Each hormone is the center of a hormonal regulation system. Specialized glandular cells synthesize the hormone from precursors, store it in many cases, and release it into the bloodstream when needed (biosynthesis). For transport, the poorly water-soluble lipophilic hormones are bound to plasma proteins known as hormone carriers. To stop the ef- fects of the hormone again, it is inactivated by enzymatic reactions, most of which take place in the liver (metabolism). Finally, the hor- mone and its metabolites are expelled via the excretory system, usually in the kidney (excretion). All of these processes affect the concentration of the hormone and thus con- tribute to regulation of the hormonal signal. In the effector organs, target cells receive the hormone’s message. These cells have hormone receptors for thepurpose,which bind thehor- mone. Binding of a hormone passes informa- tion to the cell and triggers a response (effect). 370 Hormones H H H P H H H H M H M H M P H M M H H H H M M M H H H M Insulin Glucagon Cortisol Thyroxin Epinephrine (H2O, electrolytes, ) Parathyroid hormone Calcitonin ANF Aldosterone Calcitriol Gastrin Secretin CCK etc. A.

Hormones: overview Biosynthesis Effect Hormone precursor Hormone Hormone metabolite Hormone carrier Transport ExcretionMetabolism Hormones P 371Hormonal system Plasma levels and hormone hierarchy A. Endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine hor- mone effects \u0002 Hormones transfer signals by migrating from their site of synthesis to their site of action. They are usually transported in the blood. In this case, they are said to have an endocrine effect (1;example: insulin). By contrast, tissue hormones, the target cells for which are in the immediate vicinity of the glandular cells that producethem, aresaidto havea paracrine effect (2;example: gastrointestinal tract hor- mones). When signal substances also pass ef- fects back to the cells that synthesize them, they are said to have an autocrine effect (3; example: prostaglandins). Autocrine effects are often found in tumor cells (see p. 400), which stimulate their own proliferation in this way. Insulin, whichis formed inthe Bcells of the pancreas, has both endocrine and paracrine effects. As a hormone with endocrine effects, it regulates glucose and fat metabolism. Via a paracrine mechanism, it inhibits the synthesis and release of glucagon from the neighboring A cells. B. Dynamics of the plasma level \u0002 Hormones circulate as signaling substances in the blood at very low concentrations (10 –12 to between 10 –7 mol L –1). These values change periodically in rhythms that depend on the time of day, month, or year, or on physiolog- ical cycles. The first example shows the circadian rhythm of the cortisol level. As an activator of gluconeogenesis (see p. 158), cortisol is mainly released in the early morning, when the liver’s glycogen stores are declining. Dur- ing the day, the plasma cortisol level declines. Many hormones are released into the blood in a spasmodic and irregular manner. In this case, their concentrations change in an episodic or pulsatile fashion. This applies, for instance, to luteinizing hormone (LH, lutropin). Concentrations of other hormones are event-regulated. For example, the body re- sponds to increased blood sugar levels after meals by releasing insulin. Regulation of hor- mone synthesis, release, and degradation al- lows the blood concentrations of hormones to be precisely adjusted. This is based either on simple feedback control or on hierarchically structured regulatory systems. C. Closed-loop feedback control \u0002 The biosynthesis and release of insulin by the pancreatic B cells (see p. 160) is stimulated by high blood glucose levels (> 5 mM). The in- sulin released then stimulates increased up- take and utilization of glucose by the cells of themuscleand adiposetissues.As a result, the blood glucose level falls back to its normal value, and further release of insulin stops. D. Hormone hierarchy \u0002 Hormonesystems areoften linked to each another, giving rise in some cases to a hier- archy of higher-order and lower-order hor- mones. A particularly important example is the pituitary–hypothalamic axis, which is con- trolled by the central nervous system (CNS). Nerve cells in the hypothalamus react to stimulatory or inhibitory signals from the CNS by releasing activating or inhibiting factors, whichare knownas liberins (“releasing hor- mones”)and statins (“inhibiting hormones”). These neurohormones reach the adenohy- pophysis by short routes through the blood- stream. In the adenohypophysis, they stimu- late (liberins) or inhibit (statins) the bio- synthesis and release of tropines. Tropines (glandotropic hormones) in turn stimulate pe- ripheral glands to synthesize glandular hor- mones. Finally, the glandular hormone acts on its target cells in the organism. In addition, it passes effects back to the higher-order hormone systems. This (usually negative) feedback influ- ences theconcentrations of thehigher-order hor- mones, creating a feedback loop. Many steroid hormones are regulated by this type of axis—e. g., thyroxin, cortisol, es- tradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. In the case of the glucocorticoids, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH or corticoliberin, a peptide consisting of 41 aminoacids), whichinturnreleases corticotropin (ACTH, 39 AAs) in the pituitary gland. Corticotropin stimulates synthesis and release of the glandular steroid hormone cor- tisol in the adrenal cortex. 372 Hormones H H V H H H H H H H H H H H V H H H H V H H H mg · l-1 mU · ml-112 18 24 24612 18 100 200 mU · ml-1 12 15 18 2421 3 10 20 30 69 Cortisol 12 15 18 2421 3 10 20 30 6 9 H V H R R H HH Time of day Time of day A.

A. Lipophilic hormones \u0002 Lipophilic hormones, which include steroid hormones, iodothyronines, and retinoic acid, are relatively small molecules (300–800 Da) that are poorly soluble in aqueous media. With the exception of the iodothyronines, they are not stored by hormone-forming cells, but are released immediately after being syn- thesized. During transport in the blood, they are bound to specific carriers. Via intracellular receptors, they mainly act on transcription (see p. 358). Other effects of steroid hor- mones—e. g., on the immune system—are not based on transcriptional control. Their details have not yet been explained. Steroid hormones The most important steroid hormones in ver- tebrates are listed on p. 57. Calcitriol (vitamin D hormone) is also included in this group, although it has a modified steroid structure. The most important steroid hormone in in- vertebrates is ecdysone. Progesterone is a female sexual steroid be- longing to the progestin (gestagen) family. It is synthesized in the corpus luteum of the ova- ries. The blood level of progesterone varies with the menstrual cycle. The hormone pre- pares the uterus for a possible pregnancy. Following fertilization, the placenta also starts to synthesize progesterone in order to main- tain the pregnant state. The development of the mammary glands is also stimulated by progesterone. Estradiol is the most important of the estrogens. Like progesterone, it is synthesized by the ovaries and, during pregnancy, by the placenta as well. Estradiol controls the men- strual cycle. It promotes proliferation of the uterine mucosa, and is also responsible for the development of the female secondary sexual characteristics (breast, fat distribution, etc.). Testosterone is the most important of the male sexual steroids (androgens). It is synthe- sized in the Leydig intersitial cells of the testes, and controls the development and functioning of the male gonads. It also deter- mines secondary sexual characteristics in men (muscles, hair, etc.). Cortisol,the most important glucocorticoid, is synthesized by the adrenal cortex. It is in- volved in regulating protein and carbohydrate metabolism by promoting protein degrada- tion and the conversion of amino acids into glucose. As a result, the blood glucose level rises (see p. 152). Synthetic glucocorticoids (e. g., dexamethasone) are used in drugs due to their anti-inflammatory and immunosup- pressant effects. Aldosterone,a mineralocorticoid, is also synthesized in the adrenal gland. In the kid- neys, it promotes Na + resorption by inducing Na +/K + ATPase and Na + channels (see p. 328). At the same time, it leads to increased K + excretion. In this way, aldosterone indirectly increases blood pressure. Calcitriol is a derivative of vitamin D (see p. 364). On exposure to ultraviolet light, a precursor of the hormone can also arise in the skin. Calcitriol itself is synthesized in the kidneys (see p. 330). Calcitriol promotes the resorption of calcium in the intestine and in- creases the Ca 2+ level in the blood. Iodothyronines The thyroid hormone thyroxine (tetraiodo- thyronine, T4) and its active form triiodo- thyronine (T3) are derived from the amino acid tyrosine. The iodine atoms at positions 3 and 5 of the two phenol rings are character- istic of them. Post-translational synthesis of thyroxine takes place in the thyroid gland from tyrosine residues of the protein thyro- globulin, from which it is proteolytically cleaved before being released. Iodothyronines are the only organic molecules in the animal organism that contain iodine. They increase the basal metabolic rate, partly by regulating mitochondrial ATP synthesis. In addition, they promote embryonic development. 374 Hormones S ATP CO2 O2 H2O Ca2 2K 3Na 2K 3Na Proteolysis Protein synthesis Gluconeogenese Blut-Glucose Activity of the immune system Progesterone Hormone Ovaries Estradiol Ovaries Sites of action Uterus Prepares uterus for pregnancy Promotes implantation of fertilized egg Maintenance of pregnancy Development of mammary glands Stimulates proliferation of endometrium Testosterone Testes Cortisol Causes: Sexual differentiation to male phenotype Formation of ejaculate Spermatogenesis Development of secondary male sex characteristics e.g., skeleton, muscles, body hair Protein synthesis Calcitriol Thyroxine Thyroid gland Embryo Fetal development, growth, and maturation Basal metabolic rate Heat generation O2 consumption ATP, Heat Uterus and other organs Proteins Amino acids Glucose Aldosterone ADP+Pi Na retention K excretion Blood pressure Ca2 - and phosphate resorption Ca2 metabolism of bones ADP+Pi Actions Adrenal glands (cortex) Gut Intermediary metabolism Bones Adrenal glands (cortex) Site of formation A.

Biosynthesis of steroid hormones \u0003 All steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol. Thegonanecoreof cholesterol consists of 19 carbon atoms in four rings (A–D). The D ring carries a side chain of eight Catoms (see p. 54). The cholesterol required for biosynthesis of the steroid hormones is obtained from vari- ous sources. It is either taken up as a constit- uent of LDL lipoproteins (see p. 278) into the hormone-synthesizing glandular cells, or syn- thesized by glandular cells themselves from acetyl-CoA (see p. 172). Excess cholesterol is stored in the form of fatty acid esters in lipid droplets. Hydrolysis allows rapid mobilization of the cholesterol from this reserve again. Biosynthetic pathways. Only an overview of the synthesis pathways that lead to the individual hormones is shown here. Further details are given on p. 410. Among the reactions involved, hydroxyla- tions (H) are particularly numerous. These are catalyzed by specific monooxygenases (“hy- droxylases”) of the cytochrome P450 family (see p. 318). In addition, there are NADPH- dependent and NADP+-dependent hydrogena- tions (Y) and dehydrogenations (D), as well as cleavage and isomerization reactions (S, I). The estrogens have a special place among the ste- roid hormones, as they are the only ones that contain an aromatic A ring. When this is formed, catalyzed by aromatase, the angular methyl group (C-19) is lost. Pregnenolone is an important intermedi- ate in the biosynthesis of most steroid hor- mones. It is identical to cholesterol with the exception of a shortened and oxidized side chain. Pregnenolone is produced in three steps by hydroxylation and cleavage in the side chain. Subsequent dehydrogenation of the hydroxyl group at C-3 (b) and shifting of the double bond from C-5 to C-4 results in the gestagen progesterone. With the exception of calcitriol, all steroid hormones are derived from progesterone. Hy- droxylations of progesterone at C atoms 17, 21, and 11 lead to the glucocorticoid cortisol. Hydroxylation at C-17 is omitted during syn- thesis of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. Instead, the angular methyl group (C-18) is oxidized to the aldehyde group. During syn- thesis of the androgen testosterone from pro- gesterone, the side chain is completely re- moved. Aromatization of the A ring, as men- tioned above, finally leads to estradiol. On the way to calcitriol (vitamin D hor- mone; see p. 342), another double bond in the B ring of cholesterol is first introduced. Under the influence of UV light on the skin, the B ring is then photochemically cleaved, and the secosteroid cholecalciferol arises (vi- tamin D3; see p. 364). Two Cyt P450-depen- dent hydroxylations in the liver and kidneys produce the active vitamin D hormone (see p. 330). B. Inactivation of steroid hormones \u0003 Thesteroid hormones aremainlyinactivated in the liver, where they are either reduced or further hydroxylated and then conjugated with glucuronic acid or sulfate for excretion (see p. 316). The reduction reactions attack oxo groups and the double bond in ring A. A combination of several inactivation reactions gives rise to many different steroid metabo- lites that have lost most of their hormonal activity. Finally, they are excreted with the urine and also partly via the bile. Evidence of steroids and steroid metabolites in the urine is used to investigate the hormone metabo- lism. Further information Congenital defects in the biosynthesis of ste- roid hormones can lead to severe develop- mental disturbances. In the adrenogenital syndrome (AGS), which is relatively common, there is usually a defect in 21-hydroxylase, which is needed for synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone from progesterone. Reduced syn- thesis of this hormone leads to increased for- mation of testosterone, resulting in masculin- ization of female fetuses. With early diagno- sis, this condition can be avoided by providing the mother with hormone treatment before birth. 376 Hormones 1 H H D ID 2 H DH H S A H Y 3 H A C18 H S Y C19 HHHD Y D H H H/S C21 DSHH C27 HHH HO OH O OH HO CO CH3 O CO CH3 O OHC CO CH2OH HO O CO 2 HO OH CH OH HO OH HO OH CH2 HO OH O CO CH2OH HO OH HO AB CD O CO AB CD CH3 AB CD O O HYDHH Cholesterol Progesterone Androstenedione Cholesterol Estradiol Oxidation Conjugate formation Conjugate formation Hydroxylation A.

Inactivation of steroid hormones H: D: I: Y: S: A: 377Lipophilic hormones Mechanism of action A. Mechanism of action of lipophilic hormones \u0002 Lipophilic signaling substances include the steroid hormones, calcitriol, the iodothy- ronines (T3 and T4), and retinoic acid. These hormones mainly act in the nucleus of the target cells, where they regulate gene tran- scription in collaboration with their receptors and with the support of additional proteins (known as coactivators and mediators; see p. 244). There are several effects of steroid hormones that are not mediated by transcrip- tion control. These alternative pathways for steroid effects have not yet been fully ex- plained. In the blood, there are a number of trans- port proteins for lipophilic hormones (see p. 276). Only the free hormone is able to pen- etrate the membrane and enter the cell. The hormone encounters its receptor in the nu- cleus (and sometimes also in the cytoplasm). The receptors for lipophilic hormones are rare proteins. They occur in small numbers (10 3–104 molecules per cell) and show marked specificity and high affinity for the hormone (Kd =10 –8–10 –10 M). After binding to the hormone, the steroid receptors are able to bind as homodimers or heterodimers to control elements in the promoters of specific genes, from where they can influence the transcription of the affected genes—i. e., they act as transcription factors. The illustration shows the particularly well-investigated mechanism of action for cortisol, which is unusual to the extent that the hormone–receptor complex already arises in the cytoplasm. The free receptor is present in the cytoplasm as a monomer in complex with the chaperone hsp90 (see p. 232). Binding of cortisol to the complex leads to an allosteric conformational change in the receptor, which is then released from the hsp90 and becomes capable of DNA bind- ing as a result of dimerization. In the nucleus, the hormone–receptor complex binds to nucleotide sequences known as hormone response elements (HREs). These are short palindromic DNA seg- ments that usually promote transcription as enhancer elements (see p. 244). The illustra- tion shows the HRE for glucocorticoids (GRE; “n” stands for any nucleotide). Each hormone receptor only recognizes its “own” HRE and therefore only influences the transcription of genes containing that HRE. Recognition be- tween the receptor and HRE is based on in- teraction between the amino acid residues in the DNA-binding domain (B) and the relevant bases in the HRE (emphasized in color in the structure illustrated). As discussed on p. 244, the hormone recep- tor does not interact directly with the RNA polymerase, but rather—along with other transcription factors—with a coactivator/me- diator complex that processes all of the sig- nals and passes them on to the polymerase. In this way, hormonal effects lead within a pe- riod of minutes to hours to altered levels of mRNAs for key proteins in cellular processes (“cellular response”). B. Steroid receptors \u0003 The receptors for lipophilic signaling substan- ces all belong to one protein superfamily. They are constructed in a modular fashion from domains with various lengths and functions. Starting from the N terminal, these are: the regulatory domain, the DNA-binding domain, a nuclear localization sequence (see p. 228), and the hormone-binding domain (see p. 73D). The homology among receptors is particu- larly great in the area of the DNA-binding domain. Theproteins havecysteine-rich se- quences here that coordinatively bind zinc ions (A, Cys shown in yellow, Zn2+ in light blue). These centers, known as “zinc fingers” or “zinc clusters,” stabilize the domains and support their dimerization, but do not take part in DNA binding directly. As in other tran- scription factors (see p. 118), “recognition helices” are responsible for that. In addition to the receptors mentioned in A, the family of steroid receptors also includes the product of the oncogene erb-A(see p. 398), the receptor for the environmental toxin dioxin, and other proteins for which a distinct hormone ligand has not been identi- fied (known as “orphan receptors”). Several steroid receptors—e. g., the retinoic acid re- ceptor—form functional heterodimers with orphan receptors. 378 Hormones hsp 90 2x hsp 90 A/B C D E AnGGT CT nA AAnTCT A nG G TCTnAA A n T CT Hormone RNA polymerase Gene mRNA Protein Target cell Nucleus DNA-binding domain (dimer) bound to DNA Hormone receptor DNA Hormone response element (HRE) Heat-shock protein A.

Hormones with endocrine effects are synthesized in glandular cells and stored there in vesicles until they are released. As they are easily soluble, they do not need carrier proteins for transport in the blood. They bind on the plasma membrane of the target cells to receptors that pass the hor- monal signal on (signal transduction; see p. 384). Several hormones in this group have paracrine effects—i. e., they only act in the immediate vicinity of their site of synthesis (see p. 372). A. Signaling substances derived from amino acids \u0002 Histamine, serotonin, melatonin, and the cat- echolamines dopa, dopamine, norepineph- rine, and epinephrine are known as “biogenic amines.” They are produced from amino acids by decarboxylation and usually act not only as hormones, but also as neurotransmitters. Histamine,animportant mediator (local signaling substance) and neurotransmitter, is mainly stored in tissue mast cells and baso- philic granulocytes in the blood. It is involved in inflammatory and allergic reactions. “His- tamine liberators” such as tissue hormones, type E immunoglobulins (see p. 300), and drugs can release it. Histamine acts via vari- ous types of receptor. Binding to H1 receptors promotes contractionofsmoothmuscle inthe bronchia, and dilates the capillary vessels and increases their permeability. Via H2 receptors, histamine slows down the heart rate and pro- motes the formation of HCl in the gastric mu- cosa. In the brain, histamine acts as a neuro- transmitter. Epinephrine is a hormone synthesized in the adrenal glands from tyrosine (see p. 352). Its release is subject to neuronal con- trol. This “emergency hormone” mainly acts on the blood vessels, heart, and metabolism. It constricts the blood vessels and thereby in- creases blood pressure (via α1 and α2 recep- tors); it increases cardiac function (via β2 re- ceptors); it promotes the degradation of gly- cogen into glucose in the liver and muscles (via β 2 receptors); and it dilates the bronchia (also via β2 receptors). B. Examples of peptide hormones and proteohormones \u0002 Numerically the largest group of signaling substances, these arise by protein biosynthe- sis (see p. 382). The smallest peptide hor- mone, thyroliberin (362 Da), is a tripeptide. Proteohormones can reach masses of more than 20 kDa—e. g., thyrotropin (28 kDa). Sim- ilarities in the primary structures of many peptide hormones and proteohormones show that they are related to one another. They probably arose from common predeces- sors in thecourseof evolution. Thyroliberin (thyrotropin-releasing hor- mone, TRH) is one of the neurohormones of thehypothalamus (seep. 330). It stimulates pituitary gland cells to secrete thyrotropin (TSH). TRH consists of three amino acids, which are modified in characteristic ways (see p. 353). Thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hor- mone, TSH) and the related hormones lutropin (luteinizing hormone, LH) and follitropin (follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH) originate in the adenohypophysis. They are all dimeric glycoproteins with masses of around 28 kDa. Thyrotropin stimulates the synthesis and secretion of thyroxin by the thyroid gland. Insulin (for the structure, see p. 70) is pro- duced and released by the B cells of the pan- creas and is released when the glucose level rises. Insulin reduces the blood sugar level by promoting processes that consume glu- cose—e. g., glycolysis, glycogen synthesis, and conversion of glucose into fatty acids. By contrast, it inhibits gluconeogenesis and gly- cogen degradation. The transmission of the insulin signal in the target cells is discussed in greater detail on p. 388. Glucagon, a peptide of 29 amino acids, is a product of the A cells of the pancreas. It is the antagonist of insulin and, like insulin, mainly influences carbohydrate and lipid metabo- lism. Its effects are each opposite to those of insulin. Glucagon mainly acts via the second messengercAMP(see p. 384). 380 Hormones HCl N N H CH2 CH2H3N CH2H2N CH OH OH HO CH3 Thyrotropin secretion Neurotransmitter action Synthesis and secretion of thyroxine Glucose uptake by cells Blood glucose Storage compounds: formation degradation Glycogenolysis Gluconeogenesis Blood glucose Ketone body formation Width of bronchi Capillaries: width permeability Gastric acid secretion by parietal cells Width of blood vessels Blood pressure Cardiac output Metabolism: Glycogenolysis Blood glucose Lipolysis Actions Thyroliberin (TRH) 3 AA Hypothalamus TSHBrain Thyrotropin (TSH) α chain 92 AA β chain 112 AA Adeno- hypophysis Thyroid gland Thyroxine Glucose Pancreas B cells Glycogen Glucose Proteins Pancreas A cells Glycogen Glucose Amino acids Fats Fatty acids Amino acids Insulin A chain 21 AA B chain 30 AA Glucagon 29 AA Histamine Histamine stores LungsMast cell Basophilic granulocyte Stomach Epinephrine Adrenal glands (medulla) Heart Muscle LiverAdipose tissue A.

Amino acid derivatives arise in special metabolic pathways (see p. 352) or through post-translational modi- fication (see p. 374). Proteohormones, like all proteins, result from translation in the ribo- some (see p. 250). Small peptide hormones and neuropeptides, most of which only con- sist of 3–30 amino acids, are released from precursor proteins by proteolytic degradation. A. Biosynthesis \u0003 The illustration shows the synthesis and pro- cessing of the precursor protein proopiome- lanocortin (POMC) as an example of the bio- synthesis of small peptides with signaling functions. POMC arises in cells of the adeno- hypophysis, and after processing in the rER and Golgi apparatus, it supplies the opiate- like peptides met-enkephalin and -endor- phin (implying “opio-”; see p. 352), three melanocyte-stimulating hormones (α-, β-and γ-MSH, implying “melano-”), and the glan- dotropic hormone corticotropin (ACTH, im- plying “-cortin”). Additional products of POMC degradation include two lipotropins with catabolic effects in the adipose tissue (β-and γ-LPH). Some of the peptides mentioned are over- lapping in the POMC sequence. For example, additional cleavage of ACTH gives rise to α- MSH and corticotropin-like intermediary peptide (CLIP). Proteolytic degradation of β- LPH provides γ-LPH and β-endorphin. The latter can be further broken down to yield met-enkephalin, while γ-LPH can still give rise to β-MSH (not shown). Due to the numer- ous derivative products with biological activ- ity that it has, POMC is also known as a poly- protein. Which end product is formed and in what amounts depends on the activity of the proteinases in the ER that catalyze the indi- vidual cleavages. The principles underlying protein synthe- sis and protein maturation (see pp. 230–233) can besummeduponceagain usingthe ex- ample of POMC: [1] As a result of transcription of the POMC gene and maturation of the hnRNA, amature mRNA consisting of some 1100 nucleotides arises, which is modified at both ends (see p. 246). This mRNA codes for prepro-POMC— i. e., a POMC protein that still has a signal peptidefor theER at the N terminus (see p. 230). [2] Prepro-POMC arises through translation in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER). The growing peptide chain is introduced into the ER with the help of a signal peptide. [3] Cleavage of the signal peptide and other modifications in the ER (formation of disulfide bonds, glycosylation, phosphorylation) give rise to thematureprohormone(“pro-POMC”). [4] The neuropeptides and hormones men- tioned are now formed by limited proteolysis andstoredin vesicles. Releasefrom these vesicles takes place by exocytosis when needed. The biosynthesis of peptide hormones and proteohormones, as well as their secretion, is controlledbyhigher-orderregulatorysys- tems (see p. 372). Calcium ions are among thesubstancesinvolvedin thisregulation as second messengers; an increase in calcium ions stimulates synthesis and secretion. B. Degradation and inactivation \u0002 Degradation of peptide hormones often starts in the blood plasma or on the vascular walls; it is particularly intensive in the kidneys. Several peptides that contain disulfide bonds (e. g., insulin) can be inactivated by reductive cleavage of the disulfide bonds (1). Peptides and proteins are also cleaved by peptidases, starting from one end of the pep- tide by exopeptidases (2), or in the middle of it by proteinases (endopeptidases, 3). Proteoly- sis gives rise to a variety of hormone frag- ments, several of which are still biologically active. Some peptide hormones and proteo- hormones are removed from the blood by binding to their receptors with subsequent endocytosis of the hormone–receptor com- plex (4). They are thenbrokendownin the lysosomes. All of the degradation reactions lead to amino acids, which become available to the metabolism again. 382 Hormones 87 ~3 900 151 ~2 800 1 2 3 4 ACTH β-MSH 210–214190–207 β-LPHACTH 5` γ-MSH ACTH β-LPH 50–6 112–150 153–236 γ-MSH α-MSH-CLIP γ-LPH P P P α-MSH CLIP γ-LPH 112–124 129–150 153–207 220–236 AAAA---meGppp 3` P A.

These bind the hormone on the outside of the cell and trigger a new second signal on the inside by altering their conformation. In the interior of the cell, this secondary signal influences the activity of enzymes or ion channels. Via further steps, switching of the metabolism, changes in the cytoskeleton, and activation or inhibition of transcription factors can occur (“signal transduction”) can occur. A. Mechanisms of action \u0002 Receptors are classified into three different types according to their structure (see also p. 224): 1. 1-Helix receptors (left) are proteins that span the membrane with only one α-helix. On their inner (cytoplasmic) side, they have do- mains with allosterically activatable enzyme activity. In most cases, these are tyrosine kinases. Insulins (see p. 388), growth factors, and cytokines (see p. 392), for example, act via 1- helix receptors. Binding of the signaling sub- stance leads to activation of internal kinase activity (in some cases, dimerization of the receptor is needed for this). The activated kinase phosphorylates itself using ATP (auto- phosphorylation), and also phosphorylates ty- rosine residues of other proteins (known as receptor substrates). Adaptor proteins that recognize the phosphotyrosine residues bind to the phosphorylated proteins (see pp. 388, 392). They pass the signal on to other protein kinases. 2. Ion channels (center). These receptors contain ligand-gated ion channels. Binding of the signaling substance opens the channels for ions such as Na +,K+,Ca 2+,and Cl –.This mechanism is mainly used by neurotrans- mitters such as acetylcholine (nicotinic recep- tor; see p. 224) and GABA (A receptor; see p. 354). 3. 7-Helix receptors (serpentine receptors, right) represent a large group of membrane pro- teins that transfer the hormone or transmitter signal,with the helpofG proteins (see below), to effector proteins that alter the concentrations of ions and second messengers (see B). B. Signal transduction by G proteins \u0002 G proteins transfer signals from 7-helix re- ceptors to effector proteins (see above). G protein are heterotrimers consisting of three different types of subunit (α, β,and γ;see p. 224). The α-subunit can bind GDP or GTP (hence the name “G protein”) and has GTPase activity. Receptor-coupled G proteins are re- lated to other GTP-binding proteins such as Ras (see pp. 388, 398) and EF-Tu (see p. 252). G proteins are divided into several types, depending on their effects. Stimulatory G pro- teins (Gs) are widespread. They activate ad- enylate cyclases (see below) or influence ion channels. Inhibitory G proteins (Gi) inhibit ad- enylate cyclase. G proteins in the Gq family activate another effector enzyme—phospholi- pase c (see p. 386). Binding of the signaling substance to a 7- helix receptor alters the receptor conforma- tion in such a way that the corresponding G protein can attach on the inside of the cell. This causes the α-subunit of the G protein to exchange bound GDP for GTP (1). The G pro- tein then separates from the receptor and dissociates into an α-subunit and a βγ-unit. Both of these components bind to other mem- brane proteins and alter their activity; ion channels are opened or closed, and enzymes are activated or inactivated. In thecaseof the β 2-catecholamine recep- tor (illustrated here), the α-subunit of the Gs protein, by binding to adenylate cyclase, leads to the synthesis of the second messenger cAMP. cAMP activates protein kinase A, which in turn activates or inhibits other proteins (2; see p.120). The βγ-unit of the G protein stimulates a kinase (βARK, not shown), which phosphory- latesthe receptor. Thisreduces itsaf nity for the hormone and leads to binding of the blocking protein arrestin. The internal GTPase activity of the α-subunit hydrolyzes the bound GTP to GDP within a period of seconds to minutes, and thereby terminates the action of the G proteinonthe adenylate cyclase (3). 384 Hormones PK-A PK-G PK-C cAMP cGMP DAG InsP3 Ca2 NO Ca2 Na K Cl 1. 2. cAMP GTP ATP PP GDP P ATP ADP GDP 3. 1 1 1 1 P P + u.a.

They arise from easily available substrates and only have a short half-life. The most important second messengers are cAMP, cGMP, Ca 2+,in- ositol triphosphate (InsP3), diacylglycerol (DAG), and nitrogen monoxide (NO). A. Cyclic AMP \u0002 Metabolism. The nucleotide cAMP (adenosine 3\u0001,5\u0001-cyclic monophosphate) is synthesized by membrane-bound adenylate cyclases [1] on the inside of the plasma membrane. The adenylate cyclases are a family of enzymes that cyclize ATP to cAMP by cleaving diphos- phate (PPi). The degradation of cAMP to AMP is catalyzed by phosphodiesterases [2], which are inhibited by methylxanthines such as caf- feine, for example. By contrast, insulin acti- vates the esterase and thereby reduces the cAMP level (see p. 388). Adenylate cyclase activity is regulated by G proteins (Gs and Gi), whichin turnare con- trolled by extracellular signals via 7-helix re- ceptors (see p. 384). Ca 2+-calmodulin (see be- low) also activates specific adenylate cyclases. Action. cAMP is an allosteric effector of protein kinase A (PK-A, [3]). In the inactive state, PK-A is a heterotetramer (C2R2), the catalytic subunits of which (C) are blocked by regulatory units (R; autoinhibition). When cAMP binds to the regulatory units, theC units separatefrom the R units and become enzymatically active. Active PK-A phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of more than 100 different proteins, enzymes, and transcription factors. In addition to cAMP, cGMP also acts as a second messenger. It is involved in sight (see p. 358) and in the signal transduction of NO (see p. 388). B. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol \u0002 Type Gq Gproteinsactivate phospholipase C [4]. This enzyme creates two second messen- gers from the double-phosphorylated mem- brane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PInsP2), i. e., inositol 1,4,5-tris- phosphate (InsP3), which is soluble, and diac- ylglycerol (DAG). InsP3 migrates to the endo- plasmic reticulum (ER), where it opens Ca 2+ channels that allow Ca 2+ to flow into the cy- toplasm (see C). By contrast, DAG, which is lipophilic, remains in the membrane, where it activates type C protein kinases,which phosphorylate proteins in the presence of Ca 2+ ions and thereby pass the signal on. C. Calcium ions \u0002 Calcium level. Ca 2+ (see p. 342) is a signaling substance. The concentration of Ca 2+ ions in the cytoplasm is normally very low (10–100 nM),asitiskeptdown byATP- driven Ca 2+ pumps and Na +/Ca 2+ exchangers. In addition, many proteins in the cytoplasm and organelles bind calcium and thus act as Ca 2+ buffers. Specific signals (e. g., an action potential or second messenger such as InsP3 or cAMP) can trigger a sudden increase in the cytoplasmic Ca 2+ level to 500–1000 nM by opening Ca 2+ channels in the plasma membrane or in the membranes of the endoplasmic or sarco- plasmic reticulum. Ryanodine, aplant sub- stance, acts in this way on a specific channel in the ER. In the cytoplasm, the Ca 2+ level always only rises very briefly (Ca 2+ “spikes”), as prolonged high concentrations in the cyto- plasm have cytotoxic effects. Calcium effects. The biochemical effects of Ca 2+ in thecytoplasm aremediatedbyspecial Ca 2+-binding proteins (“calcium sensors”). These include the annexins, calmodulin, and troponin C in muscle (see p. 334). Calmodulin is a relatively small protein (17 kDa) that oc- curs in all animal cells. Binding of four Ca 2+ ions (light blue) converts it into a regulatory element. Via a dramatic conformational change (cf. 2a and 2b), Ca 2+-calmodulin enters into interaction with other proteins and mod- ulates their properties. Using this mechanism, Ca 2+ ions regulate the activity of enzymes, ion pumps, and components of the cytoskeleton. 386 Hormones 1 cAMPATP PPi H2O AMP2 3 1 2 P ATP ADP 3 5' 3' N CH N C C C N HC N NH2 O CH2 O H OOH H HH P O OGiGs Na ATP ADP ER/SR ATP ATP ADP 500-1000 nM ca. 2 500 000 nM 10-100 nM Pi Pi Ca2 Ca2 Ca2 Ca2 Ca2 a b cAMP InsP3 P 4 H2O 4 P P O O OH O OH H H H H OH P HH P P Ca2 InsP3 Ca2 Ca2 A.

The mediator nitrogen monoxide (NO) is also clinically important, as it regulates vascular caliber and thus the body’s perfusion with blood (see B). A. Insulin: signal transduction \u0003 The diverse effects of insulin (see p. 160) are mediated by protein kinases that mutually activate each other in the form of enzyme cascades. At the end of this chain there are kinases that influence gene transcription in the nucleus by phosphorylating target pro- teins, or promote the uptake of glucose and its conversion into glycogen. The signal trans- duction pathways involved have not yet been fully explained. They are presented here in a simplified form. The insulin receptor (top) is a dimer with subunits that have activatable tyrosine kinase domains in the interior of the cell (see p. 224). Binding of the hormone increases the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor, which then phosphorylates itself and other proteins (receptor substrates) at various tyrosine re- sidues. Adaptor proteins, which conduct the signal further, bind to the phosphotyrosine residues. The effects of insulin on transcription are shown on the left of the illustration. Adaptor proteins Grb-2 and SOS (“son of sevenless”) bind to the phosphorylated IRS (insulin-re- ceptor substrate) and activate the G protein Ras (named after its gene, the oncogene ras; seep. 398). Ras activates theprotein kinase Raf (another oncogene product). Raf sets in motion a phosphorylation cascade that leads via the kinases MEK and ERK (also known as MAPK, “mitogen-activated protein kinase”) to the phosphorylation of transcription factors in the nucleus. Some of the effects of insulin on the carbo- hydrate metabolism (right part of the illustra- tion) are possible without protein synthesis. In addition to Grb-2, another dimeric adaptor protein can also bind to phosphorylated IRS. This adaptor protein thereby acquires phos- phatidylinositol-3-kinase activity (PI3K)and, in the membrane, phosphorylates phospholi- pids from the phosphatidylinositol group (see p. 50) at position 3. Protein kinase PDK-1 binds to these reaction products, becoming activated itself and in turn activating protein kinase B (PK-B). This has several effects. In a manner not yet fully understood, PK-B leads to the fusion with the plasma membrane of vesicles that contain the glucose transporter Glut-4. This results in inclusion of Glut-4 in the membrane and thus to increased glucose uptake into the muscles and adiposetissue(seep. 160). In addition, PK-B inhibits glycogen synthase kin- ase 3 (GSK-3) by phosphorylation. As GSK-3 in turn inhibits glycogen synthase by phosphor- ylation (see p. 120), its inhibition by PK-B leads to increased glycogen synthesis. Protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1)converts glycogen syn- thase into its active form by dephosphoryla- tion (see p. 120). PP-1 is also activated by insulin. B. Nitrogen monoxide (NO) as a mediator \u0003 Nitrogen monoxide (NO) is a short-lived rad- ical that functions as a locally acting mediator (see p. 370). In a complex reaction, NO arises from argi- nine in the endothelial cells of the blood ves- sels [1]. The trigger for this is Ca 2+-calmodulin (see p. 386), which forms when there is an increase in the cytoplasmic Ca 2+ level. NO diffuses from the endothelium into the underlying vascular muscle cells, where it leads, as a result of activation of guanylate cyclase [2], to the formation of the second messenger cGMP (see pp. 358, 384). Finally, by activating a special protein kinase (PK-G), cGMP triggers relaxation of the smooth muscle and thus dilation of the vessels. The effects of atrionatriuretic peptide (ANP;see p. 328) in reducing blood pressure are also mediated by cGMP-induced vasodilation. In this case, cGMP is formed by the guanylate cyclase activity of the ANP receptor. Further information The drug nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate), whichis used inthe treatment of angina pectoris, releases NO in the bloodstream and thereby leads to better perfusion of cardiac muscle. 388 Hormones Ras SOS Grb-2 IRS-1 P P P P P P NA P NA P P α α β β PDK-1 PK-B PP-1 GSK-3 Glut-4 Ca2 InsP3 PK-G ANP NO·NO· P 5' 3' O CH2 O H OOH H HH P O O cGMP GTP GTP Ca2 ER 1 Ca2 ?

As mediators, they influencea largenumber ofphysiological processes (see below). Eicosanoid metabolism is therefore an important drug target. As short-lived substances, eicosanoids only act in the vicinity of their site of synthesis (para- crine effect; see p. 372). A. Eicosanoids \u0003 Biosynthesis. Almost all of the body’s cells form eicosanoids. Membrane phospholipids that contain the polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (20:4; see p. 48) provide the starting material. Initially, phospholipase A2 [1] releases the arachidonate moiety from these phospholi- pids. The activity of phospholipase A2 is strictly regulated. It is activated by hormones and other signals via G proteins. The arachidonate released is a signaling substance itself. How- ever, its metabolites are even more important. Two different pathways lead from arachi- donate to prostaglandins, prostacyclins,and thromboxanes,on the onehand, or leuko- trienes on the other. The key enzyme for the first pathway is prostaglandin synthase [2]. Using up O2, it catalyzes in a two-step reac- tion the cyclization of arachidonate to prosta- glandin H2, the parent substance for the pros- taglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) irreversibly ace- tylates a serine residue near the active center of prostaglandin synthase, so that access for substrates is blocked (see below). As a result of the action of lipoxygenases [3], hydroxyfatty acids and hydroperoxyfatty acids are formed from arachidonate, from which elimination of water and various conversion reactions give rise to the leukotrienes. The for- mulae only show one representative from each of the various groups of eicosanoids. Effects. Eicosanoids act via membrane re- ceptors in the immediate vicinity of their site of synthesis, both on the synthesizing cell itself (autocrine action) and on neighboring cells (paracrine action). Many of their effects are mediated by the second messengers cAMP and cGMP. The eicosanoids have a very wide range of physiological effects. As they can stimulate or inhibit smooth-muscle contraction, depend- ing on the substance concerned, they affect blood pressure, respiration, and intestinal and uterine activity, among other properties. In the stomach, prostaglandins inhibit HCl se- cretion via Gi proteins (see p. 270). At the same time, they promote mucus secretion, which protects the gastric mucosa against the acid. In addition, prostaglandins are in- volved in bone metabolism and in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. In the immune system, prostaglandins are impor- tant in the inflammatory reaction. Among other things, they attract leukocytes to the site of infection. Eicosanoids are also deci- sively involved in the development of pain and fever. The thromboxanes promote throm- bocyte aggregation and other processes in- volved in hemostasis (see p. 290). Metabolism. Eicosanoids are inactivated within a period of seconds to minutes. This takes place by enzymatic reduction of double bonds and dehydrogenation of hydroxyl groups. As a result of this rapid degradation, their range is very limited. Further information Acetylsalicylic acid and related non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) selectively inhibit the cyclooxygenase activity of prosta- glandin synthase [2] and consequently the synthesis of most eicosanoids. This explains their analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic effects. Frequent side effects of NSAIDs also result from inhibition of eicosanoid synthesis. Forexample, theyimpairhemostasisbecause the synthesis of thromboxanes by thrombo- cytes is inhibited. In the stomach, NSAIDs in- crease HCl secretion and at the same time inhibit the formation of protective mucus. Long-term NSAID use can therefore damage the gastric mucosa. 390 Hormones Ser COO CH3 COO OH SCys CH3 Gly COO CH3 O O HOHH H CH3 HOHHHO O COO COO CH3 HOHH HHO HO COO CH3 HOHH H O HO HO Arachidonic acid Hormones and other signals Lysophospholipid Prostaglandin synthase Hydroxy- and Hydroperoxy fatty acids Essential fatty acids: Linoleic acid Linolenic acid Thromboxane B2Prostaglandin F2αProstacyclin I2 Leukotriene D4 Contraction of smooth muscle Biosynthesis of steroid hormones Gastric juice secretion Hormone-controlled lipases Thrombocyte aggregation Pain production Inflammatory response Effects: Stimulation of Prostaglandin H2 Arachidonate Phospholipid Inclusion in Heme Arachidonate Peroxidase center Cyclooxy- genase channel Arachidonate lipoxygenases 1.13.11. n Prostaglandin H-synthase [heme] (dioxygenase + peroxidase) 1.14.99.1 Phospholipase A2 3.1.1.4 Prosta- glandin synthase Lipoxygenase Prostaglandin H2 A.

Cytokines \u0002 Cytokines are hormone-like peptides and pro- teins with signaling functions, which are syn- thesized and released by cells of the immune system and other cell types. Their numerous biological functions operate in three areas: they regulate the development and homeosta- sis of the immune system; they control the hematopoietic system; and they are involved in non-specific defense, influencing inflamma- tory processes, blood coagulation, and blood pressure. In general, cytokines regulate the growth, differentiation, and survival of cells. They are also involved in regulating apoptosis (see p. 396). There is an extremely large number of cy- tokines; only the most important representa- tives are listed opposite. The cytokines include interleukins (IL), lymphokines, mono- kines, chemokines, interferons (IFN), and col- ony-stimulating factors (CSF). Via interleukins, immune cells stimulate the proliferation and activity of other immune cells (see p. 294). Interferons are used medically in the treat- ment of viral infections and other diseases. Although cytokines rarely show structural homologies with each other, their effects are often very similar. The cytokines differ from hormones (see p. 370) only in certain re- spects: they are released by many different cells, rather than being secreted by defined glands, and they regulate a wider variety of target cells than the hormones. B. Signal transduction in the cytokines \u0003 As peptides or proteins, the cytokines are hy- drophilic signaling substances that act by binding to receptors on the cell surface (see p. 380). Binding of a cytokine to its receptor (1) leads via several intermediate steps (2 –5) to the activation of transcription of specific genes (6). In contrast to the receptors for insulin and growth factors (see p. 388), the cytokine re- ceptors (with a few exceptions) have no ty- rosine kinase activity. After binding of cyto- kine (1), they associate with one another to form homodimers, join together with other signal transduction proteins (STPs) to form dimers, or promote dimerization of other STPs (2). Class I cytokine receptors interact with three different STPs (gp130, βc,and γc). The STPs themselves do not bind cytokines, but conduct the signal to tyrosine kinases (3). The fact that different cytokines can activate thesameSTP via their receptors explains the overlapping biological activity of some cyto- kines. As an example of the signal transduction pathway in cytokines, the illustration shows the way in which the IL-6 receptor,after bind- ing its ligand IL-6 (1), induces the dimeriza- tion of the STP gp130 (2). The dimeric gp130 binds cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases from the Jak family (“Janus kinases,” with two kinase centers) and activates them (3). The Janus kinases phosphorylate cytokine receptors, STPs, and various cytoplasmic proteins that conduct the signal further. In addition, they phosphorylate transcription factors known as STATs (“signal transducers and activators of transcription”). STATs are among the proteins that have an SH2 domain and are able to bind phosphotyrosine residues (see p. 388). They therefore bind to cytokine receptors that have been phosphorylated by Janus kinases. When STATs are then also phosphorylated them- selves (4), they are converted into their active form and become dimers (5). Aftertransferto the nucleus, they bind—along with auxiliary proteins as transcription factors—to the pro- moters of inducible genes and in this way regulate their transcription (6). The activity of the cytokine receptors is terminated by protein phosphatases, which hydrolytically cleave the phosphotyrosine residues. Several cytokine receptors are able to lose their ligand-binding extracellular do- main by proteolysis (not shown). The extra- cellular domain then appears in the blood, where it competes for cytokines. This reduces theeffective cytokineconcentration. 392 Hormones 6 STAT 5 4 IL-6 STAT gp 130 1 432 5 ATP ADP ATP ADP 43 5 Tyr Transcriptional controlNucleus A. Cytokines B.

Cell cycle \u0002 Proliferating cells undergo a cycle of division (the cell cycle), which lasts approximately 24 hours in mammalian cells in cell culture. The cycle is divided into four different phases (G1,S, G2,and M—in that sequence). Fully differentiated animal cells only divide rarely. These cells are in the so-called G0 phase,in which they canremainpermanently. Some G0 cells return to the G1 phase again under the influence of mitogenic signals (growth factors, cytokines, tumor viruses, etc.), and after crossing a control point (G1 to S), enter a new cycle. DNA is replicated (see p. 240) during the Sphase, and new chroma- tin is formed. Particularly remarkable in mor- phological terms is the actual mitosis (M phase), in which the chromosomes separate and two daughter cells areformed. TheMand S phases are separated by two segments known as the G1 and G2 phases (the G stands for “gap”). In the G1 phase, the duration of which can vary, the cell grows by de novo synthesis of cell components. Together, the G1,G0,S, and G2 phases are referred to as the interphase, which alternates in the cell cycle with the short M phase. B. Control of the cell cycle \u0003 Theprogression of thecellcycle is regulated by interconversion processes. Ineachphase, special Ser/Thr-specific protein kinases are formed, which are known as cyclin-depen- dent kinases (CDKs). This term is used be- causethey haveto bindan activator protein (cyclin) in order to become active. At each control point in the cycle, specific CDKs asso- ciate with equally phase-specific cyclins. If there are no problems (e. g., DNA damage), the CDK–cyclin complex is activated by phos- phorylation and/or dephosphorylation. The activated complex in turn phosphorylates transcription factors, which finally lead to the formation of the proteins that are re- quired in the cell cycle phase concerned (en- zymes, cytoskeleton components, other CDKs, and cyclins). The activity of the CDK–cyclin complex is then terminated again by pro- teolytic cyclin degradation. The above outline of cell cycle progression canbe examined here inmore detailusing the G2–M transitionas anexample. Entry of animal cells into mitosis is based on the “mitosis-promoting factor” (MPF). MPF consists of CDK1 (cdc2) and cyclin B.The in- tracellular concentration of cyclin B increases constantly until mitosis starts, and then de- clines again rapidly (top left). MPF is initially inactive, because CDK1 is phosphorylated and cyclin B is dephosphorylated (top center). The M phase is triggered when a protein phos- phatase [1] dephosphorylates the CDK while cyclin B is phosphorylated by a kinase [2]. In its active form, MPF phosphorylates various proteins that have functions in mitosis—e. g., histone H1 (see p. 238), components of the cytoskeleton such as the laminins in the nu- clear membrane, transcription factors, mitotic spindle proteins, and various enzymes. When mitosis has been completed, cyclin B is marked with ubiquitin and broken down proteolytically by proteasomes (see p. 176). Protein phosphatases then regain control and dephosphorylate the proteins involved in mitosis. This returns the cell to the inter- phase. Further information The G1–S transition (not shown) is particu- larly important for initiating the cell cycle. It is triggered by the CDK4–cyclin D complex, which by phosphorylating the protein pRb releases the transcription factor E2F previ- ously bound to pRb. This activates the tran- scription of genes needed for DNA replication. If the DNA is damaged by mutagens or ion- izing radiation, the protein p53 initially delays entry into the S phase. If the DNA repair sys- tem (see p. 256) does not succeed in remov- ing the DNA damage, p53 forces the cell into apoptosis (seep. 396). Thegenes coding for pRband p53belongto the tumor-suppressor genes (see p. 398). In many tumors (see p. 400), these genes are in fact damaged by mutation. 394 Growth and development P P AA PP P P P P P A PP P M MMM 2 11 11 2 11 12h 0 h 8 h 4 h P P A. Cell cycle B.

Cell proliferation and apoptosis \u0002 The number of cells in any tissue is mainly regulated by two processes—cell proliferation and physiologicalcelldeath, apoptosis.Both of these processes are regulated by stimulatory and inhibitory factors that act in solute form (growth factors and cytokines) or are pre- sented in bound form on the surface of neigh- boring cells (see below). Apoptosis is genetically programmed cell death, which leads to “tidy” breakdown and disposal of cells. Morphologically, apoptosis is characterized by changes in the cell mem- brane (with the formation of small blebs known as “apoptotic bodies”), shrinking of the nucleus, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation of DNA. Macrophages and other phagocytic cells recognize apoptotic cells and remove them by phagocytosis with- out inflammatory phenomena developing. Cell necrosis (not shown) should be distin- guished from apoptosis. In cell necrosis, cell death is usually due to physical or chemical damage. Necrosis leads to swelling and burst- ing of the damagedcells andoften triggers an inflammatory response. Thegrowthoftissue(or,moreprecisely, the number of cells) is actually regulated by apoptosis. In addition, apoptosis allows the elimination of unwanted or superfluous cells—e. g., during embryonic development or in the immune system. The contraction of the uterus after birth is also based on apop- tosis. Diseased cells are also eliminated by apoptosis—e. g., tumor cells, virus-infected cells, and cells with irreparably damaged DNA. An everyday example of this is the peel- ing of the skin after sunburn. B. Regulation of apoptosis \u0003 Apoptosis can be triggered by a number of different signals that use various transmission pathways. Other signaling pathways prevent apoptosis. At the center of the apoptotic process lies a group of specialized cysteine-containing as- partate proteinases (see p. 176), known as cas- pases. These mutually activate one another, creating an enzyme cascade resembling the cascade involved in blood coagulation (see p. 290). Other enzymes in this group, known as effector caspases,cleave cell components after being activated—e. g., laminin in the nu- clear membrane and snRP proteins (see p. 246)—or activate special DNases which then fragment the nuclear DNA. An important trigger for apoptosis is known as the Fas system.Thisisusedby cytotoxic T cells, for example, which eliminate infected cells in this way (top left). Most of the body’s cells have Fas receptors (CD 95) on their plasma membrane. If a T cell is activated by contact with an MHC presenting a viral peptide (see p. 296), binding of its Fas ligands occurs on the target cell’s Fas recep- tors. Via the mediator protein FADD (“Fas- associated death domain”), this activates cas- pase-8 inside the cell, setting in motion the apoptotic process. Another trigger is provided by tumor ne- crosis factor- (TNF-α), which acts via a sim- ilar protein (TRADD) and supports the endog- enous defense system against tumors by in- ducing apoptosis. Caspase-8 activates the effector caspases either directly, or indirectly by promoting the cytochrome c (see p. 140) from mitochon- dria. Once in the cytoplasm, cytochrome c binds to and activates the protein Apaf-1 (not shown) and thus triggers the caspase cascade. Apoptotic signals can also come from the cell nucleus. If irreparable DNA dam- age is present, the p53 protein (see p. 394)—the product of a tumor suppressor gene—promotes apoptosis and thus helps eliminate the defective cell. There are also inhibitory factors that op- pose the signals that activate apoptosis. These include bcl-2 and related proteins. The ge- nomesof several virusesinclude genesfor this type of protein. The genes are expressed by the host cell and (to the benefit of the virus) prevent the host cell from being pre- maturely eliminated by apoptosis. 396 Growth and development Fas ligand Fas receptor TNF-α bcl-2 proteinp53 protein snRNA proteins Laminin Apoptosis Cytotoxic T cell A.

They were first discovered as viral (v-) oncogenes in retroviruses that cause tumors (tumor viruses). Viruses of this type (see p. 404) sometimes incorporate genes from the host cell into their own genome. If these genes are reincorporated into the host DNA again during later infection, tumors can then be caused in rare cases. Although virus- related tumors are rare, research into them has made a decisive contribution to our understanding of oncogenes and their func- tioning. A. Proto-oncogenes: biological role \u0002 The cellular form of oncogenes (known as c- oncogenes or proto-oncogenes) code for pro- teins involved in controlling growth and dif- ferentiation processes. They only become on- cogenes if their sequence has been altered by mutations (see p. 256), deletions, and other processes, or when excessive amounts of the gene products have been produced as a result of overexpression. Overexpression can occur when amplifica- tion leads to numerous functional copies of therespectivegene, or when thegene falls under the influence of a highly active pro- moter (see p. 244). If the control of oncogene expression by tumor suppressor genes (see p. 394) is also disturbed, transformation and unregulated proliferation of the cells can oc- cur. A single activated oncogene does not usually lead to a loss of growth control. It only occurs when over the course of time mutations and regulation defects accumulate in oneand the samecell. If theimmunesys- tem does not succeed in eliminating the transformed cell, it can over the course of months or years grow into a macroscopically visible tumor. B. Oncogene products: biochemical functions \u0002 A feature common to all oncogenes is the fact that they code for proteins involved in signal transduction processes. Thegenes aredesig- nated using three-letter abbreviations that usually indicate the origin of the viral gene andare printedin italics (e. g., myc for mye- locytomatosis, a viral disease in birds). Onco- gene products can be classified into the fol- lowing groups according to their functions. 1. Ligands such as growth factors and cytokines, which promote cell proliferation. 2. Membrane receptors of the 1-helix type with tyrosine kinase activity, which can bind growth factors and hormones (see p. 394). 3. GTP-binding proteins. This group includes the G proteins in the strict sense and re- lated proteins such as Ras (see p. 388), the product of the oncogene c-ras. 4. Receptors for lipophilic hormones mediate the effects of steroid hormones and related signaling substances. They regulate the transcription of specific genes (see p. 378). The products of several oncogenes (e. g., erbA) belong to this superfamily of ligand-controlled transcription factors. 5. Nuclear tumor suppressors inhibit return to the cell cycle in fully differentiated cells. The genes that code for these proteins are referred to as anti-oncogenes due to this function. On the role of p53 and pRb, see p. 394. 6. DNA-binding proteins. Awhole series of oncogenes code for transcription factors. Particularly important for cell proliferation are myc, as well as fos and jun. The protein products of the latter two genes form the transcription factor AP-1 as a heterodimer (see p. 244). 7. Protein kinases play a central role in intra- cellular signal transduction. By phosphor- ylating proteins, they bring about altera- tions in biological activity that can only be reversed again by the effects of protein phosphatases. The interplay between pro- tein phosphorylation by protein kinases and dephosphorylation by protein phos- phatases (interconversion) serves to regu- late the cell cycle (see p. 394) and other important processes. The protein kinase Raf is also involved in the signal transduc- tion of insulin (see p. 388). 398 Growth and development GTP Ca2 P GTP P P A. Proto-oncogenes: biological role B.

Division behavior of cells \u0002 The body’s cells are normally subject to strict “social” control. They only divide until they come into contact with neighboring cells; cell division then ceases due to contact inhibition. Exceptions to this rule include embryonic cells, cells of the intestinal epithelium (where the cells are constantly being replaced), cells in the bonemarrow (whereformation of blood cells takes place), and tumor cells. Un- controlled cell proliferation is an important indicator of the presence of a tumor. While normal cells in cell culture only divide 20–60 times, tumor cells are potentially immortal and are not subject to contact inhibition. In medicine, a distinction is made between benign and malignant tumors. Benign tumors consist of slowly growing, largely differenti- ated cells. By contrast, malignant tumors show rapid, invasive growth and tend to form metastases (dissemination of daughter lesions). The approximately 100 different types of tumor that exist are responsible for more than 20% of deaths in Europe and North America. B. Transformation \u0002 The transition of a normal cell into a tumor cell is referred to as transformation. Normal cells have all the characteristics of fully differentiated cells specialized for a par- ticular function. Their division is inhibited and they are usually in the G0 phase of the cell cycle (see p. 394). Their external shape is variable and is determined by a strongly structured cytoskeleton. In contrast, tumor cells divide without in- hibition and are often de-differentiated—i. e., they have acquired some of the properties of embryonic cells. The surface of these cells is altered, andthisisparticularly evident in a disturbance of contact inhibition by neighbor- ing cells. The cytoskeleton of tumor cells is also restructured and often reduced, giving them a rounded shape. The nuclei of tumor cells can be atypical in terms of shape, num- ber, and size. Tumor markers are clinically important for detecting certain tumors. These are proteins that are formed with increasing frequency by tumor cells (group 1) or are induced by them in other cells (group 2). Group 1 tumor markers include tumor-associated antigens, secreted hormones, and enzymes. The table lists a few examples. The transition from a normal to a trans- formed state is a process involving several steps. 1. Tumor initiation.Almost every tumor be- gins with damage to the DNA of an individual cell. The genetic defect is almost always caused by environmental factors. These can include tumor-inducing chemicals (carcinogens—e. g., components of tar from tobacco), physical processes (e. g.,UV light,X-ray radiation; see p. 256), or in rare cases tumor viruses (see p. 398). Most of the approximately 10 14 cells in the human body probably suffer this type of DNA damage during the average lifespan, but it is usually repaired again (see p. 256). It is mainly defects in proto-oncogenes (see p. 398) that are relevant to tumor initiation; these are the decisive cause of transformation. Loss of an anti-oncogene (a tumor-suppressor gene) can also contribute to tumor initiation. 2. Tumor promotion is preferential prolif- eration of a cell damaged by transformation. It is a very slow process that can take many years. Certain substances are able to strongly accelerate it—e. g., phorbol esters. These occur in plants (e. g., Euphorbia species) and act as activators of protein kinase C (see p. 386). 3. Tumor progression finally leads to a macroscopically visible tumor as a result of growth. When solid tumors of this type ex- ceed a certain size, they form their own vas- cular network that supplies them with blood (angiogenesis). Collagenases (matrix metallo- proteinases, MMPs) play a special role in the metastatic process, by loosening surrounding connective tissue and thereby allowing tumor cells to disseminate and enter the blood- stream. New approaches to combating tumors have been aimed at influencing tumor angio- genesis and metastatic processes. 400 Growth and development 1 2 3 UV H3C H3C O OH CH2OH CH3 CH3 OH OH H3C H HOH Hormones Nutrient medium Normal cells Tumor cells Uncontrolled cell proliferation Growth inhibition due to contacts with adjacent cells A.

Most transformed cells are recognized by theimmunesystem and eliminated (see p. 294). If endogenous defense is not suf - ciently effective, rapid tumor growth can oc- cur. Attempts are then made to inhibit growth by physical or chemical treatment. A frequently used procedure is targeted irradiation with γ-rays, which block cell re- production due their mutagenic effect (see p. 256). Another approach is to inhibit cell growth by chemotherapy. The growth-inhib- iting substances used are known as cytostatic drugs. Unfortunately, neither radiotherapy nor chemotherapy act selectively—i. e., they damage normal cells as well, and are there- fore often associated with severe side effects. Most cytostatic agents directly or indirectly inhibit DNA replication in the S phase of the cell cycle (see p. 394). The first group (A)lead to chemical changes in cellular DNA that im- pede transcription and replication. A second group of cytostatic agents (B) inhibit the syn- thesis of DNA precursors. A. Alkylating agents, anthracyclines \u0003 Alkylating agents arecompounds capableof reacting covalently with DNA bases. If a com- pound of this type contains two reactive groups, intramolecular or intermolecular crosslinking of the DNA double helix and “bending” of the double strand occurs. Exam- ples of this type shown here are cyclophos- phamide and the inorganic complex cisplatin. Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin (adriamy- cin) insert themselves non-covalently be- tween the bases and thus lead to local alter- ations in theDNA structure(seep. 254 B). B. Antimetabolites \u0003 Antimetabolites are enzyme inhibitors (see p. 96) that selectively block metabolic pathways. The majority of clinically important cytostatic drugs act on nucleotide biosynthesis. Many of these are modified nucleobases or nucleotides that competitively inhibit their target enzymes (see p. 96). Many are also incorporated into the DNA, thereby preventing replication. The cytostatic drugs administered (indi- cated by a syringe in the illustration) are often notactivethemselves but areonly converted into the actual active agent in the metabolism. This also applies to the adenine analogue 6- mercaptopurine, which is initially converted to the mononucleotide tIMP (thioinosine monophosphate). Via several intermediate steps, tIMP gives rise to tdGTP, which is in- corporated into the DNA and leads to cross- links and other anomalies in it. The second effective metabolite of 6-mercaptopurine is S-methylated tIMP, an inhibitor of amidophos- phoribosyl transferase (see p. 188). Hydroxyurea selectively inhibits ribonu- cleotide reductase (see p. 190). As a radical scavenger, it removes the tyrosine radicals that are indispensable for the functioning of the reductase. Two other important cytostatic agents tar- get the synthesis of DNA-typical thymine, which takes place at the level of the deoxy- mononucleotide (see p. 190). The deoxymo- nonucleotide formed by 5-fluorouracil or the corresponding nucleoside inhibits thymidy- late synthase. This inhibition is based on the fact that the fluorine atom in the pyrimidine ring cannot be substituted by a methyl group. In addition, the fluorine analogue is also in- corporated into the DNA. Dihydrofolate reductase acts as an auxiliary enzyme for thymidylate synthase. It is in- volved in the regeneration of the coenzyme N 5,N 10-methylene-THF, initially reducing DHF to THF with NADPH as the reductant (see p. 418). The folic acid analogue methotrexate, a frequently used cytostatic agent, is an ex- tremely effective competitive inhibitor of di- hydrofolate reductase. It leads to the deple- tion of N 5,N10-methylene-THF in the cells and thus to cessation of DNA synthesis. Further information To reduce thesideeffects of cytostatic agents, new approaches are currently being devel- oped on the basis of gene therapy (see p. 264). Attempts are being made, for exam- ple, to administer drugs in the form of pre- cursors(known asprodrugs), which only be- come active in the tumor itself (“tumor tar- geting”). 402 Growth and development dGDP me-tIMP SAH SAM tIMP 1 3 2 4 4 12 3 GIn Glu tdGDPtGDPtGMPtIMP IMP GMP GDP P P PRPP NA PTHF DHF 5 6 5 DNA DNA dTTP dTMP 6 NA P dUMP + H C H N PO CH2 CH2 H CH2 Cl CH2 Cl H3CO O O OH HO C OH CH2OH O R OH Pt H3N H3N Cl Cl C C N CH NC N HC N S Rib CH3 P C C N CH NC N HC N SH RibP C C N CH NC N HC N SH N OHC H2N O H N RibP CH C C HN C O O F C N C N C C H2N N C CH N CH2 NNH2 H3C C HN O C H COOCH2OOC CH2 A.

They often consist of only a single nucleic acid molecule (DNA or RNA, never both) and a protein coat. Viruses have no metabolism of their own, and can therefore only replicate themselves with the help of host cells. They are therefore not regarded as independent organisms. Viruses that damage the host cell when they replicate are pathogens. Diseases caused by viruses include AIDS, rabies, polio- myelitis, measles, German measles, smallpox, influenza, and the common cold. A. Viruses: examples \u0002 Only a few examples from the large number of known viruses are illustrated here. They are allshown on thesamescale. Viruses that only replicate in bacteria are known as bacteriophages (or “phages” for short). An example of a phage with a simple structure is M13. It consists of a single- stranded DNA molecule (ssDNA) of about 7000 bp with a coat made up of 2700 helically arranged protein subunits. The coat of a virus is referred to as a capsid, and the complete structure as a nucleocapsid. In genetic engi- neering, M13 is important as a vector for for- eign DNA (see p. 258). The phage T4 (bottom left), one of the larg- est viruses known, has a much more complex structure with around 170 000 base pairs (bp) of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) contained within its “head.” The tobacco mosaic virus (center right), a plant pathogen, has a structure similar to that of M13, but contains ssRNA instead of DNA. The poliovirus, which causes poliomyelitis, is also an RNA virus. In the influenza virus,the pathogen that causes viral flu, the nucleocap- sid is additionally surrounded by a coat de- rived from the plasma membrane of the host cell (C). The coat carries viral proteins that are involved in the infection process. B. Capsid of the rhinovirus \u0003 Rhinoviruses cause the common cold. In these viruses, the capsid is shaped like an icosahe- dron—i. e., an object made up of 20 equilateral triangles. Its surface is formed from three dif- ferent proteins, which associate with one an- other to form pentamers and hexamers. In all, 60 protein molecules are involved in the structure of the capsid. C. Life cycle of HIV \u0002 The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes the immunodeficiency disease known as AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syn- drome). The structure of this virus is similar to that of the influenza virus (A). TheHIV genomeconsists of two molecules of ssRNA (each 9.2 kb). It is enclosed by a double-layered capsid and a protein-contain- ing coating membrane. HIV mainly infects T helper cells (see p. 294) and can thereby lead to failure of the immune system in the longer term. During infection (1), the virus’s coating membrane fuses with the target cell’s plasma membrane, and the core of the nucleocapsid enters the cytoplasm (2). In the cytoplasm, the viral RNA is initially transcribed into an RNA/DNA hybrid (3) and then into dsDNA (4). Both of these reactions are catalyzed by re- verse transcriptase, an enzyme deriving from the virus. The dsDNA formed is integrated into the host cell genome (5), where it can remain in an inactive state for a long time. When viral replication occurs, the DNA segment corresponding to the viral genome is first transcribed by host cell enzymes (6). This gives rise not only to viral ssRNA, but also to transcription of mRNAs for precursors of the viral proteins (7). These precursors are integrated into the plasma membrane (8, 9) before undergoing proteolytic modification (10). The cycle is completed by the release of new virus particles (11). The group of RNA viruses to which HIV belongs are called retroviruses,because DNA is produced from RNA in their replication cy- cle—the reverse of the usual direction of tran- scription (DNA \u0001 RNA). 404 Growth and development 1 2 1 10 11 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 Phage M13 ssDNA 7 kb Helical Coat Influenza virus ssRNA (8 molecules) 3.6 kb Nucleocapsid with coatEicosa- hedral head T4-Phage ds DNA 170 kbp complex structure Tail Phage DNA Bacterial cell 1.

Explanatory text is deliberately omitted from them. These “charts”: • Contain details of metabolic pathways that are only shown in outline in the main text for reasons of space. This applies in partic- ular to the synthesis and degradation of the amino acids and nucleotides, and for some aspects of carbohydrate and lipid metabo- lism. • Offer a quick overview of a specific path- way, the metabolites that arise in it, and the enzymes involved. • Can be used for reference purposes and for revising material previously learned. The most important intermediates are shown with numbers in the charts. The correspond- ing compounds can be identified using the table on the same page. In addition, at each step the four-figure EC number (see p. 88) for the enzyme responsi- ble for a reaction is given in italics. The en- zyme name and its systematic classification in the system used by the Enzyme Catalogue are available in the following annotated enzyme list (pp. 420–430), in which all of the enzymes mentioned in this book are listed according to their EC number. The book’s index is helpful when looking for a specific enzyme in the text. In reactions that involve coenzymes,the coenzyme names are also given (sometimes in simplified form). Particularly important starting, intermediate, or end products are given with the full name, or as formulae. Example On p. 407, the initial step of the dark reactions in plant photosynthesis (in the Calvin cycle) is shown at the top left. In this reaction, one molecule of ribulose- 1,5-bisphosphate (metabolite 1) and one mol- ecule of CO2 (metabolite 2) give rise to two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (metabolite 3). The enzyme responsible has the EC number 4.1.1.39. The annotated enzyme list shows that this refers to ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (“rubisco” for short). Rubisco be- longs to enzyme class 4 (the lyases) and, within that group, to subclass 4.1 (the car- boxy-lyases). It contains copper as a cofactor ([Cu]). 406 Metabolic charts C5 C7 C5 6 CO2 + 18 ATP + 12 NADPH + 12 H Hexose + 18 ADP + 18 P + 12 NADP 2x 5 5 5 5 55 21 3 3 4.1.1.39 2.7.2.3 4 4 2 1.2.1.13 PP 5 5 6x 5.3.1.1 6 6 4.1.2.13 7 3.1.3.11 8 2.2.1.1 94.2.1.13 10 3.1.3.37 P 11 2.2.1.1 1212 13 14 14 14 1 1 1 5.1.3.4 5.3.1.6 2.7.1.19 2.7.1.19 CO2 C5 C5 15 2 C3 C6 P C4 ATP ADP ATP NADP NADPH ATP ADP ATP ADP ATP ADP NADPH 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1 2 3 Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate Carbon dioxide 3-Phosphoglycerate 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate Dihydroxyacetone phosphate Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate Fructose 6-phosphate Erythrose 4-phosphate Sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate Xylulose 5-phosphate Ribose 5-phosphate Ribulose 5-phosphate 15 Glucose 6-phosphate Ribulose 1,5 - bis P Glucose 6- phosphatePGlyceraldehyde 3- A.
