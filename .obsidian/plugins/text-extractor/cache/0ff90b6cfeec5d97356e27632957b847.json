Introduction • The sole of the foot is the part of the foot that meets the floor or ground. • The structure of the sole of the foot is similar to that of the palm. • The major differences arise due to the functional difference between the hand and the foot. • The hand is a prehensile organ whereas the foot is concerned with transmission of body weight and locomotion. The Skin • The skin of the sole of the foot is thick and hairless. • It is firmly bound to the underlying deep fascia (plantar aponeurosis) by the numerous fibrous bands. • It is creased at the sites of skin movement and contains large number of sweat glands. The Superficial Fascia • It is mostly composed of subcutaneous fat in the meshwork of fibrous septa, which anchor the skin with the underlying deep fascia. • The superficial fascia is thick and dense over the weight-bearing points to provide fibrofatty cushions at these sites e.g., • Posterior tubercles of the Calcaneum • Metatarsal heads • Pulps of the digits Cutaneous Innervation • Medial calcaneal branches • They arise directly from the tibial nerve and supply skin over the posterior and medial portions of the. • The corresponding dermatome is S1. • Cutaneous branches of the medial plantar nerve • They supply the skin over the larger anteromedial portion of the sole and medial 3½ digits. • The corresponding dermatome is L4. • Cutaneous branches of the lateral plantar nerve • They supply the skin over the smaller anterolateral portion of the sole and lateral 1½ digits. • The corresponding dermatome is L5. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_nerve The Deep Fascia • The deep fascia of the sole consists of three parts; central, medial, and lateral. • The central part is very thick and termed plantar aponeurosis. • The medial and lateral parts are thin and termed medial and lateral plantar fasciae, respectively. https://www.earthslab.com/anatomy/sole-of-the-foot/ The Deep Fascia • It contains bundles of collagen fibres which are arranged longitudinally in the plantar aponeurosis and transversely in the medial and lateral plantar fasciae. • In the region of toes, the deep fascia forms the deep transverse metatarsal ligaments and fibrous flexor sheaths. https://www.earthslab.com/anatomy/sole-of-the-foot/ The Plantar Aponeurosis • It is a triangular thickening of the deep fascia that protects the underlying nerves, blood vessels, and muscles. • Its apex is attached to the medial and lateral tubercles of the calcaneum. • The base of the aponeurosis divides into five slips that pass into the toes. The Plantar Aponeurosis • Functions • It firmly fixes the skin of the sole. • It provides origin to the muscles of first layer of the sole. • It protects the plantar nerve and vessels from compression. • It helps to maintain the longitudinal arches of the foot by acting as tie beam. Clinical Significance of theThe Plantar Aponeurosis • Plantar fasciitis • The plantar aponeurosis is stretched during standing position. • Hence, tearing or inflammation (plantar fasciitis) often occurs in individuals who do a great deal of standing or walking, viz. traffic police personnel. • It causes pain and tenderness in the sole of the foot especially underneath the heel during standing. • Repeated attack of the plantar fasciitis leads to calcification in the posterior attachment of the plantar aponeurosis forming a calcaneal spur. Muscles of the Sole of the Foot • The muscles of the sole are conveniently described in four layers • First layer: Abductor hallucis, flexor digitorum brevis, abductor digiti minimi • Second layer: Flexor accessorius, lumbricals, flexor digitorum longus tendon, flexor hallucis longus tendon • Third layer: Flexor hallucis brevis, adductor hallucis, flexor digiti minimi brevis • Fourth layer: Interossei, peroneus longus tendon, tibialis posterior tendon First LayerFirst layer muscles in bold Second layers muscle in boldSecond LayerThird LayerThird layer muscles in bold Fourth layer muscles Fourth LayerLong Tendons of the Sole of the Foot • Flexor Digitorum Longus Tendon • The flexor digitorum longus tendon enters the sole by passing behind the medial malleolus beneath the flexor retinaculum • It passes forward across the medial surface of the sustentaculum tali and then crosses the tendon of flexor hallucis longus, from which it receives a strong slip. • It is here that it receives on its lateral border the insertion of the quadratus plantae muscle. Long Tendons of the Sole of the Foot • Flexor Digitorum Longus Tendon • The tendon now divides into its four tendons of insertion, which pass forward, giving origin to the lumbrical muscles. • The tendons then enter the fibrous sheaths of the lateral four toes. • Each tendon perforates the corresponding tendon of flexor digitorum brevis and passes on to be inserted into the base of the distal phalanx • . • It should be noted that the method of insertion is similar to that found for the flexor digitorum profundus in the hand. Long Tendons of the Sole of the Foot • Flexor Hallucis Longus Tendon • The flexor hallucis longus tendon enters the sole by passing behind the medial malleolus beneath the flexor retinaculum. • It runs forward below the sustentaculum tali and crosses deep to the flexor digitorum longus tendon, to which it gives a strong slip. • It then enters the fibrous sheath of the big toe and is inserted into the base of the distal phalanx. Fibrous Flexor Sheaths & Synovial Flexor Sheaths • Fibrous Flexor Sheaths • The inferior surface of each toe, from the head of the metatarsal bone to the base of the distal phalanx, is provided with a strong fibrous sheath, which is attached to the sides of the phalanges. • The arrangement is similar to that found in the fingers. • The fibrous sheath, together with the inferior surfaces of the phalanges and the interphalangeal joints, forms a blind tunnel in which lie the flexor tendons of the toe • Synovial Flexor Sheaths • The tendons of the flexor hallucis longus and the flexor digitorum longus are surrounded by synovial sheaths.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
