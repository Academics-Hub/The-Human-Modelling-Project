L5 bodies ▪ Lumbar plexus found deep within ▪ Lumbar plexus via anterior branches of L2-4 ▪ Iliacus ▪ Lateral to inferior part of psoas major ▪ From iliac fossa ▪ Conjoined tendon, deep to inguinal ligament – iliopsoas – chief flexor of thigh ▪ Femoral nerve (L2-4) ▪ Quadratus lumborum ▪ Adjacent to & from transverse processes (& 12th rib) ▪ Lateral to superior part of psoas major ▪ Anterior branches of T12 – L4 6789 T12 L1 L3 L1 L1 L2 L1 (subcostal L2) L1-4 T12 9 ▪ Inferior Vena Cava: ▪ Union of common iliac veins (median sacral drains into left) ▪ Lies right of aorta ▪ Pierces central tendon of diaphragm (T8) ▪ Paired direct tributaries: ▪ Hepatic veins ▪ Inferior phrenic ▪ Renal veins ▪ 1 or 2 pairs of lumbar veins ▪ Partially indirect pairs: ▪ Suprarenal (left via renal) ▪ Gonadal (left via renal) 10 ▪ Nodes and vessels along aorta, IVC and iliac vessels ▪ Lumbar lymph nodes  Common iliac nodes  external and internal iliac nodes ▪ GI tract, liver, spleen and pancreas → coeliac and superior mesenteric → pre-aortic lymph nodes → intestinal lymphatic trunks → thoracic duct origin ▪ Posterior abdominal wall, kidneys, ureters, testes/ovaries, uterus & uterine tubes → Right & left lumbar nodes (caval and aortic) ▪ Descending colon, pelvis & lower limbs → inferior mesenteric and common iliac lymph nodes → caval and aortic lumbar nodes ▪ Thoracic duct begins @ L1 – 2 (cisterna chyli) 11 ▪ Sympathetic trunks: ▪ Pass under medial arcuate ligament ▪ Lie in groove between psoas major & vertebral bodies ▪ Thoracic splanchnic branches pass through fibres of diaphragm crura → coeliac ganglion (around coeliac trunk) ▪ Coeliac plexus: ▪ Sympathetic (splanchnic) & parasympathetic (vagus) ▪ Gives rise to plexiform branches around arteries ▪ Continues downward as aortic plexus → Inferior mesenteric plexus 12 ▪ Anterior primary rami of L1 - 4 ▪ Forms within psoas major muscle ▪ 2nd-4th rami divide into anterior & posterior divisions 7 branches: ▪ Iliohypogastric nerve from L1 ▪ Ilioinguinal nerve from L1 ▪ Genitofemoral nerve, from L1 & L2 ▪ Obturator nerve – anterior divisions of L2-4 ▪ Femoral nerve – posterior divisions of L2-4 ▪ Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh – posterior divisions of L2 & L3 ▪ Lumbosacral trunk - L4 - 5 ▪ (Accessory obturator – infrequent, from posterior divisions of L3 & L4) 13 ▪ 3 parts: ▪ Sternal ▪ Costal ▪ Lumbar ▪ 2 crura ▪ Right crus ▪ Left crus ▪ Diaphragmatic ligaments: ▪ Median arcuate ligament – fibro- osseus tunnel at T12 ▪ Medial arcuate ligament - Arch over psoas major, from median ligament to tip of L1 transverse process ▪ Lateral arcuate ligament – over quadratus lumborum, from tip of L1 transverse process to tip of 12th rib 14 3 major openings: ▪ Aortic opening ▪ Behind diaphragm ▪ Aorta ▪ Thoracic duct ▪ Left & right ascending lumbar vessels ▪ Oesophageal opening ▪ Left of T10 ▪ Oesophagus ▪ Anterior & posterior vagal trunks ▪ IVC opening ▪ T8 ▪ IVC ▪ Right phrenic nerve 15 Minor pathways: ▪ Lymphatics (diaphragmatic liver) – through sternocostal triangle ▪ Splanchnic nerves – through crura ▪ Sympathetic trunks – medial arcuate ligament ▪ Subcostal nerve – lateral arcuate ligament ▪ Branches of left phrenic – through diaphragm ▪ Superior epigastric vessels – between attachments to xiphoid & 7th costal cartilage ▪ 7th-12th intercostals neurovascular bundles – between costal slips of origin of diaphragm 1617 ▪ Extrapulmonary TB manifestation ▪ Vertebral column = common location ▪ Abscesses can form in lumbar region into psoas sheath ▪ Fascia thickens → tube stocking ▪ Pus in the fascia surfaces in thigh ▪ Superior iliac fascia loose → iliacosubfascial fossa ▪ NB!: Iliopsoas muscle relations ▪ Disease of related structures → iliopsoas movement pain ▪ Psoas sign","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
