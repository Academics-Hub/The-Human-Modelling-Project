Nevertheless, until now, bioelectronic devices for such prostheses have been patch type, which cannot be applied onto rough, narrow or deep tissue surfaces 3–5. Here we present an injectable tissue prosthesis with instantaneous bidirectional electrical conduction in the neuromuscular system. The soft and injectable prosthesis is composed of a biocompatible hydrogel with unique phenylborate- mediated multiple crosslinking, such as irreversible yet freely rearrangeable biphenyl bonds and reversible coordinate bonds with conductive gold nanoparticles formed in situ by cross-coupling. Closed-loop robot-assisted rehabilitation by injecting this prosthetic material is successfully demonstrated in the early stage of severe muscle injury in rats, and accelerated tissue repair is achieved in the later stage. Advances in closed-loop gait rehabilitation integrated with lighter- weight exoskeletons and wearable or implantable devices have substan- tially improved the quality of patient healthcare owing to the potential for clinical effectiveness originating from efficient recovery of motor and sensory malfunctions associated with severely injured nervous and muscular systems 6,7. Despite such progress, achieving early-stage recovery of locomotion remains challenging. In this regard, the appli- cation of an electroconductive hydrogel strategy used in rapid tissue repair to the conventional soft tissue prosthesis approach may resolve such unmet needs owing to the low electrical impedance, mechani- cal modulus match, tissue adhesion and even biodegradability of hydrogels. Such hydrogels satisfy essential requirements for electro- physiological tissue conduction in the early stage of rehabilitation, effective low-threshold electrical stimulation to organ surfaces for accelerated tissue regeneration and recording of low-noise physi- ological signals for closed-loop healthcare systems, enabling precise diagnosis and feedback treatment1–3,8–11. So far, most tissue-interfacing bioelectronics used in neuroprosthe- ses have been based on the patch-type formfactor and are limited in their ability to access cramped, complicated and tiny biological inter- faces in injured tissue regions 3–5. On the other hand, syringe-injectable and conductive hydrogels have progressed in recent years and can be effectively introduced into inaccessible sites for tissue engineering and in the soft bioelectronics field 12–15. However, most injectable and/ or conductive materials with dynamic reversible bonds (for example, host–guest interactions, hydrogen bonds) that simply have embed- ded electroconductive additives show low mechanical and electrical durability because of their weak molecular bonds and heterogeneous electrical percolation by poor gelation, thereby undesirably impeding long-term stable on-site tissue interfacing16–18. Although strong irre- versible covalent bonds can be introduced to enhance the mechanical properties of the existing hydrogels 19, they often cause a trade-off with the injectability of those materials. Here we report injectable tissue-interfacing prostheses composed of conductive hydrogels (termed IT-IC hydrogels) generated via phe- nylborate (PB)-mediated multiple crosslinking strategies. The IT-IC hydrogels contain irreversible biphenyl bonds (Fig. 1a(i), red dashed box), reversible strong coordinate bonds between conductive gold nano- particles (AuNPs) in situ reduced by biphenyl coupling and PB groups (green dashed box), and weak multivalent ionic interactions such as hydrogen bonds, metal-π bonds and metal–carboxylate (Au 3+–COO −) interactions on polysaccharide backbones. The PB-derived multiple bonds synergistically allow effective energy dissipation through both dissociation of weak noncovalent bonds and biphenyl rearrangement under shear stress during injection (Fig. 1a(ii)) and self-recovery after injection (Fig. 1a(iii)), which are entirely differentiated from those of the typical noninjectable hydrogels with irreversible covalent bonds, which inevitably lead to mechanical failure (Supplementary Fig. 1). Further- more, electrically conductive AuNPs, ionically conductive polymers and numerous free ions (for example, Na + and Au 3+) synergistically confer electrical percolation within the network. This combinatorial crosslink- ing mechanism provides highly conformal and electrophysiological interfacing capability to the hydrogels, allowing simultaneous function as either tissue-to-tissue conduction through filling muscle-tissue loss for immediate rehabilitation in the early stage and accelerated myofibre regeneration in the long-term stage (Fig. 1b, red dashed box) https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06628-x Received: 9 August 2022 Accepted: 8 September 2023 Published online: 1 November 2023 Check for updates 1Department of Intelligent Precision Healthcare Convergence, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea. 2Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research, Institute for Basic Science, Suwon, Republic of Korea. 3Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea. 4Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Single Cell Network Research Center, School of Medicine, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea. 5School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Chemical Processes, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea. 6Department of Superintelligence Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea. 7Department of Biomedical Engineering, SKKU Institute for Convergence, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea. 8These authors contributed equally: Subin Jin, Heewon Choi. ✉e-mail: daniel3600@g.skku.edu; mikyungshin@g.skku.edu Nature | Vol 623 | 2 November 2023 | 59 or tissue-to-bioelectronics bridging for bidirectional stimulation and recording of peripheral nerves (blue dashed box). Specifically, such transfer of electrical signals generated from the muscle can be aided by robotic rehabilitation that is precisely controlled by a closed-loop system capable of peripheral nerve stimulation and feedback elec- tromyogram (EMG) monitoring and vice versa (green dashed box). Characterization of IT-IC hydrogels To prepare the IT-IC hydrogels, PB-tethered hyaluronic acid (HA–PB) was synthesized via a carbodiimide coupling reaction, and the degree of PB conjugation (DOCPB%) was set to 10.0 ± 0.3% (HA–PBhigh) (Sup- plementary Fig. 2a,b) 20. To achieve a desirable mechanical modulus of the hydrogels for further in vivo implantation, we chose a crosslink- ing mechanism for the in situ conductive gelation of HA–PB solution containing Au(III) ions that was triggered by adding sodium hydrox- ide (NaOH) (Fig. 2a), which is a type of modified Suzuki–Miyaura reaction using palladium catalysts21. Under mildly basic conditions (approximately pH 9), PB groups undergo ionization, deboronation and transmetalation catalysed by in situ Au(III) reduction (Fig. 2a)22. Simultaneously, the phenyl carbanions formed by deboronation are covalently crosslinked to each other (for example, by biphenyl homocoupling), generating IT-IC hydrogels. The details of the IT-IC hydrogel gelation mechanism are provided in Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Note 1. The gelation depends on a stoichiometric ratio of [NaOH] to [Au(III) ions], and a ratio of 4 formed the IT-IC hydrogel with the highest storage modulus (G′ = 188.9 ± 28.3 Pa at 1 Hz) and the lowest loss factor(tan δ = 0.018 ± 0.003) within 1 min (Fig. 2b, Supple- mentary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Note 2). Other variables, such as DOCPB%, polymer concentration, the NaOH/Au 3+ ratio, amount of Au 3+, and types of metal catalyst and solvent, can affect rheological prop- erties regarding the stiffness and injectability of the IT-IC hydrogels (Supplementary Figs. 5–8 and Supplementary Note 3). In addition, the diameter and size distribution of AuNPs in situ formed in the hydrogels depended on the NaOH/Au 3+ ratio (Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supple- mentary Note 4). Considering the storage moduli of the soft biological tissues (around 0.1–400 kPa)23,24, IT-IC hydrogels consisting of 2 wt% HA–PBhigh crosslinked at a NaOH/Au 3+ ratio of 4 (termed IT-IC@4) were chosen for the following experiments and used after stabilization of the polymeric crosslinking and sufficient gold reduction through overnight incubation at room temperature. The formation of biphenyl rings and AuNPs within the IT-IC hydrogel network was detected by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectros- copy (Fig. 2c) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Supple- mentary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Note 5). In the FT-IR spectra of the lyophilized IT-IC@4 and IT-IC@1 (NaOH/Au 3+ ratio = 1), new peaks appeared at 1,535 cm −1 (Fig. 2c, blue) and 1,550 cm −1 (red), respectively, indicating C–C stretching vibration in biphenyl rings25.

In the high-resolution XPS spectra of the hydrogels, an increase in C–C bonds by the forma- tion of biphenyl rings, a decrease in C–B bonds by deboronation and fabrication of AuNPs were clearly shown (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Note 5). As mentioned above, the PB-derived multiple crosslinking strategies, including reversible strong or weak coordinate bonds aided by rear- rangeable biphenyl bonds, allow great injectability of IT-IC@4, which corresponds to the rapid shear thinning behaviour (Supplementary Fig. 6b) and self-healing properties of the hydrogels (Supplementary Fig. 11). On the basis of its rheological properties, IT-IC@4 also exhibited excellent conformal contact when applied to rough surfaces of dam- aged biological tissues (for example, muscle) or three-dimensional (3D) curved objects by injection using needles with different inner diameters (for example, 260 μm for 26 gauge (G) and 838 μm for 18G) (Fig. 2d, yellow dashed line and Supplementary Fig. 12), demonstrat- ing their benefit as stable interfacing materials on biotic and abiotic substrates. Regarding the injectability and on-tissue conformabil- ity of the IT-IC hydrogels, we hypothesized that the configurational change of the hydrogel network occurs spontaneously during or after injection owing to dynamic strong or weak coordinate bonds. To test this hypothesis, we performed small-angle X-ray scattering analysis (Fig. 2e). The scattering pattern of the IT-IC hydrogels before injection was fitted to the Gel Fit model in SasView27,28 (Fig. 2e, square), where the correlation length (ξ), which refers to the distance between the polymer bundles or chains in the network, was calculated to be 26.5, and the gyration radius (Rg) of the polymer bundle was 85.6. Nota- bly, the pattern of the hydrogel filaments immediately after injection (0 min) showed a low ξ value of 19.3 and an Rg value of 38.3 (Fig. 2e, triangle), indicating that the physical distance between the polymer bundles or single polymers becomes shorter owing to the disruption of weak coordinate bonds after high shear stress. By contrast, at 1 h after injection, these values had recovered, with ξ = 26.1 and Rg = 76.4 NaOH/Au3+ ratioG\u0000, G\u0000 (Pa)tan tan 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0.8 103 102 101 100 10–1 1 2 4 6 bc 1.0 1,630 1,613 1,535 1,550 1,700 9001,500 1,300 1,100 Wavenumber (cm–1) HA–PB IT-IC@1 IT-IC@4 G\u0000 G\u0000 A –200 –100 0 100Dihedral angle (°) 0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Strain (dxz−1) Shear strain A B A\u0000 B\u0000 X Y Z A B A\u0000 B\u0000 BA\u0000 B\u0000 = –140°Dihedral angle B\u0000 B A\u0000A = ~30° Shear strain ed IT-IC@4 Muscle FITC RhodamineI(q) IT-IC@4 0 min 60 min 23 G 0.01 0.10 q (Å–1) = 26.5 = 19.3 = 26.1 Rg = 85.6 Rg = 38.3 Rg = 76.4 ghResistance (k\u0000) 2 4 6 12 14 0 Stacked times 012 26 G 23 G 18 G 3Resistance (k\u0000) Strain (%) 0 6 8 10 500204010 30 26 G 23 G 18 G 4 2 10 8 f Biphenyl crosslinked HA HA–PB IT-IC hydrogels AuNPs a NaOH Biphenyl ringDeboronation Ionization Transmetalation Au3+ O OHHO OO NH O NH HO O B OHHO nO OH B HO OH OH B HO OH OH Au n O OHHO OO NH O NH HO OH O O O OHHO OO NH O NH HO O O n OH Fig. 2 | Physicochemical and electrical characterization of the IT-IC hydrogel. a, The gelation mechanism of IT-IC hydrogel via the PB-derived biphenyl homocoupling reaction. b, Storage moduli (G′) (blue), loss moduli (G″) (light blue), and tan δ (red) values (mean ± s.d.; n = 3 for independent samples) of IT-IC hydrogel consisting of HA–PBhigh as a function of the NaOH/Au3+ ratio. c, FT-IR spectra of HA–PB alone (black), IT-IC@1 (blue) and IT-IC@4 (red). d, On-tissue conformal contact capability of IT-IC@4 (green) encapsulating fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) on skeletal muscle tissue (purple) stained with rhodamine.

Nature | Vol 623 | 2 November 2023 | 61 (Fig. 2e, circle), indicating the structural recovery of the polymer bundle in the hydrogel filaments by reassociation of the coordinate bonds. In addition, the rotational rearrangement of the biphenyl rings during shear deformation was detected through a computational molecular dynamics (MD) simulation (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Note 6). The dihedral angle of the rings abruptly changed from −140° to +30° when the strain exceeded 1.8 (Fig. 2f, red-coloured balls in the middle and right graph). For further discussion, we compared the oscillation ampli- tude behaviour, stress relaxation behaviour and cyclic compressive stress–strain curves of IT-IC hydrogels with those of typical hydrogels crosslinked by alkane C–C bonds (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supple- mentary Note 7). These results suggest that dissociation of multiple dynamic bonds enables great injectability and shape-morphing con- formability of the IT-IC hydrogels, and rotational rearrangements of biphenyl rings at threshold strain might support these mechanical characteristics. To investigate the electrical performance of IT-IC@4 in the neuro- muscular system, we monitored whether the resistance of bulk IT-IC@4 was reversible without electrical hysteresis when the strain increased to 100% (Supplementary Fig. 14a–c). In addition, its impedance (0.68 kΩ at 1 kHz) and phase were stable in the stretching mode with 30% strain, and charge storage capacity (3.73 mC cm−2) at 30% strain was compa- rable to that at 0% strain (3.74 mC cm −2) (Supplementary Fig. 15). This might be because elasticity of the IT-IC hydrogel leads to an increase in the exposed polymer surface and enhances charge transport at the interface between the polymer and electrolytes. The charge stor- age capacity was also maintained after 50 cycles and there was no significant difference in the impedance value of the hydrogels even after applying 1,000 pulses of stimulation (peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) = 1 V). Further results for electrical resistance of the IT-IC hydrogels with a smaller number of AuNPs are described in Supplementary Fig. 16 and Supplementary Note 8. Similar to those of bulk hydrogels, the hydrogel filaments of IT-IC@4 injected through needles (26, 23 or 18G) possessed stable electrical resistance (of around several kiloohms) that decreased with each stack of the filament (Fig. 2g, inset scheme). That is, electrical flow can pass through the IT-IC@4 filaments continuously. Although a gradual increase in the resistance of the filaments injected using 26 or 23G needles was observed as a function of strain (Supplementary Fig. 14d and Fig. 2h, black and blue), the resistance of the 18G filament was stable overall under 50% strain (red). In particular, in stretching and releasing tests under 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50% strain, the electri- cal hysteresis of the hydrogel filaments (23 and 18G) was negligible, and their resistance values were reversibly recovered after deforma- tion. However, slight hysteresis for the thin filament extruded by 26G needles was detected because of rapid dehydration. These stable and reversible electrical properties of IT-IC@4 result from the synergistic effect of both freely rearrangeable biphenyl bonds with delocalized electrons and conductive AuNPs. When the hydrogel is stretched, the rearrangement of biphenyl rings can help to prevent a certain degree of internal cracking in the hydrogels, but spatially distant AuNPs decrease the conductivity. After release, the electrical resistance of the hydro- gel recovers to the original value owing to the strain resistance of the hydrogel crosslinked by PB. These findings suggest that PB-derived biphenyl bonds and AuNPs in situ generated by cross-coupling reactions allow homogeneous gelation with injectability and strain-resistant electrical properties for further interfacing of implantable bioelectronics. Comparing the performance of most injectable and conductive hydrogels crosslinked via noncovalent bonds (for example, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, π–π interactions) and encapsulation of conductive additives (for example, polypyrrole, graphene oxide and gold nanorods) (Supplementary Fig. 17), the IT-IC hydrogels satisfy important requirements for soft tissue prosthesis, tissue-like conductivity (10−2 S cm−1), injectability using a needle with a small aperture (around 260 μm) and conform- ability on rough and curved areas. Muscle-to-IT-IC hydrogel interfacing Compared with the organ attachment methodology of conventional film-type bioelectrical patches, the injectability of our IT-IC hydrogel makes it capable of interfacing seamlessly with narrow and/or deep difficult-to-reach tissues injured by diverse events, such as surgical operations, traumatic injury and congenital or acquired anomalies29. Before the following biological tests, we investigated the in vitro dissociation profile of IT-IC@4, which showed swelling behaviour in physiological conditions over 2 days and slow dissociation for 5 days, releasing AuNPs (Supplementary Fig. 18). As a tissue-interfacing material, the biocompatibility of the IT-IC hydrogels was sufficient to maintain around 99% viability of two different neuron-like cells (differentiated PC12 and HT22 cells) treated with the hydrogel releas- ates (Supplementary Fig. 19). In addition, we confirmed ex vivo elec- trical conduction capability of the IT-IC hydrogel (Supplementary Fig. 20). The electrical signals were successfully transferred from one stimulated muscle through IT-IC to another muscle to be recorded, and the EMG amplitude (2.2 mV) was highest with IT-IC@4 interfacing when compared with that of other controls. To better clarify the capacity of IT-IC hydrogels for in vivo tissue–tissue conduction, we applied IT-IC hydrogels to a muscle injury model established by cross-sectional cut- ting of the whole tissue, which causes complex and rough surfaces of the damaged tissues as well as irrecoverable damage, potentially interfer- ing with the recognition of precisely intended motions, which is a key requirement for performing early-stage closed-loop robot-assisted rehabilitation (C-RAR) 30 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 21). Under elec- trical stimulation of the muscle around a proximal region of the sciatic nerve, electrophysiological functional recovery (EMG amplitude) of the muscle tissue was immediately detected on stacking each IT-IC hydrogel filament (50 μl) using a 26G needle (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Video 1). The EMG amplitude (25.7 ± 0.6 mV) of IT-IC hydrogels with a total of 350 μl (bulk or injected filaments) on the damaged tissues is comparable with that of pristine normal muscle tissue (31.7 ± 3.4 mV) (Fig. 3b). The recording of EMG signals indicates that viscous IT-IC hydrogels with a thin filament formfactor can conformally contact the damaged interfaces and stably allow electrical flow between the tissues. Such instantaneous electrophysiological functional recovery was notably different from that of a control group without the injec- tion of IT-IC hydrogels when electrical stimulation was applied from 0.1 V to 10 V (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the IT-IC hydrogel could be used as a surface electrode capable of directly recording the EMG signals from the muscle tissue (Supplementary Fig. 22). These results demonstrate that even after injection, the IT-IC hydrogel enables effective tissue conduction and ultra-conformable contact at the tissue–hydrogel interfaces without areal loss, owing to its reversible conductivity based on biphenyl-driven AuNP formation and modulus matching to that of muscle, respectively. Recent reports suggest that implantation of conductive scaffolds helps myogenic differentiation by efficient electrical conduction 31,32. Thus, filling the defect region with IT-IC hydrogels can promote myogenesis and myoblast proliferation through the effective charge storage capability of the hydrogel even in the absence of cells or growth factors. After induction of volumetric muscle loss (VML) injury (diameter, 8 mm), treatment with IT-IC hydrogel could successfully regenerate the muscle tissue within 4 weeks (Fig. 3d). In histologi- cal analysis through haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, IT-IC@4 significantly increased the number of centrally nucleated myofibres compared with non-treated and gelatin-methacryloyl (Gel-MA)-treated groups at 1 and 2 weeks (Figs. 3e,g and Supplementary Note 9). After 4 weeks, the high aspect ratio of the myofibres demonstrates enhanced myofibre growth induced by the hydrogels (Figs. 3f,h). The implanted IT-IC@4 exhibited gradual degradation, generated a mild immune response and showed acceptable long-term biocom- patibility, as evidenced by the low fibrotic tissue area and infiltration 62 | Nature | Vol 623 | 2 November 2023 Article of inflammatory or immune cells (Supplementary Figs. 23–25 and Supplementary Note 9). In addition, the dissociated AuNPs from IT-IC@4 showed relatively higher accumulation in kidneys, liver and spleen but did not cause significant toxicity (Supplementary Fig. 26 and Supplementary Note 9). In summary, muscle-tissue interfacing by IT-IC hydrogels enables instant tissue–tissue electrical conduc- tion at an early stage after injection as well as further tissue repair at later stages. Sensory and motor signalling Conventional diagnosis and treatment tools have limitations in their use because of the inaccessible tissue surface and insufficient feedback capabilities (details in Supplementary Fig. 27 and Supple- mentary Note 10). The IT-IC hydrogel can overcome such limitations owing to its stretchability, modulus matching, low impedance and pattern-controllable injectability. Notably, our IT-IC hydrogel showed a much higher tensile adhesion strength of 8.8 ± 2.1 kPa on nerve than other existing materials (methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MeHA), 1.9 ± 0.6 kPa; Gel-MA, 1.3 ± 0.6 kPa; HA–PB, 0.9 ± 0.4 kPa) (Fig. 4a). Owing to its exceptional nerve adhesion, the IT-IC hydrogel injected on the rat sciatic nerve was stably maintained without delamination issues, even in stretching or bending modes (Fig. 4b). For immediate and safe access to the nerve using conventional electrical wires, IT-IC hydrogels were sequentially injected in the form of small sphere-like structures (Fig. 4c). These unique features allowed the interface between the nerve and IT-IC hydrogel to facilitate the recording of different sensory neural responses to three modes of mechanical stimulation: strong brush- ing, weak brushing or tapping of the sole of the rat’s foot (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Figs. 28 and 29). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR; strong brushing, 3.0 ± 0.4; weak brushing, 1.9 ± 0.3; tapping, 0.7 ± 0.2) val- ues corresponding to the individual events are almost identical to the SNRs of sensory neural signals previously reported 33 (Fig. 4e). In addi- tion to the mechanoreceptor-to-nerve pathway, the connection was tested in reverse, and stimulation of the nerve with varying frequencies (5, 10, 20 and 50 Hz) and amplitudes (0.1–0.9 V) effectively induced hind-limb muscle contractions without any tissue damage (Fig. 4f–i, Supplementary Fig. 30 and Supplementary Videos 2 and 3). The trend of ankle contraction after the applied voltages matched the EMG signals, indicating that the nerve-to-muscle signalling pathway can be precisely controlled by the IT-IC hydrogel.P = 0.0245 NS a c Interfacing by stacking of the injected IT-IC@4 ﬁlament Injected IT-IC hydrogel ﬁlamentNeedle EMG recording TA muscle (i) (iii) (iv) Stacking by addition of IT-IC hydrogel Multiple connection of the injected IT-IC b Uninjured Bulk IT-IC P = 0.7913 Stimulation voltage: 5 V 050 100 150 200 250 300 350 IT-IC (\u0000l)Vpp (mV) 10 20 30 40 0 Uninjured Injured Treated 0 10 20 30 40 Stimulation voltage (V)Vpp (mV) 12345678 910 0 50 d (ii) Muscle interfacing with 50 \u0000l of IT-IC P < 0.0001 Incised muscle injury model P < 0.0001 0 20 40 60Number of centrally nucleatedmyoﬁbre per 300 \u0000m2 12 Week Injured Gel-MA IT-ICAspect ratio of regeneratedmyoﬁbre (length per width) 0 2 4 6 8 10 TA muscle Treatment with IT-IC Tissue regeneration hg Injured Gel-MA IT-IC NS P < 0.0001 8 mm VML injury model 4 NS P = 0.0215 f12Week 4eInjuredGel-MAIT-IC * ** * * * * ** * * * * * * * * * * ** * ** * * * * * * * * ** 4 * ** * * * * * * * * Repaired myoﬁbre Cylindrical defect IT-IC Fig. 3 | Skeletal muscle-tissue prosthesis through IT-IC hydrogel injection. a, Experimental procedures for in vivo muscle-tissue conduction of IT-IC@4 in the severe VML model (i).

Nature | Vol 623 | 2 November 2023 | 63 To better investigate the feasibility of our bidirectional sensory and motor signalling for C-RAR, we first confirmed the electroneurogram (ENG) recording performance (Fig. 4j, red arrow) of the IT-IC hydro- gel when uninjured, injured and IT-IC hydrogel-treated muscles were electrically stimulated with an increase in the applied voltages (0–1 V) (Fig. 4j–l). ENG signals were detected at 0.4 V for the IT-IC hydrogel- treated case, whereas the ENG signals in the injured condition were detected at 0.6 V (Fig. 4l). Although the ENG signal amplitudes in the uninjured case (for example, 1.08 ± 0.24 mV at 0.5 V) were slightly higher than those in the treated case (for example, 0.48 ± 0.33 mV at 0.5 V), the IT-IC hydrogel was clearly effective in providing both muscle-bridging and nerve-signal-monitoring capabilities. Conversely, EMG measurements (blue arrow) were recorded under the same three conditions while applying voltages (0–1 V) to the peripheral nerve (Fig. 4m). As expected, the IT-IC hydrogel also efficiently interfaced with the corresponding nerve and muscle tissues, resulting in higher EMG Stimulation voltage (V) TreatedInjuredUninjured 0 10 20 30 40EMG amplitude (mV) 1234567 89 10 0 50 1 2 3 4 0 5 Injured TreatedUninjuredENG SNR (dB) Uninjured Injured Treated Uninjured Injured Treated Neural stimulation (100 \u0000A, 50 Hz) Nerve IT-IC interfacing 20 0 5 10 15 10 Stimulation frequency (Hz) 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9 2 ms 10 mV EMG signalsAngle change, (°)60 40 20 0 5 Needle Sciatic nerve IT-IC Neural tissue interfacing Injection IT-IC Stretching Bending Force Force e 0.5s 20 \u0000V 0.5s 20 \u0000V 0.5s 20 \u0000VENG SNR (dB) 0 1 2 3 StrongWeakTap 50 p kl m qo higf b c d n j Muscle tissue interfacing Proximal ENG recording Sciatic nerve TA muscle Stimulation voltage (V)ENG amplitude (mV) Stimulation voltage (V) 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.5 1.0 0 0.5 Uninjured Injured Treated 2.0 0 NS P = 0.0137 P = 0.0264 P = 0.0007 P = 0.0017 P < 0.0001 P = 0.0009 P = 0.008EMG amplitude (mV) Stimulation voltage (V) 20.4 0.60.8 1.0 15 10 0 5 25 20 Injured Treated 0 Uninjured 30 P = 0.0112 P = 0.0182 0.1 V0.3 V 0.5 V 0.7 V 0.9 V Control Proximal Sciatic nerve * * ** ** ** * * ** ******* ** * * P = 0.0187 P = 0.0082 P = 0.0037 P = 0.0061 P = 0.0267 4 IT-IC Nerve Gel-MA IT-ICAdhesion strength (kPa) 0 5 10 15 MeHA HA–PB a B– HO OH OH C O O OH OH B– O O OHNo. of vibrations per second Distal Distal EMG recording EMG recording TA muscle Nerve tissue interfacing ENG recording Strong Weak Tap Fig. 4 | Bidirectional sensory and motor signalling of IT-IC hydrogels in the neuromuscular system. a, Nerve adhesion strength of the IT-IC hydrogel (mean ± s.d.; n = 4 for samples).

In addition to IT-IC hydrogel interfacing in the muscle defect model, our bidirectional func- tionality was demonstrated on the notched nerve and uninjured muscle tissues (Fig. 4n,o). It was noted that IT-IC hydrogel treatment resulted in more effectively delivery of sensory and motor signals compared with the injured case (Fig. 4p, EMG monitoring under nerve stimu- lation; Fig. 4q, SNR comparison of recorded ENG under mechanical stimulation). In other words, the EMG signal amplitude shown in the treated case (26.21 ± 8.02 mV at 5 V) was higher than in the injured case (5.07 ± 1.96 mV at 5 V). Similarly, the ENG signal amplitude shown in the treated case (3.81 ± 0.28 dB at mechanical stimulation of 1.2 N) was higher than in the injured case (2.59 ± 0.23 dB at mechanical stimulation of 1.2 N). In addition, no biological safety issues of IT-IC@4 on the nerve were detected (Supplementary Fig. 31 and Supplementary Note 11). Closed-loop rehabilitation In line with our continuous efforts to develop the IT-IC hydrogel with effective charge delivery and tissue regeneration capabilities and apply it to in vivo bidirectional sensory and motor signalling in anaesthetized rats (Supplementary Figs. 32 and 33 and Supplementary Video 4), we further applied the IT-IC hydrogel to C-RAR, for which awakened rats with muscle injury could move around at an early stage (Fig. 5). To pre- pare for establishing the C-RAR system, a self-healing and stretchable cuff electrode was first wrapped around the rat’s sciatic nerve coated with the IT-IC hydrogel to deliver electrical stimulation (Fig. 5a, top and right inset showing the corresponding image; Supplementary Fig. 34). To measure the EMG evoked by the aforementioned nerve stimulation and then transmitted to the robot motion-triggering system, a stretchable electrode was also implanted into the epimysium c ed b a (i)(ii)(iii) Robot activation Evoked EMG signal Stimulation artefact RightTAmuscle Robotmovement Legmovement (left, right)EMGsignal(mV) Without stimulation 1.5 –1.5 0 063 Time (s) Stimulator EMGrecorder Robot Sciaticnerve TA muscle EMG monitoring Nerve stimulation Step supporting Signal processing Epimysial electrode Cuff electrode IT-IC Nerve Robot activating Foot dragging Nerve stimulation Robot activation Starting step Poor step Irregular foot angle Regular foot angleEMGsignal(mV) With stimulation 1.5 –1.5 0 Robot assistance* ** * 063 Time (s) Fig. 5 | C-RAR system using IT-IC hydrogel. a, Schematic illustration showing the sequential operation of the C-RAR system comprising IT-IC hydrogels, a robot, a treadmill and self-healing stretchable cuff and epimysial electrodes.

Scale bars in c and e, 5 cm. Nature | Vol 623 | 2 November 2023 | 65 coated with the IT-IC hydrogel (Fig. 5a, bottom and right inset show- ing the corresponding image; Supplementary Fig. 35). On the basis of such a setup, the robot is intended to aid the rat’s gait while it walks on the treadmill. Thus, the robot assistance was programmed so that its motion was activated to lift the rat’s foot when the average of the EMG signals within 50 ms recorded from the epimysial electrode implanted into the right tibial anterior muscle exceeded a threshold (Fig. 5a, right; schematics of the C-RAR system and sequential steps of (i) detection of nerve stimulation-evoked EMG signal, (ii) robot-assisted gate of the rat’s right leg and (iii) return of the robot to standby status when the right leg swing is temporarily stopped; Supplementary Figs. 36–38). The activated C-RAR system triggers feedback stimulation that can be changed in proportion to the degree of changes in the averaged EMG signal without undesired open-loop divergence (Supplementary Fig. 39 and Supplementary Note 12). To demonstrate the C-RAR system for immediate movement recov- ery of an awake rat 3 days after surgery with VML injury, we used the bidirectional nerve- and muscle-interfacing function (Fig. 5b–e, Supplementary Fig. 40 and Supplementary Video 5). In a control con- dition (without nerve stimulation), the spontaneous contraction of injured muscle tissues could generate only small tibialis anterior (TA) EMG signals that were rarely above the threshold voltage, leading to gait failure (foot dragging, irregular foot angles and poor steps) with- out the aid of robot assistance (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 40). However, when the nerve stimulation was applied to the rat’s right leg, compound EMG signals were evoked followed by clear detection over the threshold voltage (Fig. 5d), thus successfully triggering robot assistance to fully support the rat’s normal gait with regular foot angles (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 40). To better show the instantane- ous robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAR) performance, we prepared a control experiment in which the IT-IC hydrogel and peripheral nerve interface (PNI)-based nerve stimulation were not applied to the injured rat (see Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Video 6 and Supplementary Fig. 41 for details of gait of each group). Under these conditions, the absence of the muscle–hydrogel interface prevented the instantaneous robot assistance from functioning. Notably, when IT-IC hydrogel was applied to the injured muscle tissue, the resulting conduction allowed the RAR system to function immediately. Although the RAR system alone, without PNI-based nerve stimulation, showed reliable closed-loop results, such a function is limited to muscle tissues with moderate injuries. In this regard, our C-RAR system can be a promising candidate for efficient robot-enabled rehabilitation. Conclusion Injectable prostheses consisting of soft and conductive hyaluronic hydrogels lead to instantaneous C-RAR through muscle and peripheral nerve tissue conduction in the early stage after injury and enhance- ment of tissue repair in the later stage. In the hydrogel network, dynamic coordinate bonds aided by rearrangeable biphenyl bonds play a critical role in securing a desirable mechanical modulus simi- lar to that of tissue, great injectability by efficient energy dissipation against shear stress, conformal contact on rough-tissue interfaces and strain-resistant electrical conductivity. Applying IT-IC hydrogels to tis- sue defects and device–tissue interfaces implements transmission and monitoring of electrophysiological signals. Ultimately, the injectable prosthesis platform brings bidirectional crosstalk between muscle and peripheral nerve tissues for therapeutic recovery in patients with chronic tissue injury.

Sodium hyaluronate (HA; 151 – 300 kDa) was purchased from Lifecore Biomedical. Synthesis of HA–PB To synthesize HA–PB, 100 mg HA was dissolved in 15 ml of distilled water in a 20 ml vial, and the pH was adjusted to 5.5 by adding 1 mol l −1 NaOH. EDC (95.85 mg) and NHS (57.55 mg) were added to the HA solution. Then, 4-aminophenylboronic acid (86.7 mg) was added slowly to the HA–EDC–NHS solution (pH 5.5). The mixture was stirred for 24 h, dia- lysed against distilled water with sodium chloride (9 g l −1) for 3 days using a regenerated cellulose dialysis membrane (molecular weight cutoff) and lyophilized for 4 days. The degree of conjugation of boronic acid was determined by proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR, Oxford 300 NMR, VARIAN) spectroscopy, and the integration value was calculated with MestReNova v.6.0.2. For that, the lyophilized HA–PB (7.5 mg) was dissolved in deuterium oxide (750 μl). Fabrication of IT-IC hydrogels To prepare the IT-IC hydrogel, the HA–PBlow or HA–PBhigh was dissolved in distilled water at a final concentration of 2 wt%. Then, NaOH (con- centration of stock solution = 1 mol l−1; half the volume was treated first, and the remainder treated after adding HAuCl4) and HAuCl4 (100 mmol l −1) were sequentially added to the HA–PB solution (a total volume of 400 μl) at various ratios (NaOH/Au3+ ratio = 1, 2, 4 or 6). The reaction proceeded for at least 120 min. Furthermore, the HA–PBhigh hydrogels with 1 and 3 wt% were prepared at a NaOH/Au3+ ratio of 4 in the same manner. To prepare the less-conductive IT-IC hydrogel, HA–PBhigh hydrogels with 5 and 10 μl of HAuCl4 were prepared at a NaOH/Au 3+ ratio of 4 in the same manner. Rheological analysis The storage (G′) and loss (G″) moduli of the IT-IC hydrogels were meas- ured using an HR10 rheometer (TA Instruments) under oscillatory frequency sweep mode (0.1–10 Hz, at 1% strain) with a 20 mm plate geometry and gap size of 100 μm at room temperature. In addition, the shear viscosity of IT-IC@4 was monitored as the shear rate increased from 0.01 to 100 s −1. To demonstrate self-healing properties, the G′ and G″ values of the IT-IC hydrogels were measured under alternating strains of 1% and 1,000% at a fixed frequency of 1 Hz. Each strain was applied to the hydrogels for 180 s. To investigate the gelation time, the G′ and G″ moduli of either IT-IC@2 or IT-IC@4 (at 1 Hz, 1% of strain) were meas- ured as a function of time after mixing the polymer, NaOH and Au3+. Chemical characterization of IT-IC hydrogels To investigate the gelation mechanism of the IT-IC hydrogels, XPS and FT-IR analyses were conducted. First, for XPS analysis (Thermo ESCALAB250), samples prepared with two NaOH/Au 3+ ratios (1 or 4) and HA–PB dissolved in distilled water (2 wt%) were dried onto a silicon wafer. The obtained raw spectra of each sample were deconvoluted using Origin 5 software. Second, for FT-IR analysis (ATR FT-IR; IFS 66 v/S, Bruker), the sample was prepared in the same manner as for XPS, and the spectrum was obtained in the wavenumber ranging from 4,000 to 600 cm−1. Size analysis of AuNPs in the IT-IC hydrogels The size of AuNPs distributed in the IT-IC hydrogels was analysed in two ways: ultraviolet–visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy (Agilent 8453) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ( JEM−2100F, JEOL). For sample preparation, 100 μl of IT-IC hydrogel was vigorously vor- texed, dispersed in 900 μl of distilled water and centrifuged. The absorption spectra of the supernatant solution were analysed using the UV–vis detector, and part of the solution (5 μl) was drop-cast in 300-mesh copper grids and dried for TEM. In the TEM images, the size of the AuNPs was measured with ImageJ software. Conformal contact test of the IT-IC hydrogels To evaluate the conformal contact ability of the IT-IC hydrogels, freshly dissected TA muscle tissues (Sprague Dawley (SD) rat, male, 300–350 g, 10 weeks) and 3D curved objects were prepared. IT-IC@4 encapsulating fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma-Aldrich) was applied to muscle tissue stained with rhodamine B (Sigma-Aldrich). A cross-sectional fluorescent image was obtained by confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8 STED). Furthermore, the conformability on the curved objects was evaluated using injected filaments (26 and 18G). A mould with various curvature from 0.1 to 0.9 (the difference of each hill and valley was 0.05) was fabricated by stereolithography apparatus (SLA) type 3D printing (commissioned by a company, 3D PRO). The optical images were obtained by simple magnifier (PS-EM307, Presentshop). Computational MD simulations The hydrogel system was constructed using two polymeric backbone chains crosslinked with biphenyl rings at a ratio of ten monomer units to one biphenyl group. To incorporate water into the system, the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) water model 34 was used, being filled to 80% of the total weight. LigParGen force-field mapping35 was used to represent the hydrogel at an all-atomic level. To accurately account for long-range electrostatic interactions, the particle–particle particle–mesh solver method was used. The MD calculations were performed with a time step of 2 × 10 −15 s. Before the MD simulation, the FIRE algorithm was used for energy minimization. A 10 ns isothermal– isobaric (NPT) simulation was carried out using the Nosé–Hoover thermostat36 and the Parrinello–Rahman barostat37, maintaining the system at a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 1.0 bar. Following the NPT simulation, a shear deformation MD simulation was conducted in the xz plane, applying a constant shear rate of 10 8 per second, until a strain (= dx z −1) of 2 was reached. For the entire simulation process, the LAMMPS software package38 was used as the computational tool. Electrical characterization of the IT-IC hydrogels To investigate the electrical resistance of IT-IC hydrogels, samples were prepared with a cylindrical shape (diameter, length: 4.78 mm, 20 mm) of bulk IT-IC hydrogel and filaments were extruded with different gauges of needle (diameter, length: 0.63 mm, 20 mm (26G); 2.29 mm, 20 mm (23G); 3.53 mm, 20 mm (18G)). The electrical resistance (Ω) was meas- ured using a four-point probe method (Keithley 2450 source meter; Keithley) with equal probe spacing of 5 mm. From the resistance of bulk hydrogel, the conductivity at 0% strain was calculated using the following equation: lA RConductivity (S cm )= /( ×) −1 where A is the cross-sectional area of the hydrogel (cm2), l is the length of hydrogel (cm) and R is the measured resistance (Ω). Using a sample with initial length of 5 mm, the change in resistance was measured while stretching at 1 mm s−1 (strain ranging from 0 to 100%). Then, the electrical hysteresis of the sample was measured at the same stretching–releasing speed up to various strains (from 0% to 100%). Animal experiments All animal experiments were conducted with approval from the Insti- tutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sungkyunkwan Univer- sity (SKKUIACUC2021-03-28-1 and SKKUIACUC2022-08−36-2) and under published standards for humane animal care (n = 3 or 5). In addition, the authors conducted all animal experiments in accord- ance with the ethical protocol given by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. In vivo muscle-tissue-IT-IC hydrogels interfacing test To verify the efficient charge transfer of IT-IC hydrogels at muscle tissue–tissue interfaces, an in vivo muscle defect model was used (SD rats male, 300–350 g, 10 weeks). The TA muscles were first sepa- rated on Teflon tape to prevent electrical conduction to other muscles and cut using a scalpel. The cut muscles were spaced approximately 5 mm apart. The upper muscle of the damaged region was electrically stimulated using two pin-shaped single electrodes with a waveform generator (Arbitrary, 1 Channel, 20 MHz, 33511B, Keysight Technolo- gies, Inc.). While IT-IC@4 was injected into the damaged region (total volume = 400 μl, injections of 50 μl each with a 26G needle), the EMG signals from the bottom muscle were recorded using biosignal ampli- fiers (Bio Amp FE231, AD instruments) and a data acquisition device (PowerLab 8/35, AD instruments) with cathode and anode electrodes inserted at 2 cm intervals into the bottom of the TA muscle and refer- ence electrodes inserted into the tail. The EMG signals were filtered according to the ISEK (International Society of Electrophysiology and Kinesiology) standard (1,500 Hz, low pass). Furthermore, for evalua- tion of the EMG recording capability of IT-IC hydrogels, we conducted the aforementioned stimulation, recording and signal processing experiments in normal animals (SD rats, male, 300–350 g, 10 weeks). The IT-IC hydrogel was applied to the rat’s TA muscle and two pin-type electrodes for EMG recording were inserted into it. The recorded EMG signals were compared with those recorded from the muscle without hydrogel. Histological analysis To evaluate muscle-tissue repair by implantation of IT-IC hydrogel, the VML model (SD rats, male, 300–350 g, 10 weeks) with a 3-mm-deep cylindrical defect (diameter = 8 mm) was used. IT-IC or Gel-MA hydrogel (200 μl) was implanted in the defect region. For histological analy- sis, the rats were killed 1, 2 or 4 weeks later, and the tissue was fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde solution. The tissue specimen was sec- tioned in the cross-sectional or longitudinal direction and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (or Masson-trichrome staining agent for the IT-IC@4 group; American MasterTech Scientific). All procedures were commissioned by GENOSS. At randomly selected positions on the H&E-stained images, the number of centronucleated myofibres and the aspect ratio of the myofibres were measured using ImageJ software. For Masson-trichrome stained images, the fibrotic area (%) was calculated by the following equation. Each area was quantified using ImageJ software. Fibrotic area (%)= blue coloured area/total stained (red andbluecoloured) area ×100 For immunofluorescence staining, the freshly dissected muscle tissue was embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura) and serially sectioned at 10 μm using a cryomicrotome. The tissue slides were incubated in primary antibody solutions as follows: (phyco- erythrin (PE)-conjugated CD3e monoclonal (145-2C11) (1:1,000, Invitrogen, USA); FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD8a (1:1,000, Bio- Legend); APC-eFluor 780 conjugated CD11b monoclonal (M1/70) (1:1,000, Invitrogen); APC-conjugated F4/80 monoclonal (BM8) (1:1,000, Invitrogen); and anti-laminin (ab11575, 1:400; Abcam)). Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400, Invitro- gen) was used as secondary antibodies to stain laminin green. Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The number of positive inflammatory cells was counted in randomly selected immunofluorescence-stained images and calculated per mm2. Adhesiveness of IT-IC hydrogels on nerve tissue The adhesive strength of the hydrogels on nerve tissue was measured using a universal testing machine (34SC−1, Instron). The peroneal nerve was dissected from the pig’s forelimbs, cut into 1 cm × 0.5 cm pieces and fixed on a T-shaped holder (surface area, 20 × 20 mm 2; height, 20 mm) using conventional Superglue. For control groups, MeHA, Gel-MA hydrogels and HA–PB pre-gel solution were prepared (Supplementary Methods). The HA–PB polymer was dissolved in distilled water at a final concentration of 2 wt%. All samples were spread on the epineurium of one nerve tissue and squeezed with another tissue piece. Tensile stress was applied to the terminal of the holder using a 50 N load cell at a speed of 0.5 mm s−1. The tensile adhesive strength (kPa) was calculated by dividing the maximum load (N) by the attached area (m2). The RAR/C-RAR system using IT-IC hydrogels IT-IC hydrogel was injected into the surfaces of the TA muscle and sciatic nerve of rats with VML injury. As-prepared intrinsically stretchable elec- trodes were conformally mounted onto the TA muscle and the sciatic nerve. The stretchable devices used as either cuff-type neural interfacing or epimysial electrodes were wired to external interconnects fixed to the heads of IT-IC hydrogel-treated VML rats (Supplementary Methods). The external interconnects and wire-shaped electrodes penetrating the rat’s tail were connected to the waveform generator and data acquisition device, respectively. The sciatic nerve of the rat was electrically stimulated every 3 s with a specific pulse (duration of 1 ms) applied by the waveform generator. This stimulation was applied to rats walking on the tread- mill (LT320, LAIYUE BIOTECH) at a speed of 3 m min −1 and was adjusted depending on the level of EMG signals as follows. Considering the electri- cal simulation, we set the initial parameters (initial stimulation ampli- tude of 50 mV, update weights of 5, EMG threshold (multiplying by 15) and window size (5,000 samples every 50 ms)). EMG signals were then recorded in real time at a sampling frequency of 100 kHz. The EMG signals were simultaneously processed with a band-pass filter (200 to 1,500 Hz) to remove noise associated with rat movements. The processed EMG signals were confirmed using LabChart 8 Pro (AD Instruments) software. The absolute values of the signals filtered during 50 ms were calculated in real time to take the mean value using MATLAB software, for which codes were designed using the Labchart-MATLAB application programming interface (https://www.adinstruments.com/support/knowledge-base/ can-data-be-streamed-labchart-windows-matlab-while-sampling) and MATLAB-Dobot Studio application programming interface (https:// www.dobot-robots.com/products/education/magician.html). We increased the amplitude of the electrical stimulation by 10 mV incre- ments when the averaged EMG signals were lower than the predeter- mined threshold voltage. If the averaged EMG signals exceeded the threshold value, the cue to trigger the robot (Dobot Magician, DOBOT) assistance at 2 cm in the z axis was activated, and the stimulation ampli- tude was changed in proportion to the degree of changes in the average EMG signal. In the RAR system based on muscle–IT-IC interfacing without PNI, the underlying closed-loop operation entailing the electrical stimula- tion and signal recording processes is almost identical to that of the C-RAR system using muscle– and nerve–IT-IC interfacing. The only difference in this system is that the closed-loop operation is performed on the real-time monitoring and analysis of EMG signals generated from the injured and IT-IC-treated muscle tissues. For quantitative analysis, we manually analysed gait cycle (%) in stance and swing phase modes, maximum toe height and step width data from recorded videos. All videos were analysed with Adobe premiere pro v.22.5, PotPlayer v.1.7.21831 and VapMix2. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test using GraphPad Software (Prism v.7). Article P values were used to determine significant differences (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001).
