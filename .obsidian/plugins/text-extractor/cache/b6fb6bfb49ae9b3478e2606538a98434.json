It is the result of a network of interconnecting sensory nerves, that supplies many different tissues/organs. 9 Brachial Plexus ◼ Network of spinal nerves that controls muscle movements & sensation in upper limb ◼ Components ◼ Roots ◼ Trunks ◼ Divisions ◼ Cords ◼ Branches 10 Formation of Brachial Plexus ◼ Roots (5): Ventral rami of ◼ C5, C6 , C7, C8, T1 ◼ Prefixed brachial plexus: ◼ C4 – C8. ◼ Large contribution from C4 with no significant contribution from T1 ◼ Postfixed brachial plexus: ◼ C6 – T2. ◼ Large contribution from T2 with no significant contribution from C5 C1 C5 T1 11 Trunks & Divisions Trunks (3) ◼ Superior trunk: C5 & C6 ◼ Middle trunk: C7 ◼ Inferior trunk: C8 & T1 Divisions (6) ◼ Each trunk splits into anterior (3) & posterior (3) divisions 12 Cords (3) ◼ Lateral cord: anterior divisions of superior & middle trunks ◼ Medial cord: anterior division of inferior trunk ◼ Posterior cord: posterior divisions of superior, middle & inferior trunks Relations of components ◼ Roots: Between anterior & middle scalene muscles ◼ Trunks: Cross posterior triangle of neck ◼ Divisions: Behind the clavicle 14 Relations of components ◼ Cords: ◼ Lie in axilla and named according to their relation with the 2nd part of axillary artery ◼ Lateral ◼ Medial ◼ Posterior 15 Supraclavicular Branches ◼ Roots: ◼ Muscular (scalene & longus colli muscles) ◼ Dorsal scapular nerve ◼ Long thoracic nerve ◼ Contribution from C5 to Phrenic nerve (C3-C5) ◼ Trunks (Superior): ◼ Nerve to subclavius ◼ Suprascapular nerve 16 Infraclavicular Branches (13) ◼ Lateral cord (3) ◼ lateral pectoral ◼ musculocutaneous ◼ lateral head of median nerve ◼ Posterior cord (5) ◼ axillary nerve ◼ upper subscapular ◼ thoracodorsal ◼ lower subscapular ◼ radial nerve 17 Infraclavicular Branches… ◼ Medial cord (5) ◼ medial cutaneous nerve of arm ◼ medial cutaneous nerve of forearm ◼ medial pectoral ◼ medial head of median nerve ◼ ulnar nerve 18 From Nerve Roots Muscles Cutaneous Roots Dorsal scapular C5 rhomboid muscles & levator scapulae -
