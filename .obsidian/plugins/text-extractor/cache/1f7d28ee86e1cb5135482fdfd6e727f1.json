Single cilium, few short microvilli. • Dark cells: few, with cytoplasmic apical folds and numerous mitochondria Ross and Pawlina, 2006 Excretory passages • Collecting ducts exit at the area cribrosa • Series of excretory passages till the urinary bladder: • Transitional epithelium • Urethra • Male ~20cm in 3 segments: • Prostatic urethra lined with transitional epithelium • Membranous urethra lined with stratified or pseudostratified columnar epithelium • Penile urethra lined with pseudostratified epithelium that becomes stratified squamous epithelium • Female ~3-5cm: • lined with pseudostratified epithelium that becomes stratified squamous epithelium Ross and Pawlina, 2006 Recap Medullary rays","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
