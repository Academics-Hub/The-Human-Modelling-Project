The zygote does not grow in size but the cells increase in number and become smaller Following fertilization Blastocyst ❖On entering the uterine cavity, the zona pellucida starts to degenerates, uterine fluid will enter through these defects to create pressure amongst the blastomeres ❖The accumulation of fluid forms a blastocoel fluid filled cavity. ❖Because of this pressure, the internal cells of the blastocyst will be pushed to one pole. ❖The inner cell mass will form the embryo proper, while the trophoblast will contribute to the formation of the placenta. Embedding of blastocyst ❖The blastocyst attaches to the endometrium at the embryonic pole. ❖The outer cell mass (trophoblast) cells displace endometrial cells in the central part of the implantation site. ❖Some decidual cells degenerate adjacent to penetrating trophoblast and provide rich embryonic nutrition. ❖The blastocyst is now partially embedded in the endometrium. ❖The blastocyst will then implant at the end of the first week in order to receive haemotrophic nutrition (histotrophic nutrition is no longer adequate at this stage). IMPLANTATION ❖ Implantation - The process by which blastocyst settles into the endometrium ❖ Gravid phase replaces the menstrual phase; Endometrial decline delayed after parturition ❖ Embedding of blastocyst (early second week) ❖ Chorion cells secrete hCG and luteotropins - CL maintenance – oestrogen (E) and progesterone (P) ❖ Endometrium’s decline is prevented ❖ The period when uterus is most receptive for implantation of the blastocyst which lasts for about 4 days ❖ It follows around 6 days after the LH peak and completes on day 10 or during the 20th to the 23rd day after the last menstrual period ❖ Characterized by the plasma membrane transformation which bring the blastocyst nearer to the endometrium and immobilize it ❖ The implantation window results from series of programmed actions of P and E on the endometrium THE WINDOW OF IMPLANTATION ❖ Decidualisation could be viewed as the postovulatory process of endometrial remodelling in preparation for pregnancy ❖ Decidual process denotes the morphological and biochemical reprogramming of the endometrial stromal compartment which includes CT, glands and spiral arteries ❖ Endometrial reaction after implantation DECIDUAL REGIONS Decidua basalis - The area of endometrium immediately under implanting embryo which becomes the maternal part of the placenta Decidua capsularis - A thin layer of endometrium that lies between the implantation site and the uterine lumen Decidua parietalis - The mucous membrane lining the main cavity of the pregnant uterus elsewhere than at the site of attachment of the embryo DECIDUA ❖ During implantation, the trophoblast differentiates into two distinct layers: ❖ The outer syncytiotrophoblast. This is a multinucleated cytoplasmic mass. It does not undergo mitosis. Its function is to invade the endometrium ❖ Whereas the inner cytotrophoblast is mitotically active, it fuses with the syncytiotrophoblast ❖ The syncytiotrophoblast then implants the blastocyst into the endometrium of the uterus. CHANGES DURING IMPLANTATION 1.Epithelium of uterine endometrium 2.Hypoblast 3.Sycyntiotrophoblast 4.Cytotrophoblast 5.Epiblast 6.Blastocyst cavity Syncytiotrophoblast (ST) - Invader ❖ Intrudes between epithelial cells ❖ Erodes stroma and capillaries ❖ Surface re-epithelised - becomes decidua capsularis ❖ Maternal vessels on trophoblast - O2 and nutrient transfer in maternal blood lakes Cytotrophoblast (CT) ❖ Fuses with syncytiotrophoblast ❖ Blastocyst contact causes stromal cells to fully decidualise Syncytiotrophoblast and Cytotrophoblast Uteroplacental circulation ❖As the embryo develops, isolated lacunae appear in the syncytiotrophoblast. ❖Lacunea become filled with maternal blood from ruptured endometrial cappillaries and secretions from eroded endometrial glands; embroyotroph. ❖The opening of eroded uterine vessels into the lacunea represent the beginning of the uteroplacental circulation. ❖ Adjacent syntiotrophoblast lacunae fuse to form lacunae networks ❖ Blastocyst is now deeply embedded. ❖ The cytotrophoblast sends extensions into the substance of the sytotrophoblast to form the primary villi ❖ Arterial and venous branches of maternal vessels communicate with syncytiotrophoblast lacunea, circulation is established ❖ Lacunar network at embryonic pole are the primordia of the placenta intervillous space of the placenta. ❖ Syncytiotrophoblast + cytotrophoblast= primary villus ❖ Syncytiotrophoblast + cytotrophoblast + extraembryonic mesoderm = secondary villus ❖ Syncytiotrophoblast + cytotrophoblast + embryonic mesoderm + embryonic capillaries = tertiary villus ❖ Placenta is a disk shaped organ serves for the exchange of materials between the fetal and maternal circulation (maintenance of the fetus) ❖ Consists of the fetal portion - chorion and maternal portion - decidua basalis ❖ Both parts involved in physiologic exchange between maternal and fetal circulation Proliferation of the CT, chorionic mesoderm and blood vessels give rise to: ❖ CT covered by ST form the primary villi (Day 11-13) ❖ Develop a loose mesenchymal core - secondary villi (Day 16) ❖ Development of a capillary system - tertiary villi (Day 28) ❖ Inter-villous spaces site of exchange ❖ Presence of vascular channels, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and Hofbauer cells ❖ Hofbauer cells - large cells with vacuolated cytoplasm (macrophages and fetal Ag presenting cells) ❖ BV join up to form 2 arteries and a vein in the umbilicus PLACENTA Separation of the fetal and maternal blood, referred to as the placental barrier, is maintained primarily by the layers of fetal tissue. At its thinnest, the placental barrier consists of the: ❖ Syncytiotrophoblast ❖ Discontinuous inner cytotrophoblast layer ❖ Basal lamina of the trophoblast ❖ Connective (mesenchymal) tissue of the villus ❖ Basal lamina of the endothelium ❖ Endothelium of the fetal placental capillary in the tertiary villus This barrier has an important function of exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide— It also has a particular type of macrophage in its connective tissue, the fetal placental antigen–presenting cells (Hofbauer cell). PLACENTA BARRIER ❖ Areola—central pigmented area ❖ Nipple—protruding central area of areola ❖ Lobes—internal structures that radiate around nipple ❖ Lobules—located within each lobe and contain clusters of alveolar glands ❖ Alveolar glands—produce milk when a woman is lactating (producing milk) ❖ Lactiferous ducts—connect alveolar glands to nipple ❖ Lactiferous sinus—dilated portion where milk accumulates MAMMARY GLAND ❖ Paired specialized organs located on the anterior pectoral regions ❖ A main circular body ❖ Axillary tail that is smaller and extends towards the axilla ❖ Centrally placed nipple ❖ Surrounding the nipple is a pigmented area called the areola ❖ Present in males and females ❖ Contain mammary glands in females (terms are used interchangeably) GENERAL ANATOMY ❖ It is conical in shape ❖ The colour may be pink, light brown, or dark brown ❖ It is covered in keratinised stratified squamous epithelium that is continuous with the skin ❖ The skin around the nipple is called the areola ❖ The areola darkens during pregnancy ❖ Nipple epithelium lies on a connective tissue stroma with abundant smooth muscle ❖ Smooth muscle fibres are arranged in a circular pattern around the deeper lactiferous ducts ❖ But assume a parallel configurations towards the nipple. This assist with erection of the nipple ❖ There is an abundant nerve supply in breast tissue NIPPLE ❖ The main function is produce milk that feeds the baby ❖ Maternal provision of nutrients begins within 48 hours of delivery ❖ A clear fluid named colostrum or ‘foremilk” is secreted first ❖ Colostrum is rich in proteins (lactalbumin and lactoprotein), immunoglobulins lactoferrin and growth factors. ❖ The immunoglobulins or antibodies provide passive immunity to the new born. ❖ Proper milk delivery then follows after the colostrum ❖ Human milk contains about 1% protein, 7%lactose, 3.5% fat ,peptide hormones, growth factors, cortisol and insulin ❖ Human milk contains an equivalent of about 70kcal/100mL ❖ By the first week 550ml/day is produced ❖ This may increase to 2000ml/day ❖ Infants nurse roughly 6 to 12 months FUNCTIONS OF THE BREAST ❖ Mammary cells package proteins and fats in secretory droplets ❖ The droplets are secreted into alveoli under the influence of the hormone prolactin ❖ The infants ‘anticipatory signals (eg crying) stimulates the release of the hormone oxytocin ❖ Oxytocin causes contraction of myoepithelial cells around the alveoli and smooth muscle and around the duct walls ❖ The ‘let down reflex’ is triggered and milk accumulates in the areolar area ❖ The infant suckles and gets the milk via perforations in nipple FUNCTIONS OF THE BREAST ❖ During puberty in girls, breasts increase in size while breasts remain flattened in boys ❖ The nipple becomes prominent ❖ There is accumulation of adipose tissue and connective tissue ❖ There is increased branching duct system ❖ All these changes are under the influence of estrogens. ❖ During pregnancy breasts enlarge, nipples enlarge, the areolar becomes darker ❖ After menopause breasts shrink, reduction in fat, loss of elasticity and sagging due to declining estrogen. BREAST CHANGES DURING PUBERTY, PREGNACY AND POST MENOPAUSE ❖ The breast is composed of several mammary glands ❖ Mammary glands are modified sweat glands ❖ These are exocrine glands that are classified as compound tubulo alveolar glands (describe a compound tubulo alveolar gland) ❖ Mammary glands consists of a series if ducts and secretory lobules ❖ There are about 15 –25lobules that are divided by dense connective tissue septa ❖ The lobules are embedded in connective tissue and adipose tissue ❖ Each lobule functions as an individual gland that has collecting ducts that empty independently into the nipple THE NON-LACTATING BREAST ❖ Each lobule consists of many tubulo alveolar secretory end pieces and ducts ❖ Each lobule is drained by a series of ducts ❖ These ducts converge at the nipple in a radial pattern ❖ The histology changes slightly during the menstrual cycle, e.g, duct proliferation, edema of the connective tissue stroma, breast enlargement in response to high estrogen levels. ❖ Lactiferous ducts and terminal ducts are lined by simple cuboidal epithelium with myoepithelial cells ❖ Close to the nipple, lactiferous ducts dilate to form lactiferous sinuses ❖ Lactiferous sinuses are lined by stratified columnar or cuboidal epithelium that changes to stratified squamous epithelium towards the openings HISTOLOGY OF NON LACTATING MAMARY GLAND ❖ Connective tissue and adipose tissue amounts decrease ❖ Epithelial tubulo alveolar cells produce milk that accumulates in the lumen ❖ Milk also accumulates in the lactiferous ducts ❖ Secretory cells assume a low cuboidal shape ❖ Spherical lipid and protein droplets accumulate within the cytoplasm of secretory cells ❖ Protein is released by a merocrine mode of secretion ❖ Lipids/fats by an apocrine mode of secretion ❖ Myoepithelial cells ( revise their function) (describe a merocrine and apocrine mode of secretions). ❖ Vacuoles containing milk, proteins, fat droplets accumulate at the apical cytoplasm of alveolar cells. These will be released by apocrine(fats) and merocrine(proteins) mode of secretion THE LACTATING BREAST 1-Vaculoes 2-Milk within the lumen 3-Myoepithelal cells Connective tissue septa Duct Myoepithelial cells Alveoli RECAP HISTOLOGICAL FEATURES ❖Histology of all types of growing follicles and hormonal control of the events related to the follicular development ❖Detailed description and histology of the three endometrial phases of the normal menstrual cycle and the influence of hormones (including the source of their secretions) ❖Histological description and classification of mammary glands and their mode and nature of secretion ❖Implantation, implantation window and decidualisation ❖Placenta, histology of the fetal and maternal portion and Placental barrier ❖Elaine, N., Marieb, K. and Suzanne, M., 2017.
