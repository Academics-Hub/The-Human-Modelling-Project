For communication, please do not send me an email if you need clarification on any of the slides. Let us communicate via the forum function on Sakai so that everyone who wants to read the answers can do so. The link for the chat function is https://ulwazi.wits.ac.za/courses/27146/discussion_topics/243163.The questions that you see in the text are not for marks, but are there to help you think through the processes that are being described. Essentially the biochemistry section is about explaining the role of the nutrients that we eat. That is, what is the nutrient, what does the nutrient do at a biological level, how does the nutrient contribute to what the body is and in a lot of cases, how does the nutrient provide energy. Thus we have been studying how nutrition is the relationship of food substances (nutrients) to living bodies. Carbohydrates, proteins and lipids are macronutrients that are required in large amounts. We will now focus on proteins, which simply put are very similar to the carbohydrates, but importantly have an amino group in the protein chemical structure. Do remember that in nutrition, the term “essential” defines some nutrient that the body cannot make and must be obtained from the diet. 1 The course objectives identify protein-energy malnutrition as the main pathological condition that students have to understand. As shown above, this protein-energy malnutrition may occur with oedema (top left) or is non-oedematous (top right). By the end of this series of lectures you should be able to explain the pathophysiology of what is occurring in both of these patients. 2 Marasmus is the politically incorrect wording of non-oedematous protein energy malnutrition. As you can see it is easier to say marasmus, but do get into the habit of using the correct terminology. As often occurs in nutritional deficiency states, it is not only one nutrient that is present in insufficient amounts, but in the case of the patient above, the patient also presents with a vitamin C and a vitamin B2 deficiency. 3 The oedematous form of protein energy malnutrition is commonly called kwashiorkor, and again try not to use this term. If you are in the clinical degree you will learn a lot more, in pathology, about the differences between classical and marasmic kwashiorkor; but for second-year physiology, we will only briefly explain the difference. 4 Our roadmap for the concepts we need to understand are written in the slide above. We will explain why need to ingest (eat) protein regularly for the maintenance of good health. Please note that in these lectures health has a very narrow definition. Good health means the absence of disease and the maintenance of homeostasis. We will not cover any aspects of mental wellbeing as this aspect is not in the second-year objectives. The biochemical aspects we shall learn about include the identification of protein monomers (amino acids) and revise how polymerisation of these amino acids results in polypeptide (protein) formation. In the gastrointestinal tract series of lectures you will learn about the digestion (breakdown of macromolecules) and absorption (monomers being taken up into the bloodstream from the gut) of nutrients. In this series, we will briefly describe protein digestion. Once amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream we will describe their role in the synthesis of albumin. As you learnt in body fluids, albumin is the main plasma protein responsible for the capillary oncotic pressure. The two diseases that are important in this section are both forms of protein-energy malnutrition. If albumin is deficient oedema occurs. Albumin synthesis occurs in the liver and we will learn about the liver as an important organ that determines the use and degradation of amino acids in the body. 56 Carbohydrates and lipids are mainly used for energy storage. In healthy people, proteins are a less important as source of energy except in energy deficiency diseases. Proteins are highly variable in structure and chemical properties. For example enzymes are protein biological catalysts, haemoglobin carries oxygen, collagen is the main connective tissue and insulin is a polypeptide molecule. Many different food types contain protein. The diversity of these dietary sources means that most people with access to food can obtain the required amounts of protein required to maintain good health. Healthy children are growing and so they need relatively more protein per day than adults, because healthy children are growing their body tissues. Excess carbohydrates are stored as glycogen in the liver or lipid in adipose tissue. However, nitrogen is not stored except as part of protein which is synthesised according to the body’s need rather than for storage. If the dietary consumption of protein exceeds the body’s requirement, the nitrogen in amino acids is removed by the liver (deamination) and the carbon skeleton remaining is stored as glycogen and lipid. The nitrogen is converted to urea by the liver, and the urea is excreted. Briefly, amino acids are incorporated into new proteins because of the constant turnover (new proteins are constantly being made and degraded). If dietary protein is in excess, the proteins are metabolized to glycogen or fat and subsequently used for energy metabolism. The amine group is removed as NH4+ and converted to urea in the liver. Whether amino acids go to protein or energy is determined by hormones: - insulin increases conversion of amino acids and glucose to protein. - cortisol increases conversion of protein and amino acids to glucose during starvation when there is insufficient carbohydrate and fat. Muscle wasting occurs and the protein is used to make many molecules important for metabolism e.g. neurotransmitters, hormones, DNA bases, all of which contain nitrogen. 7 Most of us have noticed that after showering, there is hair on the plughole. Hair is made of the protein keratin and so this example shows that we do not only lose protein as urea, but we lose protein in other ways too. Gastrointestinal tract epithelial cells are also rapidly lost in faeces, our skin gets scraped regularly and so we lose protein in that way too. This means that this lost protein must be replaced for maintenance of good health. But, as we have explained, protein is not stored and so humans must ingest protein regularly. Thus protein ingestion (input) must compensate for protein that is being used and lost (output). When protein intake matches protein loss, the individual has a nitrogen equilibrium. When bodybuilders and elite athletes are rapidly gaining muscle, their nitrogen balance becomes positive as more protein is made as muscle than is lost. For individuals who are starving, more protein is lost and so they have a negative nitrogen balance. Questions: What do you think would happen to a type I diabetic with regards to their nitrogen balance and why? Individuals who are undergoing stress have high concentrations of cortisol. What effect would the high cortisol concentration have on their nitrogen balance? The basic unit of carbohydrate is a monosaccharide. In proteins, the monomeric unit is an amino acid. As you can see from the figure above, amino acids are named for their amino group (NH2) and acidic group (COOH). The side chain R varies in chemical structure. This variance gives amino acids their physical and chemical properties. Thus some R groups make proteins hydrophilic (dissolve in water), hydrophobic (dissolve in lipid), more acidic or more basic. There are 20 naturally occurring amino acids in the body and each one has a different R group. Do not worry about learning the structures of the 20 different amino acids, shown in the following slides. 89 The variability of protein structure, chemistry and function results from chemistry of amino acid R side-chains. Side chains perform interactions within proteins and between different proteins and different subunits. The side chain interactions depend on the chemical nature of the R group and may involve disulphide bonding between cysteine amino acids, hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions between hydrophilic R groups and Van der Waals interactions between hydrophobic side chains. These interactions stabilize the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins. The interactions also allow the changes in structure that allow functional proteins such as enzymes to work. Essential amino acids cannot be made by humans. Ones that are important are lysine, tryptophan, methionine and threonine, because they are most deficient in certain diets. Other amino acids can be synthesized from metabolic intermediates (e.g. alanine from pyruvate) or from essential amino acids (e.g. tyrosine from phenylalanine). These non essential amino acids are made by the body but are still important. Non-essential refers to the fact that they can be made as opposed to having to be obtained from the diet. There are 20 naturally occurring amino acids with different side chains. DO NOT MEMORIZE the structures. The order of amino acids is different from each protein, and is determined by the genes for each protein. Not all proteins have all of the essential amino acids. Humans can make 11 amino acids, but 9 cannot be made and must be obtained from the diet. These 9 essential amino acids are also called indispensable. We can synthesize other 11 from carbohydrates and fatty acids, but we must get essential amino acids from the diet. 101112 Variability of protein structure, chemistry and function results from the chemistry of amino acid side-chains. Hydrophobic amino acids are insoluble in water, and are used for making membrane and structural proteins. The rest are hydrophilic and can make hyrogen bonds with water and other important molecules. Some are charged, whereby acidic can form ionic interactions with basic side chains. Side chains perform interactions within proteins and between different proteins and different subunits. 13 This cartoon shows green hydrophobic R groups and blue hydrophilic R groups. The hydrophobic R groups hide away from water (hydro = water, phobia = fear), whilst the hydrophilic (phil = love of) can make hydrogen bonds (red) with water and so dissolve in water. Remember that 60% of our bodies are water and so molecules that are present in aqueous environments must be able to dissolve in water. The more hydrogen bonds a protein can make, the better the water solubility. 14 For this slide, and for my series of lectures, I do not expect you to remember structures. Understanding the concept is what is important, not memorising the structure. We have defined amino acids (or residues as some text books call them) as the monomeric units of proteins. Proteins are simply many amino acids (polypeptides) strung together to form a chain. The example above shows four amino acids (methionine, aspartic acid, leucine and tyrosine) that polymerise to form a peptide. This peptide is made up of the 4 different amino acids. Peptides have peptide bonds (CO-NH) between the amino acids. These peptide bonds are covalent bonds and so are strong and difficult to break. However, we know that proteins are large polypeptides that have to be digested because they are too big to diffuse across gastrointestinal cells for absorption. Thus digestive enzymes are required to break these peptide bonds so that the individual small amino acids are absorbed into the blood stream. 15 The same peptide we saw in the previous slide can be abbreviated to a cartoon (schematic) or the 3-letter code (sequence) shown above. These two forms of representation are easier to visualize than the peptide structure shown in the top line. When the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide are written as shown in the sequence, this is referred to as the polypeptide primary structure. Thus the primary structure is simply the order in which the amino acids appear when written down. When reading textbooks, there are some terms that you have to understand the meaning of. A few of the commonly used terms to describe protein structure are described in the slide above. 1617 The alpha helix shown in (C) is an example of a secondary structure. 18 The beta sheet shown in (F) is an example of a secondary structure. 19 These 3-dimensional tertiary structures are what these proteins would look like if we looked at them under a powerful microscope. A globular tertiary structure generally refers to round sort of shape. Fibrous proteins like collagen (connective tissue) and keratin (hair) are long and thin. This makes sense as the function of collagen and keratin requires them to be elongated and not round. 20 The overall 3-dimensional (tertiary) structure is determined by bonding between the R groups of amino acids. The types of bonds include ionic (or electrostatic) interactions (top left), hydrogen bonds (top right), Van der Waals interactions (middle) and disulphide S-S bonds between cysteine at the bottom right. The number of the non-covalent bonds determines how strong the folding of the 3-dimensional structure is. If more bonds are formed, there is tighter packing and the 3-dimensional structure will be harder to disrupt (denature). Protein denaturation is thus the disruption or degradation of the 3- dimensional structure of a protein’s tertiary structure. 21 A common example of protein denaturation is when we cook egg whites. On the left, the egg whites have their tertiary structure intact. However, when we apply high heat the proteins in the egg whites have their primary, secondary and tertiary structures destroyed by the heat, and so the protein becomes denatured as shown on the right. Humans cannot heat proteins inside the gastrointestinal tract to enable digestion to take place; and so the stomach pH carries out the denaturation of dietary protein. The pH of the stomach contents is around pH 2 and this very acidic environment disrupts the ionic interactions between the protein R groups. The protein 3-dimensional structure is then broken and the protein unravels (becomes floppy and linear instead of being in a tight globular shape). The unravelling of protein exposes the peptide bonds to gastrointestinal digestive enzymes. Peptide bond hydrolysis by gastrointestinal digestive enzymes completes the protein denaturation so that amino acids are released for the amino acid absorption into the bloodstream. Question: Based on what we have explained on protein denaturation, and knowing the need for organic vitamins such as vitamin B12 in preventing megaloblastic anaemia, what is more nutritious: cooked or uncooked eggs? 22 Haemoglobin (globins in green, haem in red) is an example of a molecule whose quaternary structure is made up of 2 alpha chains and 2 beta chains. The subunit nature of haemoglobin explains the co-operativity of oxygen binding to haemoglobin that you learnt about in blood. Enzymes with allosteric activity also have multiple subunits and the co-operativity of enzymes binding to substrates is explain by the enzyme having multiple subunits. Slide 16 is visually represented by the slide above. A, B, C and D, respectively show the primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins. 23 Amino acids are used to synthesize proteins for growth, repair of tissues and to synthesize nitrogen-containing compounds. Towards the end of the lecture series we will learn how amino acids are catabolised for energy production. 24 Simply put, when there is a low protein intake, an individual develops a negative nitrogen balance and the condition is called protein energy malnutrition. In severe wasting, such as in starvation, the body energy stores (glycogen, adipose tissue and protein such as muscle) are severely depleted. Older textbooks call this condition marasmus. You should refer to it as non-oedematous protein energy malnutrition. If albumin synthesis is compromised, for example if there is concurrent hepatic (liver) disease, oedema develops. In this case, the condition is called oedematous protein energy malnutrition. Older textbooks refer to it as kwashiorkor. Essential amino acids are required for albumin synthesis and if these are deficient in the diet, and therefore regardless of whether the liver is healthy, albumin cannot be synthesised and so oedema develops. 25 The child in the picture above has oedematous protein energy malnutrition. The pedal oedema occurs because albumin synthesis is decreased. Skin has got lots of connective tissue, and so the protein deficiency prevents adequate skin formation and so leg ulcers develop. 26272829 This slide is only for interest, because it shows the laboratory experiment that was used  to calculate biological values for proteins. It is not to be learnt. 30 What determines how “good” a protein food is? The table above is not to be memorized. The table illustrates that animal proteins are easier for the body to digest. Plant proteins are harder to digest because the protein is within a plant cell wall. Thus plants have to be cooked for the cell wall to be broken so that the digestive enzymes get exposed to the intracellular protein. This is the concept of digestibility. The biological value is what we are most concerned with. Biological value is a measure of the nitrogen balance if that food item is the only food one is eating. Note that this definition tells us nothing about the heath of an individual. All biological value tells us is about the nitrogen balance. So in the table above, someone eating maize only gets 45% of their protein requirement. Someone eating steaks only gets 75% of their protein requirement. Biological value would not give a measure of the cholesterol in the steak or the gout that is likely to develop in this individual. Ignore the net utilization column. The table also show why strict vegetarians have to mix their foods. In this case beans and lentils together would provide the amino acid requirements of an individual, whereas beans alone or lentils alone would not provide an adequate source of protein. 31 The table above is not to be memorized and I have only put it here for general knowledge. The table shows common foods and what proportion of that food contains the essential amino acids lysine, threonine, methionine and tryptophan. Briefly, the required amounts of each indispensable amino acid have been worked out, and the amount of each essential amino acid in protein can be measured and compared with the required amount. Animal foods such as meat, eggs, milk have enough of all essential amino acids as the score equals 100%. Legumes often lack mrthionine and we can see that soya beans, have JUST enough. Cereals most common in SA have enough threonine and methionine but not tryptophan or lysine. Other staple cereals have even less protein than maize and wheat. Both of these children have protein-energy malnutrition. Young children are supposed to be growing rapidly such that their body protein stores are built up (in Endocrinology you will learn about the importance of growth hormone). The child on the left has oedema, and the one on the right does not have oedema. The key difference between the two is that the child on the left cannot synthesise albumin. Other differences are listed in the table on the following page. 323334 We have covered what proteins are, why they are important and so let us move to how they are metabolised and handled by the body after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. The main reactions we will discuss are transamination using the hepatic aminotransferase enzymes. We briefly mention the role of alanine aminotransferase during the enzymes lectures. We will also briefly discuss deamination. You will have covered this indirectly in carbohydrates when you learnt about gluconeogenesis. Remember gluconeogenesis is the production of glucose by the liver from non carbohydrate sources. Glycerol (an alcohol), pyruvate (an alpha keto acid) and alanine (an amino acid) are the substrates commonly used in gluconeogenesis. Deamination is the removal of an amino (NH2) group from an amino acid such that a keto acid is formed. The keto acid is then used for gluconeogenesis. The amino (NH2) group is effectively ammonia (NH3), but since the liver has aqueous compartments ammonia dissolved in solution exists as ammonium ions (NH4+). So we generally call it ammonia, but since ammonia is a gas, in physiological solutions ammonia exists as ammonium ions. Ammonia/ammonium ions are toxic to the central nervous system and so the ammonia must be rapidly converted to urea to prevent toxicity. Carbamoyl phosphate production is the rate-limiting step in urea formation, and we will briefly explain how carbamoyl phosphate is produced in the liver. 35 The main stimulus for insulin production is a high plasma glucose concentration, for example after a meal. Insulin is responsible for storage of excess glucose as glycogen. That is insulin is an anabolic hormone. In contrast, cortisol is a catabolic hormone. [Metabolism = anabolism (synthetic reactions) + catabolism (breakdown reactions)]. Insulin stimulates a positive nitrogen balance whereby amino acids are taken up from the plasma for synthesis of proteins inside the liver. Cortisol stimulates a negative protein balance because cortisol is a gluconeogenic hormone. Body proteins are broken down such that glucose is formed when cortisol concentrations in the plasma are high. Body proteins are also broken down when individuals are not ingesting energy-containing foods or in disease conditions like type I diabetes mellitus whereby insulin is absent. Physiological stressors such as infections, burns and trauma all result in cortisol being released by the adrenal cortex. Body protein stores are depleted, plasma glucose concentrations increase; and the individuals with high cortisol concentrations show signs of insulin resistance (type II diabetes mellitus). 36 This diagram is important and so must be understood. Let us imagine that after a meal, a molecule of the amino acid alanine has just been taken up by a hepatocyte from the hepatic portal vein. There are many fates that this amino acid alanine can under including synthesis of proteins, conversion to a different amino acid, conversion to acetyl coA (for lipogenesis) and conversion to glucose. The first reaction that is common to all the conversions listed above would be a transamination reaction catalysed by its own aminotransferase. Each of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids has its own aminotransferase enzyme. For alanine it is alanine aminotransferase (ALT). When an amino acid has an amino group removed a keto acid and ammonia are the products of this reaction. In this case, alanine aminotransferase catalyses the conversion of alanine into pyruvate (the keto acid) and ammonia (NH3). Pyruvate may then be converted to acetyl CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase for lipogenesis or, pyruvate is converted to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase for gluconeogenesis. The ammonia produced is toxic and so hepatocytes must quickly convert this ammonia to urea. There is a urea cycle that accounts for the conversion of ammonia into urea. In the diagram above, the ammonia wont go to the urea cycle, but is instead transferred to a keto acid called alpha ketoglutarate. Thus, in our example, the enzyme alanine aminotransferase is doing two things at the same time. 1) ALT removes an amino group from alanine so that pyruvate is formed (in the diagram above pyruvate is the  keto acid) and 2) The amino group from step 1) is added to the keto acid alpha keto glutarate so that the amino acid glutamate is formed. Glutamate is labelled as L-glutamate in the diagram above. Thus the ammonia does not diffuse away as it is added to an alpha ketoglutarate molecule and so no toxicity occurs. 37 Glutamate is then metabolised by a different enzyme called glutamate dehydrogenase via a process of deamination. In this reaction an amino group is removed from glutamate and alpha ketoglutarate is regenerated. This alpha ketoglutarate has exactly the same structure as you learnt about in the Krebs cycle. During these lectures you learnt that there is a finite (small or limited) amount of alpha ketoglutarate inside cells. Thus the oxidative deamination of glutamate replenishes (restores) the alpha ketoglutarate in cells. The figure above shows that the product of the deamination reaction is ammonia. The ammonia is then detoxified in the mitochondria of hepatocytes during the urea cycle. In the urea cycle carbon dioxide (from bicarbonate (HCO3-) is combined with ammonia (or ammonium ions) to form urea. Important things to remember include the fact that alanine aminotransferase needs the vitamin pyridoxine (vitamin B6) as a coenzyme. If vitamin B6 is deficient from the diet, the enzyme alanine aminotransferase cannot work. Hepatocytes have high concentrations of the aminotransferase enzymes, which is why damage to hepatocytes causes rupturing of the hepatocytes and their contents are released into the plasma. If a clinician takes a blood sample from a patient and finds alanine aminotransferase in the blood, it is likely that there is a liver disease of some sort. We can use the same schematic for the amino acid aspartate. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) also needs vitamin B6 to carry out its transamination function. Aspartate aminotransferase converts aspartate into oxaloacetate. At the same time the amino group that is removed from aspartate is added to alpha ketoglutarate to form glutamate. Glutamate is then metabolised by glutamate dehydrogenase via deamination. As in the example of alanine, an amino group is removed from glutamate and alpha ketoglutarate is regenerated. The ammonia produced is combined with ammonia to form urea. Question: What is the biochemical significance of the “L” in L-glutamate? 38 Let us now imagine a different scenario. We have a balanced meal at 19.00, go to bed later and wake up at 11.30 the next morning because of the lockdown. Over this overnight fasting period our hepatic glycogen stores get depleted and so plasma glucose concentrations must be maintained. Fatty acids cannot be not used to make glucose. Instead skeletal muscle cells are broken down. Amino acids such as alanine are then release into the plasma after skeletal muscle proteolysis. Hepatocytes take up the plasma alanine and use alanine as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Like before, alanine is converted to pyruvate, and the pyruvate is used by the liver to make new glucose. The glucose is then released by the liver and the body cells can then take up the glucose for use in anaerobic respiration. Note that urea is only made in the liver (small amounts can be made in the kidney) but skeletal muscle cells cannot make urea. However, skeletal muscle cells have some transamination enzymes. This means that skeletal muscle cells can make non-essential amino acids by moving the amino group from one amino acid to another. The glucose-alanine cycle shown above is important for maintaining plasma glucose concentrations via proteolytic degradation of skeletal muscle. (As an interesting aside this is why athletes who take high carbohydrate meals also increase their skeletal muscle bulk. The anabolic effect of insulin occurs when insulin is secreted because the plasma glucose is high after a carbohydrate- rich meal). 39 When the lockdown is ended and you start running around the education track for exercise, lactate accumulates in your skeletal muscles (or in red blood cells after glycolysis when pyruvate is converted to lactate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase). Lactate is detoxified by the liver because skeletal muscle cells and red blood cells have a different lactate dehydrogenase isozyme. The lactate in skeletal muscle (or red blood cells) diffuses out of the cells and enters the plasma. Remember that lactate is lactic acid and so the plasma pH is decreased, which means that the lactate must be detoxified by the liver so that the plasma pH stays around pH 7.4. Hepatocytes take up the lactate molecules. Inside the liver, the lactate dehydrogenase isozyme favours the conversion of lactate into pyruvate. Pyruvate is used by the liver to make new glucose. The glucose is then released by the liver and the body cells can then take up the glucose for use in anaerobic respiration. This glucose-lactate cycle is called the Cori cycle. Thus we have seen how the liver can make glucose (gluconeogenesis) using lactate, pyruvate or amino acids. 40 Do not memorise the numbers in this figure. The only important aspects I would like to remind you are that: 1) Glycolysis is inefficient for making ATP, as you can see above only 2 net molecules of ATP result from the oxidation of glucose. 2) Gluconeogenesis is an energy-consuming pathway for making glucose. The brain can use ketones for energy, but glucose is required for the brain to function. Though lots of ATP is expended during gluconeogenesis, the glucose is required. The ATP for gluconeogenesis comes from -oxidation of fatty acids. 3) Urea formation is also an energy-consuming process. In metabolic regulation you will learn how urea synthesis is inhibited during severe starvation so that ATP is conserved by the body. 4142 Ammonia is detoxified via the urea cycle in hepatocytes. The figures above are not that important and so I would like to highlight the important concepts: 1) There are many sources of ammonia in the body, especially during digestion of proteins in the gastrointestinal tract. The ammonia produced in the gastrointestinal tract is absorbed as ammonium ions into the hepatic portal vein. Thus the liver detoxifies the nutrient-rich blood coming from the gut. If there is hepatic disease or there is hepatic portal vein hypertension, ammonia is not detoxified and central nervous system toxicity occurs. 2) The first and only reaction I would like you to remember is the conversion of ammonia in the mitochondria of hepatocytes into carbamoyl phosphate. The enzyme catalysing the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia and carbon dioxide is carbamoyl phosphate synthase I. This enzyme is different from carbamoyl phosphate synthase II, which we will cover in nucleotide metabolism. 3) I don’t expect you to remember the individual reactants of the urea cycle, but it would be nice if you can recognise the cycle when the reactants are identified in a diagram. 4) Expression (production) of urea cycle enzymes increases on high-protein diets and during the early stages of starvation. Oedematous protein energy malnutrition does not cause an increase in the urea cycle enzymes. 5) Ignore everything else in the diagrams that I haven’t mentioned in this slide. 4344 You should be familiar with the Krebs cycle shown above. I would like you to understand that some amino acids can be converted to acetyl coA. These amino acids are called ketogenic amino acids because acetyl coA is condensed to form the energy source ketones. Some amino acids ultimately end up as oxaloacetate. As you remember from carbohydrates, oxaloacetate is used for gluconeogenesis and so these amino acids are gluconeogenic amino acids. It would be nice to remember a few important examples of each, but if you don’t; that is fine. 45 Essential amino acids have to be obtained from the diet. Non essential amino acids can be made from Krebs cycle intermediates as shown in the diagram above. Again, I expect you to understand the principle of how non essential amino acids are made, but if you don’t remember the non essential amino acids, that is fine. 4647 An important aspect of amino acid anabolism is products that use amino acids as substrates such as neurotransmitters (shown above, and to be covered in more detail during autonomic and nervous system lectures), nucleotides (next series of lectures) and haem (covered in the blood series of lectures). Neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released by one nerve in a synapse and activate the other. Many of the most important neurotransmitters are amino acids or derived from amino acids. The reactions are not important to remember, but when we cover micronutrients it is important to understand the role that vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) plays in neurotransmitter synthesis. Pyridoxine is the vitamin and pyridoxal phosphate is the active co-enzyme. In case you are interested in the mechanism of ammonia intoxication during hepatic failure, NH3 enters brain combines with α-ketoglutarate to make glutamate and glutamine. Depletion of α-ketoglutarate inhibits the Krebs cycle. Accumulation of GABA (inhibitory) and glutamate (excitatory) neurotransmitters may add to erratic behaviours. This schematic diagram is a pictorial summary of the role that proteins play in the body. 4849 This slide is a reminder of the main regulatory hormones, which control protein anabolism and catabolism in the body. Depending on the body’s requirements, amino acids may thus be used for replenishment of body tissues or energy provision. 50 Of the macronutrients, proteins are the only ones that are needed in large amounts that cannot be substituted by other macronutrients. For example glucose can be made from breakdown of fat or protein, fats can be made from breakdown products of carbohydrate and protein. The most severe effects of undernutrition and starvation result from a deficiency of protein. When there is no insulin, low cellular glucose results, which stimulates muscle protein catabolism. Cortisol is produced during chronic physiological stress (trauma, infection, burns), and cortisol also stimulates muscle catabolism (and gluconeogenesis).
