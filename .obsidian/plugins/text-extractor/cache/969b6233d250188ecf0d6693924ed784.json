Biology of Human Sodium Glucose Transporters. Physiol Rev 91: 733–794, 2011; doi:10.1152/physrev.00055.2009.—There are two classes of glucose transporters involved in glucose homeo- stasis in the body, the facilitated transporters or uniporters (GLUTs) and the active transporters or symporters (SGLTs). The energy for active glucose transport is provided by the sodium gradient across the cell membrane, the Na \u0001 glucose cotransport hypothesis ﬁrst proposed in 1960 by Crane. Since the cloning of SGLT1 in 1987, there have been advances in the genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics, and structure of SGLTs. There are 12 members of the human SGLT (SLC5) gene family, including cotransporters for sugars, anions, vitamins, and short-chain fatty acids. Here we give a personal review of these advances. The SGLTs belong to a structural class of membrane proteins from unrelated gene families of antiporters and Na \u0001 and H \u0001 symporters. This class shares a common atomic architecture and a common transport mechanism. SGLTs also function as water and urea channels, glucose sensors, and coupled-water and urea transporters. We also discuss the physiology and pathophysiology of SGLTs, e.g., glucose galactose malabsorption and familial renal glycosuria, and brieﬂy report on targeting of SGLTs for new therapies for diabetes. I. INTRODUCTION Sodium-glucose transporters, also known as Na\u0001/ glucose cotransporters or symporters (SGLTs), have a historical place in the ﬁeld of membrane transport. Half a century ago it was established that glucose transport across the small intestine occurred by active transport, i.e., the sugar could be absorbed uphill against its con- centration gradient both in vivo and in vitro, and this uptake was blocked by metabolic poisons. Nonmetabo- lized glucose analogs were also actively transported, and the process was located at the brush-border membrane of the enterocytes lining the intestine. An explanation for active transport of glucose, and other molecules, was completely lacking until Bob Crane proposed the Na\u0001/ glucose cotransport hypothesis in 1960 at the Symposium on Membrane Transport and Metabolism in Prague (94). In this model, the energy for uphill glucose transport was provided by the sodium gradient across the brush-border membrane, and the sodium gradient was maintained by the Na\u0001/K\u0001 pump. The model proposed by Crane is reproduced in Figure 1. It shows the brush-border membrane of the intestinal epithelium with the digestive surface and the diffusion barrier (plasma membrane). Glucose, liberated from di- etary sucrose at the digestive surface, is transported across the plasma membrane by a sodium-glucose carrier complex. Glucose transport is driven by the inward Na\u0001 gradient maintained by the Na\u0001 pump. Strophanthidin inhibits the Na\u0001 pump causing the Na\u0001 gradient to dissi- pate and remove the driving force for uphill glucose trans- port. Phlorizin, a plant glucoside, directly inhibits cotrans- port. This simple scheme accounts for “active” transport of glucose across the intestinal brush-border membrane and the requirement for energy input from the cell. The model remains valid to this day, apart from some minor details such as the site of phlorizin inhibition (extracellu- lar) and the location of the Na\u0001/K\u0001 pump (basolateral membrane). A personal account of Crane’s road to the Na\u0001/glucose cotransport hypothesis is available (26). The cotransport hypothesis was initially not well re- ceived by physiologists, but Peter Mitchell, who was also a participant at the Prague Symposium, later generalized the concept to include both cotransport and exchange (148). He clearly recognized that coupled transport could be extended to active transport in bacteria, i.e., H\u0001/sugar cotransport. Mitchell deﬁned coupled transport as sec- ondary active transport and coined the term symport that has been retained by biochemists. Readers interested in a wider historical perspective are referred to the mono- graph by Robinson (184). In the 1960s and 1970s, the Na \u0001 cotransport hypoth- esis was vigorously tested and extended to include the “active” transport of other molecules and ions, not only in the intestine and kidney but in such organs as the brain and thyroid gland (196). The active transport of ions and molecules in plants and bacteria was also demonstrated to be due to “symport” with protons as the driving cations. As work progressed, Na\u0001 symporters in bacteria and H\u0001 symporters in mammals have been identiﬁed. The most 734 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. convincing evidence for cotransport came with technical innovations: 1) introduction of plasma membrane vesicles (“Kabackasomes,” Ref. 85). Intestinal brush-border mem- brane vesicles were then used to show Na\u0001 gradient- driven accumulation of glucose in the intravesicular space (76). 2) The use of isolated intestinal cells directly demonstrated Na\u0001-coupled glucose transport (93). These advances have been fully reviewed in this journal and elsewhere (24, 27, 75, 92, 195, 196). Our review begins in 1987 with the cloning of the intestinal Na\u0001/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) (61), and here we focus on the biology of human SGLTs in health and disease. As more transporters were cloned, it was found that SGLT1 was the ﬁrst member of a large group of proteins in the SGLT (SSS) gene family (http://pfam. sanger.ac.uk). There are 12 members of the human family (SLC5), and they include Na\u0001 cotransporters for sugars, myo-inositol, iodide, short-chain fatty acids, and choline (251). A major shock came with solving the crystal struc- ture of vSGLT (48) when we discovered that members of unrelated gene transporter families share the same basic core structure, suggesting a common mechanism (1). It has also gradually emerged that SGLTs are expressed throughout the body, indicating their importance in or- gans other than the intestine and kidney, e.g., SGLT1 is active in speciﬁc regions of the brain such as the hip- pocampus. This review will cover these advances, but it should be emphasized that this is a rather egocentric view of the SGLTs. II. 1987 BC In the quarter of a century following its publication and before cloning (BC), the Na\u0001/glucose transport hy- pothesis was extensively tested in the intestine and kid- ney using in vitro techniques and radioactive tracers (3H- and 14C-labeled sugars as well as 22Na and 24Na) and/or electrical assays. It was established that the natural sug- ars D-glucose and D-galactose, and their nonmetabolized homologs, 3-O-methyl-D-glucoside and \u0001-methyl-D-gluco- pyranoside, were all transported across the brush-border membrane in a Na\u0001-dependent, phlorizin-sensitive man- ner, but 2-deoxy-D-glucose and fructose were not. Trans- port was associated with a depolarization of the mem- brane potential, and the rate of transport was voltage dependent. Na\u0001 was required in the extracellular solu- tions to drive uphill transport, but Na\u0001 could be mimicked by H \u0001 and Li\u0001 and not K\u0001,Rb\u0001,Cs\u0001, or choline\u0001.In terms of sugar selectivity, it was established that hexoses with equatorial -OH groups at carbons 2 and 3 were transported, but 2-deoxy-D-glucose, 3-deoxy-D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-xylose were not. Several glucosides and \u0002-glucopyranosides were also found to be transported, e.g., 3-O-methyl-D-glucoside, and \u0002-phenyl-D-glucopyrano- side but others, notably phlorizin (215), were potent com- petitive inhibitors. At least in the case of the chick intes- tine, it was demonstrated that there was a tight stoichi- ometry between 22Na and 14C sugar transport with a coupling coefﬁcient of 2. FIG. 1. The cotransport model drawn by Crane on August 24, 1960 in Prague. The redrawn ﬁgure was included in the Appendix to the presubmitted paper (23, 25). (Figure kindly provided by Bob Crane.)

A great deal of effort was directed at unraveling the kinetics of cotransport, but this resulted in conﬂicting models largely due to limitations of the methods. Exper- imental limitations included the following: 1) ﬂux mea- surements are prone to error at low speciﬁc activities of the tracers; 2) difﬁculty of measuring initial rates of trans- port under well-deﬁned cis- and trans-conditions; 3) un- controlled membrane potential; 4) presence of other transport systems (diffusion, uniport); and 5) possibility of multiple transporters in natural membranes. Even un- der the best of circumstances, e.g., voltage-clamped mem- brane vesicles or isolated cells, it was difﬁcult to counter all these limitations. Probably the most succinct discussion of the kinetics of intestinal Na\u0001/glucose cotransport was provided by Stan Schultz in 1985 (195). His model, Figure 2, was a rapid equilibrium, ordered, six-state scheme where one external Na\u0001 binds ﬁrst to produce a conformational change permitting sugar binding and then Na\u0001/glucose cotransport. The empty carrier was modeled as a nega- tively charged protein (z \u0002\u00031) that was sensitive to membrane potential. Although this simple equilibrium model requires eight independent parameters that are difﬁcult to estimate, the general predictions were consis- tent with the experimental data, e.g., maximum transport is independent of external Na\u0001 concentration, and the apparent Km for sugar is Na\u0001 dependent and voltage sensitive. While it was clear that the transporter is revers- ible, little was known about the kinetics of efﬂux due to the inherent experimental hurdles at the time. Further progress was hindered by the difﬁculty in teasing out the kinetics of the partial reactions. The SGLT1 protein was not deﬁnitively identiﬁed until 20 years after the cotransport hypothesis was pro- posed. This was ﬁnally accomplished by the Semenza and Wright labs through the use of azido-phlorizin-photoafﬁn- ity labeling, antibodies, and group speciﬁc reagents (79, 169, 192). We demonstrated that the lysine reagents phe- nyl-isothiocyanate (PITC) and ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled the protein in the absence of Na\u0001 and D-glucose. Speciﬁc labeling of the transporter was then achieved by pretreating the membranes with PITC in the presence of Na\u0001 and glucose, washing, and then labeling with FITC in the presence or absence of Na\u0001 and glucose. The ﬂuorescently labeled protein was then identiﬁed as a 73-kDa band on SDS-PAGE. Na\u0001 speciﬁcally quenched the ﬂuorescence of FITC bound to a lysine at or near the glucose binding site, and this was interpreted as a con- formation change that permitted sugar binding (169). During this period evidence emerged that there are at least two different Na\u0001/glucose transporters. First, mi- croperfusion studies in the kidney revealed that the early proximal tubule absorbed glucose with a Km (2 mM) higher than in the late proximal tubule (0.5 mM) (5). Second, it was found that brush-border membrane vesi- cles prepared from the renal outer cortex and outer me- dulla have low- (Km 6 mM) and high-afﬁnity (Km 0.3 mM) transporters (223, 224). The low-afﬁnity SGLT transporter had an apparent coupling stoichiometry of 1 Na:1 sugar, whereas for the high-afﬁnity transporter, it was 2 Na:1 sugar. The low-afﬁnity transporter became to be known as SGLT2, and the high-afﬁnity transporter was deter- mined to be SGLT1 (245). Third, different inherited de- fects of glucose transport were found in the intestine and FIG. 2. A mechanical model for Na \u0001-cou- pled sugar transport. This is a 6-state rapid equi- librium, alternating access model, based on that proposed by Schultz (195). States 1–3 face out- ward, and states 4 – 6 face inward. The unloaded negatively charged carrier (state 1) has low af- ﬁnity for external sugar before sodium binds. After external Na \u0001 and sugar binding, the ter- tiary Na \u0001/sugar/carrier undergoes a conforma- tional change to present the Na \u0001 and sugar bind- ing sites to the cytoplasm where the ligands are released, either Na \u0001 or glucose ﬁrst. The un- loaded carrier (state 6) then undergoes a further conformation change to reexpose the binding sites to the external surface of the membrane. The voltage dependence of Na \u0001/sugar cotrans- port could arise from the electrodiffusion of Na \u0001 in and out of the binding site at each side of the membrane, and/or the translocation (reori- entation) of the charged form of the carrier from one surface to the other. 736 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. kidney, i.e., intestinal glucose galactose malabsorption (GGM) was not associated with a major defect in renal glucose reabsorption (193), while congenital defects in renal reabsorption (familial renal glucosuria, FRG) were not accompanied by defects in intestinal absorption (244, 250). III. EXPRESSION CLONING The mid-1980s brought astonishing progress in the cloning of membrane proteins as exempliﬁed by the suc- cesses with the facilitated glucose transporter GLUT1 (150) and the red cell Cl/HCO3 exchanger (97). These clones were isolated from cDNA libraries by screening with antibodies and/or synthetic oligonucleotide probes based on partial amino acid sequences. We were deter- mined to clone SGLT1 and initiated a program to purify and sequence FITC-labeled SGLT from rabbit brush bor- ders (Brian Peerce), recruit a postdoctoral fellow with experience in DNA sequencing (Matthias Hediger), and an undergraduate student (Tyson Ikeda) to develop a heter- ologous expression system to study the functional prop- erties of clones. Michael Coady, a new graduate student, also joined the team. Cameron Gunderson, who had just returned to UCLA from a postdoctoral position at Univer- sity College in London, advised us to use Xenopus laevis oocytes as an expression system. Soon thereafter we established that native oocytes did not exhibit an endog- enous sodium glucose cotransporter as determined by uptakes of \u0001-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (\u0001MDG) in the presence and absence of Na\u0001. However, injection of in- testinal poly(A)\u0001 RNA into the oocytes increased the rate of Na\u0001-dependent \u0001MDG uptake by an order of magni- tude compared with H2O-injected control oocytes. This established that oocytes were a good system to study the function of cloned SGLTs. Unfortunately, our attempt to purify and sequence SGLT1 peptides failed, so by necessity we used transport assays in oocytes to screen intestinal cDNA libraries. To simplify the task, Matthias Hediger used preparative gel electrophoresis to fractionate mRNA, and he isolated an enriched fraction (2.0 –2.6 kb) containing the mRNA cod- ing for SGLT1 (62). cDNA was synthesized from this fraction, and a plasmid library was constructed in the Bluescript expression vector. Synthetic RNA was pre- pared from cDNA from pools of clones, and this was used to screen for transport activity in the oocyte expression assay. One pool of clones gave a positive signal, and this group was further subdivided until a single clone was isolated: pMJC424, selected by Mike Coady on 4/24/1987, increased Na\u0001-dependent \u0001MDG uptake by more than 1,000-fold (61). Soon thereafter, human SGLT1 was cloned (64). A. The Intestinal Brush-Border Transporter Is SGLT1 the intestinal brush-border transporter? This question was resolved by comparing and contrasting the properties of the cloned transporter expressed in oocytes with the Na\u0001/glucose cotransporter in the intes- tinal brush-border membranes (82). The ion speciﬁcity, sugar speciﬁcity, and sodium activation plots were simi- lar: neither choline, nor K\u0001, nor Li \u0001 could efﬁciently replace Na\u0001 in driving sugar transport; sugar transport hadaNa\u0001 Hill coefﬁcient of close to 2; and other hexoses inhibited \u0001MDG transport while mannitol and L-glucose did not. Furthermore, the properties of the cloned rabbit and human transporters were similar when expressed in mammalian cell lines (COS7), insect cells (Sf9 cells), or bacteria (10, 176, 202, 228). The apparent \u0001MDG afﬁnity (K0.5) was 0.1– 0.5 mM in oocytes, CO7 cells, and Esche- richia coli. The kinetics for \u0001MDG transport across in- testinal brush-border membranes is more complex: appar- ently with high- and low-afﬁnity systems in brush-border membrane vesicles (K0.5 values of 0.04 and 0.6 mM, Ref. 82); and an unexplained discrepancy between these ap- parent afﬁnities and those measured in vivo, 10 –30 mM for glucose, galactose, and \u0001MDG in rats (31). This dis- crepancy also holds for the apparent inhibitor constant for phlorizin, 0.2 \u0003M for rat SGLT1 in oocytes to 100 \u0003M in vivo (6, 163). The cloned SGLT1 expressed in oocytes is electro- genic (11, 226). Figure 3A shows that 10 mM \u0001MDG depolarized the membrane potential by 70 mV (from \u000335 to \u000135 mV), and under voltage clamp (\u000350 mV), the sugar FIG. 3. Electrical properties of hSGLT1 expressed in oocytes. The oocyte was bathed in 100 mM NaCl buffer (in mM: 100 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5) at 20°C. A: depolarization of the mem- brane potential after addition of 10 mM \u0001MDG. B: inward current produced by 10 mM \u0001MDG when the same oocyte was voltage-clamped at \u000350 mV. (From D. D. F. Loo and E. M. Wright, unpublished data.)

Neither membrane depolarization nor inward currents are ob- served in the absence of Na\u0001 in SGLT1 expressing oocytes or in control oocytes. The electrophysiological properties of SGLT1 can be then used to explore sugar and ion speciﬁcity. Figure 4A shows an experiment with hSGLT1 (37). The addition of 1 mM \u0001MDG rapidly produced an inward current of 800 nA, and this was reversed by washing out the sugar in a Na \u0001-free buffer (choline Cl). Restoring the external Na\u0001 buffer brought the current back to the start- ing level. No inward sugar-induced currents were ob- served in the absence of Na\u0001 (choline Cl), i.e., the sugar- induced currents are inward Na\u0001 currents. The addition of the \u0002-glucoside indican (2 mM) also produced a revers- ible inward current, but the \u0002-glucoside esculin (10 mM) did not. Phlorizin alone (100 \u0003M) did not induce an in- ward current but rather inhibits a small inward current, and this suggests that SGLT1 transports a modest amount of Na\u0001 in the absence of sugar (226). There was no effect of phlorizin in control oocytes or in hSGLT1 oocytes in the absence of Na\u0001. The ﬁnal part of this experiment shows the second trial with \u0001MDG pro- duced an inward current similar to the ﬁrst and that esculin partially inhibits the \u0001MDG current. This simple experiment suggests that indican is a substrate for hSGLT1, while esculin is not but instead behaves as an inhibitor (37). An advantage of the electrical assays for SGLT1 sugar transport kinetics is that radioactive substrates are not required. This is illustrated for two sugars in Figure 4B, where we measured the kinetics of both \u0001MDG and 3-ﬂuoro-3-deoxy-D-glucose at an external NaCl concentra- tion of 100 mM and a membrane potential of \u000350 mV (38). Both sugars have close to the same maximum velocity (maximum sugar currents of 860 and 775 nA) but different apparent afﬁnities (K0.5 values of 0.5 and 9 mM). The \u0001MDG K0.5 is similar to that obtained with radioactive tracer uptakes. A further advantage of the electrophysio- logical assays is that it is possible to obtain a complete data set on a single oocyte for the kinetics of sugar transport as a function of the membrane potential and the external sodium, sugar, and inhibitor concentrations (pre- sented below). Clearly, the magnitude of the maximum currents depends on the level of SGLT expression that varies from cell to cell. Taken together with studies of glucose-galactose ma- labsorption (see sect. XIVD), these data show that the clone isolated from the small intestine is in fact the brush- border SGLT1. B. Stoichiometry of Na\u0001 to Glucose Transport The ability of SGLTs to accumulate sugar is critically dependent on the stoichiometry of the Na\u0001 and sugar FIG.4. A:Na\u0001 current was measured in a single hSGLT1 injected oocyte in the presence of different glycosides (37). The membrane potential was clamped at \u000350 mV. The horizontal line indicated the baseline current in Na \u0001 medium in the absence of substrate. The addition of 1 mM \u0001MDG and 2 mM indican induced inward currents, 100 mM Pz reduced the baseline current, and 10 mM Esculin did not produce a current but inhibited the \u0001MDG current by 30%. After the addition of each sugar, the oocyte was washed out in Na \u0001-free medium (black box) followed by Na \u0001 medium (blank box). B: kinetics of \u0001MDG and 3F3DOglc in a single oocyte expressing hSGLT1 by measuring sugar-induced currents as a function of sugar concentration (38). Kinetic constants (means \u0004 SE), K0.5, and Imax were obtained by ﬁtting the sugar-dependent currents for each sugar concentration to the equation, I \u0002 Imax \u0005 [S]/ (K0.5 \u0001 [S]). The apparent afﬁnities for each sugar in each SGLT are summarized in Table 2. 738 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. ﬂuxes, i.e., [S]i/[S]o \u0002 ([Na\u0001]o/[Na\u0001]i)n exp(VF/RT)n, where [S] and [Na\u0001] are the intracellular (i) and extracel- lular (o) sugar and Na\u0001 concentrations, respectively; V is the membrane potential, F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and n is the coupling coefﬁcient. This relationship gives the theoretical equilibrium intracellular sugar concentration for a given Na\u0001 electrochemical potential gradient, and it assumes that there is no sugar metabolism and no other route of sugar transport into or out of the cell. Thus, for the same Na\u0001 electrochemical potential gradient, e.g., V \u0002\u000336 mV and [Na \u0001]o/[Na\u0001]i \u0002 5, increasing the stoi- chiometry from 1 to 2 increases the theoretical sugar concentration ratio by 20-fold (see Ref. 92). An experi- mental problem in establishing the stoichiometry using thermodynamics has been the uncertainly in determining the membrane potential, the internal Na\u0001 and sugar con- centrations, and sugar metabolism. This has been over- come by measuring reversal potentials with deﬁned ion and nonmetabolized sugar concentrations on each side of the membrane (17, 81). We determined stoichiometry by simultaneously measuring currents and radioactive tracer ﬂuxes into sin- gle oocytes expressing rabbit SGLT1 (139). The experi- mental protocol is illustrated in Figure 5A, where the baseline current of an oocyte is recorded in the absence of sugar and radioactive tracers. The current was then recorded continuously while superfusing the oocyte with 200 \u0003M \u0001MDG and 10 mM 22NaCl for 10 min. The inte- grated sugar-induced currents (charge expressed in moles) are plotted against the 22Na uptakes in Figure 5B and give a slope of 1.0 \u0004 0.1, i.e., the sugar-induced current through SGLT1 is exclusively a Na\u0001 current. Sim- ilar experiments were carried out to measure 50 –500 \u0003M [ 14C]\u0001MDG uptakes, and Figure 5C shows that plotting charge versus sugar uptakes has a slope of 1.6 \u0004 0.3. With a higher Na\u0001 concentration (100 mM NaCl at \u0003110 mV), the Na\u0001 to \u0001MDG coupling ratio is 1.9 \u0004 0.1. These results are in close agreement with reversal potential measure- ments on hSGLT1 (17, 81) and the radioactive tracer experiments on chick intestinal cells (93). The stoichiom- etry for pig SGLT3 is also 2/1 (34). C. Reversible Transport Two major approaches have been used to study re- verse transport: the ﬁrst was to express rabbit SGLT1 in oocytes and employ isolated patch-clamp techniques to measure the kinetics of Na\u0001/glucose outward currents (47, 191), and the second was to express hSGLT in bac- teria, prepare right-side-out and inside-out membrane ves- icles, and measure the transport kinetics of sugar uptake using radioactive tracer techniques (176). The patch-clamp approach is illustrated in Figure 6A. Currents were recorded from an isolated patch of oocyte plasma membrane expressing SGLT1. The pipette solu- tion contained a buffer with 10 mM NaCl and no sugar (the extracellular solution) while the bath (intracellular solution) contained 0 –500 mM NaCl and 0 –500 mM sugar. The sugar-dependent currents across the membrane were recorded at voltages between \u0003150 and \u000150 mV (intra- cellular side with respect to the extracellular side). In this particular experiment, the current was recorded with an FIG. 5. Stoichiometry of Na \u0001/glucose cotransport. A: sugar-dependent current (with membrane potential clamped at \u000370 mV) was continuously monitored in an oocyte expressing rabbit SGLT1 (139). Baseline current was stable in 10 mM Na\u0001 before superfusing 10 mM \u0001MDG together with 10 mM 22Na for 10 min (shown by the solid bar) before washing out with 10 mM Na \u0001 (without tracer). The sugar-dependent inward charge (Q\u0001MG), i.e., integral of the sugar-induced current over 10 min, was \u00031.4 \u0005 10\u00034 Coulombs, equivalent to 1,425 pmol of monovalent charge. 22Na accumulation in this oocyte was 1,398 pmol (having subtracted the mean basal 22Na accumulation over 10 min in control oocytes), yielding a charge-to- 22Na ratio of 1:1. B: charge/ 22Na stoichiometry for rSGLT1. Sugar-dependent charge (Q \u0001MG) and 22Na accumulation over 10 min at 10 mM Na \u0001 were simultaneously determined at \u000370 mV in 19 oocytes expressing rSGLT1. The charge/ 22Na stoichiometry was 1.0 \u0004 0.1 (SE). C:Na \u0001/\u0001MDG stoichiometry for rSGLT1. Q \u0001MG was compared with the accumulation of 50 –500 \u0003M[ 14C]\u0001MDG over 1–10 min, at \u000370 mV. The mean Na \u0001/\u0001MDG coupling coefﬁcient was 1.6 \u0004 0.3 at \u000370 mV.

The addition of 100 mM \u0001MDG to the intracellular solution produced an outward current (intra- cellular to extracellular current) of 20 pA that reversed on washing out the sugar. Figure 6B shows the outward currents produced by 10 –500 mM \u0001MDG, and Figure 6C is the plot of the sugar-induced current against the internal sugar concentration which yields a K0.5 of 37 mM. As judged by the currents produced by different sugars at 100 mM, the relative sugar afﬁnities for reverse transport is \u0001MDG \u0006 D-galactose \u0006 3-O-methyl-D-glucoside \u0006 D-glu- cose. This is quite different from the sugar selectivity for inward transport, \u0001MDG \u0007 D-galactose \u0007 D-glucose \u0006\u0006 3-O-methyl-D-glucoside. Phlorizin is also a poor inhibitor from the cytosolic side of the membrane with a Ki esti- mated to be \u00061 mM compared with \b1 \u0003M at the extra- cellular surface. The kinetics of forward and reverse sugar transport by human SGLT1 was also studied by monitoring radio- active \u0001MDG uptake into right-side-out and inside-out membrane vesicles from bacteria expressing hSGLT1 (176). In both cases, incubation buffer contained 100 mM NaCl and the intravesicular buffer contained 100 mM K-phosphate. The \u0001MDG K0.5 for transport in the forward direction (extracellular to intracellular) was 0.15 mM (identical to that for SGLT expressed in oocytes, COS7, and Sf9 cells), while that for \u0001MDG transport in the reverse direction (intracellular to extracellular) was 56 mM. \u0001MDG transport in the forward direction was Na\u0001 dependent, phlorizin sensitive (Ki 2 \u0003M), and inhibited by FIG. 6. Outward Na\u0001/sugar cotransport by rabbit SGLT1 in an excised inside-out patch of oocyte membrane (47). A: membrane potential was clamped at 0 mV, at the time shown by the bar, and 100 mM \u0001MDG was added to the external superfusing solution (internal surface of SGLT1). Sugar induced an upward deﬂection of the current trace, signifying an outward current (20 nA). Pipette (or external) solution contained the following (in mM): 10 NaCl, 90 choline Cl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgC12, and 10 HEPES, pH 7. 5. Bath (or internal) solution contained the following (in mM): 500 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. B: dependence of the outward current on internal [\u0001MDG] (47). Current records in the same patch (expressing rabbit SGLT1) as various concentrations of \u0001MDG were added to the bath solution. Pipette and bath solutions contained 10 and 500 mM Na\u0001 at0mV(Vm). C: relationship between the \u0001MDG-induced outward current and [\u0001MDG]i, from the experiment of Fig. 6B. The data followed a hyperbolic relation with a K0.5 for \u0001MDG of 37 \u0004 5 (SE) mM. Population average was 32 \u0004 8mM(n \u0002 5). 740 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. 10 mM D-glucose, \u0001MDG, and D-galactose, but not 2-de- oxy-D-glucose, i.e., has the same sugar and phlorizin se- lectivity as uptakes into eukaryotes expressing hSGLT1. On the other hand, transport in the reverse direction was reduced by 100 mM sugar in the order \u0001MDG \u0006 D-galac- tose, 3-O-methyl-D-glucoside \u0006 D-glucose, and there was a poor afﬁnity for phlorizin, i.e., similar to that observed with reverse transport in the patch-clamp experiments (see above). These patch-clamp and vesicle studies show that transport through SGLT1 is indeed reversible, but the kinetics and sugar selectivity are asymmetrical. The im- plication is that there are slight differences in the sub- strate binding site depending on the direction of trans- port. In summary, this preliminary characterization of the hSGLT1 clones, and those from rabbit (228), rat (164), mouse (33), and sheep SGLT1 (M. Bing, D. D. F. Loo, B. A. Hirayama, S. P. Shirazi-Beechey, and E. M. Wright, unpublished data), is quite consistent with all that was known about intestinal brush-border Na\u0001/ glucose transporter prior to cloning in 1987. IV. GENES A. Chromosomal Location The chromosomal location of hSGLT1 was ﬁrst as- signed to the q11.2 qter region of chromosome 22 using Southern blots of genomic DNA from a panel of hamster- human somatic cell hybrids (60). This was further reﬁned to the proximal half of band q13.1 by ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with metaphase chromosomes from normal subjects and patients with translocations of chro- mosome 22, e.g., chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (219). hSGLT2 was assigned to chromosome 16 close to the centromere (240). The human genome project ulti- mately led to the gene mapping of all six SGLTs (Fig. 7) beginning with SGLT1 on chromosome 22 (39): SGLT2 16p12-p11; SGLT3 21q22.12; SGLT4 1p32; SGLT5 17p11.2, and SGLT6 16p12.1 (251). B. Gene Mapping The entire SGLT1 gene was initially mapped by clon- ing the gene from cosmid and \u0004 phage clones, restriction mapping, and sequencing the exon/intron boundaries (220). This single-copy gene is large with 15 exons span- ning 72 kb (Fig. 7). Transcription is under the control of a TATA box 27 bp upstream of the start codon, and the minimal promoter, as judged by luciferase reporter assays in Caco-2 cells (143), is encoded in nucleotides \u0003235/\u000122. This minimal promoter contains three cis-elements, a HNF-1, and two GC boxes, which are critical for basal expression and a novel 16-bp element that bind members of the Sp1 family of proteins that enhance basal expres- sion. At least in sheep, HNF-1 (the HNF-1\u0001 isoform) ap- pears to be involved in the increase of intestinal SGLT1 gene expression in response to dietary glucose (229). Interestingly HNF-1\u0001\u0003/\u0003 mice do not show any defect in intestinal glucose absorption, but instead show a renal defect in glucose reabsorption caused by a reduction in SGLT2 expression (172). The organization of all 6 SGLT genes is quite similar, in having 15 exons, although they span from 8 to 72 kb (Fig. 7), but in other members of the SLC5 gene family the coding sequences are found in 14 (NIS), 8 (CHT), or only 1 exon(s) (SMIT1) (251). In SGLT 4 – 6 there are some indications of alternative splicing, and this may account for the difﬁculty in expressing these clones in heterolo- gous expression systems. C. Human Gene Family (SLC5) The SGLT family grew larger with the identiﬁcation of the renal Na\u0001/glucose (SGLT2) (240), the renal Na\u0001/ myo-inositol (SMIT1) (104), the thyroid Na\u0001/iodide (NIS) (29), and Na\u0001/multivitamin (SMVT) (174). In humans, this is the SLC5 family (Fig. 8) (253). All members of the SLC5 family code for 60- to 80-kDa proteins containing 580 –718 amino acids. It is noteworthy that human SGLT3 is not a transporter but a glucosensor (35), and this underscores the importance of functional studies. When human SGLT1 was ﬁrst cloned, we found that it was homologous to the E. coli Na \u0001/proline transporter PutP with a 28% amino acid identity (64). This family of genes, now known as the sodium solute symporter family (SSS or SSF), contains hundreds of proteins of pro- and eukaryotic origins with a common architecture. The SSF human genes belong to one of 14 members of the Pfam family clan APC (Cl0062) (PF00474 http://pfam.sanger. ac.uk). The SSF structural domain proteins share the con- sensus sequence [GS]-2(2)-[LIY]-x(3)-[LIVMFYWSTAG](7)- x(3)-[LIY]-[STAV]-x(2)-G-G-[LMF]-x-[SAP]. There is also a common motif for the six SGLTs and SMIT1s [RxTxxxx- FLAGxxxxWWxxGAS] located on the intracellular loop be- tween transmembrane helices (TM) 1 and 2 (Fig. 1 in Ref. 249). Other families in the APC clan include amino acid and bicarbonate cotransporters and exchangers. Readers should be aware that there is another classiﬁcation system for membrane transporters where the SGLTs are included in the electrochemical potential-driven transporters as subclass 2.A.21 (http://www.tcdb.org/tcdb). These two websites, along with those at the United States National Library of Medicine (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and GeneCards (http://www.genecards.org ), provide a rich source of infor- mation about the SGLTs. BIOLOGY OF HUMAN SODIUM GLUCOSE TRANSPORTERS 741 Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. While we are fairly conﬁdent that all members of the human SGLT (SLC5) gene family have been identi- ﬁed, we recognize that other Na\u0001-dependent sugar transporters may still be hiding in the human genome. One such novel transporter, NaGLT1, has been cloned from a rat kidney cDNA library (78). A human homolog has been identiﬁed, KIAA1919, and located on chromo- some 6, 6q22. NaGLT1 is a 484-residue protein with \b22% amino acid identity with SGLT and GLUT trans- porters. The gene is mainly expressed in the proximal tubule at a higher level than SGLT1 and SGLT2. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the protein in- creased Na\u0001-dependent \u0001MDG uptake fourfold, and this was blocked by phlorizin. Neither D-galactose nor D-mannose was transported by this low-afﬁnity trans- porter. In HEK293 cells, NaGLT1 also behaved as a Na\u0001-dependent, phlorizin-sensitive, D-fructose trans- porter (77). D. Functional Characterization Table 1 summarizes the functional properties and tissue distribution of the six human SGLTs. As discussed above, SGLT1 transports the natural sugars glucose and galactose with similar kinetics (K0.5 and Vmax), and this FIG. 7. The organization of human SGLT1– 6 genes. All SGLT coding se- quences are found in 15 exons. (From E. Turk and E. M. Wright, unpublished data.) 742 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. protein is found abundantly in the brush-border mem- brane of the small intestine. Relatively little is known about the functional properties of the kidney SGLT2 as it is very poorly expressed in heterologous expression sys- tems, but it is a glucose transporter that has poor afﬁnity for galactose (81, 86, 214). SGLT2 has become a major drug target for regulating blood glucose levels in diabetes (see sect. XIVJ). SGLT3 is not a transporter in some species, e.g., in humans SGLT3 is a glucosensor expressed in the enteric nervous system and muscle (35). The sensor does not recognize galactose, but it has a very high afﬁnity for imino sugars (235). There is one report on SGLT4 (214) showing that it is a low-afﬁnity glucose transporter with unusual sugar selectivity, i.e., it transports D-man- nose but not galactose or 3-O-methyl-D-glucoside. The function of SGLT5 has only been reported in abstract form (113). When expressed in HEK293 cells it exhibits Na\u0001-dependent, phlorizin-sensitive transport of \u0001MDG and galactose. This gene is exclusively expressed in the renal cortex. SGLT6 (SMIT2) has the lowest amino acid identity with SGLT1 (50%), and its preferred substrate is not glucose but D-chiro-inositol (118). D-Glucose inhibits with a Ki of 6 mM. Rabbit SGLT6 transports glucose with a K0.5 of 35 mM (21). V. EXPRESSION A. mRNA Analysis of gene expression in human tissues has been carried out using Northern blots, real-time PCR, and RNAase protection assays on commercial mRNA samples, from a very limited pool of Caucasian individuals with unknown medical histories. A comprehensive study of SLC gene expression, including SGLT1, -2, -3, -5, and -6, using these samples has been published (151). Others have determined expression as the genes were cloned, e.g., SGLT4 with reference to SGLT1 and -2 (214). In the PCR experiments, SGLT1 was most abundant in the small intestine, and signiﬁcant levels were also found in tra- chea, kidney, heart, and colon; SGLT2 was exclusively in kidney; SGLT3 in small intestine; SGLT4 in small intestine and kidney; SGLT5 in kidney; and SGLT6 in spinal cord, kidney, and brain. We found similar results in our RNase protection assays. (Figure 9 shows the proﬁle of SGLT2 mRNA expression.) However, we ﬁnd SGLT2 mRNA in cerebellum and low levels in tissues such as heart, sali- vary gland, liver, and thyroid; SGLT1 mRNA in testis; SGLT3 in testis, spleen uterus, brain, kidney, and lung; SGLT4 in liver, brain, and lung; SGLT5 exclusively in FIG. 8. An unrooted phylogenic tree of the 12 human members of the SLC5 gene family. SGLT6 is also known as SMIT2 (Na \u0001/inositol cotransporter 2). SMIT, sodium myo-inositol; CHT, choline; SMVT, so- dium multivitamin; SMCT, sodium monocarboxylic acid; NIS, sodium iodide cotransporters. [Revised from Wright and Turk (253).] TABLE 1.

What remains to be determined is the cellular dis- tribution of SGLT mRNAs in the organs and tissues of the human body, e.g., by in situ hybridization methods. This has been carried out for kidney, brain, and spinal cord in animal models (86, 173, 257; Allen Institute Brain Atlas http://www.brain-map.org/; Ref. 28). Signif- icant levels of SGLT1 and SGLT2 mRNA are detected in speciﬁc regions of the pig, rabbit, rat, and mouse brain, e.g., pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, and in rat kidney SGLT2 mRNA is present in S1 segment tubules in the cortex while SGLT1 mRNA is in the outer stripe of the outer medulla. Another source of information about SGLT gene ex- pression in normal human tissues is the EST (expressed sequence tag) data bases, e.g., www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene. For example, SGLT2 expression is similar to that for mRNA (Fig. 9), but positives are also reported for testis, placenta, larynx, pancreas, placenta, and stomach. B. Proteins Antibodies have been used to map SGLT expres- sion in human cells and tissues, but so far there are no comprehensive studies, due to the lack of speciﬁc an- tibodies and the availability of tissue. Soon after clon- ing of rabbit SGLT1, a series of polyclonal antibodies were raised to different SGLT1 peptide sequences and screened for their speciﬁcity on brush-border mem- branes using Western blots (70, 209). Our criteria for acceptable antibodies were that 1) antibodies made against two different peptides are able to recognize the same single band, and 2) the antigenic peptide had to block antibody binding. Two antibodies 8792 and 8821 met these criteria in blots of rabbit brush-border mem- branes. Figure 10 shows a Western blot of mouse intesti- nal brush-border membranes with a single, broad band of 75 kDa. No other immunoreactive bands were observed in these blots. We later demonstrated that the broad band was in part due to N-linked glycosylation of the brush- border SGLT1 (71). The same antibodies recognized cloned rabbit SGLT1 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, but two bands are observed representing the core and unglycosylated protein (70). It is important to recognize that membrane pro- teins run faster than expected from their molecular weight on SDS-PAGE gels with broad bands, presum- ably due to incomplete denaturing of membrane pro- teins by SDS. It appears that the apparent molecular weight of SGLTs can vary with the degree of glycosyl- ation in that SGLT1s from different species range in size from 69 to 79 kDa (70). Finally, under different experimental conditions, multimeric SGLT1 bands may FIG. 10. Western blot of mouse intestinal brush-border mem- branes for SGLT1 using two antipeptide antibodies (no. 8792, resi- dues 402– 419; no. 8821, residues 604 – 615; Ref. 70). Both antibodies recognize the same 75-kDa protein, and the immunoreactivity was blocked with the peptides used to raise each antibody. Similar West- ern blots were obtained against hSGLT1 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes (140). [From Wright et al. (247).] FIG. 9. Expression of SGLT2 mRNA in human tissue samples. These studies were carried out by RNase protection assays on commercial samples of human mRNA. The autoradiograms were digitized, and the protected fragments of SGLT2 mRNA were digitized, counted, and ex- pressed as a percentage of that in the tissue expressing the highest abundance. mRNA extracted from the duodenum and renal cortex was included as controls.

Wright, unpublished data.) 744 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. appear on the Western blots when frozen samples are used. We have validated the use of our SGLT1 antibodies for immunolocalization studies, ﬁrst in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing wild-type rabbit SGLT1 and a mu- tant R427A rabbit SGLT1 that is not inserted into the plasma membrane (137). Confocal ﬂuorescence micros- copy showed 1) no SGLT immunoreactivity in control oocytes, 2) immunoreactivity was restricted to the plasma membrane in oocytes expressing wild-type SGLT1 (within the resolution of light microscopy), and 3) immunoreactivity only appeared just below the plasma membrane in oocytes expressing the R427 mu- tant. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy conﬁrmed that SGLT1 was not in the plasma membrane of control or oocytes expressing the mutant in contrast to the 5,000 copies/\u0003m2 in wild-type expressing oocytes. Sim- ilar results were observed with hSGLT1 (140). Second, we have demonstrated that the intensity of the 78-kDa immunoreactive band in Western blots of sheep brush- border membranes is proportional to the transport ac- tivity over two orders of magnitude (201). Such antibodies have been used to immunolocalize SGLT1 protein in the rat intestine and kidney (209), rat and pig brain (173), and rat heart and skeletal muscle (45). The studies from the Koepsell group can be used to illustrate the problems that arise when the peptide antibody recognizes additional bands on Western blots. Their antibody to residues 582– 600 of rat SGLT1 also recognized a 40-kDa protein (probably a viral receptor protein) that led to erroneous conclusions, e.g., that SGLT1 was expressed in endothelial cells in brain (4). Commercial antibodies are available for SGLT1 and other SGLTs, but these have not been carefully evalu- ated, so published results with these have to be reeval- uated. One report has appeared using a SGLT2 antibody to localize SGLT2 in wild-type and SGLT2\u0003/\u0003 mice (227). This study clearly identiﬁes SGLT2 in the brush- border membrane of early proximal tubules. As yet, the potential to map the distribution of SGLTs throughout the human body by immunolocalization has not been realized. C. PET Imaging Positron emission tomography (PET) has revolu- tionized studies of glucose uptake and metabolism in organs and tissues in the human body in health and disease using 2-[18F]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2FDG) as a tracer (see Ref. 170). 2FDG PET is a safe, noninvasive, imaging method to monitor glucose uptake and trap- ping in cells and tissues with high spatial and temporal resolution (2 mm, s). Fluorine-18 is the preferred pos- itron emitter as it decays with a conveniently short half-life (109.8 min). 2-FDG is transported into cells via GLUTs, where it is trapped after conversion to the phosphorylated sugar 2-FDG-6-phosphate. Accumula- tion of 2-FDG-6-phosphate in tissues is followed as a function of time, and a compartmental analysis is used to extract rate constants for transport and glucose phosphorylation (80). 2FDG is a poor substrate for SGLTs (Table 2), so PET studies with this tracer do not report cellular glucose uptake via SGLTs. We and others (12, 30) have developed SGLT speciﬁc PET probes to study the distribution of functional SGLTs in the human body. Our ﬁrst generation tracer is \u0001-methyl- 4-deoxy-4-[18F]ﬂuoro-D-glucopyransoside (Me4FDG). This was designed based on functional studies of sugar selec- tivity: 1) \u0001MDG is a substrate for SGLTs and not GLUTs (92, 252); 2) \u0001MDG is not phosphorylated by hexokinase (7, 258); 3) 4FDG is a high-afﬁnity substrate for SGLT1 (Table 2) (38); and 4) Me4FDG is a high-afﬁnity substrate for SGLT1 and -2, but not GLUTs (Table 2) (81; B. A. Hirayama and E. M. Wright, unpublished data). PET scans of one adult male subject with 2FDG and Me4FDG are shown in Figure 11. 2FDG was accu- mulated in regions of the brain, excreted by the kidneys into the urinary bladder, and accumulated to a lesser degree in heart, liver, kidneys, and muscle. These ob- servations agree with the expression of GLUT1 in the blood-brain barrier, GLUT3 in brain, GLUT2 in liver and kidney, and GLUT4 in muscle. The excretion of 2FDG into the urine is also expected as 2FDG is not a sub- strate for SGLTs, and hence, it is not salvaged from the glomerular ﬁltrate. FIG. 11. The biodistributions of FDG (left) and Me-4FDG (right)on a 64-yr-old male subject (EMW). 10 mCi of each tracer were injected intravenously into the subject on separate occasions, and whole body PET scans were collected at 60 min after intravenous injections. (Note that each scan is normalized to the highest point, i.e., the two scan scales are not normalized to each other.) The scans show the lack of brain uptake of Me-4-[ 18F]FDG, compared with 2-FDG, and there is no elimi- nation of Me-4-[ 18F]FDG into the urinary bladder. (From E. M. Wright, A. Halabi, B. A.

In contrast, Me4FDG did not enter the brain, con- ﬁrming that it is not a substrate for GLUT1 in the blood-brain barrier, and did not appear in the urinary bladder, indicating that it was indeed salvaged from the glomerular ﬁltrate by SGLTs in the proximal tubule. Me4FDG was accumulated in kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, liver, prostate, uterus, and testes, suggesting that SGLT genes are functional in these tissues (Table 1). Studies are in progress to determine which SGLTs are functional in these organs and tissues, and how expres- sion is regulated. So far, in vivo and in vitro assays of SGLT activity in rat show SGLT activity in discrete regions of the brain, e.g., hippocampus and cerebral cortices (258). VI. PROKARYOTE SGLTS A few thousand SSF (SSS) genes have been identiﬁed in archea, prokaryote, and eukaryote genomes. The inter- ested reader is referred to the phylogenic tree of 41 diverse members of the gene family (253). FIG. 12.

Ever since SGLT1 was cloned, we have made ef- forts to overexpress and purify SGLT1 protein for bio- chemical and structural studies with limited success (e.g., Refs. 177, 202). Following the success of others in the overexpression, puriﬁcation, and reconstitution of bacterial symporters, we focused our attention on the structure and function of the bacterial homolog of SGLT coded by the SgLs gene of Vibrio parahaemo- lyticis, vSGLT (218). The protein is smaller than hS- GLT1, 543 versus 664 residues, but there is 32% identity and 75% similarity between the amino acid sequences. This protein has only one cysteine residue, and this facilitates cysteine-scanning accessibility measure- ments. Our strategy was ﬁrst to express the gene in E. coli and to characterize vSGLT transport activity in intact cells, membrane vesicles; puriﬁed protein recon- stituted into proteoliposomes, and solubilized protein (216, 218, 230, 254). We found that vSGLT carried out Na\u0001-dependent transport of D-galactose, but not \u0001MDG. Phlorizin inhib- ited transport but with a poor afﬁnity (Ki \u0006 1 mM). In proteoliposomes, the K0.5 for D-galactose transport was 158 \u0003M, and the Hill coefﬁcient for Na\u0001 was 1, suggesting a 1:1 coupling between Na\u0001 and galactose transport. The Na\u0001 K0.5 depended on galactose concentration; in Xeno- pus laevis oocytes, it was 17 mM at 0.06 mM galactose (116). Kinetic studies with proteopliposomes and puriﬁed protein in detergent further revealed that the system was ordered with Na\u0001 binding before sugar and that Na\u0001 binding results in a conformation change that underlies sugar binding (216, 230). In summary, the functional properties show that vSGLT has much in common with hSGLT1, but there are differences in sugar selectivity and Na\u0001-to-sugar trans- port stoichiometry (1:1 rather than the 2:1 for SGLT1). This encouraged us to purify this protein for structural studies (see below). VII. STRUCTURE A. Amino Acid Sequences The SGLT genes code for proteins with 596 – 681 residues. Alternative splicing with SGLT4 – 6 may result in the predicted amino acid content varying by up to 52 residues (253). Relative to human SGLT1, there is be- tween 50 and 70% identity and 67– 84% similarity in the FIG. 12.—Continued BIOLOGY OF HUMAN SODIUM GLUCOSE TRANSPORTERS 747 Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. sequences for SGLT2– 6. The greatest divergence in se- quence occurs at the extracellular NH2-terminal domain and the COOH-terminal third of the proteins. This also holds for members of the larger SSS family (253). Figure 12 shows an alignment of the SGLT1– 6 amino acid se- quences. B. Secondary Structure The amino acid sequence of hSGLT1 superimposed on a 14-transmembrane helix model is shown in Figure 13. Note that the 14 helices have been renumbered from TM \u00031 to 13 based on the crystal structure of LeuT structural family (1). This model was based primarily on N-glyco- slyation scanning mutagenesis analysis and computer al- gorithms, e.g., the neural network algorithm to predict membrane spans (217, 221). Additional experimental ap- proaches used by us and others included antibody recog- nition of polypeptide epitopes and labeling of cysteine mutants with “impermeant” alkylating reagents such as rhodamine maleimide and charged methanethiosulfon- ates (MTSET, MTSES). While our model is now generally accepted, there is disagreement about the location of the 90-residue hydrophilic domain between TMs 12 and 13. A succinct review of experimental evidence for the topol- ogy of the COOH-terminal domain is contained in a paper by Gagnon et al. (53). In essence, the controversy stems from studies on the accessibility of the large, very hydro- philic loop to hydrophilic reagents and antibodies in the extracellular compartment, raising the possibility of a reentrant loop between TMs 12 and 13. This was appar- ently supported by a proteomic study of trypsin digests of hSGLT1 in proteoliposomes (102), but we think that the results are ambiguous as hSGLT1 was most likely recon- stituted into the liposomes in both orientations. Results in support of the 14 TM model (Fig. 13) include experiments on vSGLT. The secondary structure model for vSGLT closely resembles that for hSGLT1 but with shorter hydrophilic loops between the transmem- brane domains (221). The NH2-terminal of vSGLT was shown to be extracellular by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) of puriﬁed vSGLT: the NH2 termi- nal retains its formylmethionine that would normally be excised in the cytoplasm (218). The crystal structure of vSGLT (48) showed that the protein has 14 transmem- brane helices and that the hydrophilic loop between TM12 and 13 remains in the cytoplasm. TM13 lies outside the core of the structure in both the native protein and that with an additional COOH-terminal TM helix (glycophorin A). In Figure 13, we have superimposed the helices in the FIG. 13. Secondary structure model of hSGLT1 (217). This model shows the sequence of the 664 residues arranged in 14 transmembrane helices with both the NH2 and COOH termini facing the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. A single N-glycosylation site occurs at Asn (N) 248. Highlighted are the locations of the helical domains based on the vSGLT structure (48). The numbering of the TMs has been revised to conform with the LeuT structural fold to allow easy comparisons between structural family members, i.e., TM1 through TM13 (1). 748 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. vSGLT crystal structure on the hSGLT1 secondary struc- ture model to highlight the agreement between the model and the crystal structure. Differences between the pre- dicted secondary structure and the crystal structure arise mainly due to assumptions in modeling of the length and angle of helical segments crossing the membrane. For example, the results of cysteine scanning studies on rab- bit SGLT1 suggesting a helical loop in the extracellular loop between TM3 and TM4 have been reinterpreted as part of TM3 in light of the vSGLT crystal structure (122). It remains to be determined why the hSGLT loop between TM12 and 13 is accessible to extracellular hydrophilic reagents. Apart from N-linked glycosylation at N248, there is little direct evidence for other secondary modiﬁcations of SGLT1. N-linked glycosylation is not required for func- tional expression (63, 71). There is no evidence for O- linked glycosylation (71). Analysis of potential secondary modiﬁcation of the SGLTs using PROSITE at PredictPro- tein (www.predictprotein.org) predicts motifs for cAMP, PKC, CK2, and Tyr phosphorylation and myristoylation sites. The importance of these has yet to be tested by direct experiment (the regulation of SGLT1 expression by kinases will be discussed below). C. Monomer Freeze-fracture studies of hSGLT1 expressed in oocyte plasma membranes and puriﬁed vSGLT reconsti- tuted in proteoliposomes clearly demonstrated that both are fully functional as monomeric proteins (46, 218). This conclusion was based on the cross-sectional area of the proteins within the plasma membrane relative to those of membrane proteins of known structure that were also analyzed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy in oocyte membranes. The dimensions of the vSGLT electron mi- croscopic images, corrected for the thickness of carbon/ platinum coating, also agreed with the dimensions of the vSGLT crystal structure. One unresolved question is the discrepancy between these electron microscopic images of hSGLT1 and the radiation inactivation analysis of trans- port in rabbit brush-border membranes, suggesting that SGLT1 is a homotetramer (205). Hermann Koepsell and colleagues (106) cloned a 67-kDa protein RS1 that was initially claimed to be a regulatory subunit, but subsequent studies demon- strated that RS1 was not in the plasma membrane but instead participated in the transcription and posttrans- lational trafﬁcking of SGLT1 and other transporters (101, 182, 232, 233). D. Protein The major advantages of using vSGLT for structure/ function studies are as follows: 1) vSGLT only contains one cysteine residue, and this is not required for full functional activity (254). Thus cysteine scanning accessi- bility measurements can be made on a cysteine-less back- ground (230). 2) vSGLT mutants expressed in bacteria do not suffer from trafﬁcking defects observed in eu- karyotes, and 3) it is straightforward to isolate vSGLT mutants from bacterial expression systems for biochem- ical studies. In 1999, Eric Turk took on the challenge to produce vSGLT protein for structural studies. Our strategy to produce and purify the transporter (vSGLT) was to construct an expression plasmid (VNH6A) by inserting the full SgLs coding region into the pBAD18 vector and appending a COOH-terminal HIS tag for metal- chelate chromatography (218). To facilitate optimization of vSGLT protein expression and puriﬁcation, we also constructed a vSGLT-green ﬂuorescence protein (GFP) fusion plasmid where a 15th TM (glycophorin) was used to locate GFP in the cytoplasm (VNGFPH6). Both con- structs were expressed in XL1Blue cells after induction with L-arabinose. Membrane vesicles were prepared by standard methods, and the protein solublization and pu- riﬁcation was followed by monitoring GFP ﬂuorescence. Both the vSGLT and vSGLT-GFP proteins were almost exclusively expressed in the bacterial plasma membrane, and each was fully active in cell and membrane vesicle transport assays (218, 254). The proteins were puriﬁed to homogeneity by metal-chelate and size exclusion chroma- tography as judged by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. ESI-MS conﬁrmed the correct mass of the proteins to within 0.01% (218). Currently, we obtain \u00065 mg of vSGLT protein from 10 liters of cultured cells. Biochemical, transport, and ﬂuorescence assays show that puriﬁed vSGLT protein is fully active when incorporated into li- posomes (48, 216, 218, 230, 231). Using similar strategies, we and others have had success in purifying hSGLT1 from E. coli and Pichia pastoris (177, 225). E. Circular Dichroism Given that vSGLT was fully functional when solubi- lized in detergent, we examined the secondary structure of the protein using ultraviolet (UV) circular dichroism (CD) (216). The fusion protein vSGLT-GFP was included as a control as the crystal structure of GFP is known (50% \u0002-strand and \b2% \u0001-helix). A large crystallographic refer- ence set of proteins was available, and three algorithms (CONTINLL, CDSSTR, and SELCON3) were used to pre- dict the helical content of membrane proteins. For exam- ple, CD measurements accurately predicted the helical content of lactose permease (85%, compared with 86% in the crystal). Our CD spectra predicted 82– 89% \u0001-helical content in vSGLT and 60% in the vSGLT-GFP fusion pro- tein. This decrease with vSGLT-GFP was anticipated given the low helical content of GFP. We further estimate BIOLOGY OF HUMAN SODIUM GLUCOSE TRANSPORTERS 749 Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. that 27–33% of the total helical content in vSGLT occurs outside the plasma membrane domain (216). Again, the CD predicted secondary structure is quite consistent with the subsequent vSGLT crystal structure. D-Galactose changed the near UV CD, 250 –300 nm, of vSGLT in the presence of Na\u0001, but not in K\u0001 (216). This, and the galactose-induced change in tryptophan ﬂuo- rescence (231), probably reﬂects conformational changes at a tryptophan residue at or near the galactose binding site. A tryptophan was found ﬂanking the Y263 involved in stacking with galactose in the sugar binding site (48). Attenuated total reﬂection Fourier transform infra- red (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was also used to examine the structure of vSGLT (112), but the results suggested that only 35% \u0001-helical content in the absence of ligands. This secondary structure proﬁle was unexpected, but it is now known that FTIR methods have a tendency to predict \u0002-sheet content in \u0001-helical membrane proteins where none exists, e.g., aquaporin 1 and lactose permease. The FTIR studies do show that there is limited extent of hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) exchange in vSGLT, 40 –50% in 2 h compared with 80% for lactose permease and GLUT1. These results are interpreted as showing that there is limited water access to vSGLT compared with that found for the H\u0001/lactose symporter. Na\u0001 and D-galactose each reduced H/D exchange in vSGLT, and this suggested that the ligands caused a compaction of the overall protein structure. F. Crystal Structure The ﬁrst structure of vSGLT was solved in collab- oration with Jeff Abramson and his team (48). The structural model was reﬁned to 2.7 Å, and all residues, apart from those in TM\u00031 and 36 disordered residues in two cytoplasmic loop regions, were assigned. Figure 14A con- tains a topology model of the crystal structure, and Figure 14B shows a side view of the model in the membrane plane. As predicted, the structure contains 14 TMs with the NH2 and COOH termini on the same side of the membrane. A single galactose molecule was found in the center of the protein, where it was occluded from both the extra- and intracellular compartments. Nota- ble features not anticipated from the amino acid se- quence and the analyses of secondary structure were as follows: 1) the inverted topology repeat (TM1-TM5 and TM6 –10) that forms the core of the structure (there is FIG. 14. The structure of vSGLT. A: topology model showing the 14 TM from the NH2 terminal (TM-1) to the COOH terminal (TM13). The blue and red trapeziums represent the inverted topology of TM1-TM5 and TM6-TM10. B: a side view of the 3-dimensional structure viewed from the membrane plane.

An overview of the galactose and Na\u0001 binding sites. The sugar is occluded from the exterior by external and internal hydrophobic gates. 750 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. no amino acid sequence homology between the repeats, but the structures can be superimposed with a RMSD of 3.9 Å); 2) the two discontinuous membrane helices, TM1 and TM6, which lie at the interface between the two inverted repeats (these two discontinuous helices are at the core of the sugar binding site); 3) the large tilts in TM3 and TM8; 4) the variation in the length of the TM helices; and 5) the presence of helical struc- tures in the extra- and intracellular loops. The total helical content of the transmembrane domains and the extracellular loops (72%) was anticipated by the CD analysis (216). The structure contains a central group of seven helices (TM1, TM2, TM3, TM6, TM7, TM8, and TM10) that are supported by a ring of other helices. Finally, the cytoplamic halves of TM1, TM2, TM5, TM7, and TM9 form a large hydrophilic cavity that extends from the inner gate of the sugar binding site (Y263) to the cytoplasm. An overview of the location of the galactose and Na\u0001 binding sites and the intra- and extracellular gates is provided in Figure 14C. A close-up view of the galactose binding site from the extracellular surface in Figure 15A shows the position of the gates, M73, Y87, F424, and Y263 that block sugar entry and exit. The outer gate residues are removed from the external view in Figure 15B to highlight the residues coordinating with galactose. Hydro- gen bonds from the residues coordinating with D-galac- tose include Q428, Q69, E88, K294, S91, and N260, and the pyranose ring is stacked against the inner gate residue Y263. The putative Na\u0001 binding site, \u000710 Å away from the sugar binding site, has coordinating residues S354, S355 (TM8), and the carbonyl oxygens of A62, I65 (TM1), and A361 (TM8) (see Fig. 16B below). The functional impor- tance of the sugar and sodium coordinating residues has been conﬁrmed by transport assays on the mutated pro- teins, Q69A, E88A, K294A, Q428A, and S365A, reconsti- tuted into proteoliposomes (48). Both the bound galactose and Na\u0001 binding sites face the cytoplasmic aqueous vestibule. Galactose is prevented from entering the vestibule by the inner gate tyrosine (Y263), and Na\u0001 is held in place by the coor- dinating residues on TM1 and TM8 (see below). There are additional helical structures in the hy- drophilic loops connecting the transmembrane helices. On the intracellular surface, a short helix (IL2) between TM2 and TM3 lies on the outer edge of the hydrophilic cavity leading to the sugar binding site, and on the extracellular surface one of two helices (EL7b) forms extensive contacts with TM1 and TM3. An additional extracellular helix (EL5) between TM5 and TM6 con- nects the two inverted repeats, and in hSGLT1, this loop contains the N-linked glycosylation site (see Fig. 13). The hydrophilic helices are predicted to play roles in the conformational changes that underlie coupling of Na\u0001 and sugar transport. vSGLT is constructed of two precisely assembled halves, so it is amazing that these assemble properly to form a fully functional transporter when they are ex- pressed in the same cell under two different promoters, the NH2-terminal half (residues 1–279) and the COOH- terminal half (residues 280 –543) (254). G. LeuT Superfamily The core structure of vSGLT (TM1-TM5 and TM6- TM10) is virtually identical to the core structure of LeuT, an unrelated transporter in the neurotransmitter sodium cotransporter gene family (NSS) (48, 256). This was soon followed by reports that two other unrelated sodium cotransporters, Mhp1 and BetP, share the same core structure (183, 241). The core structure of all four pro- FIG. 15.

Figure 16A shows that the substrate binding sites have a common location approximately half- way across the membrane. While the substrate binding sites in the four proteins share a common location, the substrate speciﬁcities are determined by different coordi- nating residues. The four proteins were found to be in slightly different conformations: LeuT and Mhp1 in an outward occluded conformation with aqueous vestibule extending from the substrate binding site to the extracellular surface; vSGLT in an inward occluded conformation with a hydrophilic vesti- bule leading from the sugar binding site to the cytoplasm; and BetP in an intermediate conformation with no aqueous vestibules leading to or from the betaine binding site (see sect. XII for further discussion). In each structure, addi- tional TM helices may be present at the NH2 or COOH termini, and these may or may not be important for function. Two putative Na \u0001 binding sites have been identiﬁed in LeuT, Na1, and Na2 (256). By homology, these two sites were also found in BetP, and one, Na2, was identiﬁed in vSGLT and Mhp1. Na1 overlaps with the substrate binding sites in LeuT and BetP, where the cation is coordinated with the carboxyl group of the substrate. In contrast, Na2 is formed by two conserved serine residues and backbone carbonyl oxygens (Fig. 16B). The presence of one or two sodium binding sites is correlated with the stoichiometry of transport. The vSGLT2 Na2 site appeared more open than that in LeuT (Fig. 16B), suggesting a different functional state. This was supported by molecular dynamic simulations: Na\u0001 was stably bound to the Na2 site in LeuT, whereas in vSGLT Na\u0001 rapidly escaped down the aqueous vestibule into the cytoplasm (117, 238). More recently it was reported that the LeuT structural motif extends to a cation-indepen- dent arginine/agmatine antiporter (AdiC) in the APC gene family (50, 54). Na1 and Na2 sites were not found in this structure, and this validates the functional signiﬁcance of the Na1 and Na2 sites in the sodium cotransporters. As yet, there is no information about the location of the second Na \u0001-binding site in mammalian hSGLT1. Although it is impossible to deduce transport mech- anism from a single structure, it is feasible to gain insight into the structural rearrangements by examining the structures of the other transporters (see sect. XII). VIII. SUGAR SELECTIVITY Since 1987 the kinetics and speciﬁcity of SGLT iso- forms have been studied using electrophysiological tech- niques on cloned rabbit, rat, mouse, or human SGLT1, SGLT2, and SGLT3 (33, 34, 37, 38, 67, 81, 86, 125, 235). Electrophysiological methods offer unique advantages: 1) they enable accurate determination of apparent afﬁnities (K0.5) from submicromolar to \u0006100 mM; 2) measurement of K0.5 and maximum rates of transport (Imax) for many different substrates on the same cell (see Fig. 4); 3) allow discrimination between substrates and competitive inhib- itors (Fig. 4); and 4) determine inhibitor kinetics in the absence of substrates from leak currents (Fig. 4) and pre-steady-state charge movements (Fig. 20) (66). A. Monosaccharides Table 2 summarizes estimates of apparent sugar af- ﬁnities (K0.5) for the cloned Na\u0001/sugar cotransporters hSGLTs 1– 4, pig SGLT3, and SMIT1–2 from dog and rat. All transport or bind D-glucose and \u0001MDG and are inhib- ited by phlorizin, but the afﬁnity of the Na\u0001/myo-inositol (SMIT) cotransporters for glucose are 1–2 orders of mag- nitude lower than hSGLT1. The most essential require- ment for substrate interaction and transport by SGLTs is FIG. 16. The LeuT structural family.

Removal of the one, two, three, or six equatorial hydroxyls reduces the apparent afﬁnity for hSGLT1 by a factor of 5 to \u0006200 (1-deoxy-, 2-deoxy-, 3-deoxy-, and 6-deoxyglucose). The O1 in hSGLT3 is of minor importance as removal reduces the apparent afﬁnity by only a factor of 2. The 4 hydroxyl is not essen- tial for hSGLT1, but replacement with ﬂuorine (4F4DOG) increases apparent afﬁnity by a factor of 10. Adding F to 2-deoxyglucose (2F2DOG) does not restore the apparent afﬁnity, whereas in the case of 3-deoxyglucose the afﬁnity is partially restored (K0.5 decreases from \u0006100 to 9 mM). The SGLT isoforms 2 and 3 are more selective at the 4 position in that they have poor afﬁnities for D-galactose relative to D-glucose. Oxygen 5, in the ring, is essential for recognition by hSGLT1, as replacement by sulfur is detri- mental, and substitution by nitrogen abolishes binding completely. In contrast, imino sugars, e.g., 1-deoxynojiri- mycin, are the preferred ligand for SGLT3 with micromo- lar afﬁnities. At positions 2 and 3, the hydroxyl must be in the equatorial position as D-mannose and D-fucose do not interact with SGLT1, -2, or -3, but mannose is accepted by SGLT4. Despite these differences in sugar afﬁnity and se- lectivity, the sugar coordinating residues are generally conserved in the SGLT family (Table in Fig. 12). One signiﬁcant exception is in SGLT3, where glutamic acid replaces glutamine at residue 457. Mutation of this residue, E457Q-SGLT3, resulted in a SGLT1-like pheno- type (9), apart from a low galactose afﬁnity (K0.5 \u0006100 mM). In contrast, mutation of 457 in SGLT1, Q457E, partially produced the SGLT3 phenotype; glucose was still transported, but the coupling between sugar and Na\u0001 transport was not tight (38).

Based on similarities to sugar binding proteins, such as the lectins, we also expected to see a hydrophobic stacking interaction with an aromatic residue (178, 211). We hypothesized that Q457 of hSGLT1 interacts with O1, O5, and O6; T460 interacts with O4; H-bonds to and from an unspeciﬁed residue with O2 and a hydrophobic stacking interaction with an aromatic side chain(38). How do these predictions compare with those found in the vSGLT crystal structure (48)? The occluded sugar binding site in the crystal is dehydrated, and the sugar is coordinated by H-bonds with polar side chains and stack- ing of the hydrophobic face of the sugar with tyrosine 263 (Table 4 and Fig. 15B). The coordinating residues are constrained by adjacent side chains to provide a precise spatial arrangement for sugar identiﬁcation. hSGLT1 has 32% amino acid identity (60% similarity) with vSGLT, enabling us to model hSGLT1 based on the vSGLT crystal coordinates. How do the sugar interactions in the threaded hSGLT1 model compare with the predic- tions based on experiment? Figure 17 shows the model of glucose binding to hSGLT1. In general, the interactions between glucose and the protein are accounted for, apart from a missing O1 interaction. Note that mutation of Q457C results in a 12-fold reduction in sugar afﬁnity and that alkylation of this cysteine blocks sugar transport (38, 129). Experiments in progress have conﬁrmed the impor- tance of all the putative sugar coordinating residues (M. Sala-Rabanal, D. D. F. Loo, B. A. Hirayama, and E. M. Wright, unpublished data). B. Glucosides It has long been known that a variety of glucosides are transported by SGLTs. Studies from this and many other groups (e.g., Refs. 2, 37, 107, 136, 149) clearly show that SGLT1s accept \u0002-aromatic and hydrophobic glucopy- ranosides, with afﬁnity and transportability (Vmax) deter- mined by the groups decorating the aglycone. For exam- ple, phenyl-\u0002-D-glucose is transported by rabbit SGLT1, but phenyl-\u0001-D-glucose is noninteracting, i.e., neither a substrate nor an inhibitor (136). Adding a para-hydroxyl or amino group to phenyl-\u0002-D-glucose improves afﬁnity, whereas a NO2 creates an inhibitor. So the sugar binding site and translocation pathway is able to accept a large substituent to the pyranose ring, if it has the right char- acteristics. In addition to glucopyranosides, glucosides such as 3-O-methyl- and 3-O-benzyl glucoside are trans- ported by hSGLT1 albeit with a lower afﬁnity than glucose (Table 5). Large glucosides (up to 20 \u0005 12 \u0005 5Å)are therefore transported through SGLT1, and this obviously requires large conformational changes in the protein. These studies also suggest that there is a series of “selectivity ﬁlters” along the sugar translocation pathway through the protein and that the characteristics of these ﬁlters can be different from those in the binding site, and also vary among members of the SGLT family. For exam- ple, in rabbit SGLT1, adding a para-hydroxyl to phenyl-\u0002- D-glucose increased both afﬁnity (3 times) and transport- TABLE 3.

Comparison to the K0.5 for glucose was then used to pro- pose the pattern and importance of hydrogen bonding involved in rec- ognition. Glucose has hydrophobic surfaces due to the axial orientation of its hydrogens in the plane of the ring. TABLE 4.

These sugar-protein bonds and interactions between side chains are summarized. We note that the crystal structure is an occluded state and may not represent the initial sugar binding site. 754 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. ability (1.5 times) (136), but in hSGLT1 there was no change in afﬁnity but transportability increased threefold. Indican (3-indolyl-\u0002-D-glucopyranoside) is a high-afﬁnity (60 \u0003M) transported substrate, but it is only transported at 14% of the maximal rate for \u0001MDG (Imax \u0001MDG) in hSGLT1. It is also a substrate (0.9 mM) in pig SGLT3, but here it is transported at 80% of Imax \u0001MDG (37). A simple modiﬁcation can change transported indolyl glucosides from sub- strates into an inhibitor. When bromine is added at the 5-position of the substrate 3-indolyl-\u0002-D-galactopyrano- side, 5Br-3-indolyl-\u0002-D-galactopyranoside becomes an in- hibitor (66). Likewise, engineering these transporters may convert substrates into inhibitors, and vice versa, e.g., a pig SGLT1/SGLT3 chimera transports phlorizin with a K0.5 of 4.5 \u0003M and a maximum transport rate comparable to that for glucose(161). C. Inhibitors The classic competitive inhibitor of SGLTs is phlo- rizin {Fig. 18A, natural dihydrochalcone glucoside (1-[2-\u0002- D-glucopyranosyloxy)-4,6-dihydroxyphenyl]-3-(4-hydroxy- phenyl)-1-propanone} (see an excellent review by Ehren- kranz et al., Ref. 44). Phlorizin is a \u0002-glucoside comprised of two aromatic rings (A and B) joined by an alkyl spacer of three carbons. As with the aglycone phloretin, it un- dergoes a keto-enol tautomerization (52, 242), with the keto-form being the higher afﬁnity conﬁguration (32, 66). The phlorizin Ki for hSGLT1 is 200 –300 nM, but the Ki varies among different isoforms, e.g., rat SGLT1 Ki \u0002 12 nM and rabbit SGLT1 Ki \u0002 760 nM (66, 69, 159, 164). hSGLT2 has an order of magnitude higher afﬁnity for phlorizin (Ki \u0002 10 –39 nM, Refs. 81, 88, 159), despite its 10-fold lower apparent afﬁnity for glucose (6 vs. 0.5 mM). The ﬂexible structure of phlorizin makes predictions about its three-dimensional structure in the binding site uncertain (Fig. 18A). First we assume that since phlorizin is a competitive inhibitor, the glucose is bound at the same site as the free glucose: this is reasonable given that the hSGLT1 Ki for phlorizin, 200 nM, is 250 times lower than that for the aglycone phloretin, 50 \u0003M (66). We propose that the B-ring is canted 30° to the plane of the sugar as for phenyl-\u0002-D-glucopyranose. Possible conﬁgu- rations of the A-ring range from that for the X-ray crystal structure, an extended conformation with the aglycone in roughly the same plane as the pyranose ring (Cambridge Structural Database code CEWWAC), to that from solu- tion NMR studies and computer conformational searches, which predict that that A-ring folds back over the B-ring (161, 242). The energetic differences between the differ- ent conformations are small, so it is not clear how real- istically computational methods can be employed to pre- dict the bound conformation. Nevertheless, analysis of the physical characteristics of the aglycones combined with their kinetics (Table 5) allowed us to create a pharmacophore model of the in- hibitor binding site, and predict interactions of the agly- cone with SGLT1 that determined binding (Fig. 18B) (66). We predicted that there is a ﬂat hydrophobic surface of at least 7 \u0005 12 Å extending from the sugar binding site with an orientation similar to the plane of the pyranose. Many of these inhibitors are relatively ﬂexible, and conforma- tional analyses predict folded solution structures. A study focused on phlorizin (242) predicted the binding structure being a folded conformation occupying a 13 \u0005 10 \u0005 17 Å volume, an arrangement similar to the structure shown by Panayotova-Heiermann (161) and Figure 19. Independent of the actual conformation, the pharmacophore predicts that there are three locations where H-bonds can be do- nated and accepted, one point where an H-bond is do- nated from the protein, and one area in which an H-bond is detrimental (66). Phlorizin can be docked into homol- ogy models of SGLT1 and -2 with glucose in the sugar binding site and the aglycone in either the enol or keto conformation (V. Chaptel and B. A. Hirayama, unpub- lished data). Given that hSGLT2 is 59% identical to hSGLT1 and is expected to share the same architecture, how, then, does one produce a speciﬁc SGLT2 inhibitor? Over the past decade, several pharmaceutical com- panies have attacked this problem experimentally by modifying the phlorizin structure to enhance selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1. Phlorizin has a greater than four- fold higher afﬁnity for hSGLT2 (Ki \u000740 nM) than hSGLT1 (\u0007200 nM) (81, 88, 159). The ﬁrst report of an effective FIG. 17. Glucose binding to hSGLT (homology model). The primary sequence of hSGLT1 was aligned on that of vSGLT, and this was then superimposed on the vSGLT crystal structure to create a “threaded” model structure of hSGLT1 with glucose replacing galactose in the binding site: O1, no interaction observed; O2 N78, H83 can donate and accept; O3, E102 can donate and accept; O4, T287, W291 can donate and accept; O5, Q457 can donate; O6, Q457 donate and accept, possible hydrophobic with T290; and hydrophobic stacking with Y290.

SGLT2 inhibitor was T-1095A, a phlorizin derivative cre- ated by research groups at Tanabe Seiyaku (156), that could be delivered orally in a pro-drug strategy. Selectiv- ity for SGLT2 was accomplished by substituting a methyl group for the meta hydroxyl of the B-ring, and creating an aromatic ﬁve-membered ring of the para-OH of the A-ring (Fig. 18A). The pro-drug was absorbed without interact- ing with the intestinal SGLT1, and the active drug had a fourfold increase in SGLT2/SGLT1 selectivity. We will present a brief synopsis of the continuing evolution of speciﬁc hSGLT2 inhibitors. A more detailed discussion of intermediate structures isavailable in phar- maceutical reviews (e.g., Refs. 83, 147, 237). Since the description of T-1095A, several groups have addressed the SGLT1/SGLT2 speciﬁcity problem. Approaches of note are Sergiﬂozin-A, Dapagliﬂozin, and 6=-O-spiro-C-aryl glu- cosides (Fig. 19), as each represents advances in the phlorizin modiﬁcation strategy. In the initial investigation of glucoside transport and binding to SGLT1, the impor- tance of the glycosidic oxygen was noted, as was the observation that a \u0002-linked hydrophobic/aromatic struc- ture could be accommodated in the binding site. This model is followed in phlorizin, T-1095A, and Sergiﬂozin-A. Sergiﬂozin-A is a \u0002-glucopyranoside in which the A-ring is joined to the B-ring by only one carbon rather than the three carbons of phlorizin and T-1095A (88). Both hy- droxyls of the B-ring and the carbonyl oxygen in the linker are absent. The para hydroxyl of the A-ring of phlorizin is replaced by a methoxy group. These changes resulted in an increase in SGLT2/SGLT1 selectivity (to 210:1) and an increase in SGLT2 afﬁnity (Ki 2–10 nM) (88, 159). Dapagliﬂozin is a further departure from the phlo- rizin plan (147) as it is a C-aryl glucopyranoside, i.e., the B-ring is directly linked to the pyranose ring in an equa- torial conﬁguration, eliminating oxygen 1. The A- and B-rings are still linked by a single carbon, but the B-ring has a chloro group para to the sugar, and the A-ring is attached in the meta position. The A-ring has a para ethoxy group. These modiﬁcations improved SGLT2: SGLT1 selectivity (1,200:1) and afﬁnity for SGLT2 (EC50 \u0002 1.1 nM). Given the speciﬁcity proﬁle of hSGLT1 (Table 5), this increase in afﬁnity in the absence of the glycosidic oxygen was initially surprising, but we note that this requirement may not hold for all SGLT isoforms (Table 2): TABLE 5.

The third example is an O-spiro modiﬁcation of dapagliﬂozin where the orientation of the B-ring is locked in position by creating a ﬁve-membered ring of the \u0001-oxygen and the B-ring of the aglycone (Fig. 19) (255). This compound showed that the presence of the substituent at the para position of the A-ring was im- portant for SGLT2 binding, and the 6=-O-spiro com- pound was preferred over the 2=-O-spiro construct, helping to more clearly deﬁne the orientation of the B-ring. However, no gain in selectivity over that of dapagliﬂozin was reported. The development of selective SGLT2 inhibitors was mostly accomplished with an increase in afﬁnity for hSGLT2 and a reduction in afﬁnity for SGLT1: the hSGLT1 Ki (or rather EC50) values for these inhibitors increased by roughly an order magnitude (Fig. 18). The pharmaceu- tical implications of the SGLT2 inhibitors are addressed in section XIVH. IX. ION SELECTIVITY SGLTs are exquisitely selective for Na\u0001 as the ener- gizing cation. Apart from H\u0001 and Li\u0001, no other monova- lent cation can replace Na\u0001 to drive glucose transport (82, 166). The cation K0.5 values were 4 mM for Na \u0001,12mM for Li\u0001, and 7 \u0003M for H \u0001 at \u0003150 mV (68, 175). The maximum velocities were similar, and Hill coefﬁcients were greater than 1. There was a kinetic penalty for substituting Na\u0001 with Li\u0001 or H\u0001 in that the apparent afﬁnity for sugar decreased by 1–2 orders of magnitude: K0.5 \u0001MDG increased from 0.15 to 4 and 20 mM. One inter- pretation of the cation selectivity data is that cation binding initiates a change of the conformation of the sugar binding site: the conformations induced by Li\u0001 and H\u0001 binding are perturbed relative to the Na\u0001-bound transporter. The agreement between the Na\u0001 to glucose transport stoichiometry (2:1) and the Na\u0001 Hill coefﬁ- cient in SGLT1 and pig SGLT3 has led to the conclusion that these proteins have two strongly interacting Na\u0001 binding sites (34, 139). On the other hand, hSGLT2 only has one Na\u0001 binding site (81). One study examined the FIG. 18. Phlorizin and a 3-dimensional pharmacophore for hSGLT1. A: chemical structure of phlorizin showing the A and B rings. B:an inhibition pharmacophore for hSGLT1 was constructed by comparing strength of inhibition of hSGLT1 function by aromatic glucosides with potentially interacting groups placed at different positions on the rings. Red spheres indicate a region where hydrogen bond donation and acceptance are favorable; the blue sphere is the location where only hydrogen bond donation is allowed, and the green sphere designates the area where hydrogen bonding is detrimental. The yellow region shows the extent of the planar surface for aromatic/hydrophobic interactions. The space was generated by overlaying seven structures that represent the diverse regions and types of interactions tested: salicin, arbutin, two conformations of 2-naphthyl galactopyranoside, 1-naphthyl galactopyranoside, rhapontin, and 5-Br-6Cl-3-indolyl-ga- lactopyranoside.

Cl\u0003 had no effect on maximal transport rate. What does the crystal structure of vSGLT tell us about the Na\u0001 binding sites? First, it should be made clear that crystallographic assignment of Na\u0001 binding sites is nontrivial, even for proteins with much higher resolution structures than are currently available for membrane transport proteins (157, 158). The problem is that Na\u0001 has a small ionic radius of 0.97 Å and the same number of electrons as water, and there are no electron-dense cat- ions that can substitute for Na\u0001. Even in the case of the highest resolution structure of a cotransporter to date (LeuT 1.65 Å, Ref. 256), the two Na\u0001 binding sites (Na1 and Na2) were assigned based on modeling density peaks as water or Na\u0001, valence calcu- lations, and consideration of coordination distances. [Sig- niﬁcantly, neither Na1 nor Na2 sites have been identiﬁed in Na\u0001-independent transporters in the LeuT structural family (50, 54).] Both LeuT Na1 and Na2 sites are near the unwound sections of TM helices and involve ﬁve or six coordinating atoms, mostly backbone carbonyls. The ma- jor difference between the two sites is that the negatively charged group of the substrate (carboxyl group of leu- cine) contributes to the coordination of Na1, while Na2 is constructed from polar/neutral groups (carboxyl oxygens from Gly-20, Val-23, and Ala-351 and hydroxyl oxygens from Thr-354 and Ser-355; see Fig. 16B). Molecular dy- namic simulations of ion selectivity of the LeuT Na1 and Na2 sites suggest, as predicted, the Na1 site is more selective for Na\u0001/K\u0001 than Na2 (5,000 vs. 400) (152). One sodium site corresponding to Na2 of LeuT has been assigned to vSGLT (Fig. 16B) (1, 48). This is \u000710 Å away from the sugar binding site with the coordinating residues from TM1 (A62, I65) and TM8 (A361, S364, S365). An equivalent site is found in the Mhp1 and BetP trans- porters, but the Na1 site is only found in LeuT and BetP. The presence of one or two sites is consistent with the 1:1 and 2:1 Na\u0001/substrate coupling ratio reported for these transporters. Experimental evidence for the importance of the Na2 site S365A in vSGLT was the abolition of transport by S365A (48), and in the homologous Na2 site in hSGLT1 the mutation S392A reduces both Na\u0001 and sugar afﬁnities (Loo, Hirayama, Sala-Rabanal, and Wright, unpublished data). Molecular dynamic simulations of mu- tations at the LeuT Na2 site predict that the mutations S355A and T354A increase the Na\u0001/K\u0001 selectivity and T354A increase the Li\u0001/Na\u0001 selectivity (Sergei Noskov, personal communication). Close inspection of the superimposed Na2 sites in core vSGLT, LeuT, and Mhp1 structures shows that TM1 and TM8 are shifted away from each other in vSGLT (1). The Na\u0001 coordinating distances are larger (3.1–3.8 Å) in vSGLT than in LeuT (2.2–2.5 Å), suggesting that in vSGLT the cation has access to the cytoplasmic aqueous vesti- bule. This is supported by molecular dynamic simulations indicating that Na\u0001 is bound tightly to the Na2 site in LeuT, but in vSGLT Na\u0001 can escape into the cytoplasmic aqueous vestibule and, after a transient interaction with D186, into the cytoplasm (117, 238). X. KINETICS The high level of expression of SGLT1 in heterolo- gous systems has led us to revisit the questions of SGLT1 kinetics using voltage-clamp methods. One signiﬁcant ad- vance has been the ability to record the kinetics as a function of membrane potential and external sugar, so- dium, and phlorizin concentrations in a single cell. In addition, it is now possible to control the composition of the intracellular compartment using either the cut-open oocyte or patch-clamp preparations (17, 47, 81, 191). An- other major advance was our introduction of fast pertur- bation techniques developed for enzymology to the ﬁeld of cotransporters. We used rapid jumps in membrane potential to record the transient capacitive SGLT currents as a function of external Na\u0001, sugar, and phlorizin (pre- steady-state kinetics)(127). The signiﬁcance is that for the ﬁrst time one can study partial reactions in the overall transport cycle. Relatively little is known about the transport kinetics of other human SGLTs: SGLT2 is expressed poorly in heterologous expression systems, where the rate of trans- port is generally orders of magnitude less than that for SGLT1 (81, 86). Human SGLT3 is not a transporter but instead a glucose sensor (35). Pig SGLT3 (originally des- ignated pig SGLT2) is a transporter with a common trans- port mechanism to hSGLT1 (34, 138). Only limited infor- mation is available for SGLT4, -5, and -6 (SMIT2) (21, 113, 118, 214). A. Steady-State Kinetics 1. Inward transport As discussed above (Figs. 3 and 4), the activity of hSGLT1 can be monitored as an inward sodium current generated by glucose, and the kinetics can be determined by recording the currents as a function of voltage and the external sugar, cations, and inhibitor concentrations (see Fig. 4B for \u0001MDG and 3FDOG in a single oocyte). The protocol that is commonly employed in oocytes express- ing hSGLT1 is illustrated in Figure 20. The cell membrane potential is voltage clamped at \u000350 mV and then rapidly stepped to voltages ranging from \u000150 to \u0003150 mV for 100 758 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. ms, ﬁrst in the absence of substrate (Fig. 20A) and then in the presence of different external cation and sugar con- centrations (Fig. 20B). Note that the practical range of test potentials, \u000150 to \u0003150 mV, is limited by the stability of the cell membrane, i.e., without artifacts from voltage- activated endogenous channels or dielectric breakdown. In the experiment illustrated in Figure 20, the exter- nal Na\u0001 concentration ([Na\u0001]o) was 100 mM, and the \u0001MDG concentration ([\u0001MDG]o) was varied between 0 and 10 mM. In both the presence and absence of sugar, the currents approached a steady-state value 95–100 ms after stepping the membrane potential (Vm) to each test value, and returned to the original holding potential with a similar time course. The difference between the steady- state currents obtained in the presence and absence of sugar at each voltage step gives the current-voltage (I-V) curve at each sugar concentration (Fig. 20C). Note that the I-V curves approach zero current at positive Vm values and saturate at hyperpolarizing voltages, i.e., transport has voltage-sensitive (between \u000150 and \u0003100 mV) and voltage-insensitive (\u0003100 to \u0003150 mV) kinetics. The substrate-coupled current (I) was empirically described by the relationship: I \u0005 Imax S [S]n ⁄{(K0.5 S )n \u0006 [S]n}(1) where [S] is the external substrate concentration (cation or sugar substrate), Imax S is the maximal substrate-induced current, K0.5 S is the half-maximal substrate concentration, and n is the so-called Hill coefﬁcient. In the experiment illustrated, the K0.5 for \u0001MDG was 0.7 mM at \u000350 mV (Hill coefﬁcient set to 1) (Fig. 20D), and the K0.5 decreased towards a minimum value of 0.2 mM at \u0003150 mV (Fig. 20E). In the same oocyte, the currents induced by \u0001MDG were also recorded as the Na\u0001 concentration was varied between 0 and 100 mM and ﬁt to Equation 1 (not shown), and the apparent K0.5 for Na\u0001 was plotted against voltage in Figure 20F. The Na\u0001 K0.5 was voltage dependent ranging from 60 mM at 0 mV to a minimum value of 0.8 mM at \u0003150 mV. The Hill coefﬁcient for Na\u0001 was 1.5 and independent of voltage. Steady-state kinetics provides insights into the or- der of substrate binding, as well as whether the sub- strates are transported sequentially or simultaneously. For example, in a strictly ordered system, if glucose is the last molecule to bind, then the maximal transport rate for sugar (Imax S , determined by maintaining [Na\u0001] FIG. 20.

We found that the Imax for sugar (\u0001MDG) at saturat- ing voltages (\u0003150 mV) was independent of the Na\u0001 concentration (Fig. 21C), whereas Imax for Na\u0001 depends on the glucose concentration (Fig. 21D). These observa- tions indicate that external Na\u0001 bind to the transporter before the external sugar (167). At saturating voltages, \u0003150 mV, the K0.5 for Na\u0001 depends on the \u0001MDG con- centration (Fig. 21B), and conversely, the K0.5 for \u0001MDG depends on the Na\u0001 concentration (Fig. 21A). This mutual dependence of the K0.5 values for Na\u0001 and glucose indi- cates that two substrates are transported simultaneously. The Hill coefﬁcients for \u0001MDG and Na\u0001 are 1 and \u00061.5, respectively, consistent with measurements of sugar and Na\u0001 stoichiometry. The binding of the two Na\u0001 to the transporter before glucose is also supported by ﬂuores- cence experiments (see Fig. 25B). Na\u0001/glucose cotransport has large temperature de- pendence, temperature coefﬁcient Q10 \u00063, or activation energy Ea \u000620 kcal/mol, i.e., much greater than for chan- nels (145, 168). There was no temperature effect on the apparent afﬁnities of rabbit SGLT1 for either Na\u0001 or glucose, but the maximum rate of transport increased with a Q10 of \u00073 (168). 2. Outward transport Outward Na\u0001/sugar currents were also measured as a function of voltage and internal Na\u0001 (0 –500 mM) and sugar (0 –500 mM) concentrations when the exter- nal solution contained 10 mM Na\u0001 and no sugar, i.e., the reverse of inward current measurements (see Fig. 6; Refs. 47, 191). In contrast to the inward Na\u0001/sugar currents, which saturated with large hyperpolarizing voltages and approach zero at large depolarizing volt- ages (Fig. 20C), the outward Na\u0001/sugar currents satu- rated at 0 mV and approached zero at \u0003150 mV. The internal K0.5 for sugar was \u000740 mM at 0 mV (with internal Na\u0001 concentration of 500 mM). The outward current decreased as the internal Na\u0001 was lowered from 500 to 0 mM with a sodium K0.5 of 45–50 mM when the data were ﬁt with a Hill coefﬁcient of 2. Model simulations indicate that if sugar is dissociated before Na\u0001, there would be sugar trans-inhibition, i.e., inhibi- FIG. 21.

Sugar trans-inhibition has also been dem- onstrated in brush-border membrane vesicles (91). B. Pre-Steady-State Kinetics Understanding the mechanism of SGLT1 has been revolutionized by our discovery of SGLT capacitive currents, or charge movements. These are the carrier counterparts of the gating currents of voltage-gated ion channels and are thought to arise from movement of charged and/or polar residues in response to changes in the membrane electric ﬁeld (11, 127–129, 166; see also Refs. 18, 59, 99, 123). The carrier-mediated capacitive transients are elicited by step jumps in membrane volt- age in the absence of glucose (Fig. 20A). These tran- sients, or pre-steady-state currents, are blocked by sat- urating concentrations of glucose and phlorizin (Figs. 20B and 22, B and C). Pre-steady-state currents are a general property of cotransporters (see Ref. 59). So far, we have been unable to detect any hSGLT2 pre-steady- state currents (81). The pre-steady-state current of hSGLT1 is illustrated in Figure 20A. In the absence of external sugar, the membrane potential was held at \u000350 mV (Vh) and then stepped to a series of test values (from \u000150 to \u0003150 mV in 20-mV dec- rements) for 100 ms (ON) before returning to Vh (OFF). In response to the voltage jump, the total current con- sisted of 1) an initial membrane bilayer capacitance transient which decays to steady state with a time constant \u0007 of 1 ms, which is insensitive to Na\u0001 and sugar concentrations. This component was also ob- served in noninjected control oocytes. Integration of this transient in control oocytes gave a capacitance of 275–340 nF, and, with the assumption of a speciﬁc membrane capacitance of 1 \u0003F/cm2, the area of the oocyte cell membrane area was 30 \u0005 106 \u0003m2 (262). 2) SGLT1 pre-steady-state currents with time constants greater than for the membrane capacitance \u0007 vary be- tween 3–20 ms, and 3) SGLT1 steady-state currents consist of the background (endogenous) currents of the cell and the Na\u0001 currents mediated by SGLT1 (leak or uniporter currents) (166, 131). During the ON and OFF pulses, the SGLT1 pre-steady-state currents were in the opposite direction, but the total charge moved (Qmax) for ON and OFF voltage jumps were identical. The SGLT1 current transients were inhibited by glucose (Fig. 20B) and phlorizin (Fig. 22, B and C) and were not observed in control cells. Increasing external \u0001MDG concentrations reduced the charge movements (Qmax) with an apparent K0.5 of 1.1 mM, and phlorizin inhibited FIG. 22. Dependence of hSGLT1 presteady cur- rents on phlorizin and glucose. A: compensated cur- rent records (at Vm \u000150, \u000310, \u000390, and \u0003130 mV) in 100 mM NaCl buffer.

Maximal charge Qmax is the difference in Q between the depolarizing and hy- perpolarizing limits. Qmax is decreased with increasing [phlorizin]. V0.5 is the midpoint of the Q-V curve and is unaffected by [phlorizin]. For this oocyte, V0.5 is \u000337 mV. D: relation between Qmax and maximal sugar transport rates Imax.

The reduction in charge by sugar was directly proportional to the increase in sugar current with a slope of 84 s\u00031 (see Fig. 22D). The pre-steady-state current of SGLT1 can be iso- lated from the total current (Itot) by two equivalent methods (18, 59, 123, 127): 1) point to point subtraction of the total currents in the presence and absence of saturating phlorizin and 2) ﬁtting the total current by the equation Itot(t) \u0005 Icm exp(\b t ⁄ \u0007cm) \u0006 Ipss exp(\b t ⁄ \u0007pss) \u0006 Iss (2) where Iss is the steady-state current, Icm exp(\u0003t/\u0007cm)is the bilayer capacitance current with initial value Icm and time constant \u0007cm, and Ipss exp(\u0003t/\u0007pss) is the SGLT1 pre-steady-state current with initial value Ipss and time constant \u0007pss. SGLT1 pre-steady-state currents were obtained from Itot(t) by subtraction of the capacitive and steady-state components [Ipss(t) \u0002 Itot(t) \u0003 Icmexp(\u0003t/\u0007cm) \u0003 Iss]. The “compensated current” records, i.e., the currents cor- rected for the bilayer membrane capacitive component and the steady-state current, are shown in Figure 22, A and B. For jumps to large depolarizing voltages, e.g., \u000150 mV, the current rose to a peak (at 1.5 ms from the onset of the voltage pulse) before decaying to the steady state (128). The implications of the rising phase of charge movement are discussed below (Fig. 25). The total charge transfer Q at each test voltage (Vm) was obtained by taking the integral of the current transients, and this was equal for the ON and OFF responses. Q shows a sigmoidal dependence on Vm (Figs. 21C and 22D), and the charge versus voltage (Q-V) curve is empirically ﬁtted by the Boltzmann relation {(Qdep \b Qhyp)⁄ Qmax \u0005 1⁄[1 \u0006 exp(z\t(Vm \b V0.5)F ⁄ RT)}] (3) where Qmax is the maximal charge transfer; Qmax \u0002 Qdep \u0003 Qhyp, with Qdep and Qhyp representing the charge mea- sured at large depolarizing and hyperpolarizing limits, respectively; and z\t is maximum steepness factor for the dependence of Q on voltage, and is the product of the apparent valence of the movable charge (z) and the frac- tional distance (\t) within the membrane electric ﬁeld in which the charge moves. V0.5 is the midpoint voltage or voltage at 50% Qmax (Fig. 22C). F is Faraday’s constant, R is the gas constant, and T is absolute temperature. For Qhyp to be the hyperpolarizing limit, we assume z \b 0. In this simple treatment the Boltzmann relation is inter- preted as a distribution of a movable charge between two states according to membrane voltage. Pre-steady-state currents depend on external [Na\u0001], suggesting that Na\u0001 can bind to the transporter in the absence of the substrate. This is illustrated in Figure 23, A–C, where [Na\u0001]o was decreased from 100 to 25 mM. Lowering the external [Na\u0001] causes a decrease of the transient currents in the depolarizing direction and an increase in the hyperpolarizing direction. Compared with 100 mM Na\u0001, the midpoint of the distribution, V0.5, shifts to more negative values. The Q-V curves at 100, 50, and 25 mM Na\u0001 were shifted to align at the depolarizing limit (Fig. 23D), and the plots show that reducing external [Na\u0001] reduces the maximal charge (the difference be- tween the hyperpolarizing and depolarizing limits) as well as shifted the midpoint voltage V0.5. For the wild-type hSGLT, it is not possible to obtain the Qmax at0mMNa\u0001 as the Q-V curve moves out of the working range of the test voltages. However, with several hSGLT1 mutants, e.g., Y290C, substantial charge movements were observed in Na \u0001-free solutions, and the complete Q-V curve fell within the \u0003150 to \u000150 mV range. This demonstrated that orientation of the Na\u0001-free protein contributed to the SGLT1 capacitive charge. Attempts to identity the origin of SGLT1 charge movement by mutation of charged residues in the mem- brane domain have not yet been successful, but this should be revisited in light of the crystal structure. Given that the Na2 binding site in vSGLT is a neutral site (see above), we have to entertain the possibility that protein dipoles contribute to the charge move- ments. The dependence of the V0.5 on Na\u0001 is shown in Figure 23E. The line was obtained by linear regression with slope 93 mV/10-fold change in [Na]o. The shift in V0.5 with [Na\u0001]o suggests that the distribution of conforma- tions of hSGLT1 in the membrane is dependent on [Na\u0001]o. The occupancy of SGLT1 proteins in the charge-generat- ing conformations is increased with increasing [Na\u0001]o (see below). Figure 23F shows the dependence of the relaxation time constant (\u0007) of the pre-steady-state currents on membrane voltage. For the ON pulse (ﬁlled symbols), in the hyperpolarizing direction, \u0007 (\u000720 ms) was relatively independent of voltage, whereas \u0007 decreased at more positive test voltage to 3 ms (at \u000150 mV). The time constant for the OFF transients (open symbols), when the membrane was stepped from the test voltage (Vm) back to Vh, was independent of the test voltage (15 ms). The time constants decreased as Na\u0001 concentration was reduced from 100 to 25 mM [Na]o (at0Na\u0001 the time constants are below the resolution of the 2-elec- trode voltage clamp). Using the cut-open oocyte prep- aration (see Fig. 26), pre-steady current in the absence of Na\u0001 decayed to steady state with a voltage-indepen- dent time constant of 0.24 ms for ON and 0.17 ms for OFF voltage pulses. 762 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. 1. Effect of sugar The effect of sugar on pre-steady-state current is illustrated in Figure 20B for an oocyte in 0 and 0.25 mM \u0001MDG. The most pronounced effect of sugar was the reduction in pre-steady-state current with hyperpolarizing voltages. With increasing [\u0001MDG] (from 0 to 100 mM), there was a reduction and eventual elimination of the maximal charge Qmax. The reduction in Qmax was hyper- bolic with a \u0001MDG K0.5 of 1.1 mM. The midpoint voltage (V0.5) shifted to more positive values with K0.5 values similar to the K0.5 for reduction of Qmax with [\u0001MDG], but z\t was unaffected (127, 130). The reduction of Qmax and shift of V0.5 with increasing sugar concentrations demon- strated that under sugar transporting conditions, there is a partition of SGLT1 into non-voltage-dependent states. Since Qmax provides an index of the number of trans- porters in the oocyte plasma membrane, the turnover rate of SGLT1 can be estimated from the ratio (Imax/Qmax)of the maximal rate of transport (Imax) and maximal charge (Qmax), assuming z \u0002 1. The turnover rate for \u0001MDG transport by hSGLT1 at 20°C was initially estimated to be 57 s\u00031 (127). It was revised to 28 s\u00031 when longer duration voltage pulses (500 ms) revealed a slow component of charge movement (time constant \u0007 \u0007100 ms) contributing a maximal charge similar to that of the 20 –30 ms (me- dium) component (128). 2. Phlorizin Phlorizin also blocks the pre-steady-state currents. This is illustrated in Figure 22, which shows the pre- steady-state currents in absence of phlorizin (A) and with 100 \u0003M phlorizin (B) in the bath solution. Analysis of the Q-V relations as external [phlorizin] varied from 0 to 250 \u0003M indicates that the Qmax was reduced with a phlorizin Ki of 100 nM (Fig. 22C), but z\t and V0.5 were unaffected (59, 66, 130). The high afﬁnity of SGLT1 for phlorizin (Ki 200 nM) means that during the 100-ms pulse, the inhibitor has locked the transporter in a phlorizin-bound state. Increasing the duration of a depolarizing pulse up to 2 s shows partial recovery of charge and so demonstrates the slow inhibitor off rate (130, see also 81). FIG. 23. Dependence of hSGLT1 pre-steady-state currents on Na \u0001. A: total current records from an oocyte injected with cRNA coding for hSGLT1. External medium was NaCl buffer. Membrane potential was held at Vh \u0002\u000350 mV and stepped (ON) to various test voltages (Vm) between \u000150 and \u0003150 mV (in 20-mV decrements) for 100 ms before returning to Vh (OFF). B: compensated (or pre-steady state) current records at Vm \u000150, \u000310, \u000390, and \u0003150 mV.

Q was obtained from integration of the pre-steady-state currents. Q was the same for ON and OFF responses, and shown are the QOFF. At each voltage, the Q-V data were ﬁtted (smooth curves) to the Boltzmann relation (Eq. 3). The Q-V curves at 100, 50, and 25 mM Na \u0001 were shifted to align at the depolarizing limit.

Correlation between charge and expression Qmax values at saturating Na\u0001 can be used to esti- mate the number of SGLT1 proteins (N) in the plasma membrane, N \u0002 Qmax/ze, where z is the apparent valence of the moveable charge (the limiting slope of the Q-V curve) and e is the elementary charge (127). In an oocyte with a Qmax of 25 nC, this corresponds to \u00071011 SGLT1 molecules/cell or 104 \u0003m\u00032. Independent conﬁrmation that the maximal charge provides an index of the number of cotransporters in the oocyte plasma membrane was obtained from freeze-frac- ture electron microscopy (262). Replicas of the P or cy- toplasmic face of the plasma membrane of SGLT1-cRNA- injected oocytes showed an increase in the density of intramembrane particles (IMPs) with diameter 7– 8 nm compared with control oocytes (262). There was a direct correlation between particle density and charge density, and the slope gives an estimate of \u00073.5 charges per SGLT1 molecule. The apparent discrepancy between the apparent valency (z\t \u0002 1) and this estimate of charge may in part be due to our simplifying assumption that the SGLT1 charge movements occur in a single step by ﬁtting the Q-V curves to the Boltzmann relation (262). Subsequently, we were able to demonstrate that these IMPs in SGLT1 expressing oocytes were indeed SGLT1 monomers (46). We concluded that Qmax is a valid measure of the number of cotransporters expressed in the oocyte membrane. 4. Conformational changes The demonstration that the charge movements are directly associated with protein conformation charges came from biochemical experiments where we measured the accessibility of covalent probes to a cysteine residue (Q457C) in the sugar binding site (38, 129). The hSGLT1 mutant Q457C has a similar apparent afﬁnity (K0.5) for Na\u0001 as wild-type hSGLT1 and is able to transport sugar. Sugar transport, but not the SGLT1 capacitive transients, were abolished after alkylation of the mutant by methane- thiosulfonate reagents (38, 129, 146). However, inhibition of Cys-457 SGLT1 was dependent on the conformation of the transporter, as determined by the rate of inhibition of the sugar-induced current after exposure to MTSEA (2-amino- ethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide). Figure 24A shows an example. Initially, \u0001MDG generated a current of 180 nA. After exposure to MTSEA in Na\u0001 buffer (for 80 s), the sugar-induced current was reduced to 40 nA. MTSEA inactivation was reversed by washing the oocyte in DTT (dithiothreitol, 10 mM). In the second part of the experi- ment, the inhibition of transport by MTSEA was blocked by the presence of sugar (Fig. 24B). It was further dem- onstrated that the accessibility to Cys-457 to MTSEA was dependent on the presence of external Na\u0001 and was blocked by phlorizin: there was no reduction in \u0001MDG- induced current if the oocyte was pretreated with MTSEA in the absence of Na \u0001 (choline replacement) or in the presence of Na\u0001 and 100 \u0003M phlorizin before testing for \u0001MDG transport (Fig. 24B). In addition to ligands, accessibility of Cys-457 hSGLT1 to MTSEA was dependent on membrane volt- age. The accessibility of MTSEA to Cys-457 was deter- mined when the membrane potential held at different values between \u000390 and \u000130 mV, and is compared with FIG. 24. Dependence of effect of MTSEA on protein conformation in hSGLT1 mutant Q457C. The ability of 1 \u0003M MTSEA to label the cysteine at residue 457 was inﬂuenced by substrate binding and mem- brane voltage. The oocyte was voltage-clamped at \u000350 mV in Na\u0001 buffer, and bath composition was varied. Effects of MTSEA were mea- sured as the current generated by 200 mM \u0001MDG. Between all of the experiments, the oocyte was washed in 10 mM DTT for 15 min before equilibration in Na buffer. Dashed line indicates baseline holding cur- rent. A: control experiment demonstrating MTSEA inactivation of sugar transport was reversible. B: sugar protected against MTSEA inactiva- tion. C: dependence of MTSEA inactivation on Na \u0001 and phlorizin. D: correlation of the voltage dependence of Q457C accessibility and the pre-steady-state charge movement. Accessibility was measured as the extent of inhibition of the sugar-induced current (unity is 100%) after 1-min exposure to 10 \u0003M MTSEA. The relative voltage sensitivity was obtained by normalizing the accessibility at the holding potential (\u000350 mV) to the charge. At each test voltage, the charge Q was obtained by integration of the pre-steady-state currents. The curve was the ﬁt of the Q-V data to the Boltzmann relation (Eq. 3). Qmax \u0002 13 nC, z \u0002 0.8 , and V0.5 \u0002\u000321 mV. The data have been normalized between 0 and 1 (129). 764 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. the Q-V relation of the pre-steady-state current in the same oocyte (Fig. 24D). The close correlation between charge movement and changes in MTSEA accessibility demonstrated that the Q-V relations represent the dis- tribution of SGLT1 proteins between the outward-fac- ing Na\u0001-bound conformation and the inward-facing empty carrier. 5. Voltage-clamp ﬂuorometry The correlation between charge movement and pro- tein conformational changes is further supported by volt- age-clamp ﬂuorometry (Fig. 25) measurements (129, 146). Fluorophores such as tetramethyl-rhodamine are sensi- tive to their local environment. A change in ﬂuorescence therefore indicates that the protein conformation has changed, for example, moving tetramethyl-rhodamine from a hydrophobic to a polar environment (such as aqueous external solution) would decrease its ﬂuores- cence intensity. The charge and ﬂuorescence measure- ments are complementary. SGLT1 capacitive charges are associated with global conformational changes of the transporter [the apparent valence of the movable charge, z \u0002 z1\t1 \u0001 z2\t2 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 zn\tn, is the sum of the product of all movable charges (zi) and the displacement of each charge (\ti) in the membrane electric ﬁeld], while changes of ﬂuorescence reﬂect changes in the local environment of the ﬂuorophore. In the absence of sugar, Na\u0001 can interact with SGLT1. This is illustrated in Figure 25A, which shows the time course of rhodamine ﬂuorescence on an oocyte ex- pressing Q457C labeled with TMR6M (tetramethyl-rhoda- mine-6-maleimide) as the cation in the external solution is FIG. 25. Dependence of ﬂuorescence on Na \u0001. Oocytes expressing Q457C were labeled with TMR6M. The experiments were performed using a two-electrode voltage clamp on the stage of an inverted epiﬂuorescence microscope. Fluorescence intensity changes (\tF) are quantiﬁed as percent change from baseline (\tF/F). \tF is expressed in arbitrary units (a.u.). 1 a.u. represents a \tF/Ftotal of \u00071%. A: cation dependence of ﬂuorescence. Vm was \u000350 mV, and the time course of \tF was monitored. External perfusing solution initially contained 0 Na \u0001 (100 mM choline Cl). At the arrow, the solution was changed to either 100 mM Na\u0001,Li\u0001, TEA\u0001, or NMDG\u0001. An upwards deﬂection of the traces indicates an increase in ﬂuorescence intensity. B: kinetics of Na \u0001 activation. \tF was measured as a function of [Na \u0001]. The \tF vs. [Na \u0001] curves are sigmoid and ﬁtted to Eq. 1: \tF \u0002 (\tFmax [Na \u0001] n)/{[Na \u0001]n \u0001 (K0.5) n}, where \tFmax is the maximal ﬂuorescence for saturating [Na \u0001], K0.5 is the half-maximal concentration, and n is the Hill coefﬁcient. At \u000330 mV, \tFmax \u0002 7.4 a.u., K0.5 \u0002 91 mM, and n \u0002 2.0. At \u000350 mV, \tFmax \u0002 7.5 a.u., K0.5 \u0002 58 mM, and n \u0002 1.9. At \u000390 mV, \tFmax \u0002 8.2 a.u., K0.5 \u0002 49 mM, and n \u0002 1.8. C: time course of \tF with step jumps in voltage. Vm was initially at \u000350 mV and then stepped to between \u000190 and \u0003190 mV (with 20-mV increments). External solution contained 100 mM (top panel), 25 mM (middle panel), and 0 mM [Na \u0001]o (bottom panel). D: relationship between \tF and voltage. \tF is the difference in steady-state ﬂuorescence between the test and holding voltages. The \tF vs. V relations for 100 and 25 mM [Na \u0001] were ﬁtted to a Boltzmann relation (Eq. 3): (\tF-\tFhyp)/\tFmax\u0002 1/[1 \u0001 exp(z(V \u0003 V0.5)F/RT)], where \tFmax \u0002 \tFdep \u0003\tFhyp; \tFdep and \tFhyp are the \tF at depolarizing and hyperpolarizing limits; F, R, and T have their usual meanings; V0.5 is membrane potential at 50% \tFmax; and z is apparent valence of the charge sensor of the ﬂuorophore. At 100 mM [Na \u0001], z \u0002 0.4, and V0.5 \u0002\u000350 mV. At 25 mM [Na \u0001], z \u0002 0.4, and V0.5 \u0002\u0003125 mV. For comparison, the curves have been normalized to \tFmax observed in 100 mM Na\u0001 and shifted to align at the extrapolated depolarizing limit. E: dependence of V0.5 for ﬂuorescence (\tF) on Na \u0001. The slope of the regression line is 98.5 mV/log [Na \u0001]. [From Meinild et al. (146).] BIOLOGY OF HUMAN SODIUM GLUCOSE TRANSPORTERS 765 Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. changed. External perfusing solution initially contained 0 Na\u0001 (100 mM choline Cl), and membrane potential was held at \u000350 mV. At the arrow, the perfusing solution was changed from choline buffer to either 100 mM NaCl, LiCl, TEACl, or NMDGCl. On exposure to Na\u0001, the rhodamine ﬂuorescence intensity increased to a new steady-state value and returned to baseline (in choline) when Na\u0001 was removed from the perfusing solution (not shown). This increase in ﬂuorescence intensity was speciﬁc for Na\u0001 and Li\u0001, which can substitute weakly for Na\u0001 in driving sugar transport, whereas TEA\u0001 and NMDG had no effect. The kinetics of Na\u0001 activation of hSGLT1 were de- termined by measuring the ﬂuorescence increase (\tF) as external Na\u0001 concentration varied from 0 to 100 mM with the membrane potential held constant at \u000330, \u000350, and \u000390 mV (Fig. 25B). At each holding potential, increasing Na\u0001 concentration increased ﬂuorescence. Likewise, at constant [Na\u0001], hyperpolarizing membrane potentials in- creased ﬂuorescence. The \tF versus [Na\u0001] relationship was sigmoidal, with a Hill coefﬁcient of 2 at all membrane potentials. We conclude in the absence of glucose, 2 Na\u0001 bind to SGLT1 and that there is high cooperativity be- tween Na\u0001 binding to the two sites. The time course of the ﬂuorescence intensity changes with step jumps of the membrane voltage is shown in Figure 24C. The experiments were performed with external solu- tion containing 100 mM (top panel), 25 mM (middle panel), and0mMNa \u0001 (choline replacement, bottom panel). For both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing voltage pulses, the ﬂuorescence signal reached a steady state and was main- tained until the membrane potential was returned to the holding value. From the holding potential, \u000350 mV, depolar- izing voltages decreased the ﬂuorescence, whereas hyper- polarizing voltages increased ﬂuorescence. The relation between the change in ﬂuorescence in- tensity (\tF) and the test voltage (Vm) was sigmoidal, and these were ﬁtted to the Boltzmann equation (Fig. 24D) with parameters \tFmax (maximal ﬂuorescence intensity change), z\t (apparent valence of the voltage sensor for ﬂuorescence), and V0.5 (voltage at 50% \tFmax). There was a reduction in \tFmax with decreasing Na\u0001 concen- tration. V0.5 shifted to more negative values with de- creasing [Na\u0001]o, and the shift was 98 mV/10-fold reduc- tion in [Na\u0001]o (Fig. 25E). The direction and amplitude of the shift of the V0.5 for ﬂuorescence, towards more negative values with a sensitivity \u0007100 mV/10-fold de- crease in [Na\u0001]o, is similar to that for charge movement (Fig. 23E). The apparent valence of the voltage sensor for ﬂuorescence (z\t) was 0.4 and was independent of Na\u0001 concentration. In Na\u0001-free solutions, there was also a change in ﬂuorescence with voltage jumps. This conﬁrms that the empty transporter undergoes voltage- dependent conformational changes between the exter- nal and internal membrane surfaces. The lower appar- ent valence observed for the ﬂuorescence, 0.4, than for charge, 1.0, indicates that the ﬂuorophore reports on local conformational changes. 6. Experimental limitations The two-electrode voltage clamp, cut-open oocyte voltage clamp, and patch-clamp techniques have been used to study SGLT1 and other electrogenic cotransport- ers. Each has strengths and weaknesses. The advantage of the two-electrode voltage clamp is that the oocyte is stable for many hours, and the clamp settling time of 0.6 –1.0 ms (127) can be used to record electrical and optical transients in the millisecond to second range. The relatively slow clamp speed is due to the microelectrode resistance (\u00070.5 M ) and the high membrane capaci- tance of the oocytes, \u0007300 nF. To measure kinetic events in the microsecond range, the cut-open oocyte voltage clamp with a settling time of 80 \u0003s may be used (204, 208). However, this system tends to be less stable than the two-electrode voltage clamp. Patch-clamp techniques, such as the excised giant patch, have also been employed to study SGLT1, but here the disadvantage is membrane instability and the difﬁculty of obtaining high electrical resistance contacts (\u0006109 ) between the patch pipette and the oocyte plasma membrane (47). The concurrent employment of an independent opti- cal method to monitor voltage-induced conformational changes in SGLT1 overcomes some of the inherent limi- tations of charge measurements alone, since they are subjected to different constraints than charge measure- ments. Charge is extracted from SGLT1 pre-steady-state currents within a background of plasma membrane ca- pacitive currents, SGLT1 ionic currents (uniporter cur- rents), and membrane leakage currents, whereas SGLT1 optical records are measured against a stable background ﬂuorescence. The human isoform was used to study SGLT1 charge movement because the midpoint voltage of the distribu- tion of the protein between the outside-facing and inside- facing conformations (V0.5) was close to the normal hold- ing potential, \u000350 mV. This means that over the practical range of voltages that can be used with oocytes, \u0003150 to \u000150 mV, the full charge movement can be recorded, but this is not the case with other SGLTs with V0.5 values of 0 to \u000310 mV, e.g., rabbit SGLT1 (59). This also is a problem at low Na \u0001 concentrations where V0.5 moves towards more negative voltages (Fig. 23) and it becomes difﬁcult to estimate values of Qmax. Such limitations resulted in early confusion about the origin of charge movements where some concluded that they were wholly ion-well effects. 7. Submillisecond charge movements In two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments, we ob- served a fast (submillisecond) rising phase of charge 766 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. movement when membrane potential was stepped from the holding to a large positive test voltage (e.g., from \u000350 to \u000150 mV), and simulations predicted a fast rising phase of charge movement with depolarizing voltage pulses (59, 167). To study this fast charge, the cut-open oocyte voltage- clamp technique (with a settling time of 80 \u0003s) was com- bined with ﬂuorescence measurements on the hSGLT1 mu- tant Q457C labeled by TMR6M (128). In 100 mM external Na\u0001 (Fig. 26A), depolarizing voltage steps evoked a charge movement that rose initially to a peak (with time constant 0.17 ms) before decaying to steady state (with time constants, 2–30 ms and 25–100 ms) in the presence of Na\u0001 but not its absence. The time to peak (0.9 ms) decreased with [Na\u0001] (Fig. 26B). In absence of Na\u0001, charge movements decayed to steady state with three time constants (0.2, 2, and 150 ms). Charge movement was accompanied by ﬂuorescence signals with similar time courses (Fig. 26, C and D), indicating that the con- formational changes monitored by charge movement are reﬂected by local environment changes at or near Q457C. In external Na\u0001, a depolarizing voltage pulse is thought to result in Na\u0001 release from the Na\u0001-bound transporter and a subsequent reorientation of the empty transporter from the outward-facing to the inward-facing conformation. The development of the rising phase of charge movement in SGLT1 (and Shaker K\u0001 channels; Ref. 8) is due to a decease in time constant with depolar- ization of the membrane and the contribution of charge from secondary steps. (Fig. 23F), i.e., the major voltage- dependent step of the Na\u0001/glucose transport cycle is the return of the empty carrier from inward to outward facing conformations (128). C. Conformational Dynamics Simultaneous charge and ﬂuorescence measure- ments can also be used to study the distribution of con- formations of SGLT1 under sugar transporting conditions. In these experiments, we took advantage of the hSGLT1 mutant G507C. The TMR6M-labeled mutant transporter exhibited kinetics similar to that of wild-type hSGLT1, before and after labeling of Cys507 by TMR6M (130). Figure 27A shows a comparison of charge and ﬂuores- cence (\tF) records in the absence and presence of satu- rating \u0001MDG (100 mM). Addition of saturating sugar (100 mM \u0001MDG) nearly eliminated the pre-steady-state cur- rent, but not the ﬂuorescence signal (Fig. 27B). This indi- FIG. 26.

The currents have been compensated for membrane ca- pacitance and background current using the P/4 protocol with a subtracting holding potential of \u0003150 mV (128). External and guard solution contained 100 mM Na-meth- anesulfonate and internal solution contained 100 mM K-methanesulfonate. Vh was \u000380 mV, and test voltages were \u000150 and \u0003150 mV.

In contrast, phlorizin blocked the pre-steady-state current and the conformational changes (Fig. 27C). D. Substrate and Drug Interactions SGLT1, like many other cotransporters, has been found to transport a wide variety of substrate analogs at widely different turnover rates. In the glucose, nucleo- side, and dipeptide cotransporters, drugs were trans- ported at maximum rates ranging from 10 to 150% of that for the natural substrate (37, 136, 188). For example, indican (indoxyl-\u0002-D-glucopyranoside) was transported by hSGLT1 at 10% of the maximal rate of glucose but with a fourfold greater apparent afﬁnity; K0.5 for indican is 80 \u0003M versus 300 \u0003M for glucose (37, 125). The I-V curves for the indican and \u0001MDG currents at saturating concentrations of the sugars are shown in Figure 28C. Sat- urating indican only reduced the hSGLT pre-steady-state currents by 10% (Fig. 28, A and B), whereas \u0001MDG elim- inated them. This contrast in behavior of indican and \u0001MDG indicated a difference in the rate-limiting step between the two substrates. Computer modeling (see below) indicated that the rate-limiting step for indican transport is sugar translo- cation, whereas for \u0001MDG, it is dissociation of Na\u0001 from the internal binding sites. Because of the differ- ences in turnover rates and the rate-limiting step be- tween indican and \u0001MDG, indican behaved as a com- petitive inhibitor of \u0001MDG transport (Fig. 28D). In this FIG. 28. Characteristics of indican currents from an oocyte express- ing hSGLT1.

Simulations indicate that if \u0001MDG is present at the K0.5 concentration, then the indican Ki was twice the K0.5 for indican transport, i.e., there was classical competitive inhibition between in- dican and sugar. The competition between \u0001MDG and indican is due to the “trapping” of the transporters in the indican-bound conformation (125). In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using transporters as vehicles for drug delivery. Our ﬁnd- ings using indican and glucose indicate that competition between substrates and drugs should be taken into con- sideration when targeting transporters as drug delivery systems. XI. KINETIC MODELING A. Model Many of the experimental observations on the kinet- ics of SGLT1 are accounted for by the six-state ordered nonequilibrium kinetic model for Na\u0001-dependent sugar transport originally proposed by Parent et al. (167). The model (Fig. 29) is based on the alternating access mech- anism (see also Fig. 2 for an earlier 6-state equilibrium model). In a transport cycle, accessibility to the ligand (Na\u0001 and glucose) binding sites alternates between exter- nal and internal membrane surfaces. The transporter has six kinetic states, consisting of the empty transporter [C] (states 1 and 6), the Na\u0001 bound [CNa2] (states 2 and 5), and the Na\u0001- and sugar-bound transporter [CNa2S] (states 3 and 4) at the external and internal membrane surfaces (Fig. 29). On the external membrane surface, two external Na\u0001 bind to the transporter before glucose, and glucose is released at the internal membrane surface before the Na\u0001. The transition (C2 ↔ C5) is the Na\u0001-uniport mode of the transporter. The empty transporter is assumed to have a valence of \u00032. Membrane voltage is assumed to affect Na\u0001 bind- ing/dissociation with the transporter (C1 ↔ C2) and (C5 ↔ C6), and the conformational change of the empty transporter across the membrane (C1 ↔ C6). Since the Na\u0001 bound protein [CNa2] is electroneutral, the sugar binding (rate constants k23, k32, k45, k54) and translocation steps (k34, k34) were assumed to be voltage independent. B. Experimental Basis The experimental basis for the kinetic model for Na \u0001/glucose cotransport is described above, namely, bio- chemical evidence for alternating access, indirect and direct measurement of Na\u0001:sugar stoichiometry, the ki- netics of forward and reverse Na\u0001/glucose transport, sub- strate binding order, voltage dependence of external Na\u0001 binding/dissociation and reorientation of the empty trans- porter, the number of transporters in the plasma mem- brane, and the cooperativity between the two Na\u0001 binding sites (47, 67, 68, 127–130, 139, 146, 166, 262). The goal of a kinetic model is to summarize the experimental data in a coherent conceptual framework and to use the model to make predictions for designing experiments to challenge the model. The binding of two Na\u0001 to the transporter was mod- eled to occur in one step (167). This simpliﬁcation was justiﬁed at high Na\u0001 concentrations due to the strong positive cooperativity between the Na\u0001 sites (49). Na\u0001 binding to SGLT1 exhibits high cooperativity (146). The FIG. 29. Six-state ordered kinetic model for Na \u0001-glucose cotrans- porter. Scheme showing the six kinetic states and the rate constants for the transitions between them. In the absence of ligands, the transporter exists in two states (C1 and C6). At the external surface, two Na \u0001 bind to the transporter to form the complex C2Na2. The sugar-loaded trans- porter (C3Na2S) undergoes a conformational change (C3Na2Sto C4Na2S) resulting in Na \u0001-glucose cotransport. The reaction from state C2Na2 to C5Na2 (dashed line) is the uniport mode of Na \u0001 transport by SGLT1. Pre-steady-state currents are associated with the partial reac- tions C2Na2 ¡ C1 ¡ C6. Region I (gray) is the pre-steady-state currents. II (red) includes external sugar binding/dissociation (C2Na2 ¡ C3Na2S) and sugar translocation across the cell membrane (C3Na2S ¡ C4Na2S); and III (blue) are the internal Na \u0001 release (C5Na2 ¡ C6) and sugar release (C4Na2S ¡ C5Na2) steps. The rate constants (kij, from state i to state j) can be determined by isolating partial reactions in each region. Region I describe the pre-steady-state currents (128). Rate constants in region II can be estimated using indican transport (132). The rate constants for internal reactions (III) can be estimated from the study of reverse Na \u0001-glucose cotransport (47). For the 6-state model, the rate constants (estimated using partial reactions I, II, and III described above) are as follows: k12 \u0002 140,000 M \u00032s \u00031, k21 \u0002 300 s \u00031, k16 \u0002 600 s \u00031, k61 \u0002 25 s \u00031, k23 \u0002 45,000 M \u00031s\u00031, k32 \u0002 20 s \u00031, k34 \u0002 50 s \u00031, k43 \u0002 50 s \u00031, k45 \u0002 800 s \u00031, k54 \u0002 190,000 M \u00031s \u00031, k56 \u0002 5s \u00031, k65 \u0002 2,250 M \u00032s \u00031, k25 \u0002 0.01 s \u00031, k52 \u0002 0.0005 s \u00031, k27 \u0002 50,000 M \u00032s\u00031, k72 \u0002 0.01 s \u00031, \t \u0002 0.7, \u0001= \u0002 0. 3, \u0001\u000b\u0002 0.

However, key properties of the kinetics of SGLT1 can be easier to see with such a simple model. C. Voltage Sensitivity The effect of membrane voltage Vm on the rate con- stants was assumed to follow Eyring rate theory (with symmetric potential energy proﬁle between the forward and backward reactions, Ref. 167). Dielectric parameters \u0001 and \t are used to represent the fraction of the mem- brane electric ﬁeld felt by Na\u0001 binding and the transloca- tion of the empty transporter (110), respectively. The rate constants for a transporter with a valence (zT)of \u00032 are k16 \u0002 k 016 exp(\tFVm/RT), where F is the Faraday con- stant, R is gas constant, and T is temperature. For exter- nal Na\u0001 binding, k12 \u0002 k012 [Na]o2exp(\u0003\u0001=FVm/RT) and k21 \u0002 k 021 exp(\u0001=FVm/RT); and internal Na\u0001 binding: k65 \u0002 k065 [Na]i2exp(\u0001\u000bFVm/RT) and k56 \u0002 k 056 exp(\u0003\u0001\u000bFVm/ RT). The pre-steady-state currents (hSGLT1 capacitive currents) were assumed to be associated with the reori- entation of the empty transporter between outward- and inward-facing conformations (C1 ↔ C6) and external (C2 ↔ C1) and internal Na\u0001 binding/dissociation (C5 ↔ C6). The changes of ﬂuorescence intensity associated with SGLT1 with step jumps in membrane voltage were assumed to arise from changes in occupancy probabili- ties: \tF \f qy1\tC1 \u0001 qy2\tC2 \u0001 qy3\tC3 \u0001 qy4\tC4 \u0001 qy5\tC5 \u0001 qy6\tC6, where qyj is the apparent quantum yield of the ﬂuorophore (TMR6M) when SGLT1 is in con- formation Cj (128). D. Estimating Parameters The Na\u0001/glucose cotransport model involves a closed cycle of six partial reactions, each of the phenom- enological kinetic parameters K0.5 Na, K0.5 sug, Imax Na , and Imax sug depend on all the rate constants of the transport cycle (see for example, Eqs. A37–A43 in Ref. 167). For the six-state model, there are 14 rate constants, and it is a challenge to estimate all the values. For their determina- tion, we note that the partial reactions fall into three groups: 1) voltage-dependent reactions [these are the con- formational changes of the empty transporter between external and internal membrane surfaces (C1 ↔ C6) and external Na\u0001 binding/dissociation (C1 ↔ C2)]; 2) external sugar binding/dissociation (C2 ↔ C3) and sugar translo- cation (C3 ↔ C4); and 3) internal Na\u0001 release (C5 ↔ C6) and sugar release (C4 ↔ C5). Moreover, in two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments where the inward transport of Na \u0001 and glucose are studied, the rate constants for sugar translocation across the membrane (C3 ↔ C4) and the internal ligand binding steps (C4 ↔ C5; C5 ↔ C6) cannot be uniquely determined. A set of rate constants for the six-state model for hSGLT1 obtained from experiments where individual par- tial reactions were isolated is presented in Figure 29: 1) the kinetic parameters for voltage-dependent reactions were obtained from ﬁtting the pre-steady-state currents in the absence of sugar; and 2) kinetic parameters for Na\u0001 and glucose binding on the internal membrane surface were obtained from studies on reverse sugar transport using the excised giant patch (47). The rate constants for sugar binding and translocation were estimated from for- ward Na\u0001/glucose cotransport (68). These rate constants were obtained from simulation of the global steady-state and pre-steady-state SGLT1 kinetics, and not simply the simulation of a single type of experiment. There are several notable implications of the model: 1) the voltage-dependent steps are the reorientation of the empty carrier and external Na\u0001 binding/dissociation. The internal Na\u0001 binding steps do not depend on voltage. Thus there is an asymmetry in the voltage dependence of Na\u0001 binding between the outside and inside; 2) the rate- limiting step of Na\u0001/glucose transport is the release of Na\u0001 on the internal membrane surface; 3) under steady- state conditions, the current generated by Na\u0001/glucose cotransport arises from the “conformational” current of the empty carrier as it returns from the internal to the external membrane surface (C1 ↔ C6) and external Na\u0001 binding/dissociation (C1 ↔ C2); and 4) the model ac- counts for the outward current, but this requires that the rates of translocation of the empty transporter, k16 and k61, are sodium dependent as predicted (49). The asym- metry in the I-V curves between inward and outward currents are in agreement with our model where the binding of Na\u0001 at the internal surface is voltage indepen- dent. However, this is inconsistent with the location of the Na \u0001 binding site in the sugar occluded vSGLT crystal structure (48). E. Testing Most of the tests of the six-state model have been based on extending the type of experiment and the time scale of the pre-steady-state currents, for example, exam- ining the kinetics of different substrates (glucose and indican) and reverse transport. The time scale of the pre-steady-state kinetics was extended by 1) using a faster voltage clamp, such as the cut-open oocyte voltage- clamp method which has a 10-fold faster settling time (80 \u0003s compared with 1 ms) compared with the two-electrode voltage clamp (18, 128); and 2) application of test voltage pulses of duration longer than the 100 ms standard pulses 770 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. (100, 128). In the simpliﬁed three-state model for pre- steady-state currents (C2 ↔ C1 ↔ C6), the binding of the two external Na\u0001 is lumped into a single step. This is essentially an equilibrium assumption at high Na\u0001 con- centrations, i.e., at [Na\u0001]o \u0006\u0006 KD Na (KD Na is the intrinsic dissociation constant for Na\u0001 binding to the protein). One would expect model predictions to deviate from experi- mental data at low Na\u0001 concentrations and during relax- ations to steady state in response to step perturbations in membrane voltage or ligand concentrations. Simulations of the three-state model (59, 128) predict the following: 1) the pre-steady-state current relaxation contains two time con- stants, a fast submillisecond component associated with Na\u0001 binding/dissociation and a medium component 2–30 ms associated with the empty transporter; 2) the depen- dence of the medium time constant (\u0007ON) on membrane voltage is Gaussian or bell shaped with a peak at the V0.5, and \u0007ON is decreased with hyperpolarizing and depolariz- ing voltages away from the V0.5; 3) the shift of the V0.5 of the charge movement is \u000360 mV/10-fold decrease in [Na\u0001]o; and 4) since the empty transporter has a va- lence of \u00032, z\t (in the Boltzmann relation) should be 2. While the steady-state kinetics are well described by the six-state model, there are several predictions that have not been met regarding the presteady state currents. 1) Charge and ﬂuorescence measurements have re- vealed that the pre-steady-state current contains multiple time constants with time scales ranging from 0.1 to 100 ms (128). In 100 mM external [Na\u0001], depolarizing voltage pulses evoked a charge movement that rose initially to a peak (with time constant \u0007 \u0002 0.17 ms) before decaying to steady state with two time constants (\u0007 \u0002 2–30 and 25–150 ms). In the absence of Na\u0001, charge movement decayed to steady state with three time constants (0.2, 2, and 150 ms), indicating that reorientation of the empty transporter be- tween the outward (C1) and inward (C6) facing confor- mations involves at least two additional intermediate states (C1 ↔ Ca ↔ Cb ↔ C6). 2) There is an asymmetry in the voltage dependence of the time constants. The medium (\u0007med 2–30 ms) time constant was independent of voltage for hyperpolarizing pulses, whereas \u0007med decreased with depolarizing voltage pulses (18, 128). The asymmetry in voltage sensitivity has also been observed in ion channels and has been attrib- uted to an asymmetry in the potential energy proﬁle (261). 3) The shift of the midpoint voltage (V0.5) with de- creasing [Na\u0001]o is \u0003100 mV/10-fold decrease in [Na\u0001]o (Fig. 23E). This is also the case for the shift of the V0.5 for ﬂuorescence with [Na\u0001]o (Fig. 25E; Ref. 146). The failure of the three-state model to account for the shift of the V0.5 with decreasing [Na\u0001]o is not surprising, because lumping the two Na\u0001 binding steps into one step means that the rate constants k16 for empty transporter reorientation (C1 ↔ C6) and k12 for Na\u0001 binding (C1 ↔ C2) become pseudo rate constants and are dependent on [Na\u0001]o (49). Computer simulations of different models for Na\u0001 bind- ing to cotransporters showed that two-step sequential models for Na\u0001 binding are required to account for a shift of 100 mV/10-fold change in [Na\u0001] (Dr. Ian Forster, Uni- versity of Zurich, personal communication). 4) z\t determined experimentally is 1, whereas simu- lations predict a z\t of 2. This discrepancy could, in part, be due to our inability to measure very rapid (submilli- second) components of charge movement. To account for three relaxation time constants in the absence of Na\u0001 and the asymmetry in voltage depen- dence, two additional states Ca and Cb between C1 and C6 (C1 ↔ Ca ↔ Cb ↔ C6) are required (region I of Fig. 29; Ref. 128), together with asymmetry in the voltage depen- dence of the rate constants. Simulations showed the steady-state kinetics of Na\u0001/glucose cotransport was equally accounted for by both the six- and eight-state models. The models qualitatively and quantitatively ac- counts for I-V relations for forward and reverse transport, as well as the dependence of the kinetic parameters K0.5 Na, K0.5 \u0001MDG, Imax Na , and Imax \u0001MDG on membrane voltage and ligand concentrations (130). The models also account for indi- can transport (a high-afﬁnity, low-turnover substrate) and the competition between \u0001MDG and indican (Fig. 28D). F. Distribution of Conformations Insight into the transport kinetics may be obtained by an analysis of the occupancy probability (Po) of each state in the eight-state model, and how those states are altered by ligands and voltage. In external NaCl buffer (Fig. 30), the transporter is predominantly in C2Na2 at negative membrane voltages (98% occupancy in C2Na2 at \u0003150 mV), and in C6 at depolarizing voltages (73% at \u000150 mV). With step jumps in membrane voltage, the pre-steady- state current is associated with redistribution of the neg- atively charged transporter between the outward-facing and inward-facing conformations (C2Na2 and C6). External sugar alters the distribution by reducing the occupancy in C2Na2 and increasing C5 occupancy at large negative membrane voltages. At large positive voltages (e.g., \u000150 mV), the inward-facing ligand-free conforma- tion C6 is predominant, regardless of the sugar concen- tration (Fig. 30, A, B, and D). At saturating external [\u0001MDG], when membrane voltage is stepped from \u000350 to \u000150 mV, the charge movement is too small to be detected because of the low occupancy in states C2Na2, C1, Ca, Cb, and C6 (Fig. 30D). However, there is a conformational change from C5Na2 ↔ C6, and is monitored by the ﬂuo- rescence changes in the TMR6M labeled G507C (Fig. 27B). The ﬂuorescence change is due to differences in apparent quantum yields of the ﬂuorophore between the BIOLOGY OF HUMAN SODIUM GLUCOSE TRANSPORTERS 771 Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. two states, C5Na2 and C6. We predict that this conforma- tional change is a rate-limiting step for Na\u0001/sugar cotrans- port. Phlorizin locked the transporters in a ﬁxed state (C7Na2Pz) and prevented the protein from running through the transport cycle. The increase in the occu- pancy of the phlorizin-bound state (C7Na2Pz) is balanced by reduction of the occupancy probabilities in all other conformations (Fig. 30, A, C, and E). The proﬁle of the Po-Vm curves is not affected by phlorizin. At the Ki for phlorizin, 50% of the transporters are in the phlorizin- bound conformation. The effect of phlorizin on the pre- steady-state current is consistent with the model simula- tions: there is no effect of phlorizin on midpoint voltage (V0.5), and maximal charge (Qmax) is reduced 50% at the Ki for phlorizin. The predicted occupancy in the different conforma- tions with changes in Na\u0001 and sugar concentrations and membrane voltage (Fig. 30) was supported by the close agreement between experimental data on ﬂuorescence and the simulations (125, 128, 130, 135). Simulations using the eight-state model show that, qualitatively and quantitatively, it accounts for the steady- state kinetics of Na\u0001/glucose cotransport. However, it fails to ﬁt the pre-steady-state kinetics below 1 ms due to assumptions about the kinetics of sodium binding (125, 135), e.g., 1) the initial rise component of the charge movement with depolarizing voltage pulses (Fig. 26) (128) and 2) magnitude of the shift of V0.5 (\u0007100 mV/10-fold change in [Na]o) for charge and ﬂuorescence. These are related: the rising phase is associated with the Na\u0001 bind- ing steps (128), and a sequential binding model with 2 Na\u0001 binding sites (CNa2 ↔ CNa1 ↔ C1) is required to account for the 100 mV (per 10-fold change in [Na]o) shift in V0.5. At present, very little is known about the kinetics of the FIG. 30. Simulation of occupancy probabilities (Po) of the 8-state model. For comparison of charge and ﬂuorescence measurements, the simulations were performed for the TMR6M-labeled hSGLT1 mutant G507C, which exhibited similar steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics as wild-type hSGLT1. For clarity, states with Po \b 0.1 were not plotted. These states were as follows: C1 in A, C, and E; C1, C2Na2, C3Na2S, and C4Na2Sin B and D. A: in NaCl buffer in the absence of sugar.

A future challenge is to gain insights into the binding of the Na\u0001. XII. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION The ultimate goal is to understand, on the atomic level, how an ion-driven cotransport protein transforms the energy of the electrochemical gradient into work, enabling it to drive the cosubstrate against its concentra- tion gradient. The kinetics studies have identiﬁed eight different protein conformations, the rates of transitions between them, and the dynamics of the conformational changes in a Na\u0001/sugar transport cycle (Fig. 31). With the solution of two conformations of the SGLT1 bacterial homolog vSGLT, providing for the ﬁrst time a structural model for SGLT1, the task ahead is to merge the kinetics and structure into a dynamic structural translation. Even though we do not yet have the structure of hSGLT1, the ideal situation, there are tools available to begin the pro- cess. At the time of this writing there are four different Na\u0001 cotransporter crystal structures in different confor- mations. These cotransporters, LeuT, vSGLT, BetP, and Mhp1, belong to different gene families but share a com- mon core architecture of 10 helices in an inverted repeat conﬁguration. We believe that this shared structural fold implies a common kinetic mechanism; therefore, in the following discussion we will use the LeuT helix number- ing system. [For example, vSGLT TM1 is renamed TM-1 because vSGLT TM2 corresponds to TM1 of the core structure (see Fig. 12), and so on.] The structure of the nucleobase cotransporter Mhp1 has been solved in the outward open (C2), outward occluded (C3), and inward facing (C5) conformations (199). The leucine cotrans- porter LeuT is an outward occluded (C3) conformation (256), BetP appears to be in an intermediate conformation between C3 and C4 (183), and vSGLT1 is in an inward occluded and inward open conformations (C4, C5) (48, 238). As yet, there are no structures of these proteins in the C1 or C6 conformations. Our ﬁrst strategy was to “thread” the vSGLT1 se- quence onto the LeuT coordinates to model the outward occluded (C3) conformation (48). Comparison of the vSGLT C4 conﬁguration and the C3 model were then compared to identify how the helices of the core have to move in the C3 to C4 transition (alternating access). There is an external aqueous pathway where ex- tracellular sugar and Na\u0001 gain access to the binding sites (bounded by TM1E, TM2, TM6E and TM10), and the aqueous pathway leading from the binding sites to the cytoplasm (bounded by TM1I, TM2, TM3, TM6I, TM8, and TM10). The major arrangements that are pre- dicted to occur during the transition from the outward (C3) to inward (C4) facing conformations involve TM1, TM6, and TM10. The external end of TM10 folds over the sugar binding site and F423 forms part of the ex- ternal gate along with Y87 (TM2) and M73 (TM1) (see Fig. 14C). The tilting of TM10 is facilitated by P436 and G437 in the middle of the transmembrane domain. Changes in the position of TM2, TM3, TM6I, TM8, and FIG. 31. A 6-state model of SGLTs to integrate the kinetic and structural data. Na \u0001 binds ﬁrst to the outside to open the outside gate (C2) permitting outside sugar to bind and be trapped in the bind- ing site (C3). This is followed by a con- formational change from an outward oc- cluded (C3) to an inward occluded (C4) state. Upon opening the inward gate (C5), the Na\u0001 and sugar are released into the cell interior. There is a paucity of experiments adressing the order of the ligand dissociation at the cytosolic sur- face. The transport cycle is completed by the change in conformation from the in- ward facing ligand-free (C6) to the out- ward facing ligand free (C1) states. Struc- tures corresponding to C2 and C3 have been obtained for Mhp1, C3 for LeuT, and C4 for vSGLT.

TM10 also result in the expansion of the intracellular cavity. All that is then required to release sugar into the expanded cavity is the displacement of the inner gate Y263 (238). Another view of the conformational changes that follow external sugar binding was obtained by homol- ogy modeling of hSGLT1 based on the structures of the Mhp1 obtained in the presence and absence of substrate (241). Figure 32 shows an outside view of hSGLT1 before and after sugar binding. In the outward facing open conformation (C2), the hydrophobic gating residues L87, F101, and F453 are open (12–20 Å apart), but these gates close after glucose binding (\b6 Å apart) to trap the sugar. This occurs through a tilting of the external end of TM10 into the vestibule, facilitated by the double prolines in the middle of the helix (P465 and P466). This proline duplex is well conserved in the SLC5 fam- ily (Table 1) and Mhp1 (GP), but not in the LeuT family. In addition, the external ends of TM1 and TM2 tilt inward to bring the sugar coordinating residues into range. The unwound region in TM1 could facilitate the inward motion in all four families of Na\u0001 coupled trans- porters. The predicted sugar-induced changes in tilt of the external end of TM10 is supported by cysteine scanning studies on vSGLT and hSGLT1 (67, 230). Speciﬁcally, sodium-dependent glucose binding induced changes in the ﬂuorescence of probes covalently linked to cysteines at the external end of TM10 (A423C in vSGLT, and Q457C and D454C in hSGLT1). In addition, access of other mu- tants on the outer half of TM10, T460C and A468C, to MTS reagents was also conformationally dependent (36, 67). Cysteine mutants lying outside the external vestibule also exhibit conformational changes, either access to MTS reagents (A439C, I443C, and Q445C at the top of TM9 and the linking loop to TM10, R499C at top of TM11, and L527C and Y528C at the top of TM12) (67). This indicates that there are sugar-induced structural changes through- out the protein. Open structural questions still to be resolved include the following: 1) the identity of the second sodium bind- ing site in hSGLT and determining whether it is a neutral (Na2) or charged (Na1) site (152); 2) the location of the inhibitor (phlorizin) binding site in hSGLT1 and hSGLT2. Phlorizin-like inhibitors are in development for treatment of diabetes (see Fig. 19). Phlorizin is a poor inhibitor of vSGLT (Ki \u00071 mM), but a potent inhibitor of human SGLTs (Ki \b 200 nM). 3) The structure of SGLTs in additional conformations, C1/C6, C2, and/or C4/C5, need to be determined. XIII. MULTIFUNCTIONAL PROTEINS SGLT1 does many things: it cotransports Na\u0001 and glucose, bringing an important nutrient into cells, but in doing so it depolarizes the plasma membrane, which can serve as a signal; in the absence of glucose, SGLT1 can still support a Na\u0001 current; the protein contains a water and urea channel; and it transports water and urea along with Na\u0001 and glucose (249). It is highly likely that these varied properties of SGLT1, and other cotransporters, have yet undiscovered physiological signiﬁcance. It is a major challenge to identify the physiological functions of cloned proteins such as those in the human SGLT gene family. Even when genes have been cloned by expression cloning, e.g., SGLT1, it remains a nontrivial task to estab- lish their physiological role in humans. Furthermore, there may be signiﬁcant species differences, e.g., pig SGLT3 behaves as a Na\u0001/glucose cotransporter in the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system while human SGLT3 does not (34, 35, 138). It appears that in humans, SGLT3 is a glucose sensor expressed in the enteric ner- vous system and muscle. The ﬁrst step in revealing the diverse functions of these proteins is to determine the properties of the cloned transporters in heterologous ex- pression systems and to cast the net wide in terms of functional assays. A second step is to carefully phenotype patients with severe mutations in SGLT genes. A. Na\u0001 Uniport The ﬁrst indication that SGLT behaved as a uniporter was the observation that phlorizin inhibited a current in the absence of glucose (see Fig. 4A) (226).

Shown are TMs 1, 2, 6, and 10 along with the outer and inner gate residues [outer L87, F101, and F453 (grey spheres), inner Y290 (yellow sphere), and sugar coordinating (sticks)]. In the C2 conformation, the gates are open (10 –20 Å apart) to expose the sugar binding residues. Upon sugar binding, the external gates close (4 – 6 Å apart) largely through an inward tilt of the external ends of TM10, TM1, and TM2. (From V. Chaptal, B. A. Hirayama, D. D. F. Loo, J.

Further experiments (131, 162) demonstrated that this current saturated with increasing external Na\u0001 concen- tration with a K0.5 of 2.5 mM and a Hill coefﬁcient of 2, and that both Li\u0001 and H\u0001 were able to substitute for Na\u0001. The activation energy for the Na\u0001 leak current was sim- ilar to that for Na\u0001/glucose cotransport, 21 versus 25 kcal/mol. It was concluded that the leak currents reﬂect Na \u0001 uniport through SGLT1. B. Water and Urea Channels SGLT1 provides a passive permeability pathway for water and other small molecules. Expressing SGLT1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes increased the osmotic water per- meability of the cell (262). Expressed in terms of the number of SGLT1 proteins in the membrane, the osmotic water permeability is similar to that for the water channel AQP0, but only 5% of that for AQP1. The SGLT1 passive water permeability was independent of the direction and magnitude of the osmotic gradient, the presence or ab- sence of ligands (Na\u0001 and sugar), but in Na\u0001 it was blocked by phlorizin with a Ki of \u00075 \u0003M (124, 131, 134, 145, 262). Unlike the Na\u0001 uniport mode, the activation energy for water permeability is low (5 vs. 21 kcal/mol) and similar to that for water channels. It is concluded that SGLT1 behaves as a water channel, but unlike other water channels, permeation is dependent on the protein confor- mation, i.e., channel activity is blocked by phlorizin. Urea uptake into SGLT1 expressing oocytes was also fourfold higher than in control oocytes (115, 165). The SGLT1-speciﬁc urea transport was blocked by phlorizin (Ki 1 \u0003M), but only in Na\u0001 buffer as phlorizin only binds to SGLT1 in Na\u0001. Phloretin also inhibits urea and water transport through SGLT1, but the Ki was 100 –1,000 higher than that for phlorizin. As with SGLT1 water permeability, the urea uptake was not affected by the presence or absence of Na\u0001, and the activation energy was 6 kcal/mol. The activation energy for both water and urea transport in control oocytes was 15 kcal/mol. There was no saturation of SGLT1 urea transport as uptake was not blocked by 100 mM concentrations of urea analogs, thiourea, 1,3-dimethyl urea, 1,1-dimethyl urea, or acetamide. It was concluded that SGLT1 behaves as a urea channel. Examination of the crystal structure of vSGLT and other members of the LeuT structural family does not reveal an obvious continuous pathway for water and urea across the protein, but the extracellular and intracellular aqueous vestibules suggest that pathway is through the sugar binding site. This is strengthened by molecular dynamic studies of vSGLT, showing that pas- sive water ﬂuxes cross the protein through the sugar transport pathway (20). While the unitary conductance of SGLT1 for water and urea is low relative to other channels, SGLT1 may play an important physiological role in water and urea transport in those cells with high levels of expression, e.g., 250,000 SGLT1 molecules/enterocyte. Thus SGLT1 may be a major pathway for water and urea transport across the intestinal brush-border membrane. C. Coupled Water, Urea, and Glucose Transport A surprising observation was that in oocytes express- ing SGLT1, the addition of glucose immediately increased the transport of water into the cell (133, 134, 145, 263). The initial rate of sugar-coupled water transport was 1) directly proportional to the rate of Na\u0001/glucose cotransport, i.e., the rate varied with changes in mem- brane potential, sugar concentration, and temperature (the activation energy for coupled water transport was identical to that for Na\u0001/sugar transport, 25–30 kcal/mol); 2) independent of the osmotic gradient and even occurred against an osmotic gradient; 3) coupling was independent of the ion used to drive sugar transport, Na\u0001 or H\u0001; and 4) the coupling coefﬁcient varied by cotransporter sub- type, e.g., rabbit SGLT1, human SGLT1, NIS, and a plant H\u0001/amino acid cotransporter (AAP5) where the coupling ranged from 50 to 425 water molecules per turnover. This implied that water coupling was related to transporter architecture and not simply the rate of Na\u0001 and solute transport. While these experiments clearly demonstrated that there is a close relationship between Na\u0001/glucose cotransport and the initial rate of water transport, con- troversy remains as to the interpretation of the results. We have favored the water cotransport hypothesis, while others favor a strict osmotic coupling, i.e., water ﬂowed in response to the osmotic gradients set up by Na\u0001/sugar cotransport into the cell (15, 109, 133, 263–265). While there is no doubt that osmotic gradients do contribute to coupled water ﬂow through SGLT1, the debate centers on the importance of unstirred layers during the initial (1–5 s) turning on of Na\u0001/glucose cotransport. Potential un- stirred layer effects are not likely to account for the observed coupling between urea and Na \u0001/glucose cotrans- port (115). In molecular dynamic studies of vSGLT, 70 – 80 water molecules accompany galactose as it moves from the binding site into the intracellular space (20), consis- tent with the water pump hypothesis. Nevertheless, it is clear that there is coupling, direct or indirect, between water and Na\u0001/glucose cotransport, and this is expected to play a major role in water transport across the intesti- nal brush border (133). D. Glucose Sensor Until 2003, it was widely assumed that all SGLT genes are expressed in intestinal and renal epithelial cells, where they are responsible for the accumulation of glu- BIOLOGY OF HUMAN SODIUM GLUCOSE TRANSPORTERS 775 Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. cose and galactose. However, hSGLT3 has proven not to beaNa \u0001/glucose cotransporter, but instead a glucose sensor (35). The gene was initially found to be expressed in the human small intestine and muscle, and subsequent mRNA protection assays found that it was also expressed in uterus, lung, brain, spleen, thyroid, kidney, and trachea (Table 1). In the small intestine, immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that the hSGLT3 protein was pres- ent in the enteric neurons and not in intestinal epithelial cells. In skeletal muscle, the protein was conﬁned to the neuromuscular junction. When expressed in Xenopus lae- vis oocytes, hSGLT3 was efﬁciently inserted into the plasma membrane, but it was unable to transport glucose. Electrophysiological assays revealed that glucose caused a speciﬁc, phlorizin-sensitive, Na\u0001-dependent de- polarization of the membrane potential of up to 12 mV. Radioactive glucose uptake assays under voltage clamp revealed that the glucose-induced inward currents were not accompanied by glucose transport. The D-glucose afﬁnity for hSGLT3 was low (Km 20 mM), and D-galactose was not recognized. On the other hand, imino sugars, such as 1-de- oxynojirimycin, were found to be highly potent agonists (Km 4 \u0003M; Ref. 235). Based on these electrophysiological prop- erties and the expression pattern of the gene, we have speculated that hSGLT3 is a glucose sensor and not a Na \u0001/ glucose cotransporter. This has been supported by studies that show glucose regulates intestinal motility in rodents and humans (103, 181) and that guinea pig enteric neurons are reported to be glucose sensitive (121). Further strong evidence in support of SGLT3’s func- tion as a glucosensor came from a recent study where the gene was expressed in C. elegans ASK chemosensory neurons (9). On the basis of assays on chemotaxis plates, the transgenic animals were repulsed or attracted to 10 mM glucose depending on the pH, and the responses were blocked by 100 \u0003M phlorizin. Wild-type worms were nei- ther attracted nor repulsed by glucose. E. Glucose Sensing in the Gut Glucose sensors are present throughout the body, especially in the gastrointestinal tract. These range from the “sweet” receptors in the tongue to the glucose sensors in pancreatic beta cells and in the small intestine. These sensors are intimately involved in food intake, from coordi- nating the physiological response to an ingested carbohy- drate meal, to regulating blood glucose levels, and regulating glucose transporter expression in response to changes in diet. It has long been recognized that one of the principal roles of the duodenum is to act as a sensory organ (see Ref. 180). Speciﬁcally, glucose in the duodenum inhibits gastric emptying, increases intestinal motility, and stimulates the release of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and serotonin (5-HT) from endocrine cells. The major function of GIP and GLP-1 is to stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion, whereas 5-HT acts to modulate enteric reﬂexes. The glucose sensors lining the intestine have prop- erties similar to those of SGLTs: 1) nonmetabolized substrates, 3-O-methyl glucoside and \u0001-methyl-glucopy- ranoside, mimic glucose in reducing gastric emptying and stimulate the release of 5-HT and GLP-1 from the gut and 5-HT and GLP-1 from neuroendocrine cell mod- els; 2) 5-HT and GLP-1 release are blocked by phlorizin; and 3) SGLT3 is expressed in an intestinal neuroendo- crine cell line (57). It is now recognized that at least some of the intestinal glucose sensors are G protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs) found in enteroendocrine cells (40). Perhaps the strongest evidence for this is that mice lacking T1T3 and \u0001-gustducin showed no upregulation of SGLT1 with increasing dietary carbo- hydrates. The ﬁnding that glucose sensors are ex- pressed in different cells compared with the trans- porter suggests a chemical signaling pathway between cells, and this is consistent with neurogenin-3 muta- tions in human subjects, where a lack of enteroendo- crine cells results in severe malabsorption (236). F. Glucose Sensing in the Brain The SGLT3 story now raises the possibility that other SGLTs may behave as glucose sensors especially since these genes are expressed throughout the body (Table 1). This is of particular relevance in the brain, where specialized neurons controlling sleep, appetite, and hormone secretion behave as glucose detectors (for review, see Ref. 56). There are two types of glu- cose-sensing neurons, glucose-excited and glucose-in- hibited neurons in the hypothalamus and brain stem, whose rate of ﬁring either increases or decreases in response to extracellular glucose. While the current dogma is that these glucose responses are mediated via KATP as in pancreatic \u0002-cells, there is emerging evi- dence that SGLTs are involved. Namely, glucose-ex- cited neurons are also stimulated by nonmetabolized SGLT substrates, such as \u0001-MDG, and the response is blocked by the SGLT inhibitor phlorizin and the ab- sence of Na\u0001 (Fig. 33) (154). There is also RT-PCR evidence that SGLT1 and -3 are expressed in the hypothalamus (see also section V). Given the coexpression of SGLTs and GLUT3 in neurons, it is unlikely that the SGLTs in neurons are simply required for glucose uptake. It is more likely that these cells respond to changes in ambient glucose concentrations by depolariza- tion of the membrane potential (see Fig. 3). The \u0001MDG- stimulated ﬁring of glucose-excited neurons is probably me- diated by an increase in Ca 2\u0001 inﬂux. In summary, SGLT genes may have important physiological roles throughout 776 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. the body not only as Na \u0001/glucose cotransporters but as Na \u0001 uniporters, water and urea channels, and glucose sensors. XIV. PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY A. Regulation of Expression Ongoing studies are examining the regulation of SGLT1 and SGLT2 expression at the mRNA level, mostly in the kidney and intestine in diabetes and as a function of diet. The promoters of human and sheep SGLT1 have been mapped (143, 229) and, at least in the STC-1 cell line, sheep promoter activity is activated by glucose through a PKA pathway (41). Both the SGLT1 and SGLT2 promoters contain binding sites for human hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1) that enhance promoter activity (143, 172). Knockout mice (HNF1\u0001\u0003/\u0003) suffered from a renal Fan- coni syndrome where there was severe glucose, phos- phate, and amino acid urinary wasting but there was no intestinal phenotype (172). The glucosuria was caused by a defect in SGLT2 expression. These results suggest that in the mouse HNF1\u0001 regulates renal SGLT2 expression but not intestinal SGLT1 expression. Unfortunately, a lack of well-characterized antibod- ies means that there are a limited number of studies on the regulation of protein expression in either the intestine or kidney. Arguably one of the most careful studies is that on the expression, SGLT1 and GLUT2 in the intestinal biopsies of diabetic and control human subjects (43). There was a three- to fourfold increase in SGLT1 and GLUT2 mRNA and protein levels, and the activity of Na\u0001/ glucose cotransport in brush-border membrane vesicles also increased threefold. The molecular mechanism un- derlying this increase is unknown and is complicated by the fact that mature enterocytes normally express SGLT1, and epithelial turnover occurs with a half-time of 3– 4 days. In both the intestine and kidney of animals, the changes in SGLT1 and SGLT2 mRNA levels with different experimental protocols (diet, aging, diabetic model) were generally less than ﬁvefold. A notable exception is the change in intestinal trans- port activity and protein level in sheep, where the level of glucose transport decreased by two orders of magnitude on weaning (201, 243). Both the rate of Na\u0001/glucose cotransport and SGLT1 protein in brush-border mem- branes drop by 200-fold when lambs are weaned and dietary carbohydrate fails to reach the small intestine, while there is a modest fourfold reduction in SGLT1 mRNA (114). Surprisingly, infusion of glucose into the intestine of adult sheep increased the level of transporter activity 100-fold, but the mRNA levels only increased 2-fold. This suggested translational or posttranslational regulation of the transporter in brush-border membrane. Infusion of 30 mM glucose, fructose, or 2-deoxy-glucose into the intestine of the ruminant sheep for 3 h returned the level of brush-border Na\u0001/glucose cotransport and protein to the preruminant state after several days (42). This body of work has led to the conclusion that SGLT1 upregulation is mediated by a glucose sensor that initiates a signaling pathway linked to a cAMP-PKA pathway that takes several days to act. Over the shorter term of minutes, activation of the cAMP pathway results in the recruitment of an intracel- lular pool of transporters to the plasma membrane. The experiments were performed on rabbit SGLT1 ex- pressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. With the use of membrane-permeable 8-BrcAMP to activate PKA, there was a reversible 30% increase in the maximum rate of Na\u0001/glucose transport that occurred within minutes, whereas activating PKC with membrane-permeable sn- 1,2-dioctytanoylglycerol (DOG) resulted in a decrease in the maximum rate of transport by 60% (72). There were no changes in the kinetics of SGLT1 apart from the increase in the maximum rate of transport. These changes in maximum transport rate were due to changes in the number of transporters in the plasma membrane. Both 8-BrcAMP and DOG increased the number of hSGLT1 molecules in the membrane, as did calyculin A, an inhibitor of phosphatases 1 and 2A. Even though there are four PKC and one PKA consen- FIG. 33.

Figure 34 shows thin-section and freeze-fracture electron micrographs of the 120-nm vesicles in the cyto- plasm fusing with the plasma membrane of Xenopus lae- vis oocytes (248). Note the increase in intramembrane particles (SGLT1 proteins) in the SGLT1 expressing oocytes. The freeze-fracture images of vesicles isolated from the cytoplasm of SGLT1-expressing oocytes show that there are 10 –20 SGLT1 proteins per vesicle. Given the rate of cotransporter insertion into the membrane (250,000 s\u00031), we estimate that 10,000 of these vesicles fuse with the oocyte plasma membrane per second. Since the membrane area increased by only 60 \u0003m2/s, equiva- lent to fusion of 1,500 120-nm vesicles, we suggest that concurrent endocytosis accounts for the smaller increase in area. With an average number of transporters in the plasma membrane before stimulation of 2. 5 \u0005 1011/ oocyte, a 30% increase 30 min after 8-BrcAMP treatment represents an insertion rate of 1 \u0005 107 SGLT1/s. For the area of an oocyte plasma membrane, 30 \u0005 106 \u0003m2, this is equivalent to a fusion rate of 1 vesicle·\u0003m\u00032·s\u00031 (248). This rapid insertion of SGLT1 into the plasma membrane indicates an intracellular reserve pool of vesicles within the cell poised to fuse with the cell membrane. There is evidence that cAMP and theophylline increase the maxi- mum velocity of SGLT1 activity in enterocytes within 20 min (197), presumably by a similar mechanism. One factor that may be involved in the regulation of transcription and trafﬁcking of SGLT1 in the intestine is the regulatory gene RS1 (98, 101, 232, 233). In RS10 null mice, SGLT1 was upregulated and the mice became obese, apparently due to an increase in insertion of SGLT1 vesicles from the trans-Golgi network. B. Intestinal Absorption The currently accepted dogma is that glucose and galactose absorption occurs across mature enterocytes in two stages: the ﬁrst is the uphill accumulation of these hexoses across the brush-border membrane by SGLT1, and the second is the downhill transport from the cell into FIG. 34.

Soon after the cloning of SGLT1 from the rabbit small intestine, it was shown using both Western blotting and immunocytochemistry that the protein is only expressed in the brush-border membrane (70, 209). The NH2-terminal domain of SGLT1 (amino acids 1–19) appears to detemine the targeting of the protein to the brush-border membrane (207). There was some su- pranuclear positive staining in the enterocytes on the mid-villus region consistent with the biosynthetic path- way. Immunostaining of the human brush border is shown in Figure 36A. Perhaps the most deﬁnitive evidence for the role of SGLT1 in sugar transport across the human brush-border membrane came from studies of the disorder glucose galactose malabsorption (see below), the result of muta- tions in the SGLT1 gene. Figure 36B shows immunocyto- chemical location of SGLT1 in the patient with a C292Y mutation on both alleles. In the duodenal biopsy, the C292Y-SGLT1 protein was trapped between the nucleus and the brush-border membrane (Fig. 36B). Studies of the mutant protein expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes also showed that there is no Na\u0001/glucose cotransport and that a trafﬁcking defect prevents insertion of the mutant pro- tein into the plasma membrane (142). Although GLUT2 is expressed in the basolateral membrane of enterocytes, the role of this protein in glu- cose absorption is unclear based on studies of GLUT2\u0003/\u0003 mice and patients with the Fanconi Bickel Syndrome (FBS), caused by mutations in GLUT2 (189, 206). Oral glucose tolerance tests were normal in both GLUT2\u0003/\u0003 knockout mice and FBS patients and cAMP increased glucose absorption equally well in wild-type and GLUT2- null mice. In addition, in vivo experiments in rats showed that \u0001MDG was absorbed across the intestine with kinet- ics similar to D-glucose and D-galactose (31) despite the fact that \u0001MDG is not a substrate for GLUT2 (252). This suggests that a mechanism other than facilitated diffusion through GLUT2 is responsible for exit from the enterocyte. One yet-to-be explained result was the ﬁnding that absorp- tion of 3-O-methyl-D-glucoside was abnormal in the GLUT2\u0003/\u0003 mice (206). These observations on GLUT2\u0003/\u0003 mice and FBS patients raise doubts about the popular hypothesis that GLUT2 plays an important role in the regulation of glucose absorption across the intestine (see Ref. 89). A central tenet of this hypothesis is that in response to a glucose meal, GLUT2 is redirected into the brush-bor- der membrane to account for the increase in sugar absorption. This is inconsistent with normal glucose absorption and regulation by cAMP in GLUT2-null mice and normal glucose absorption in FBS patients. There was a fundamental ﬂaw in the design of Kellett’s exper- FIG. 35. Model for glucose and galactose transport across entero- cytes. Glucose (and galactose) is accumulated within the cell from the gut lumen by SGLT1 in the brush-border membrane. The energy for uphill sugar transport is provided by the sodium electrochemical poten- tial gradient across the brush-border membrane. The two sodium ions that enter the cell with each sugar molecule are pumped out across the basolateral membrane by the Na \u0001-K \u0001 pump. Sugar that accumulates within the cell exits across the basolateral membrane into the blood. FIG. 36.

It has been well known that phloretin is a potent noncompetitive SGLT1 inhibitor with a Ki of 50 \u0003M, e.g., Refs. 66, 159. This means that Kelletts’s labo- ratory grossly underestimated the importance of SGLT1, and this is reinforced by the observation that glucose absorption can be totally defective in patients with mutations in SGLT1. C. Oral Rehydration Therapy Perhaps the most important medical application of SGLT1 is its critical role in the treatment of secretory diarrhea in children, the elderly, and immunocompro- mised patients. According to the World Health Organi- zation (WHO), diarrhea caused by cholera is the second leading cause of childhood mortality, killing some 1.5 million children \b5 years of age. Cholera infection causes massive diarrhea, resulting in dehydration that can lead to death unless the patient is rehydrated, which in adults may require 80 liters of intravenous ﬂuids over 5 days (73). The challenge of such heroic ﬂuid replacement to save the patient was overcome by the discovery that one could simply administer an oral rehydration solution (ORS) containing salt and glucose. The glucose in the ORS is absorbed along with two sodium ions by SGLT1 on the brush-border membrane, and water is either cotransported with the sugar and sodium, or follows by osmosis (see sect. XIIIC). We estimate that, directly or indirectly, SGLT1 can promote about 6 liters of water absorption daily in the normal adult intestine. The current WHO/UNICEF oral rehydra- tion solution contains 75 mM NaCl, 75 mM glucose, 20 mM KCl, and 10 mM sodium citrate with an osmolarity of 245 mosM, and commercial formulations in the United States and Europe are usually ﬂavored to make the solution more palatable. In the ﬁeld where ORS is not available, there are several homemade recipes that use locally available supplies of carbohydrate, see, http://rehydrate.org. In all cases, the ORS is designed to increase intestinal salt, sugar, and water absorption to match or exceed the secretory diarrhea caused by the toxin (see Fig. 35). Since the ﬁrst successful clinical trials of ORT in 1968 at the Cholera Research Laboratory in Dhaka (74, 171), the number of deaths has decreased dramatically, and this therapy has been extended to even include diarrhea caused by other pathogens, including rotavi- rus, E. coli, and Yersinia infections (179) in both de- veloped and underdeveloped counties worldwide. In 1978, an editorial in the British medical journal The Lancet (2: 300 –301) hailed ORT as the “most important medical advance of this (20th) century.” Readers inter- ested in the historical steps and missteps in the devel- opment of oral rehydration therapy are referred to the review by Ruxin (186). D. Glucose Galactose Malabsorption GGM was ﬁrst described in two reports in 1962 as a watery and severe diarrhea in newborn children that is fatal within weeks unless lactose, glucose, and galactose are removed from the infant’s diet (108, 119). The diarrhea ceases immediately on removing sugar and promptly re- sumes when lactose, glucose, or galactose are added back into the diet (250). It was predicted that GGM is due to a defect in the brush-border Na\u0001/glucose cotransporter. This was conﬁrmed by Eric Turk following the cloning of human SGLT1 (64, 222), when a homozygous mutation, D28N, was found in two sisters with GGM, and that each parent was a carrier for this mutation. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, the D28N SGLT1 protein was shown to be unable to transport glucose. Prenatal screening in two subse- quent pregnancies in this large consanguineous family revealed that the probands’ sibling was a carrier and a cousin did not carry the mutation (141). This study also conﬁrmed that GGM was an autosomal recessive disor- der. Patients with GGM remain intolerant of glucose and galactose for the rest of their lives, and our oldest subject, now 58, lives an apparently normal healthy life on a sugar-free diet. His blood chemistries are within normal limits, but malabsorption symptoms return immediately on ingesting food with the offending sugars. There have been a number of reports of nephrocalcinosis in GGM children (see Ref. 203). It is thought that this may arise due to hypercalcemia, metabolic acidosis, and dehydra- tion as renal tubule dysfunction, and these symptoms often resolve on removing glucose and galactose from the diet.Over 80 patients with a diagnosis of GGM have been screened for mutations in the SGLT1 gene (55, 87, 105, 140, 203, 213). The most clear diagnosis of GGM includes observations that 1) the diarrhea returns when glucose or galactose, but not fructose, is added to the diet; 2) oral glucose tolerance tests produce ﬂat blood glucose curves; and 3) positive glucose hydrogen breath tests indicate glucose malabsorption. In all but a few patients, muta- tions have been indentiﬁed in SGLT1 that cause the defect in sugar absorption (87, 142, 250). In several cases where no mutations were found, the diarrhea was found to be due to the novel disorder enteric anendocrinosis due to mutations in the neurogenin 3 gene (236). This indicates that signals from endocrine cells are required for normal absorption. 780 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. About 65% of GGM patients tested have the same mutation on each allele, and the remainder have differ- ent mutations on each allele, i.e., they are compound heterozygotes. There are only a handful of cases where the same mutation is found in unrelated families, but these families are of similar ethnic backgrounds. This may reﬂect an increase in the frequency of these vari- ants in a given population (see below). The majority of mutations are missense, but nonsense, frame shift, splice-site, and promoter mutations have also been doc- umented. The nonsense, frame shift, and splice site mutations all produce truncated proteins that are pre- dicted to be unstable and/or nonfunctional. To deter- mine whether a mutation causes an actual defect in glucose and galactose transport or is simply a polymor- phism, it is essential to measure the transport activity of the mutant protein. This has usually been carried out using the Xenopus laevis expression system (55, 87, 140, 142, 222). We have conﬁrmed that two truncated proteins, Y191X and R359X, are nonfunctional when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes (142). The mis- sense mutations are distributed throughout the protein (see Fig. 37) with no particular “hot spots.” Of the 27 mutations tested, all but 3 show dramatically reduced Na\u0001/glucose transport activity, and the most common cause is a failure in the insertion of the protein into the plasma membrane as determined from charge (Qmax) measurements, freeze-fracture electron microscopy, and/or immunohistochemistry. In several patients with these homozygous mutations, we have also found using intestinal biopsies that the transporter is not inserted into the brush-border membrane of enterocytes (see Fig. 36). There are three nonfunctional mutant proteins that are inserted into the plasma membrane, R135W, Q457R and T460P, and one of these, Q457, has been found to be important in binding sugar (38) (see Fig. 17). The residues that are mutated to produce nonfunc- tional proteins are conserved in the SGLT family of proteins (see Fig. 190 –7 in Ref. 250). Three missense mutations that did not signiﬁcantly alter the function of SGLT1, N51S, A411T, and H615Q, are not conserved in the SGLT family of proteins, but they were found at a high frequency, 9%, in the European- American population. As part of the University of Califor- nia San Francisco Pharmacogenetics of Membrane Trans- porters Project (www.pharmacognetics.ucsf.edu), we have examined 552 alleles in the Coriell Institute genomic DNA collection for variations in hSGLT1 (Fig. 38). Only 12 nonsynonymous mutations were found, and only 6 are at a frequency of \u00061%. Although these three common vari- ants were found in our pool of GGM patients, it was second mutations that produced the defect in glucose transport. None of the GGM mutations has been found in this sample of 552 alleles, as expected from the rarity of the disorder. FIG. 37. Missense mutations of SGLT1 identiﬁed in patients with GGM. The mutations are shown on a secondary structure model with the transmembrane helices from the vSGLT structure highlighted in gray.

E. Enteric Infection There is emerging evidence that upregulation of intes- tinal SGLT1 may afford protection against enteric infections. High glucose concentrations (25 mM) protected SGLT1 transfected Caco-2 cells against apoptosis induced by bac- terial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (259). Furthermore, LPS in- creased glucose transport activity in these cells. These stud- ies have been applied to Giardia duodenalis-induced apo- ptosis in this system, and extended to demonstrate that G. duodenalis proteolytic fragments increased SGLT1 expres- sion in the apical membrane (260). Arguably, the most con- vincing demonstration of the cytoprotective effects of SGLT1 was the demonstration that oral glucose gave 100% protection against lethal endotoxic shock in mice (160). Lethal endotoxic shock was induced by LPS and pretreat- ment with oral glucose, or the nonmetabolized SGLT1 sub- strate 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, resulted in 100% survival of mice against the insult. These studies suggest a novel immu- nological role for SGLT1 and new approaches to managing severe sepsis infections that result in chronic diseases such as inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD). F. Renal Reabsorption Glucose is freely ﬁltered across the renal glomerulus, amounting to 180 g·day\u00031·1.73 m\u00032 in adults (for a review, see Ref. 245). In healthy individuals, \b0.5 g/day is lost in the urine, so \u000697% of the ﬁltered load is reabsorbed. The urine remains virtually free of glucose within the normal range of blood (plasma) glucose levels (4 –10 mM), but as the plasma concentration exceeds \u000714 mM, glucose ap- pears in the urine and above 20 mM the excretion in- creases in proportion to the ﬁltered load. In other words, the reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular ﬁltrate saturates at \u0007425 g/day with an apparent Km of \u000710 mM. The most common cause of glucose in the urine of pa- tients is due to the high blood glucose levels associated with diabetes. Micropuncture studies of frog and rat nephrons have demonstrated that the glomerular ﬁltrate is glucose-free when it reached the end of the proximal tubule (Fig. 39, A and B). Microperfusion experiments with isolated nephrons from rabbits established that ac- tive glucose reabsorption occurs in the “early” convoluted proximal tubule via a low-afﬁnity (Km 2 mM) high-capac- FIG. 38.

Further evidence for two transport systems in the human kidney came from brush-border membrane vesicle experiments where there was a hint of low- and high- afﬁnity Na\u0001/glucose cotransport systems. Additional stud- ies on brush-border membranes from the outer cortex and outer medulla of rabbit kidney provided additional sup- port for two different SGLTs: one in the outer cortex had a glucose Km of 6 mM and one in the outer medulla with a Km of 0.3 mM, and the low-afﬁnity one was more sen- sitive to phlorizin than the high-afﬁnity one. These two transporters have come to be called SGLT2 and SGLT1 (245) (Fig. 39), and their properties are in close agree- ment with those of the cloned SGLT1 and SGLT2 proteins (Table 1) (81). The cellular mechanism of renal glucose reabsorp- tion is shown in Figure 39C. The two-step process is similar to that in enterocytes with uphill transport across the brush border into the epithelium and downhill facili- tated diffusion from the cell into the blood across the basolateral membrane. Antibodies against the cloned rab- bit SGLT1 were used to examine the location of SGLT1 in the rat kidney (22, 210), and it was found that the protein was present in the brush-border membrane of all three segments of the proximal tubule. This has been conﬁrmed recently with another antibody (4). In proximal tubule, GLUT1 was only found in the basolateral membrane of the S3 segment (210). Basolateral GLUT2 colocalizes in cortical tubules expressing brush-border SGLT1 (22). Im- munohistochemistry localized SGLT2 to the brush border of the early proximal tubule in mice, and this was absent in SGLT2\u0003/\u0003 animals (227). The SGLT2\u0003/\u0003 mice exhib- ited glucosuria, and free-ﬂow micropuncture studies showed that there was no glucose reabsorption in the early proximal tubule. Unlike the small intestine, GLUT2 is very important in the normal reabsorption of glucose in the kidney, as patients with FBS exhibit massive renal glucosuria (244). Those patients who have a homozygous premature stop codon in the GLUT2 gene had a renal glycosuria of up to 200 g/day. This indicates that GLUT2 is the major baso- lateral glucose transporter involved in the reabsorption of the glucose ﬁltered load. Basolateral GLUT1 and GLUT2 are also involved in the entry and exit of glucose into other segments of the nephron, e.g., in the release of glucose produced by gluconeogenesis. Mutations in brush-border SGLT1 and SGLT2 also cause renal glucosuria, but in the case of SGLT1, the glucosuria that accompanies GGM is mild, e.g., one pa- tient with severe SGLT1 mutations (G426R and S159P) lost only 1.5 g glucose/day in the urine (244). G. Familial Renal Glucosuria This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder where glucose is excreted into the urine, \u00061 g/day, when blood glucose levels and oral glucose tolerance tests are normal (244). There are no other renal abnormalities, even when the glucose excretion exceeds 100 g/day, and there are no other systemic consequences. In the case of one patient with severe renal glucosuria (\u0006109 g/day), who was re- evaluated 20 years after glucosuria was ﬁrst detected, there were no chronic nephrological complications (194). Table 6 contains a summary of the glucosuria and the SGLT2 muta- tions in ﬁve patients with severe FRG (13, 190, 244). Glucose excretion ranges from 1 to 162 g·1.73 m\u00032·day\u00031, and the mutations are those expected for an FIG. 39. Glucose reabsorption from the proximal tubule. A: anatomical arrangement of a kidney nephron with its blood supply. B: summary of the results of micropuncture experiments to measure the glucose concentration as ﬂuid ﬂows freely along the tubule from the glomerulus (244). C: a model for glucose reabsorption across the epithelium of the proximal tubule. Similar to that in enterocytes (Fig. 34), the Na \u0001 electrochemical potential gradient provides the energy source, and transport across the epithelium occurs in two steps. Glucose is transported across the apical membrane by SGLT1 and SGLT2. SGLT2 is predominantly located in the S1 and S2 segments and SGLT1 is in S3. GLUT2 is the major glucose transporter across the basolateral membrane.

So far, none of the FRG mutations has been tested for functional SGLT2 effects, due to the low expression of SGLT2 in heterolo- gous expression systems, so it is difﬁcult to relate the mutations to the severity of the glucosuria. However, it is noteworthy that 1) in subjects with severely truncated proteins, one excretes most of the ﬁltered load (374X) while two others reabsorb about half of the ﬁltered load (W440X and Y128X) (Table 6); and 2) there is a huge discrepancy in the glucosuria between two siblings with the same mutations. In subject 15–1, the glucose excre- tion is 202 g·1.73 m\u00032·day\u00031, while in subject 15–2 it is only 80 g·1.73 m\u00032·day\u00031. This, combined with the 50% inhibition of glucose reabsorption by SGLT2 inhibitors (95), suggests that SGLT2 may not be solely responsible for glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Phlorizin is known to inhibit reabsorption completely (16), and this points to the involvement of another SGLT. It is un- likely this is SGLT1, as the data suggest this transporter accounts for \b10% of the normal amount absorbed. Another possibility is SGLT5, expressed exclusively in the renal cortex (Table 1). SGLT2 mutations found in subjects with FRG are shown on a secondary structure model in Figure 40. These are distributed throughout the protein in both transmembrane domains and hydrophilic loops, and none is at the predicted sugar or Na\u0001 coordination sites, al- though F453L is at a predicted outer gate residue (see above). Several SGLT2 mutations occur in similar loca- tions to GGM mutations in SGLT1, e.g., R137H, R300C, G304K, and R499H (Fig. 37). While the effect of mutations on SGLT2 function has not yet been reported, we note that in SGLT1 mutations at R135W, R300S, A304V, and R499H produce defects in glucose transport, largely through trafﬁcking problems (142, 250). The truncated SGLT2 proteins, 128X, 186X, 347X, and 440X, are not expected to produce stable functional proteins. TABLE 6.

[Modiﬁed from Wright (244).] 784 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. In summary, SGLTs play a major role in salvaging glu- cose from the glomerular ﬁltrate to avoid loss of this nutri- ent to the urine. However, in terms of renal function, this is not deemed essential as subjects with the rare disorder known as FRG do not have any chronic kidney complica- tions, nor do they become hypoglycemic. This has encour- aged the pharmaceutical industry to develop SGLT2 inhibi- tors to lower blood glucose levels in diabetics (see below). H. Bile, Milk, and Saliva It has long been known that glucose enters the bile in the liver and then is reabsorbed in the interhepatic bile ducts by SGLT1 in the apical membrane and GLUT1 in the basolateral membrane of cholangiocytes (111). This was conﬁrmed in studies of glucose transport in microperfused rat intrahepatic bile ducts and further demonstrated that glucose transport was accompanied by water transport (144). In vivo it was reported that as the rate of glucose absorption increased there was a reduction in bile ﬂow, and when glucose absorption was inhibited by phlorizin, the bile ﬂow increased. This relationship between glucose and bile ﬂow may con- tribute to the low bile ﬂow, and associated symptoms such as jaundice, in diabetes. Glucose supply to the lactating mammary gland is important in providing energy and as precursor for lac- tose production and secretion. It has been argued that glucose transporters in the basolateral membrane of mammary epithelia are essential for milk production. The expression of glucose transporters in the human lactating mammary gland was examined in a novel manner by Obermeier et al. (155) when they examined the genes expressed in epithelial cells isolated from fresh milk. They found SGLT1 mRNA by RT-PCR and SGLT1 protein by Western Blot analysis, but did not ﬁnd GLUT1. SGLT1 mRNA and protein was also found in rat lactating mam- mary gland tissue (198). A more complete analysis of glucose transporter gene expression has been reported for the bovine mammary gland (266). The largest increase in expression, from \u000340 to \u00017 days after parturition, was for GLUT1 and GLUT8 (10- to 100-fold), while there were more modest increases in SGLT1 and SGLT2 expression. At this time, we are unaware of any studies on the distri- bution of the SGLTs and GLUTs between the apical and basolateral membranes. Likewise, we are unaware of any mammary gland phenotype in women with severe muta- tions in SGLT1 (GGM) or SGLT2 (FRG). There has been an increasing awareness of oral health complications in diabetes and the possible in- volvement of the salivary glands (187). Impaired sali- vary gland function has been reported in diabetes, in- cluding low rates of ﬂow and high glucose concentra- tions. SGLT1 was ﬁrst reported to be expressed in the basolateral membrane of sheep parotid glands (212) and more recently in the apical membrane of interca- lated ducts of the rat submandibular gland (4). We have also found SGLT1 in the apical membrane of human sublingual glands (Hirayama and Wright, unpublished data). What is the functional signiﬁcance of SGLT1 expression in salivary glands, glucose secretion by the acinar cells, and glucose reabsorption in the ducts? It is possible that glucose reabsorption from the duct oc- curs by a two-stage process, i.e., apical Na\u0001/glucose cotransport through SGLT1 followed by downhill trans- port across the basolateral membrane through a GLUT; this should be tested in microperfusion studies on iso- lated ducts from control and diabetic animals. Again, it would be informative to evaluate salivary secretion in subjects with GGM and with FRG. I. Cancer Glucose is a major source of energy, and the demand for glucose in cancer cells is even higher than normal cells. This is the basis for the detection and staging of tumors using 2FDG (see sect. VC). However, some tumors do not accumulate 2FDG, a substrate for GLUTs but not SGLTs, increasing interest in the expression of SGLTs in cancer. Inspection of the EST databases (www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/unigene) indicates that SGLT1 is expressed in colorectal, head and neck, and prostate tumors, and SGLT2 is expressed in colorectal, gastrointestinal, head and neck, and kidney tumors as well as in chondrosar- comas and leukemia. There are a handful of publica- tions on the mRNA levels of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and immunohistochemistry of SGLT1 in primary tumors, and metastatic lesions of lung, pancreatic adenocarci- nomas, and head and neck cancers (65, 84). SGLT1 was expressed in well-differentiated squamous cultures of head and neck carcinomas, SGLT2 was expressed in metastatic lesions of lung cancers, and SGLT1 protein was reported to be expressed in primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas (14). We were unable to detect spe- ciﬁc SGLT1 expression in several samples of other tumors (lung, liver, testis, sarcomas, breast, colon, prostate, and squamous cell carcinomas of the mouth). No antibodies are yet available to screen for other SGLTs in these and other tumors. Recently, an intriguing role for SGLT1 in the survival of cancer cells was postulated where epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) stabilizes SGLT1 to prevent au- tophagic cell death (239). This may explain the resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A novel strategy has also been proposed to deliver chemotherapeutic agents into tumor cells through SGLTs. This involves covalently linking a nitro- gen mustard reagent to D-glucose though the \u0002-C1-OH BIOLOGY OF HUMAN SODIUM GLUCOSE TRANSPORTERS 785 Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. group, e.g., \u0002-D-glucosylisphosphoramide mustard (glu- fosfamide). These drugs are currently in phase I and II trials for pancreatic adenocarcinomas and other solid tumors (19, 200). J. Diabetes This chronic disease is a disorder of glucose homeo- stasis where blood glucose levels greatly exceed the nor- mal levels, \u0006\u000610 mM, and there is reduction in insulin secretion and/or sensitivity. If the hyperglycemia is left untreated, it results in glucose toxicity, which damages blood vessels and peripheral nerves, leading to blindness, kidney failure, peripheral neuropathy, cardiovascular dis- ease, and other serious complications. It is estimated that (25 million) patients have diabetes, close to 10% of the adult population in the United States, and the number is growing at an alarming rate. One of the earliest symptoms is a loss of glucose to the urine due to hyperglycemia overwhelming the reabsorption capacity of SGLTs in the proximal tubule (see sect. IXD). Current therapies to combat this disease are centered on controlling blood glucose levels by increasing insulin secretion, improving insulin sensitivity, and reducing liver glucose output and intestinal glucose absorption. As the disease progresses, patients require combinations of medicines and, unfortu- nately, adverse side effects compromise compliance and the health of the patient. There is a growing interest in alternative therapies to manage diabetic patients, and one is to control blood glucose by inhibiting SGLT2 in the kidney. The pharma- ceutical industry has been encouraged by 1) studies dem- onstrating that intravenous phlorizin decreased blood glu- cose levels without producing hypoglycemia in diabetic animals, and this was accompanied by an improvement in insulin resistance (185); 2) reports that FRG is a benign disorder with no long-term renal abnormalities (see sect. IXE); and 3) cloning of the “renal” SGLTs enabling in vitro studies (see above). The strategy has been to de- velop oral SGLT2 inhibitors. Oral phlorizin does not ﬁt the bill as it blocks gastrointestinal absorption of glucose and thus produces osmotic diarrhea. Furthermore, phlorizin is hydrolyzed to glucose and phloretin by the intestinal brush-border lactase-hydrolase, so little of the intact mol- ecule is absorbed. The proof of concept for SGLT2 targeted therapy was provided by Oku et al. (156) who demonstrated that a prodrug, T-1095, was absorbed from the gut into the cir- culation; this resulted in renal glucose excretion in dia- betic animals and lowered blood glucose levels. T1095 also suppressed postprandial hyperglycemia and reduced hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia in diabetic ro- dents. In the decade since, there have been at least 21 SGLT2 inhibitors that entered the drug pipeline. Most have exploited the same chemical space as phlorizin (see sect. VIIIC), and many of these compounds are in phase I to III clinical trials. To cite one example, we focus on the C-aryl glucoside dapagliﬂozin (Fig. 19). This drug had a SGLT2 inhibitor constant (EC50) of 1 nM and a selectivity of \u00071,200 for SGLT2 over SGLT1 (237). Safety studies of dapagliﬂozin in healthy human sub- jects (95) indicated that the drug is well tolerated with minimal adverse events and no clinically relevant changes in vital signs relative to the placebo controls. The drug is rapidly absorbed with plasma levels reaching a maximum 2 h after oral administration and thereafter falling with a half-time of 17–18 h; unlike the O-glucosides, the C-aryl- glucosides are resistant to glucosidases. Ninety-seven per- cent of the drug stays bound to plasma proteins, and this probably accounts for the low renal clearance and urinary excretion. There was a dose-dependent excretion of glu- cose in urine up to a maximum of 60 – 80 grams/24 h, i.e., 50% inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption, and this persists with daily oral dosing for 2 wk. In these healthy volunteers, there was no reduction in serum glucose or insulin. The maximum reduction in glucose reabsorption of \u000750% is surprising since dapagliﬂozin inhibits SGLT2 completely in vitro (see sect. VIIIC). This is probably related to the fact that in vivo 97% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins and \b2% of the injected dose is recov- ered in the urine. Phase II clinical trials with type 2 diabetic patients for 2–12 wk and phase III trials for up to 24 wk have been reported (51, 96, 120). In general, the highest doses of dapagliﬂozin produce a sustained 30 – 65 g/day urinary glucose excretion, a 22 \u0004 10% reduction in fasting serum glucose, and a 20 \u0004 10% reduction in postprandial glucose absorption (area under the plasma glucose concentration curve). The loss of urinary glucose, 200 –300 kcal/day, results in weight loss (up to 2.5 kg), increases in urine volume (up to 470 ml/day) and hematocrit (up to 3%), and an associated modest reduction in diastolic blood pres- sure of 2–5 mmHg. The results so far suggest that anti- SGLT2 inhibitors may be useful in reaching the goals for low glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients and re- ducing glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb A1C) levels to \b7%. According to these reports, the dapagliﬂozin treatment for up to 24 wk produces no remarkable clinical side effects relative to the placebo controls, as expected from the long-term follow up with one patient with massive FRG (194). In summary, the pharmaceutical industry has in a remarkably short time advanced the proof of concept of SGLT2 inhibitors for managing hyperglycemia in dia- betic patients to phase III clinical trials. Only time will tell if these novel drugs will be effective and safe in patients. 786 WRIGHT, LOO, AND HIRAYAMA Physiol Rev • VOL 91 • APRIL 2011 • www.prv.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/physrev (102.039.110.037) on November 20, 2023. XV. OUTLOOK To gain perspective into the future, we look at the past and ask: what have we learned since 1987? First, SGLT1 was the initial member of a new gene family of 12 members, SLC5, only 4 of which are glucose transporters. Second, it was discovered that GGM and FRG, rare autosomal defects in glucose transport, are the result of mutations in SGLT1 and SGLT2. Third, in addi- tion to the intestine and kidney, SGLT1 and -2 are widely distributed in the body, including brain, salivary glands, lactating mammary gland, and bile ducts. Fourth, SGLTs are multifunctional proteins behaving as Na\u0001/glucose cotransporters, water and urea channels, glucose sensors, and coupled water and urea transporters. Fifth, an eight- state ordered kinetic model accounts quantitatively for the observed steady-state kinetics of SGLT1. Sixth, SGLT proteins can be overexpressed, puriﬁed, and reconsti- tuted in liposomes for biochemical and functional studies. Seventh, SGLTs belong to a structural family of transport- ers in different gene families with common transport mechanisms. Eighth, the x-ray structure of vSGLT, and related Na\u0001 cotransporters, has begun to allow us to explain Na\u0001/sugar cotransport at an atomic level. Ninth, the SGLTs are now drug targets for the treatment of chronic diseases, e.g., SGLT2 inhibitors to control blood glucose in diabetes. XVI. UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS Starting with our need to integrate structure and function, we must obtain high-resolution structures of human SGLTs to 1) identify the second Na\u0001 binding site in those transporters where the Na\u0001/sugar coupling coef- ﬁcient is 2. This together with being able to parse out the kinetics of Na\u0001 binding to each site will enable one to understand both the fast transporter kinetics, a major limitation with existing models, and how Na\u0001 binding alters transporter structure. 2) We must identify the origin of the “gating charge” of these transporters and unlock the origin of the voltage dependence of sugar transport. 3) We must determine the structure in different confor- mation states, e.g., Na\u0001 free, Na\u0001 bound, and inhibitor bound. This will provide more frames in the movie to understand the whole catalytic cycle. 4) We must resolve the structure of SGLTs with high-afﬁnity inhibitors bound. This may explain the selectivity differences between SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitors. 5) We must identify differ- ences in structure between hSGLT1 and hSGLT3 to let us know why hSGLT3 is a glucose sensor and not a glucose transporter. In addition, this may identify the gate that prevents sugar exit to the cytoplasm in hSGLT3 and the link coupling sugar and Na\u0001 in SGLT1. 6) High-resolution structures will indentify the pathway for water and urea through the transporters. The second challenge is to understand substrate speciﬁcity, kinetics, and function of the poorly under- stood SGLT4 and SGLT5 given the hints we already have about their unique sugar speciﬁcity and/or expression proﬁle. There is also a need to clarify the regulation of expression and function of alternatively spliced variants. A third challenge is the physiology of SGLTs in di- verse locations throughout the body. For example, 1)in the brain we need to determine why SGLTs are function- ally expressed in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and hypothalamus (258). Surely it is not to provide glucose to neurons as they are amply endowed with GLUTs. Are the SGLTs acting as glucose sensors or water channels in these cells of the brain? 2) There are large gaps in our understanding of the mechanism of milk secretion in the lactating mammary gland. Are the SGLTs expressed in the gland on the basolateral membrane to provide glucose and galactose for lactose synthesis, or are the SGLTs important for water secretion? 3) Similar questions arise about the role of SGLTs in glucose secretion and absorp- tion in salivary glands and interhepatic bile ducts. 4) What is the signiﬁcance of reported SGLT gene expression in the heart, lung, muscle, testis, ovary, pancreas, and pros- tate? These questions are not just of physiological signif- icance but are of vital interest in the pathophysiology of glucose homeostasis and the upcoming introduction of SGLT2 inhibitors to control blood glucose levels in dia- betics. It seems to us that we have just addressed the tip of the iceberg about the biology of human SGLTs, and we look forward to the entry of new investigators into this ﬁeld. NOTE ADDED IN PROOF Further insight into the transport mechanism comes from our recent study using molecular dynamics, bio- chemistry, and a second crystal structure of vSGLT (238). In essence, it is postulated that the conformational change responsible for the transition from the outward to inward occluded states (C3 to C4) is a rigid body move- ment where the “hash” (TM3, 4, 8, and 9) and “sugar” bundles (TM 2, 6, and 7) rotate by 3° in the opposite direction. This results in a displacement of TM8 by 4 Å, and along with 13° kink in the inner half of TM1, that loosens the Na2 site such that Na\u0001 leaves to the cyto- plasm within 9 ns. This exit causes a disruption in the H-bond between Try-263 and Asn-64 permitting the Try- 263 side chain to assume a transient rotomer position within 50 –100 ns allowing sugar to escape into the inter- nal hydrophilic vestibule. Moreover, the rigid body move- ments of the hash and sugar bundles increase the volume of the vestibule by 1,400 Å3, allowing free exit of the sugar to the cytoplasm.
