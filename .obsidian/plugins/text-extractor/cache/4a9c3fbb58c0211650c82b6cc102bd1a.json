Overview of Regions of the Lower Limb • The lower limb is divided into the • Gluteal region (the buttocks) • The thigh region • The Knee region • The leg region • The ankle region • The foot region • The lower limb is formed by the following joints • The hip joint • The Knee joint • Tibio-fibular joints • Ankle joints Region Bones Joints Gluteal region Hip bone Sacrum & Coccyx Sacroiliac joint Thigh Femur and patella Hip joint Knee joint Leg Tibia Fibular Tibiofibular joints Ankle joint Foot Tarsals (7) Metatarsals (5) Phalanges (14) Intertarsal joints Intermetatarsal joints Metatarsophalangeal joints Interphalangeal joints Overview of the Lower Limb Gluteal Region Gluteal Region • The gluteal region lies on the back and side of the pelvis and has two parts. • The buttock posterior region which is bounded • Superiorly: iliac crest • Inferiorly: by the gluteal fold. • Medially: the intergluteal cleft, and inferiorly The bulk of it forms the gluteal muscles. • The hip region • It is less prominent • It covers the hip joint and greater trochanter of the ©https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/gluteal-region/ Surface Markings • Buttock: • It is a round bulge on the posterior aspect of the gluteal region. • Gluteal fold: • It is a transverse skin crease, which forms the lower limit of the gluteal region. It is produced by a linear adherence of the skin to the deep fascia, obliquely across the inferior border of gluteus maximus. • Natal cleft: • It is a midline cleft between the two buttocks, which begins at the level of third spine of the sacrum and deepens inferiorly with lower sacral spines and coccyx lying in its floor. • Coccyx: • It lies just behind the anal orifice and can be identified by its relative mobility under pressure. • Posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS): • It lies in a skin dimple at the level of second sacral (S2) spine. • Ischial tuberosity: • It is a rounded bony mass on which one sits. • It is found on the same vertical plane below the PSIS. • Tip of greater trochanter: • It lies just in front of hollow on the side of hip, about one hand’s breadth below the tubercle of iliac crest. • Iliac crest: • It is a curved bony ridge • A straight line between its highest point corresponds to the interval between the spines of L3 and L4 vertebrae. • It serves as landmark for lumbar puncture is performed Moore - Clinically Oriented Anatomy 7th Ed Moore - Clinically Oriented Anatomy 7th Ed Fascia of the Gluteal Region • The superficial fascia • It is thick and contains abundant subcutaneous fat particularly in adult females • This fat is responsible for a characteristic round contour of the buttock in them. Fascia of the Gluteal Region • The deep fascia • Attached above to the iliac crest and behind to the sacrum. • It splits twice along the iliac crest, firstly to enclose the tensor fasciae latae (TFL) and second time to enclose the g. maximus. • It forms the gluteal aponeurosis between TFL and g. maximus. • The g. maximus is the most fasculated muscle in the body and this is as a result of the gluteal aponeurosis which traverses it. • The deep fascia continues laterally as the iliotibial tract. Cutaneous Nerves of the Gluteal Region • The cutaneous nerves converge on the gluteal region from all directions and could be divided into four quadrants: • Upper anterior part: • By the lateral cutaneous branches of the subcostal T12 and iliohypogastric LI nerves. • Upper posterior part: • By the posterior primary rami of spinal nerves LI, L2, L3 and SI, S2, S3. Cutaneous Nerves of the Gluteal Region • Lower anterior part: • By the posterior division of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh (L2, L3). • Lower posterior part • By the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh (SI, S2, S3) and the perforating cutaneous nerve (S2, S3).

Innervation of the Gluteal region- Sacral Plexus • The sacral plexus is a network of nerves formed by the lumbosacral trunk (L4, L5) and anterior rami of sacral spinal nerves (S1 - S4). • The plexus is found on the posterior wall of the pelvis, where it lies • anterior to the piriformis muscle. • posterior to the internal iliac vessels and ureter Innervation of the Gluteal region- Sacral Plexus • The plexus gives off numerous branches including • the anterior, posterior branches which provide motor and sensory innervation for • part of the pelvis • the posterior thigh • most of the lower leg • the entire foot Nerves of the Gluteal Region • Superior gluteal nerve. • Inferior gluteal nerve. • Sciatic nerve • Posterior cutaneous nerve of thigh. • Nerve to quadratus femoris. • Pudendal nerve. • Nerve to obturator internus. • Perforating cutaneous nerve.
