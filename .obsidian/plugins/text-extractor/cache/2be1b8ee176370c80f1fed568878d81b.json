Identify this bone and the features Numbered 1-13 (7 marks) Answer: Bone is Humerus 1 Greater tubercle 8 Capitulum 2 Lesser tubercle 9 Trochlea 3 Radial fossa 10 Medial epicondyle 4 Head 11 Coronoid fossa 5 Anatomical neck 12 Lateral epicondyle 6 Surgical neck 13 Olecranon fossa 7 Deltoid tuberosity B. Name the nerves that are in direct contact with No 6 and 10 (1 mark) Answers: No. 6 is Axillary nerve. No 10 is Ulnar nerve Elbow Joint • Classification: synovial • Type: Hinge • Articulating bones: – trochlea and trochear notch • Synovial membrane: – Encloses the prox. radioulnar jt. • Articular capsule: – Broad but thin antly. and encloses prox. radioulnar jt • Ligaments – Radial collateral blends with anular lig. And taut during flexion – Ulnar collateral is triangular. Ant band is strongest **Audio error: Articular capsule and not articular disc Elbow Joint • Vascular supply: – periarticular anastomosis • Innervation: – mainly musculocutaneous • Movement: Uniaxial jt – Flexion and Extension • Muscle producing movements: • Flexion: – brachialis, biceps brachii and brachioradialis • Extension: – triceps brachii, anconeus (and gravity) Bursae: • Intratendinous • Subtendinous (deep olecranon) • Subcutaneous (superficial olecranon) Injuries - Olecranon cyst (student’s elbow) - Nursemaid’s elbow: subluxation of elbow Proximal Radioulnar Joint • Synovial • Pivot • Radial head and radial notch (of ulnar) • Synovial membrane and articular capsule are continuous with the elbow jt. • Ligaments: – Annular: strong and encircles the radial head • Movements and muscles producing movements: Rotation of head of radius in – Pronation: pronator quadratus & pronator teres – Supination: supinator & biceps brachii Distal Radioulnar Joint • Synovial • Pivot joint • Articulations: ulnar head, articular disc & ulnar notch • Articular cartilage- fibrocartilage • Ligaments: • Ulnar collateral ligament, • dorsal and palmar radioulnar • ulnolunate and ulnotriquetral • Movements: • Rotation of head of ulnar in pronation & supination • Muscles producing movements: • Pronation: pronator quadratus & pronator teres • Supination: supinator & biceps brachii • Factors stabilizing the joints: • anular lig., interosseous membrane/lig, ulnar collateral lig Anterior (Flexor) Compartment  Muscles: ◦ Biceps brachii ◦ Coracobrachialis ◦ Brachialis  Vessel: ◦ Brachial artery & vein  Nerve: ◦ Musculocutaneous nerve 9 Biceps Brachii  Origin is proximal (scapula): ◦ Short head: coracoid process ◦ Long head: supraglenoid tubercle  Insertion is distal (radius):  Radial tuberosity + bicipital aponeurosis that attaches to the deep fascia of forearm  Nerve: ◦ Musculocutaneous nerve  Action: ◦ Flex elbow, supinate forearm, weak arm flexor, bicipital aponeurosis reinforces wall of cubital fossa 10 Coracobrachialis & Brachialis Coracobrachialis: Coracoid process of scapula to middle third of shaft of humerus - Distinguishing feature: pierced by the musculocutaneous nerve Brachialis: Distal half of ant surface of humerus to coronoid process & ulnar tuberosity Nerve supply Musculocutaneous nerve - Brachialis: double (musculocutaneous and radial nerves) innervation in about 75% of population Actions  Coracobrachialis: Flexor of arm at glenohumeral joint  Brachialis: Flexor of forearm at elbow Posterior (Extensor) compartment  Muscles: ◦ Triceps ◦ Anconeus  Vessel: ◦ Profunda brachii  Nerve supply: ◦ Radial nerve 12 Triceps  Origin- 3 heads ◦ long head from infraglenoid tubercle of scapula. It lies medial. ◦ Lateral & medial heads from posterior shaft of humerus • Insertion  Common tendon at the olecranon process of ulna • Action:  extend forearm, assist adduction of arm • Nerve: Radial nerve * 13 Anconeus  Origin- Anconeus is triangular. Arises from the lateral epicondyle • Insertion Anconeus: fibers diverge medially to attach on lateral aspect of olecranon • Action:  Assist triceps in extending the elbow joint • Nerve: Radial nerve 14 15 Musculocutaneous nerve - terminal branch of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus (C5, C6 and C7) - Pierces the coracobrachialis muscle - Supplies all the muscles in the anterior compartment of arm - Pierces the deep fascia to become cutaneous Branches Muscular branches Lateral cutaneous nerve of forearm 16 Radial Nerve http://emedicine.medscape.com/ - Terminal continuation of the post cord (C5 – T1) - Lies posterior to the axillary artery - Exits the axilla via the triangular interval - Lies in the radial groove and accompanied by the profunda brachii artery - Supplies triceps and anconeus - Enters the cubital fossa by running ant. to lat epicondyle before giving rise to two branches • Deep br. (motor) – innervates muscles in the post. compartment of the forearm • Superficial br. (sensory) – contributes to the cutaneous innervation of the dorsal hand and fingers Brachial Artery  Origin ◦ Direct continuation of axillary artery at lower border of teres major muscle  End ◦ Neck of radius medial to biceps tendon ◦ Divides into radial & ulnar arteries Branches of Brachial Artery  Deep artery of arm (profunda brachii) ◦ spiral groove with radial nerve to triceps  Muscular branches  Nutrient to humerus  Superior ulnar collateral (runs with ulnar nerve; anastomosis around elbow)  Inferior ulnar collateral (anastomosis around elbow)  Radial & middle collateral (from the deep brachii a; anastomosis around elbow)  Radial  Ulnar Audio error: Radial and ulnar arteries supply structures in the forearm and hand not forearm and arm Deep Vein of the Arm  Paired brachial veins ◦ accompanying brachial artery ◦ Receives tributaries that accompany the branches of the brachial artery  Two large subcutaneous veins ◦ Basilic vein: lies vertical in the distal half of the arm, penetrates deep fascia to lie medial to the brachial artery. Becomes the axillary vein at the lower border of teres major. The paired brachial veins join the basilic (or axillary) vein. ◦ Cephalic vein: passes superiorly on the anterolateral aspect. Passes through the ant wall of the axilla to reach the axillary vein. 19 Boundaries: Lateral: Brachioradialis Medial: Pronator teres Base: Imaginary line between medial & lateral epicondyles of humerus Floor: Brachialis & Supinator Roof: Skin, superficial & deep fasciae, reinforced by bicipital aponeurosis Cubital Fossa Shape: triangular with apex pointing distal Contents: Superficial Median cubital vein Medial cutaneous nerve of forearm Upper lateral cutaneous nerve of forearm Median cubital vein  For venepuncture & intravenous injections a. Fixed by perforating communicating vein b. Provides a direct and fast link to the heart via the axillary vein and then the subclavian vein. 22 Contents: Deep  Median nerve  Biceps brachii tendon  Radial nerve deep to brachioradialis 23  Brachial artery  Radial & Ulnar arteries  Radial recurrent artery Questions  What is the nerve supply and actions of the muscles of the anterior (or posterior) compartment of the arm?  Which structures are supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve?  Which structures are supplied by the radial nerve?  List the branches of the brachial artery  Describe the boundaries of the cubital fossa and list the contents.  Describe the elbow joint and the proximal radioulnar joint. 24 Thank you!!!! 25","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
