PROTEINS a) proteolysis, deamination b) oxidation of amino acids Metabolism Terminology Catabolic pathways The step-wise synthesis of complex molecules from smaller, simpler units. Energy is consumed and stored for later use. • Anabolic pathways: build up larger molecules from smaller ones, using chemical energy. • The major anabolic pathways include o glycogen synthesis o gluconeogenesis o fatty acid synthesis o lipogenesis o protein synthesis Processes in metabolism b) anabolic processes Overview of metabolic processes - catabolism and anabolism Glycogen Triacylglycerols (TAGs) Proteins Glucose-6-phopshate Fatty acids (FAs) Amino acids Acetyl-CoA Pyruvate Glycogenolysis Lipolysis Proteolysis Deamination and oxidation β-oxidationGlycolysis Gluconeogenesis Glycogen synthesis Glycogenesis Lipogenesis Protein synthesis FA synthesis Catabolic processes Anabolic processes Energy generation TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation Energy conversion from food in each and every cell • ATP is the key energy source – nitrogenous base, ribose sugar and phosphate – may be other nucleotide triphosphates such as uridine – two high-energy bonds that provide energy • for anabolic processes • energy-consuming processes (e.g. muscle contraction) • atpase pumps in cell walls (insulin is required to produce ATP) 1 ATP Energy carrying molecules Nitrogenous base, ribose sugar and phosphates a) Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) adenine ribose phosphates 31 kJ/mole 31 kJ/mole Pi +b) Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)+ Pi 31 kJ/mole Pi +c) Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) 31 kJ/mole ATP ADP AMP Other nucleotide energy containing nucleosides • Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) • Uridine triphosphate (UTP) •Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) Nucleotide triphosphates UTP UDP UMP All have the same energy yield of 31kJ/mol per phosphate group as ATP i.e. hydrolysis of 1 UTP has the same energy cost as using 1 ATP 2. ATP ‘storage’ molecules • Creatine phosphate NB. Enzyme Creatine Kinase (CK) makes creatine phosphate from ATP. CKMM - skeletal muscle CKMB – cardiac muscle Creatine Kinase catalyzes the reversible transfer of high-energy phosphate from ATP to creatine Leading to storage of energy in the form of phosphocreatine. Other energy containing molecules Energy carrying molecules are cycled Overall concentrations of metabolites are low so they are constantly recycled In addition, the levels of either ATP or ADP act as additional regulatory mechanisms Energy production: Carbohydrate Lipid Protein Electron transport Energy utilisation: Synthesis Muscle contraction Transport ATP ADP + Pi Each ATP is cycled ~ once every 30 seconds. AMP + 2Pi 3. Electron carriers • Energy packets in the form of NADH and FADH2 contain energy but require an additional pathway to release ATP. – Redox reactions and electron carriers are used to couple energy released from food molecules to synthesis of ATP. • Vitamins are critical for complete utilization of the energy in food. – Vitamins B1, B2 and B3 are critical as co-enzymes in the carbohydrate metabolism pathways. Reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions in metabolism Redox reactions and electron carriers are used to couple energy released from food molecules to synthesis of ATP. Usually in the form of an electron (e-) and a proton (H+) or a hydride (H-) ion = 2e-. In redox reactions, oxidation of one substance is coupled to reduction of another. e.g. Substance X-H2 + Substance Y Substance X + Substance Y-H2 (reduced) (oxidised) (oxidised) (reduced) Reduction Is Gain of electrons… Oxidation Is Loss of electrons OILRIG Many of the reactions of metabolism are redox-type reactions e.g. lactate pyruvate H- (2e-) + H+ oxidation The electrons released when substances are oxidised have potential energy. This potential energy is used to synthesise ATP in the electron transport chain (ETC) in the mitochondria. (Reaction takes place in the cytoplasm and is part of glycolysis Enzyme = lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) Electron carriers What happens to the electrons? nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) – Vitamin B3 reduction NAD+ NADH + H+ (or NADH2+) H- (2e-) H+ lactate pyruvate H- (2e- + H+) + H+ oxidation lactate pyruvate NAD+ NADH + H+ So: NADH is transported into the mitochondrion and transfers electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC) Other electron carriers Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) – Vitamin B2 - Riboflavin Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) – Vitamin B3 - Niacin Electron carriers are also in limited supply in the cell, so they must be rapidly recycled. All of the electron carriers are co-enzymes made from vitamins Vitamins • Vitamins are critical for complete utilization of the energy in food. – B1 - co-enzyme for pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) – B2 – Riboflavin for FAD+ production – B3 - Niacin (nicotinomide) for NAD+ production Coenzyme A (CoA) Synthesised from Vitamin B5 (pantothenate) Free CoA is abbreviated as CoASH (the cysteine –SH group) Functions of CoA: • key cofactor in first step of the TCA cycle, responsible for transferring the acetyl group from pyruvate oxidation to oxaloacetate yielding citrate • CoA is a carrier of acyl groups • Synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/ZA/en/technical-documents/technical- article/protein-biology/enzyme-activity-assays/coenzyme-a OH Stearic acid - a fatty acid Acyl groups Acetic Acid Cleavage point Acyl groups are chains of carbon atoms of any various lengths (i.e. 2 to ~30 carbons) ending in C=O CoA as a carrier of the acyl group The removal of the hydroxyl group will facilitate the attachment of CoA at the sulf- hydrl end of the CoA Acetyl-CoA (Acetyl-SCoA) Acetyl group Recycling of limited CoA CoA is cleaved from the acyl goup and recycled in the cell. Cleavage point There is a limited quantity of CoA in the cell. Coenzyme A Also a co-enzyme of the acyl-CoA group but the R is now an acetyl group. Acetylation of CoA with acetate becomes acetyl CoA Regulation of blood glucose 4.1-5.9 mmol/l Hormonal Regulation • Regulation of blood glucose and energy production is a critical component of homeostasis. • Blood glucose is maintained in a very narrow range 4.1mmol/l to 5.9mmol/l • If an imbalance occurs there are two physiological mechanisms to counteract either – increase – decrease Summary of Metabolism Terminology • Anabolic pathways build up larger molecules from smaller ones, using chemical energy. • The major anabolic pathways include gluconeogenesis, glycogen synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, lipogenesis and protein synthesis. • Metabolism captures some of the energy of oxidation of food in ATP. • ATP and other nucleotide triphosphates have 2 high-energy bonds that provide energy for anabolic processes and energy-consuming processes (e.g. muscle contraction). • Redox reactions and electron carriers are used to couple energy released from food molecules to synthesis of ATP. • Co-enzyme A is a high-energy carrier of acyl (from carboxylic acids) groups. • Cellular concentrations of energy-carrier molecules, including ATP, electron carriers and co-enzyme A, are low, so the molecules must be constantly recycled.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
