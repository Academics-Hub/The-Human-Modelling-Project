The Ag/AgCl electrode ’s half-cell potential is 0.233 V. The DC voltage between the two electrodes is measured with a very high impedan ce voltmeter and is 0.572 V (with the test electrode neg ative). The impedance between two electrodes is measured as a function of frequency at very low currents , and is giv en in the figure below. Determine a circ uit mode l for the electrode Prof. Vered Aharonson 2017Prof. Vered Aharonson 2017 10 A pair of electrodes are tested in a beaker o f physiologica l saline solution: The magnitude of the impedan ce between the electrodes as a function of frequency is measured using a low -level sinusoidal excitation. The impedance of the saline solution is small enough to be neglected. An equivalent circ uit of the biopotential electrodes is given below.
