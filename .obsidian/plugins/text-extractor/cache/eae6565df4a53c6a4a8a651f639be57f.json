Purp osele ss, inappropriate increased gro wth of cells which do not produce a fully function al, w ell structured tissue. The ce lls develop the capacity to migrate aw ay from th eir original site, invading ne ighbourin g tissues and spreading to distan t organs. 8 There are also tumours/n eoplasms which do not invade or spread through the body. These are kno wn as “benign ” tumo urs . Definition : “Beni gn” adjective 1 . gentle and kind. synonyms: kindly, kind, w arm -hearted, good - natured, friend ly, w arm, affectionate, agreeable, amia ble, good - hu moured, genial, congenial, cordial, app roacha ble, tender, tender-hearted, soft- hearted, gen tle etc. 2 . MEDICINE (of a disease) not harm fu l in effect. \"a benign condition\" 9 Neoplasms Benign: •Slow gro wth rate •Histo rese mbles parent tissue •Does not invade tissues (bu t may compress them) Malignant: •May gro w rapid ly •Histo –may look very different to tissue of origin •Invasive and may spread to other organs tumour cancer gro wth maligna ncy “n on- beni gn” lesion Result from autonomou s gro wth of cells carcinoma 10 Nomenclature of Cancers •When a neoplasm is benign the suffix oma is added to the cell or organ of origin e.g. lipom a (adipose tissue) •When a neoplasm is malignan t the suffix carcinoma or sarcoma is usually added to the cell or organ of origin e.g. pancreatic carcinoma, leio m yosarcoma). •There are some other names you will come across like lympho ma (malignancy of lymph oid tissue), leukaemia (malignancy of bone marro w) and melanoma (ma lignancy of melanocy tes). Nomenclature of Cancers Sarcoma : Malignan t neoplasm of mesenchyme (connective tissue), rarer than carcinomas, e.g. liposarcoma, osteosarcoma) Carcinoma: A malignan t epithelial neoplasm •Malignan t squamous e pithelium: carcinoma e.g. squamous cell carcinoma •Malignant glandular epithe lium: ade nocarcinoma e.g. colonic adenocarcinoma Also: Malignan t haematolymphoid - lym phoma/le ukaemias Malignan t pigmented skin (melanocy tes)-mela noma What effects does cancer have? Direct effects: •Pressure •Ob struction •Destruction of tissue •Ulceration with ble eding and in fection Indirect effects: •Cachexia (w asting) and fever •Paraneoplastic syndromes 13 Why does cancer kill people? 14 It is usually not the original tumour which le ads to de ath, rather it is the spread of the cancer to impo rtan t organs like the brain, lung and liver which kills the person. 15 Thi ngs t o thi nk about… •Why do you thin k cancers are far more common in some tissues than in other s?

Ben ign tumou rs are able to invade tissues but not me tastasise to other parts of the body b. An aden oma is a malignan t tum our c. A benign tumour rese mbles its tissue of origin when view ed un der a microscope d. A carcinoma is a malignan t tumou r of an ep ithelium e. A cancer can cause local destru ction of tissue Part 2 –gross an d microscopic appearances of cancer 17 Tumour shapes. Sessile , polyp o id and pap illary tumours are usually benign . E xophytic or fun gating , ulcerated or ann ular tumours are m ore like ly to be malignan t. An nu lar tumours encircling a tub ular structure (e.g. intestine) are comm on in the large bowel, where they often cau se intestinal obstruction.

For the follo win g statements, identify which are correct and justify your answ er. For those that are incorrect, try to make them correct. a. Microscopically, cancer cells are the sa me as norma l cells for that tissue but differ in that they are arranged in a haphazard w ay. b. Benign tumours have a w ell-defined boundary. c. Fungating and ulcerating tumours may cause bleeding. Part 3 –morphological growth and de velopmen t of cancer 34 Ho w does it grow and de velop? All cancer starts as a single cell but b y the time w e can detect it the re have b ee n thousands of ce ll divisions. Cancers change as they gro w, freque n tly becoming much more badly beha v ed or “mor e mal i gnant ” or “l e ss di f f er e n ti a t e d” Many cancers follo w one of 2 step wise developme n t paths. These have bee n describe d for carcin omas, but carcin omas form the majority of cancers in adults. 35 De velopmen t of cancer is a step wise process e.g. carcinoma arising in an epithelium Time Mutations Basement membrane 36 Carcinoma progression Carcinoma of the cervix 37 The adenoma -carcinoma path w ay e.g. carcinoma of the colon 38 What is th e clinical significance of these path w ays of cancer developmen t?

The Pap smear is a techniq ue wh ich can de tect dysplastic cells before a full-blo wn cancer develo p s Part 4 –the clonal basis of cancer 43 How d oes cancer start? Gro wth and social behaviour o f cells ultimately depend on DNA via production of proteins e.g. gro wth factors, signaling path w ay components, transcrip tion factors and a dhesion mole cule s 44 How many cells does it take to make a cancer? Simplistically only ONE The visible tumou r is a clone derived from one o riginal cell but the developmen t of cancer is a process not a single step 45 The family tree 46 The basis o f cancer: 1.
