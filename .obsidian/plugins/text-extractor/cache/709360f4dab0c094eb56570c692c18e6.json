HUTCHINSON 2B09 SCHOOL OF ANATOMICAL SCIENCES Objectives • Describe the basic structure, divisions and immediate relations of the pharynx • Describe the blood supply and innervation of the pharynx • Describe the organization of the cartilages, membranes and muscles of the larynx • Define the boundaries of the laryngeal inlet • Describe the blood supply and innervation of the muscles and mucous membrane of the larynx • Describe how the rima glottidis is controlled to vary the volume of air that enters the respiratory passages • Explain how changes in tension in the vocal ligament is produced to vary the pitch of the sound produced in the larynx • Review the lymphatic drainage of various structures of the head and neck region and relate this to the spread of pathologies • Identify anatomical features and major relations on diagnostic images e.g. CT, MRI and radiographs • Respiratory function • Roof and posterior wall: Continuous surface that lies inferior to the body of the sphenoid bone and the basilar part of the occipital bone • Pharyngeal tonsils: Found in the mucous membrane of the roof and the posterior wall of the nasopharynx • Digestive function, • Aids in the process of deglutition • Borders Superiorly: soft palate Inferiorly: base of the tongue • Laterally: palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches • Palatine tonsils, collections of lymphoid tissue on either side of the oropharynx between the arches • Tonsillar bed • Superior constrictor of the pharynx and the pharyngobasilar fascia form the tonsillar bed • Extends from the superior border of the epiglottis and the pharyngoepiglottic folds to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage • Borders Posteriorly: Related to the bodies of the C4- C6 vertebrae Posterior and lateral walls: Middle and inferior constrictor muscles • Palatopharyngeus and stylopharyngeus muscles form the walls • Piriform recess, small depression of the laryngopharyngeal cavity on either side of the laryngeal inlet • Separated from the laryngeal inlet by the aryepiglottic fold • 2 LAYERS OF VOLUNTARY MUSCLE • EXTERNAL CIRCULAR LAYER • Constrictor muscles • Primarily responsible for constricting the pharynx during swallowing • Mainly innervated by the pharyngeal branch of vagus and the pharyngeal plexus • Middle and inferior constrictor muscles are also innervated by the external and recurrent laryngeal nerves • INTERNAL LONGITUDINAL LAYER • Elevate/shorten and widen the pharynx during swallowing and speaking • Palatopharyngeus • Stylopharyngeus • Salpingopharyngeus • Palatopharyngeus and salpingopharyngeus are innervated by the pharyngeal branch of CNX and the pharyngeal plexus • Stylopharyngeus is innervated by CN IX MUSCLE ORIGIN INSERTION INNERVATION MAIN ACTION(S) SUPERIOR PHARYNGEAL CONSTRICTOR PTERYGOID HAMULUS, PTERYGOMANDIBULAR RAPHE, POSTERIOR END OF MYLOHYOID LINE OF MANDIBLE AND SIDE OF TONGUE PHARYNGEAL TUBERCLE ON THE BASILAR PART OF THE OCCIPITAL BONE PHARYNGEAL BRANCH OF VAGUS AND PHARYNGEAL PLEXUS CONSTRICT WALLS OF PHARYNX DURING SWALLOWING MIDDLE PHARYNGEAL CONSTRICTOR STYLOHYOID LIGAMENT AND GREATER AND LESSER HORNS OF HYOID PHARYNGEAL RAPHE PHARYNGEAL BRANCH OF VAGUS AND PHARYNGEAL PLEXUS, PLUS BRANCHES OF EXTERNAL AND RECURRENT LARYNGEAL NERVES OF VAGUS INFERIOR PHARYNGEAL CONSTRICTOR OBLIQUE LINE OF THYROID CARTILAGE AND SIDE OF CRICOID CARTILAGE CRICOPHARYNGEAL PART ENCIRCLES PHARYNGO ESOPHAGEAL JUNCTION WITHOUT FORMING A RAPHE EXTERNAL LAYER OF THE PHARYNX Superior Constrictor Middle Constrictor Inferior Constrictor MUSCLE ORIGIN INSERTION INNERVATION MAIN ACTION(S) PALATOPHARYNGEUS HARD PALATE AND PALATINE APONEUROSIS POSTERIOR BORDER OF LAMINA OF THYROID CARTILAGE AND SIDE OF PHARYNX AND ESOPHAGUS PHARYNGEAL BRANCH OF VAGUS AND PHARYNGEAL PLEXUS ELEVATE (SHORTEN AND WIDEN) PHARYNX AND LARYNX DURING SWALLOWING AND SPEAKING SALPINGOPHARYNGEUS CARTILAGINOUS PART OF PHARYNGOTYMPANIC TUBE BLENDS WITH PALATOPHARYNGEUS STYLOPHARYNGEUS STYLOID PROCESS OF TEMPORAL BONE POSTERIOR AND SUPERIOR BORDERS OF THYROID CARTILAGE WITH PALATOPHARYNGEUS GLOSSOPHARYNGEAL NERVE INTERNAL LAYER OF THE PHARYNX Palatopharyngeus Salpingopharyngeus Stylopharyngeus • 1.

TRACHEA CLINICAL ANATOMY OF THE LARYNX, PHARYNX AND OESOPHAGUS •ESOPHAGEAL INJURIES: •Rarest kind of penetrating neck trauma but cause the most complications after a surgical procedure or other treatment •Most esophageal injuries occur in conjunction with an airway injury because the airway lies anterior to the esophagus and provides some protection to it •Esophageal injuries are often occult (hidden), which makes the injury difficult to detect, especially when it is isolated •Unrecognized esophageal perforation causes death in nearly all patients who do not have surgery and in approximately 50% of those who do •ESOPHAGEAL CANCER: •Most common presenting complaint of cancer of the esophagus is dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), which is not usually recognized until the lumen is reduced by 30-50% •Esophagoscopy is a common diagnosis tool for observing these cancers •Painful swallowing in some patients suggests extensions of the tumor to periesophageal tissues •Enlargement of the inferior deep cervical lymph nodes also suggests esophageal cancer •Compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerves by an esophageal tumor produces hoarseness • Identify the highlighted structure • What is the innervation to this structure? • What is the action of the structure? • With which muscle group / layer is the highlighted structure associated?","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
