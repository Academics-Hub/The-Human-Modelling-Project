The right pleural cavity B. The mediastinum C. The left pleural cavity PARIETAL PLEURA VISCERAL PLEURA PLEURAL CAVITY (SEROUS FLUID) Pleura Pleura is a thin membrane that lines the lungs and the chest wall. Has two layers: Visceral and parietal Parietal pleura - Lines thoracic cage, mediastinum & sup surface of diaphragm - Projects above the 1st rib & clavicle Parts: • Costal pleura: costal cartilage & ribs • Mediastinal pleura: mediastinal surface • Diaphragmatic pleura: sup surface of diaphragm • Pleural cupola (or cervical pleura): projects above 1st rib & clavicle Innervation: supplied by the - intercostal nerves (costal & diaphragmatic pleurae) - phrenic nerve (diaphragmatic & mediastinal pleurae) Visceral pleura - Adheres to the lungs and it fissures - Slippery surface Arterial supply: Bronchial arteries (br. of the thoracic aorta Lymphatics: drain into the bronchopulmonary nodes. Innervation: autonomic nerves via the ant & post pulmonary plexus. It is insensitive to pain stimuli. The lungs ✓ Apex - Rises above 1st rib antly but is below the post aspect of this rib. ✓ Base - Is concave and lies above the doom of diaphragm (i.e. diaphragmatic surface) - Right dome of diaphragm is higher than left - Right lung overlies the liver - Left lung overlies the stomach, part of liver and spleen. ✓ Two or three lobes - created by one or two fissures ✓ Three surfaces - costal, mediastinal and diaphragmatic ✓ Three borders - anterior, inferior and posterior Differences between the left and right lungs Lobes and fissures • Oblique fissure is the same for each lung, and is indicated on the surface of the thorax by a line from the spinous process of T2, around the thorax and to the 6th costochondral junction. • Horizontal fissure (on the right lung) is indicated by a line on the surface of the thorax that runs from the anterior border of the lung along the 4th cartilage to the oblique fissure. Left Lung The Hilum Hilum Mediastinal view Costal view Right Lung Middle Lobe Inferior Lobe Impressions on the lungs- anterior borders of lungs lie adjacent to the anterior line of parietal pleura reflection as far as the 4th costal cartilage. - left line of pleural reflection moves laterally & inferiorly at cardiac notch to reach level of 6th costal cartilage At the lower border ***The difference between the lower border of the lung and the parietal pleura indicates the extent of the costo-diaphragmatic recess. Landmark Lung margin Pleural margin Mid-clavicular 6th rib 8th rib Mid-axillary 8th rib 10th rib Mid-scapular 10th rib 12th rib Tracheobronchial tree Bronchopulmonary segment A portion of the lung supplied by a specific segmental bronchus and a tertiary branch of pulmonary arteries. These arteries branch from the pulmonary and bronchial arteries, and run together through the center of the segment. Veins and lymphatic vessels drain (i.e. inter-segmentally) along the edges of the segments. An independent and functional unit of the lung that is surgically resectable. About 10 segments in each lung. Blood supply - Pulmonary arteries: carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs - Pulmonary veins: carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium for circulation - Bronchial arteries: supply the lung tissue with oxygenated blood. - Two left bronchial arteries - Sup left bronchial - Inf left bronchial *origin: thoracic aorta - One right bronchial artery *posterior intercostal a. or left superior bronchial a. The bronchial veins drain the lung tissue - The right bronchial vein drains into the azygous vein - The left bronchial vein drains into the accessory hemiazygous vein or into the left superior intercostal vein LymphaticsPneumothorax- air Empyema thoracis/pyothorax- pus . Haemopneumothorax- blood and air Chylothorax- chyle from thoracic duct Clinical anatomy Review questions 1. Name the parts of the parietal pleura 2. Give the surface marking of the lower border of the pleura 3. Give the innervation of the parietal and visceral pleura. 4. Explain why you will feel pain in the parietal pleura and not the visceral pleura 5. Tabulate the impressions of the right and left lung 6. Tabulate the difference between the right and left lung 7. Give the surface markings of the fissures of the right lung 8. Define the bronchopulmonary segments. Thank you!!!!","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
