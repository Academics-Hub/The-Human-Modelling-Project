HUTCHINSON 2B09 SCHOOL OF ANATOMICAL SCIENCES OBJECTIVES • Define the boundaries and subdivisions of the oral cavity (mouth) • Describe the basic tissues that form the walls, floor and roof of the oral cavity • Describe the innervation of the mucous lining of the oral cavity • Describe the anatomy of the lip and the tongue, including their blood supply, lymphatic drainage and innervation BORDERS & SUBDIVISIONS ORAL VESTIBULE: Antero-lateral border - oral fissure bordered by the lips & cheeks Superior and inferior borders - gingival gutters Postero-lateral border - dental arches & associated gingiva ORAL CAVITY PROPER: Antero-lateral border - dental arches & associated gingiva Posterior border - palatoglossal & palatopharyngeal arches Roof - palate (bony hard palate + soft palate Floor - mylohyoid muscle (in some cases the tongue) Contents - tongue LIPS, CHEEKS & GINGIVA LIPS: •Mobile, musculofibrous folds surrounding the oral fissure •Extending from nasolabial sulci and nares laterally / superiorly to the mentolabial sulcus inferiorly •Contain the orbicularis oris and superior and inferior labial muscles, nerves and vessels •Covered externally by skin and lined internally by a mucous membrane •Transitional zone of the lips continues into the oral cavity where it is continuous with the mucous membrane •Labial frenula are considered free-edged folds of mucous membrane in the midline, extending from the vestibular gingiva to the mucosa of the upper and lower lips LIPS, CHEEKS & GINGIVA UPPER LIP: Supplied by the superior labial artery (branch of the facial & infra- orbital arteries Supplied by the superior labial branches of the infra-orbital nerves (CNV2) Lower lip: Supplied by the inferior labial artery (branch of the facial & mental arteries Supplied by the inferior labial branches of the mental nerves (CNV3) Lymph drainage from the upper lip & lateral parts of the lower lip – submandibular lymph nodes Lymph from the medial parts of the lower lip to the submental lymph nodes LIPS, CHEEKS & GINGIVA •Form the moveable walls of the oral cavity •Anatomically the external aspect of the cheeks constitutes the buccal region bound: •Anteriorly by the oral and mental regions (lips and chin), •Superiorly by the zygomatic region, posteriorly by the parotid region •Inferiorly by the inferior border of the mandible •The prominence of the cheek occurs at the junction of the zygomatic and buccal regions •The zygomatic bone underlying the prominence and the zygomatic arch as the cheek bone •Principle muscles of the cheeks are the buccinator muscles •Numerous small buccal glands lie between the mucous membrane and the buccinator muscles •Superficial to the buccinators are encapsulated collections of fat i.e. The buccal fat pads which are proportionately larger in infants •Its assumed function is to reinforce the cheeks and keep them from collapsing during sucking •Cheeks are supplied by buccal branches of the maxillary artery and innervated by buccal branches of the mandibular nerve GINGIVAE •Composed of fibrous tissue covered with mucous membrane •The gingiva proper (attached gingiva) is firmly attached to the alveolar processes of the mandible and maxilla and the necks of teeth •The gingiva proper adjacent to the tongue is the superior and inferior lingual gingivae •Gingivae adjacent to the lips and cheeks is the maxillary and mandibular labial or buccal gingiva respectively •The gingiva proper is normally pink, stippled and keratinizing •The alveolar mucosa (unattached to the gingiva) is normally shiny red and non-keratinizing ORAL CAVITY PROPER ROOF: BONY HARD PALATE ORAL CAVITY PROPER ROOF: BONY HARD PALATE ORAL CAVITY PROPER ROOF: SOFT PALATE •Mobile posterior 1/3 of the roof of the oral cavity proper •It has no bony skeleton but its anterior aponeurotic part is strengthened by the palatine aponeurosis which attaches to the posterior edge of the hard palate •The aponeurosis is thick anteriorly and thin posteriorly where it blends with a posterior muscular component •Postero-inferiorly the soft palate has a curved free margin from which hangs the conical process called the uvula •During swallowing the soft palate initially is tensed to allow the tongue to press against it •Laterally the soft palate is continuous with the wall of the pharynx and is joined to the tongue and pharynx by the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches respectively •A few taste buds are located in the epithelium covering the oral surface of the soft palate, the posterior wall of the oropharynx and the epiglottis ORAL CAVITY PROPER ROOF: SOFT PALATE •The palatine tonsils associated with the palatal arches are masses of lymphoid tissue one on each side of the oropharynx •Each tonsil is in a tonsillar fossa (sinus) bounded by the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches and the tongue SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE HARD AND SOFT PALATE: •Mucosa of the hard palate is tightly bound to the underlying bone consequently, submucosal injections here are very painful •The superior lingual gingiva, the part of the gingiva covering the lingual surface of the teeth and the alveolar process is continuous with the mucosa of the palate, therefore injection of an anesthetic agent into the gingiva of the tooth anesthetizes the adjacent palatal mucosa •Deep to the mucosa are mucous secreting palatine glands, the openings of the ducts of these glands give the palatine mucosa a pitted orange-peel appearance •Radiating laterally from the incisive papilla are several transverse palatine folds or rugae, which assist with food manipulation during mastication MUSCLE SUPERIOR ATTACHMENT INFERIOR ATTACHMENT INNERVATION MAIN ACTION TENSOR VELI PALATINI SCAPHOID FOSSA OF THE MEDIAL PTERYGOID

side, a branch of the descending palatine artery •The greater palatine artery passes through the greater palatine foramen and runs antero-medially •The lesser palatine artery, a smaller branch of the descending palatine artery, enters the palate through the lesser palatine foramen and anastomoses with the ascending palatine artery a branch of the facial artery •Veins of the palate are tributaries of the pterygoid venous plexus •Sensory nerves of the palate are branches of the maxillary nerve (CNV2), which branch from the pterygopalatine ganglion •The greater palatine nerve supplies the gingivae, mucous membrane and glands of most of the hard palate •The lesser palatine nerves supply the soft palate •The palatine nerves accompany the arteries through the greater and lesser palatine foramina respectively, except for the tensor veli palatini muscle (CNV2), all soft palate muscles are supplied through the pharyngeal plexus of nerves LINGUAL TONSIL: TONSILLAR CRYPT ROOT OF TONGUE

BROADENS TONGUE •Innervation: •All muscles of the tongue except palatoglossus received motor innervation from the hypoglossal nerve •Palatoglossus receives its innervation from the pharyngeal plexus of nerves •Anterior 2/3: •General sensation - lingual nerve •Special sensation - chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve •Posterior 1/3: •General sensation - glossopharyngeal nerve •Special sensation - glossopharyngeal nerve •Twigs of the internal laryngeal nerve, a branch of the vagus nerve, supplies mostly general sensation but some special sensation to a small area of the tongue just anterior to the epiglottis •These mostly sensory nerves also carry parasympathetic secretomotor fibers to serous glands in the tongue •Four taste sensations associated with the tongue: sweet, salty, sour and bitter •Vasculature of the tongue: •Arteries of the tongue are derived from the lingual artery, a branch of the ECA •On entering the oral cavity the lingual artery passes deep to the hyoglossus muscle •Dorsal lingual arteries supply the root of the tongue •Deep lingual arteries supply the body of the tongue •The deep lingual arteries communicate with each other near the apex of the tongue •The dorsal lingual arteries are prevented from communicating by the lingual septum •Veins of the tongue include: •The dorsal lingual vein which runs with the lingual artery •Deep lingual veins which begin at the apex of the tongue, run posteriorly behind the lingual frenulum to join the sublingual vein •The sublingual veins in the elderly are often varicose, some or all of these veins may drain into the IJV •Lymph drainage of the tongue: •Lymph from the root of the tongue drains bilaterally into the superior deep cervical lymph nodes •Lymph from the medial part of the body of the tongue drains bilaterally and directly into the inferior deep cervical lymph nodes •Lymph from the right and left parts of the body drains into the submandibular lymph nodes on the ipsilateral side •The apex and frenulum drain to the submental lymph nodes, the medial portion draining bilaterally •All lymph from the tongue ultimately drains to the deep cervical nodes and passes via the jugular venous trunks into the venous system at the right and left venous angles FLOOR OF THE ORAL CAVITY: MYLOHYOID MUSCLE GENIOHYOID MUSCLE SALIVARY GLANDS Major salivary glands include: •Parotid gland •Submandibular gland •Sublingual gland Minor salivary glands include: •Small accessory salivary glands scattered over the palate, lips, cheeks, tonsils and tongue Saliva is secreted from the glands and functions in the following manner: •Keeps moist the mucous membrane of the mouth •Lubricates food during mastication •Begins the digestion of starches •Serves as an intrinsic mouth wash •Plays significant roles in the prevention of tooth decay PAROTID GLANDPAROTID GLAND •Largest of three paired salivary glands •Enclosed within a tough unyielding fascial capsule, the parotid sheath derived from the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia •It is irregular in shape because the area occupied by the gland, the parotid bed is anteroinferior to the external acoustic meatus, where it is wedged between the ramus of the mandible and the mastoid process •Fatty tissue between the lobules of the gland confers the flexibility the gland must have to accommodate the motion of the mandible •The apex of the parotid gland is posterior to the angle of the mandible and its base is related to the zygomatic arch •The subcutaneous lateral surface of the parotid gland is almost flat •Embedded within the substance of the parotid gland from superficial to deep: •Parotid plexus of the facial nerve and its branches •The retromandibular vein •External carotid artery •Parotid lymph nodes which are also present on the parotid sheath •The parotid duct: •Passes horizontally from the anterior edge of the gland •At the anterior border of the masseter, the duct turns medially, pierces the buccinator muscle and enters the oral cavity through a small orifice opposite the second maxillary molar or teeth 17/27 PAROTID GLAND •Innervation of the parotid gland and associated structures includes: •The auriculotemporal nerve a branch of CNV3 is closely related to the parotid gland and passes posterior to it with the superficial temporal vessels •The auriculotemporal nerve and the great auricular nerve, a branch of the cervical plexus composed of fibers from C2 and C3 spinal nerves innervates the parotid sheath as well as the overlying skin •The parasympathetic component of the glossopharyngeal nerve supplies presynaptic secretory fibers to the otic ganglion •The postsynaptic fibers are conveyed from the ganglion to the gland by the auriculotemporal nerve •Stimulation of the parasympathetic fibers produce a thin watery saliva •Sympathetic fibers are derived from the cervical ganglia through the external carotid nerve plexus on the external carotid artery •The vasomotor activity of these fibers may reduce secretion from the gland, sensory fibers pass to the gland through the great auricular and auriculotemporal nerves SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND •Lies along the body of the mandible, partly superior and partly inferior to the posterior half of the mandible •It is also partly superficial and partly deep to the mylohyoid muscle •The submandibular duct approximately 5 cm in length arises from the portion of the gland that lies between the mylohyoid and the hyoglossus muscles •Passing from lateral to medial the lingual nerve loops under the duct that runs anteriorly, opening by one to three orifices on a small sublingual papilla beside the base of the lingual frenulum •The orifices of the submandibular ducts are visible and saliva can often be seen trickling from them •The arterial supply of the gland is from the submental arteries and the veins accompany the arteries •Lymphatic vessels of the glands end in the deep cervical lymph nodes, particularly the jugulo-omohyoid node •Submandibular glands are supplied by presynaptic parasympathetic secretomotor fibers conveyed from the facial nerve to the lingual nerve via the chorda tympani nerve, which synapse with postsynaptic neurons in the submandibular ganglion •The latter fibers accompany arteries to reach the gland, along with vasoconstrictive postsynaptic sympathetic fibers from the deep cervical ganglion SUBLINGUAL GLAND •Are the smallest and most deeply situated salivary glands •Each almond shaped gland lies in the floor of the mouth between the mandible and the genioglossus muscle •The glands from each side unite to form a horse-shoe shaped mass around the connective tissue core of the lingual frenulum •Numerous small sublingual ducts open in the floor of the mouth along the sublingual folds •The arterial supply of the sublingual glands is from the sublingual and submental arteries, branches of the facial and lingual arteries respectively •The nerves of the glands accompany those of the submandibular gland •Presynaptic parasympathetic secretomotor fiber are conveyed by the facial nerve (chorda tympani) and the lingual nerves to synapse in the submandibular ganglion ORAL CAVITY CANCERS & SALIVARY GLAND PATHOLOGIES INDICATIONS FOR URGENT REFERRAL BY GENERAL DENTAL PRACTITIONER: •Any ulcer which persists unhealed for more than 2 weeks •Any
