Grey Matter Seen here as the dark and light purple stained layers. Folia Seen here as the “leaf like” folds. The folium contains a core of white matter that is surrounded by grey matter.

Since the neurofibrils lie within the axons, the white matter is clearly recognised with this stain as being composed of many nerve fibres (axons) THE CEREBELLUM Grey Matter White Matter Folium Molecular Layer Purkinje Cell Layer Granular Layer THE CEREBELLUM Purkinje Cell Granular Layer Molecular Layer Axons of Basket Cells synapsing on the Purkinje cell Axons of Basket Cells synapsing on the Purkinje cell Note: The neurofibrils within the axons of the nerve cells are blackened by this technique. Axons of Granule cells THE CHOROID PLEXUS • Slide 66 Stain: H&E  The Choroid Plexus lines the ventricles of the brain and is responsible for the production of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Slide2ff.JPG THE CHOROID PLEXUS Brain Tissue Choroid Plexus Lumen of Ventricle Lumen of Ventricle THE CHOROID PLEXUS Brain Tissue Choroid Plexus Lumen of Ventricle THE CHOROID PLEXUS Note: The choroid plexus is a highly vascular, contoured membrane , therefor it appears as “islands” of tissue in this section. The pia mater (which contains an extensive blood supply and numerous capillaries) extends into the ventricles of the brain and are subsequently lined by ependymal cells, thus giving rise to the choroid plexus Simple cuboidal epithelial lining These cells are known as ependymal cells. Apical surface specializations include cilia and microvilli. These cells however lack a basal lamina.
