Structure of NucleotidesStructure of DNA ▪ DNA is a polymer → made up of monomeric nucleotides ▪ Each nucleotide comprises a nitrogenous base (ring), a sugar molecule & a phosphate group. ▪ Multiple nucleotides join to form a polynucleotide chain ▪ If the base, thymine is present in the chain → the resulting structure is double-stranded DNA. ▪ If the base, uracil is present – the resulting structure is single- stranded RNA. ▪ Also, if the sugar molecule is ribose → then the resulting polymer is RNA; if the sugar is deoxyribose → the resulting polymer is DNA. ▪ In ds-DNA, the base pairs are joined by hydrogen bonds - Guanine (G) & cytosine (C) have 3 hydrogen bonds betw them - Adenine (A) & thymine (T) have 2 hydrogen bonds betw them ▪ DNA can form double helices, whilst RNA cannot Functions of Nucleic Acids • DNA is for storage of genetic information (A, G, T & C. Deoxyribose) • RNA converts the genetic information from genes into the amino acid sequences of protein (i.e. gene expression & protein synthesis), (A, G, U & C. Ribose) • General rule of molecular biology: DNA → RNA → Protein Nucleotide Synthesis • Nucleotides are monomers used to make nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). • Nucleotides comprise 3 components: (1) sugar, (2) phosphate, (3) nitrogenous base. • Bases can be either purines or pyrimidines. • Both purines & pyrimidines require an enzyme phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) → which donates the ribose & phosphate molecules to make a nucleotide. • Since nucleotides are synthesized by the body i.e liver, in nutrition, they are classified as “non-essential” Nucleotide Synthesis (continued) • Synthesis of nucleotides begins with amino acids (the source of nitrogen), at rates consistent with cell needs. • Liver has intracellular mechanisms that sense quantity of nucleotides produced → e.g. rises during growth or tissue regeneration. • Negative feedback regulation by nucleotide products on upstream reactions, exist. • 2 pathways for nucleotide synthesis: (1) For tissue cells that divide rapidly & therefore require a greater demand of nucleotides → de novo synthesis of nucleotides (fresh/new synthesis). (2) For slow-dividing tissue cells (brain & erythrocytes – incapable of de novo synthesis) → simple recycling of already preformed nucleotide bases → salvage pathways → requires less energy. Purine Biosynthesis ▪ 3 pathways: (1) De novo synthesis (fresh/new) (2) Phosphoribosylation of purines (salvage pathways) (3) Phosphorylation of nucleosides ▪ All purines are derived from precursor purine, inosine monophosphate (IMP) ▪ A purine deficiency is rare, instead a folate (Vit B12) deficiency may occur since folate is an important factor in some reactions during purine synthesis. ▪ There are 11 reactions that convert -D-ribose-5-phosphate to IMP Purine Synthesis All 11 reactions in the synthesis of inosine monophosphate (IMP) Control of the rate of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis Regulating conversion of IMP to adenosine nucleotides and guanosine nucleotides Salvage Pathways for Purines ▪ Cells that do not rapidly divide (eg brain & erythrocytes) → phosphoribosylation of free, preformed purine base to form purine 5’-mononucleotide: Pu + PR-PP → PuRP + Ppi (HGPRT) (HGPRT) Pyrimidine Synthesis Salvage pathways for Pyrimidines ▪ Similar to purine salvage reactions ▪ Pyrimidines are converted to nucleotides by addition of a phosphate & ribose molecule. ▪ Each pyrimidine is catalysed by its own specific phosphoribosyltransferase Conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxynucleotidesNucleotide Synthesis SummaryNucleotide Degradation (1) Degradation of Purine Nucleotides ▪ Anabolic purine synthesis → energy demanding synthetic pathway (i.e. requires a lot of ATP molecules). ▪ Thus, liver does not completely degrade purines → instead there is partial degradation of purines & recycling of purines in the liver. ▪ Purine ring is left intact after purine catabolism → may be recycled or excreted depending on the nucleotide demand in the body. ▪ The end product of purine catabolism in humans is uric acid → poorly soluble, thus accumulation of uric acid results in gout formation. ▪ In some mammals (eg carnivores) → uric acid is degraded to allantoin → which can be further degraded to urea or ammonia to be excreted. (2) Degradation of Pyrimidine Nucleotides ▪ Unlike purine rings in humans, which are not cleaved → pyrimidine rings can be opened & degraded to highly soluble structures to be excreted. ▪ Pyrimidines are completely hydrolytically cleaved into carbon dioxide (CO2) and ammonia (NH3). ▪ CO2 is expelled from the body during breathing. ▪ NH3 is converted to urea and excreted in urine. Formation of uric acid: end product of purine catabolism Uricase Gout • Inflammatory disease with several potential causes. • Primary gout → attributed to an inborn error of metabolism → i.e. overproduction of uric acid. • Characterised by high blood & urine levels of uric acid. • Uric acid is poorly soluble in blood plasma, synovial fluid, & cold temperatures particularly in the metatarsophalangeal joint (extremities). • Thus, with increased uric acid production, & due to its poor solubility in physiological fluids → uric acid crystallises out of solution → forming insoluble uric acid crystals. • Uric acid crystals are recognised as foreign bodies by the immune system → initiates inflammatory process → Recruitment of chemokines & inflammatory cells to site of uric acid crystallisation. • Hence, gout is an inflammatory condition, characterised by swelling, redness & pain in the extremities. • In kidneys → increased uric acid production or decreased excretion of uric acid by the kidney (due to deficits in kidney tubular transport) → then uric acid crystallises out of solution forming insoluble uric acid crystals → toxic to kidney cells → kidney damage. • Gout recurrent bouts of arthritis due to uric acid crystal deposition in the joints, kidneys & other soft tissues. Causes of Gout Include: • High uric acid production e.g. enzyme abnormalities such as HGPRT deficiency (salvage pathways) • Deficits in kidney tubular transport • Low excretion due to drugs eg. thiazide diuretics • High uric acid production due to increased cell breakdown eg. severe infection, or cancers such as leukaemia with breakdown of uric acid-rich white blood cells. Signs of GoutTreatment for Gout • Reduce acute arthritis – colchicine or anti-inflammatory drugs (eg. Ibuprofen & aspirin) • Colchicine is a phagocytosis inhibitor → inhibits macrophage activity • Enhance uric acid excretion in tubules eg. Probenecid • Reduce uric acid in the blood eg. Allopurinol → a xanthine oxidase competitive inhibitor. Allopurinol use in GoutIn Summary • Nucleotides are crucial building blocks for nucleic acids (DNA & RNA), signalling molecules (cAMP), coenzymes (NADPH) & some drug molecules. • Nucleotide metabolism is tightly regulated & according to cell needs • 2 important nucleotide synthetic pathways: ➢ De novo synthesis (synthesis of fresh/new nucleotides) → for tissue cells that divide rapidly & therefore require greater quantities of nucleotides ➢ Salvage pathways (recycling of pre-formed bases) → quick way that slow-dividing tissue cells use to generate nucleotides (eg. brain & erythrocytes) • Negative feedback regulation by products on the rate-limiting reaction step. • Catabolism of purines to uric acid (poorly soluble in physiological fluids & lower temperatures at the extremities) → in excess leads to uric acid crystallisation & gout at the extremities. • In contrast, catabolism of pyrimidines yields highly water-soluble products (CO2 & NH3) that are easily excreted from the body → thus pyrimidine catabolism does not cause gout.
