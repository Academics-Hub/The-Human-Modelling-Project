This newtechnique avoids complex experimental protocols by only requiring data from a standard meal tolerance test. Unlike other model-basedapproaches, this new approach does not require a gastrointestinal model, which leads to a much simpler solution. Furthermore, this noveltechnique requires the identification of only one parameter of the minimal model because the rest of the model parameters are consideredto have small variability. In order to account for such variability as well as to account for errors associated to measurements, intervalanalysis has been employed.ResultsThe current technique has been validated using data from a United States Food and Drug Administration-accepted type 1 diabetessimulator [root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.77] and successfully tested with two clinical data sets from the literature (RMSE = 0.69).ConclusionsThe presented technique for the estimation of Ra showed excellent results when tested with simulated and actual clinical data. Thesimplicity of this new technique makes it suitable for large clinical research studies for the evaluation of the role of Ra in patients withimpairments in glucose metabolism. In addition, this technique is being used to build a model library of mixed meals that could beincorporated into diabetic subject simulators in order to account for more realistic and varied meals.Summary of SectionsIntroduction:a. Purpose of the study is to develop a simple and robust method for estimating glucose rate of appearance (Ra) from mixed meals.b. Importance of accurate Ra estimation for understanding postprandial metabolism and diabetes management.c. Existing methods have limitations, such as requiring arterialized venous blood samples or complex mathematical models.Methods:a. Proposed method uses a simple two-compartment model with only two variables: glucose appearance rate (Ra) and glucose effectivedistribution volume (Veff).b. Model is based on the minimal model of glucose-insulin dynamics, which has been widely used in previous studies.c. Data from a mixed meal tolerance test is used to estimate Ra and Veff using nonlinear least squares optimization.Results:BacklinksBiomedical Engineering papersA Simple Robust Method for Estimating the Glucose Rate of Appearance from Mixed MealsAbstractBackgroundEstimating the rate of glucose appearance (Ra) after ingestion of a mixed meal may be highly valuable in diabetes management. Thegold standard technique for estimating Ra is the use of a multitracer oral glucose protocol. However, this technique is complex and isusually not convenient for large studies. Alternatively, a simpler approach based on the glucose-insulin minimal model is available.The main drawback of this last approach is that it also requires a gastrointestinal model, something that may lead to identifiabilityproblems.a. The proposed method provides accurate and robust estimation of Ra from mixed meals.b. Comparison with other methods shows that the proposed method has better performance in terms of precision, accuracy, and stability.c. The method is applicable to both healthy individuals and patients with diabetes.Conclusion:a. The proposed simple and robust method for estimating glucose Ra from mixed meals is a valuable tool for understanding postprandialmetabolism and diabetes management.b. The method can be used in future studies to investigate the effects of different diets, medications, or lifestyle interventions on glucosemetabolism.c. Further validation and refinement of the method are needed before it can be widely applied in clinical practice.Key Takeaways:1. A simple and robust method for estimating glucose Ra from mixed meals is developed.2. The proposed method provides accurate and stable estimation, outperforming other methods.3. The method is applicable to both healthy individuals and patients with diabetes.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
