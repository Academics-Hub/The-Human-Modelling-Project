In this regard, abnormalities of either sensory, motor or autonomic function may occur. Your understanding of the sensory, motor or autonomic disturbances that may accompany neural disease is obviously largely dependent on whether you have understood the normal control of these functions. The present practical sessions will provide you with an opportunity to assess a number of normal neural functions on yourselves, understand the physiological mechanisms responsible for these neural functions, and interpret abnormalities of neural function that are provided for you. With respect to abnormalities of sensation, these may include a decrease in the peripheral somatic senses of touch, vibration, position sensation, pressure, two-point discrimination, pain and temperature and these sensory abnormalities can be tested clinically. Moreover, a decrease in the special senses of vision, hearing, taste or smell may occur depending on where the neural damage has occurred. Again these functions may be tested clinically. In some instances somatic sensation may increase rather than decrease causing excessive pain and discomfort and you will learn the physiological mechanisms of these changes in lectures. In many circumstances abnormalities of sensory function may manifest as decreases in autonomic reflexes, reflexes which you will also have the opportunity of observing in the present practical sessions. With respect to a potential impact of diseases on the motor component of the nervous system, this may produce a variety of functional disturbances depending on where the damage has occurred. In this regard motor function may be assessed by testing the power of muscle groups, muscle tone and muscle reflexes in the periphery. You will learn of disease processes which may decrease motor power, but may increase reflexes and muscle tone. Thus, an understanding of the control of muscle reflexes and muscle tone is as important as an understanding of what controls movement. Furthermore, a number of motor functions of the head and neck are controlled by cranial nerves, which if damaged may result in a decline in a variety of head and neck movements, all of which can be tested clinically. Moreover, some neural disturbances influence motor function by limiting the co-ordination of movement or preventing the initiation of movement. An understanding of the normal control of these movements is essential for your understanding of clinical abnormalities. Further, as with sensory function, abnormalities of motor function may also manifest as decreases in autonomic 3 reflexes, reflexes which you will have the opportunity of observing in the present practical sessions. With respect to a potential impact of diseases on the autonomic component of the nervous system, as has been indicated in the aforementioned discussion, some of these functions are tested through a variety of reflexes, reflexes which are mainly considered as combinations of sensory and motor abnormalities to viscera. You will have the opportunity of observing some of these reflexes in the present practical sessions and interpreting abnormalities of these reflexes. However, you will also be provided with an opportunity to perform many of the tests of autonomic neural function in the cardiovascular practical sessions. Importantly, clinical cases are provided in these practical sessions against which you should compare your findings and answer the questions given. Much of the clinical data of the “paper” patient’s given to you in the course of this practical session can be found in the appendix. You should however, obtain the missing data from information provided at the practical. Practical 3 stations Special senses STATION A: Hearing A-1: Sound localization. A-2: The Rinne and Weber tests.

There are a number of somatic sensations which allow us to perceive our environment of which “touch” is only one of these sensations. The different forms of somatic sensations that exist have been listed in the general introduction to practical sessions 3 and 4. These somatic sensations are perceived by all parts of our bodies with the exception of the viscera, with some parts being more sensitive to these sensations than others. In the present practical you will be given the opportunity to observe the perception of a variety of somatic sensations through assessments performed on others, or to appreciate these somatic sensations for yourself. You will also be given the opportunity to assess your knowledge or gain further knowledge of the physiological mechanisms that explain your ability to perceive these sensations. Moreover, the present practical will allow you to perform a series of observations that will test the special senses of vision, hearing, taste and smell. Many of the tests of both somatic and special sensations that you will be performing in the present practical session are used clinically to assess sensory function. Abnormalities of these sensory functions noted in patients with neural disease will be described to you in the clinical “paper” cases provided. You should take the opportunity to assess your understanding of the physiological mechanisms that explain perception of these sensations, by answering questions related to these clinical “paper” cases. 1. Special senses Station A: Hearing Hearing is a sensation that may be affected by neural damage as well as by damage to various structures that are not part of the nervous system, but are essential to effective hearing. During the course of this practical you will perform a series of tests that not only identify hearing defects, but also distinguish between damage to nervous system as opposed to other structures. 6 This part of the practical should be performed in a quiet area. In the present practical, stations A-2 and A-3 are commonly employed clinical tests of hearing. Station A-1 is a task given to you to demonstrate the factors that affect your ability to localize sound. STATION A-1 Sound localization Although usually not tested for clinically, the ability to identify the origin of sound (sound localization) has major functional implications. You should imagine the consequences to your daily function if this were something that you were unable to perform well. One example of how this could affect your daily function is to think of what would happen to you if you were unable to detect the origin of a source of potential danger through sound, such as a vehicle approaching when crossing a street. You would only be able to detect the danger if you visualized the vehicle. The mechanisms responsible for the ability to detect the sources of sound will be highlighted in the present practical. In order to assess the major factor that determines your ability to localize sound you should perform the following tasks at STATION A-1: - One member of a pair of students should be blind-folded and seated in an open area. - Using a device that generates a clicking sound, the student who is not blind-folded should produce sound at a variety of angles in a 360o arc around the person who is blind-folded. The blind-folded person should point to where she/he thinks the sound originates from. - Repeat this task after occluding one of the ears of the blind-folded person with cotton wool. Record the effect that cotton wool placed in the blind-folded person’s one ear has on the ability to localize sound. …………………………………………………….……………………………………. ………………………………………………………………………………………….. 7 Questions 1) Is a reduction in hearing the only reason for the altered ability of the blind- folded person to localize sound after as compared to before the cotton wool has been placed in the ear? Explain your answer. 2) Indicate FOUR clinical abnormalities that may result in an inability to localize sound and explain the physiological reasons for this hearing disturbance. STATION A-2 Rinne and Weber tests Most sound reaches the inner ear and ultimately the brain, via conduction through the auditory canal (outer ear), eardrum (tympanic membrane), and middle ear ossicles (see Figure to orientate yourselves). Some sound however, is conducted through the bone of the skull (e.g. when you speak). As conduction via the auditory canal to the middle ear is initially through air, this is called air conduction. Conduction of sound through the bone of the skull is called bone conduction. 8 When diseases of the outer ear or the middle ear (eg. the ossicles [malleus, incus and stapes]) cause a reduced hearing, they will affect only air conduction, as sound conducted through bone does not require the outer or middle ears to activate the inner ear. When diseases of the inner ear (cochlea) or the neural pathways necessary for hearing (auditory nerve or auditory pathways) occur, both air and bone conduction will be affected as sound conducted through either air or bone will not be able to activate the neural components of hearing. These are the principles that underlie the interpretation of the Rinne’s and the Weber’s tests, clinical tests performed to assist with the interpretation of the cause of hearing abnormalities. The following will give you an opportunity to perform and understand the interpretation of these tests. Importantly, bone conduction is tested by activating a vibration in a tuning fork and placing the base of the tuning fork over a bony part of the skull. In contrast, air conduction is tested by activating a vibration in a tuning fork and placing the tuning fork in the air, but close to the outer ear. Rinne’s test In order that you may assess air and bone conduction of sound, you should perform the following tasks at STATION A-2 - Strike a tuning fork with a vibration rate of 256 Hz on a wooden surface and place the base of the fork on the mastoid bone behind the left ear. - Hold the fork in place until the sound is no longer audible and record this time. Left ear bone conduction duration……………………………………………….. - Immediately move the fork to a few centimeters from the left ear. - Hold the fork in place until the sound is no longer audible and record this time. Left ear air conduction………………………………………………………………. Repeat the process in the right ear and record the times until the sound from the tuning fork is no longer audible. Right ear bone conduction duration…………………………………………………. Right ear air conduction duration....………………………………………………… 9 Questions 1) Give a physiological explanation for the difference in the time taken for sounds to become inaudible when the tuning fork is placed over the mastoid process as opposed to next to the ear. 2) Giving reasons for your choice in each case, indicate whether the following clinical abnormalities would result in either a decrease in air conduction whilst bone conduction is maintained; or a decrease in both air and bone conduction. a) A middle ear infection. b) Trauma to the head resulting in damage to the VIIIth cranial nerve. To mimic an abnormality of the outer ear, place a piece of cotton wool in the left ear and repeat the process in the left ear at STATION A-2 noting the consequence for bone and air conduction times of an abnormality of the outer ear. Left ear air conduction…………………………………………………………….. Left ear bone conduction…………………………………………………………… Questions 1) Explain the differences in the duration of time noted after placing a piece of cotton wool in the left air to: a) bone conduction. b) air conduction Weber’s test Although in the interests of time, we will not expect you to have performed the Weber’s test in the present practical session, it is nevertheless, still worth describing the test and discussing the principles that underscore the interpretation of the data. In essence the Weber’s test is performed in the same way as the Rinne’s test except that the base of the tuning fork is placed in the centre of the forehead instead of over the mastoid process. 10 The interpretation of the results of the Weber’s test is similar to the Rinne’s test, but there are some differences. Indeed, when placing the tuning fork over the centre of the forehead in a patient with partial or full deafness in one ear, the sound may localize to one ear as opposed to the other depending on the cause of the abnormality. If the cause of the abnormality is damage to the inner ear, auditory nerve or the brain’s auditory pathways on one side, the sound will localize to the opposite ear for obvious reasons. However, if the damage is to the outer or the middle ear, the sound will localize to the SAME side as the damage. This is because the damage has obliterated external (background) sounds and hence made it easier to detect sounds transmitted through bone. To experience the effect of damage to the outer or middle ear on the localization of sound to one ear, you should block one ear with cotton wool or something that won’t damage your outer ear and then say something to yourself. You should be able to hear yourself better on the side that has had the outer ear blocked. Question Explain why the ability to hear sound conducted through bone is better in the ear which has a middle ear infection than in the intact ear. STATION A-3 Audiometry The Rinne’s and Weber’s tests are common tests that are performed to provide insights into the potential causes of obvious deafness. However, to detect the presence of more subtle forms of deafness or the degree of deafness, requires formal audiometry testing. The following practical provides you with an opportunity to conduct an audiometry test or to have an audiometry test conducted on you. Importantly, when performing this assessment, it is important to note that the degree to which the sound intensity has to be increased above the normal level (zero reference), gives a measure of the degree of hearing loss and that volume (loudness) is measured in decibels. 11 To assess hearing, use the audiometer provided at STATION A-3 as described: - Place the earphones provided, in position. - Starting at the lowest frequency, test the lowest sound level audible to your laboratory partner. Record the decibels required for your partner to hear at this frequency on the audiogram supplied. - Gradually increasing the frequency of the sounds, test the lowest sound level audible to your laboratory partner at each frequency and record these values. - Repeat the above measurements using the electronic vibrator placed over the mastoid process rather than the headphones and again record the values. Questions 1) Give a physiological explanation for the necessity to test the lowest sound level audible at different sound frequencies, rather than just at one frequency. 2) Indicate and explain the differences in the results obtained with headphones as compared to the results obtained with the electronic vibrator placed over the mastoid process. Station B: Vision The perception of vision is not simply determined by visual acuity, but also by a number of alternative factors including colour perception, the ability to focus on a near point, the breadth of the visual fields, the ability to perceive shapes and recognize objects, amongst other functions. Some of these functions may deteriorate with age and do not necessarily herald the onset of major neurological abnormalities (e.g. abnormalities in visual acuity may reflect changes in the eye itself) and may be rectified by the use of prescription lenses. However, abnormalities of some of these functions may indicate major clinical problems. Consequently, the clinical testing of these functions forms part of many routine tests in health science practice. This practical session will expose you to some of these tests and their interpretations and thus provide you with an opportunity to better understand the physiological mechanisms that contribute toward the functions that allow for appropriate visual perception. A series of questions will guide you as to the mechanisms that you should consider when disturbances in these functions occur. 12 STATION B-1 Colour vision There are many specialized components of the nervous system that contribute toward our overall perception of colour. These include unique characteristics of the cells within the retina, integration of this information in the primary visual cortex and even higher integration of neuronal information in association visual cortices. Colour blindness is a fairly common abnormality that is noted from an early age and occurs without major pathology occurring in the brain. However, with neural damage, colour blindness may manifest later in life. To detect colour blindness, specialized tests have been developed with dots consisting of multiple contrasting colours arranged to make up the form of numbers. If you have a normal ability to detect colour, you will be able to appropriately perceive the numbers. Abnormalities of the ability to detect colour will result in an inability to perceive some of the numbers. This test was originally designed by the scientist Ishihara and hence the cards used to assess colour blindness are therefore called “Ishihara cards”. To assess your ability to perceive colour, at STATION B-1 follow the instructions provided on the PowerLab tutor and read the numbers on the Ishihara cards provided. If you have a normal colour vision, you should also click on the images provided on the PowerLab tutor that indicate what you would see if you did have abnormal colour vision. STATION B-2 Visual acuity Visual acuity refers to the capacity to perceive details and contours of an object and is usually tested through the assessment of the ability to read letters of different sizes, assuming that the person has been schooled to read. This test was developed by the ophthalmologist named Snellen and hence the charts used are called “Snellen charts”. Variations on this test (using shapes) are available for persons who have not been schooled to read. Visual acuity is determined by a number of factors in the eye 13 itself as well as the presence of intact visual pathways and primary visual cortices. The ability to recognize the objects visualized is dependent on the association visual cortex. To assess visual acuity at STATION B-2, you or your laboratory partner should perform the following: - Remove all visual aides (prescription lenses). - Stand 6 meters (20 feet) away from a Snellen chart and cover one eye (the right eye). - The other person should stand next to the chart and point to each of the letters starting at the top of the chart. The person standing 6 meters away should read the letters and the person standing next to the chart should note the last line of which all the letters were read correctly. Record this line. Last line read correctly with the left eye…………………………………………… - Repeat the process with the other eye (left) covered. Last line read correctly with the right eye………………………………………… Visual acuity is expressed as 6 over the number indicated in the right of the chart next to the last line read correctly. Assuming that the number indicated in the right of the chart next to the last line read correctly is 36, this would indicate that the ability to resolve visual images at 6 meters is what a normal person can resolve at 36 meters. If your partner wears visual aides, repeat the test with the visual aides in place and record as before: 14 Questions 1) Record the visual acuity of: a) your laboratory partner’s or your own left eye without visual aides. .……………………………………………………………………………. b) your laboratory partner’s or your own right eye without visual aides. .……………………………………………………………………………. 2) If you or your laboratory partner normally wear visual aides, record the visual acuity of: a) your laboratory partner’s or your own left eye with visual aides. .……………………………………………………………………………. b) your laboratory partner’s or your own right eye with visual aides. .……………………………………………………………………………. 3) Interpret, providing an explanation, the visual acuity scores that you have recorded above: STATION B-3 Visual near point The visual “near point” is considered the closest point to the eye at which vision of an object remains clear (can be focused). Clarity of vision when focusing on near objects, depends on a number of factors within the eyes itself, the most important being the lens which modifies its curvature (accommodates) in response to the distance that an object is from the eye, as well as the iris which constricts in response to the distance that an object is from the eye. The lens and the iris are controlled by the autonomic nervous system and hence the ability to focus on near objects can be considered a function of the nervous system. 15 To determine the nearest point to the eyes at which one can focus, perform the following task at STATION B-3: - Using the “near-point” ruler provided, place the “zero-end” on the bridge of the nose. - With the person’s eyes closed, the observer should move the “letter-holder” to the “zero-end” of the ruler and place a letter in the holder. - Move the “letter-holder” slowly away from the nose until the person can read the letter clearly. Record the distance between the subject’s eye and the letter, as marked on the ruler. Near point…………………………………………………………………………….. Normal near point values: Age (years) 10 20 30 40 50 60 Near point (cm) 9 10 13 18 53 83 Questions 1) Indicate the physiological mechanisms that allow you to focus on a near point, commenting on the: a) cranial nerve involved in focusing vision on a near point b) muscle in the eye which contracts to focus vision on a near point. c) effect of the muscle indicated in your answer to “b” on the shape of the lens. d) effect of the change in lens shape on light passing through it. 2) Describe the effect of focusing on a near point on pupil diameter and explain the physiological mechanisms that mediate this effect and the impact that this change has on light reaching the retinal surface. 3) Explain the sudden increase in the near point after the age of 40 years. 16 STATION B-4 Fields of vision The capacity to perceive objects visually whilst looking straight ahead is determined by visual fields. This function has obvious advantages in that one may look at one object whilst still able to scan peripheral fields. The value of this function is highlighted by many examples. In this regard, one such example is that this function aids in communication. That is, you may talk to one person whilst “sensing” the reaction to your comments of another person, who is standing to the side of you. Another example is, whilst looking at one object of interest, you may detect approaching objects in your peripheral fields, which may either be of additional interest or may alert you to the need to move away. A further example is that an ability to see peripheral visual fields allows one to follow a sentence when reading. By focusing on the word that is being read, but perceiving the direction that your eyes should follow, you are able to quickly move onto adjacent words. Fields of vision are determined by a number of functions of the eye itself and of visual pathways. Clinically however, testing of visual fields is useful to detect abnormalities of visual pathways. The following figure shows the visual pathways and the defects (as indicated by dark shading in the left and right visual fields) that may occur with damage to various components of these pathways. This illustration can be better viewed on the poster provided in the practical. 17 In order to assess your fields of vision, you should use the field of vision disc at STATION B-4, as instructed. In addition, fields of vision may be tested in clinical settings using a simple, but nevertheless crude approach. This is assessed as follows: - Look straight ahead and cover one eye with your hand. - An observer should move their finger in the field of vision to the sides of the head, above the head and below the head. Record the most peripheral field that the person can still observe movement of the finger. - The other eye should then be covered with a hand and the process repeated. Question Using the above diagram provided to assist you with your answer, explain the visual field defects illustrated in the diagram with lesions in the: a) optic chiasma. b) optic tract, lateral geniculate body or optic radiation. Eye Optic tract Lateral geniculate body Optic radiation Optic chiasma Optic nerve Occipital cortex A B Lesion of Optic nerve Optic chiasma Optic tract Lateral geniculate body Optic radiation Direction of light 18 STATION B-5 Observing the retinal surface. This practical provides an opportunity for you to view the retinal surface, the only part of the body where you can clearly observe the intact microvasculature and nerves using non-invasive techniques. Observing the retinal surface is performed using an ophthalmoscope. It is often called fundoscopy, as it is important in many clinical settings to observe the retinal fundus (disc and surrounding vessels). Later in your careers you will use this technique to support important clinical diagnoses. However, at this time you should view the retinal surface attempting to observe components of the following images using the technique described below: Optic disc 19 To visualize the retinal surface, you should perform the following at STATION B-5. - Sit the person whose eye you are observing directly in front of you. - Indicate to the person whose eye you are observing to look past your head and focus directly on a spot behind you. Also indicate that they should not look at you or at the light as it shines into their eye, but keep focusing on the spot behind your head. - Turn the “focus” dial to indicate 0 and place the ophthalmoscope against your right eye. - Shine the light of the ophthalmoscope into the person’s right eye and gradually approach their eye with the ophthalmoscope from a distance. - You should be able to see through the pupil, lens and vitreous humour and immediately visualize the retina. You should only be able to visualize a portion of retina the size indicated in the photograph (see white box). You will recognize it by the presence of vessels passing through a dull orange background of nerves. - If it is out of focus turn the dial counter-clockwise until the focus improves. - Keep holding the ophthalmoscope against the person’s eye and gently move it so that you are able to visualize vessels in the retina. With persistence you should also be able to view the optic disc (see photograph). Although the macula and fovea are illustrated, it is unlikely that you will be able to see these clearly. - Repeat the procedure with your left eye visualizing the person’s left eye. Questions 1) Using the above diagrams to assist you, indicate the portion of the retinal surface where light reaching the retina is: a) most likely to translate into effective visual images. b) unable to translate into visual images and hence produce a “blind spot”. 2) The arterioles and venules in the retinal surface follow parallel pathways. Describe the appearance of the arterioles and the venules indicating the characteristic features of each. 20 Station C: The chemical senses Taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are special sensations detected by sensory organs on the tongue and in the nose and conveyed by a number of cranial nerves to the brain. These sensations may be affected in diseases, depending on which part of the nervous system is damaged, and recently have been shown to be altered in many people with COVID-19. Consequently, they are sometimes tested as part of a neurological examination. Moreover, they are affected by dental procedures and dental disease and hence should be sensations that dental practitioners understand. The following series of tasks will provide you with an opportunity to better understand the physiology of taste and smell. STATION C-1 Taste adaptation Your appreciation of the taste of fluids imbibed or food ingested, does adapt. To assess gustatory adaptation you should perform the following task at STATION C-1 - Place a sweet near the tip of your tongue and close your mouth. - Keep the sweet in place and do not move your tongue for ~60 seconds noting your appreciation of the taste. - Move your tongue and compare your appreciation of the taste. Questions Explain the changes in your appreciation of the taste of the sweet when a) keeping your tongue and mouth still for ~60 second. b) moving your tongue again. STATIONS C-2 Olfaction Olfaction is the ability to sense odours (smell). It is an important part of our lives as it contributes toward our emotional well-being and is a strong trigger of memories. Olfaction is mediated by olfactory receptors in the mucosa of the nose and olfactory sensation is conveyed by cranial nerve I. Diseases of the nervous system may result in abnormalities of olfaction and hence olfactory tests are sometimes employed 21 in the clinical examination. Diseases of the base of the brain which influence cranial nerve I or its central pathways may decrease olfactory capacity. Activation of olfactory cortical regions may occur in patients with epilepsy, and these patients may report imaginary odours. To test your olfactory capacity, at STATION C-2 - Smell the contents of each vial - Categorise the odour emanating from each vial into one the primary qualities of odour, which include floral (e.g., roses), ethereal (e.g., pears), musk (e.g., musk), camphorous (e.g. eucalyptus), putrid (e.g. rotten eggs) or pungent (e.g., vinegar). ……………………………………………………………………………………. To experience olfactory adaptation - Hold one nostril closed and repeatedly breathe in through the open nostril and out through the mouth with a bottle of perfume or alcohol held beneath the open nostril. - Note the time taken for the odour to disappear. - When the smell disappears, open the other nostril, repeat the procedure and note the change in the odour. ………………………………………………………………………………………….. To test the impact of odour on the appreciation of taste - Ask a colleague to hold both nostrils closed, close their eyes and protrude their tongue. - Place either a piece of apple, onion or potato on their tongue and ask them to identify each in turn. - Repeat the process with the nostrils open and identify whether your colleague’s ability to identify the item tasted was better with or without the nose closed. ………………………………………………………………………………………… 22 2. Somatic senses Primary somatic sensations (sensations that do not require higher levels of neuronal integration) include both cutaneous and muscle or joint sensations. Cutaneous sensations include touch, pressure, vibration, two-point discrimination, pain and temperature. Muscle and joint sensations also include pressure and vibration, but most importantly, muscle and joint receptors mediate position sensation (proprioception). The ability to appreciate these different somatic sensory modalities is determined largely by specialized features of sensory receptors and it is these features that you will study in lectures. Higher somatic sensory functions include the ability to identify forms placed in the hand without observing these forms visually and the ability to recognize different surface textures using touch. To appreciate these higher order sensations, close your eyes and pick up different objects and attempt to identify them or close your eyes and run your hands over surfaces with different textures. Although some higher somatic sensory functions are conferred by sensory receptor specializations, primary somatic sensory features only translate into appropriately ordered higher somatic sensatory functions once primary somatic sensory information is conveyed from the primary sensory cortex to certain areas of the cerebral hemispheres called the association sensory cortices. Thus, higher ordered sensory function still depends on the primary somatic senses. The focus of the present practical will therefore be on the primary somatic senses. The location of damage in the brain or peripheral nervous system can be pin- pointed by testing primary sensory functions. This is because different neural pathways convey different primary sensations. Thus, an important aspect of the clinical examination is to assess the primary somatic sensations. It is also important to understand how damage to different brain regions translates into different functional deficits, largely because some, but not other primary somatic sensations are affected by damage to specific areas of the brain. The present practical will give you the opportunity to appreciate the different primary somatic sensations and the chance to translate abnormalities of these functions noted in patients into a better understanding of the neural pathways that convey these sensations. 23 STATION D-1 Touch The ability to sense “touch” is tested clinically with a piece of cotton wool, stretched out to a point, which is then used to lightly stroke a skin surface with the patient’s eyes closed. The patient is requested to indicate when something is touching the skin. In the present practical however, we wish you to appreciate how different skin areas are more or less sensitive to the ability to localize touch using an approach which is not necessarily routinely used in clinical settings. To assess the capacity to localize touch in different skin regions perform the following task at STATION D-1: - Blindfold the person on whom the test is being performed. - Lightly touch the flexor surface of the forearm with the tip of a felt-tipped pen. - The person assessed must immediately indicate on the arm, using another felt- tipped pen, the area of the arm which had been touched. (The person should not be allowed to revise their estimate). - Using a ruler, measure the error in millimeters. - Repeat the procedure on a finger-tip. Distance between estimated point and actual point touched on the: forearm………………………………………………. finger………………………………………………… Questions 1) Give physiological reasons for differences in the distance between the estimated point and actual point touched on the forearm and the finger. 2) Explain the distribution of the abnormalities of touch in clinical case A given in the appendix to this practical. 3) Give a physiological reason why the abnormalities in touch in clinical cases C and D in the appendix to this practical were on the opposite side to the side of the damage in the central nervous system. 24 STATION D-2 Two-point discrimination Part of the ability to detect subtle differences in surfaces and hence to appreciate the texture and shape of objects using touch, is based on whether or not you are able to distinguish between two separate points, touching the surface of the skin, at the same time. The capacity to identify that two rather than one point on the skin is being activated, is called two-point discrimination. This capacity is largely determined by complicated functions of synaptic networks of ascending sensory information conveyed via the dorsal columns of the spinal cord to the sensory cortex, as well as by the density of receptors in a particular skin area. From a clinical perspective, it therefore provides important information regarding spinal cord pathways affected by disease processes. To assess two-point discrimination at STATION D-2 you should perform the following: - Blindfold the person who is being assessed. - Using a pair of dividers or calipers held as closely together as possible, touch the surface of the tip of the person’s finger with each point. - If the person can only detect a single point touching the finger, widen the dividers or calipers and repeat the procedure until the person can detect two distinct points on the finger tip. - Measure and record the distance between the two points. Two-point discrimination on finger tip……………………………………………… - Repeat the procedure on the person’s neck or on the forearm and measure and record the distance between the two points. Two-point discrimination on neck or forearm..…………………………………… 25 Questions 1) Explain the difference in two-point discrimination thresholds between the different areas of the body. 2) Explaining your answer, describe the abnormalities in two-point discrimination thresholds that are likely to occur in case B given in the appendix for the present practical. STATION D-3 Position sensation (proprioception) Position sensation is the ability to appreciate the position of your body without having to observe where it is. This practical is designed to study the sense of position mediated by somatic receptors. You should nevertheless, never forget that position sensation is also an important function of the vestibular system. The importance of somatic position sensory system is best underscored using everyday examples. For example, although you may take this for granted, you know where your feet are when you are walking, driving or cycling without having to look down to watch where they are. You should try and appreciate how difficult your life would be if you constantly had to watch your feet in order to know where you are putting them. Position sensation is determined by a number of receptors largely found in the joints, muscles (muscle spindles) and tendons (Golgi tendon organs). The sensations that allow you too appreciate the position of various parts of your body at any one time are conveyed via the dorsal columns in the spinal cord and these neurons ultimately synapse in the brainstem, thalamus and the sensory cortex. 26 To assess position sensation, you should perform the following three tasks at STATION D-3. The first task is the following: - Sit directly opposite a person whose position senses you wish to assess. - Put up your index finger directly in front of you at shoulder level and ask the person to reach up and touch your fingertip. - Now ask the person to close their eyes and repeat the procedure. The second task is a preferred method in clinical settings and is performed as follows: - Ask a person whose position senses you wish to assess to remove their shoes and socks and lie down on the couch provided. - Ask the person to look at their feet and relax their toes. - Hold the large toe and move it up, down and then back to the middle for the person. Indicate each time what you are doing. - Ask the person to close their eyes and then again move the large toe into different positions asking the person to indicate the position each time you move the toe. The third task is also a preferred method in clinical settings and is called the Romberg’s test. It is performed as follows: - Stand with your legs together and your eyes open. - Stand on one leg and remain balanced. - Close your eyes and again stand on one leg. Questions 1) Explaining your answer, suggest possible symptoms (complaints) that patients with defects of neuronal pathways that convey proprioceptor information may report. 2) Explain why patients with abnormalities of the dorsal columns would be able to improve their ability to balance if they were to look at their limbs (i.e. balance tested with eyes open) (positive Romberg’s sign). 3) Explain the proprioceptor abnormalities noted in clinical cases A-D given in the appendix to the present practical session. 27 STATION D-4 Pressure and vibration The ability to sense vibration or pressure has obvious advantages. With respect to vibration, this may be useful to sense the approach of mobile objects (persons or vehicles) or impending earthquakes. With respect to pressure, when we sit, lie down or stand, constant pressure is exerted on those parts of our bodies that are in contact with outside surfaces. This may be excessive and hence limit blood flow to these areas. An awareness of excessive pressure warns us that we need to move to improve blood flow to those areas. If we are not aware of the excess force and thus the need to act by moving away from the stimulus, the consequence may be a reduced blood supply and ischaemic (lack of blood supply) cell death of these skin areas (these are called pressure sores). An inability to detect excessive pressure produced by damage to nerves conveying this sense of pressure therefore has dire consequences. Vibratory sensory information is sensed by receptors that rapidly adapt (hence suited to repeated intermittent stimulation) and is conveyed via the posterior (dorsal) column of the spinal cord. Pressure sensory information is sensed by receptors that do not adapt and are found in deep tissues. Pressure signals are conveyed by both the dorsal columns and the spinothalamic tracts in the spinal cord. Vibration and pressure sensations may be tested clinically. Pressure sensations are easily tested by assessing the ability of patients to sense pressure placed on muscles or tendons. Vibration is tested using a tuning fork as follows: To assess vibration sensation, at STATION D-4 perform the following task: - Ask a member of your group to remove their shoes and socks. - Strike a tuning fork with a low rate of vibration (~128 Hz) on a hard wooden surface. - Place the base of the tuning fork on a variety of bony protuberances (ankles, sides of feet, wrist, elbow, etc.) of the person and ask the person if they can feel the vibration. 28 Questions 1) Indicate the somatic sensory receptor most suited to mediating vibratory sensations and indicate the physiological characteristics of the receptor that mediate this effect. 2) Explain the abnormalities in vibration sensation noted in clinical cases A-D given in the appendix to the present practical session. STATION D-5 Pain and temperature Pain and temperature sensations have obvious survival advantages. These sensations are mediated by the same sensory receptors and are conveyed to the brain via the spinothalamic tracts in the spinal cord. As the measurement of temperature sensation requires a great deal of time to perform, we will not require that you complete this task in the present practical. However, you should know how it is performed. In this regard, temperature is tested by placing water of about 10o C and 45o C in separate glass flasks and holding them against different skin surfaces. The range of temperatures of the flasks is then altered by mixing the water from the two flasks. In the temperature range of 28-32o C, a normal person may be able to detect a 1o C difference in temperature. In the warm temperature range a normal person should readily be able to detect the difference between 35 and 40o C. In the cold temperature range a normal person should readily be able to detect the difference between 10 and 20o C. Pain can be tested in a number of ways. However, it is normally tested clinically by using a pin and gently pricking the surface of the skin. The patient is asked to comment not just on a sense of pressure, but also on the degree of sharpness of the sensation. However, the potential hazards of needle sticks prevent the use of this clinical test in the present practical. Nevertheless, there are many methods of assessing pain thresholds. One such test is to assess the response to painful pressure such as may be exerted when “pinching” someone’s skin. The present practical provides you with an opportunity to perform such a test in a controlled fashion. 29 In order to assess pain threshold (the maximal pain tolerated), at STATION D-5 perform the following tasks: - Blindfold one of your colleagues and ask them to remain quiet. - Place a dolorimeter over the pulp of your colleague’s finger. - Continue to place weights on the dolorimeter until it becomes uncomfortable. - Record the smallest force (number of weights) required to produce pain (pain threshold). Force (number of weights)…………………………………………………………… - Repeat the process whilst the person is counting backward from 100 in sevens. Force (number of weights)…………………………………………………………….. - Repeat the process whilst you are talking to the person. Force (number of weights)…………………………………………………………….. - Repeat the process with the blindfold removed. Force (number of weights)..….……………………………………………………….. Questions. 1) Give a physiological explanation for any differences in pain thresholds in the four circumstances given above. 2) Indicate the potential clinical application of the circumstances in which you have tested pain thresholds above. 3) Give a physiological explanation for the findings of reduced pain and temperature sensation on the opposite side of the body to the abnormalities of other somatic sensations in clinical case B given in the appendix to the present practical session. 4) Explain the abnormalities in pain and temperature sensation noted in clinical cases C and D given in the appendix to the present practical session. 30 APPENDIX CASES PROVIDED FOR EACH PRACTICAL PRACTICALS 3 AND 4 CASE A The patient whose magnetic resonance imaging scan of the spinal cord (see photographs posted in the laboratory for the clinical abnormality), whose lesion looks similar to that illustrated and whose legs are depicted below was noted to have the clinical signs listed: Compressed nerve Disc protrusion 31 - A reduction in all somatic sensations (including light touch, pain, temperature, vibration, pressure, proprioception and two-point discrimination) in the left leg following the distribution indicated in the diagram in the laboratory.
