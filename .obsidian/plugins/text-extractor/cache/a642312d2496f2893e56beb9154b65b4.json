More structured than PA. • These lectures will deal with the two main types of exercise – resistance (strength training) and aerobic (endurance training). • Exercise response • An acute physiological response refers to an immediate response of one or more of the bodies systems to exercise, such as the heart rate increasing as a gym member sits on the bike and starts their warm up. • Exercise adaptation • Physiological adaptations to exercise results from regular training (i. e after a training program). These include increases in cardiorespiratory capacity and strength. • Other terms • At the start of exercise, as physiological responses occur, we use the term ‘transition’. Later, when all the appropriate responses have been affected, the body is said to be exercising in ‘steady state’. • Steady state exercise can be maintained for long periods of time, and therefore will only occur at submaximal exercise intensities. Exercise intensity can increases up to a maximum point, but this will not be maintained for very long. • Incremental exercise occurs when there is a progressive increase in exercise intensity (which generally end at a maximal point). • VO2 max refers to the maximal aerobic capacity. Muscle fiber Myofibril Muscle fascicle surrounded by perimysium Epimysium surrounded by endomysium Skeletal Muscle In the figure above the structure of a muscle is outlined. The entire muscle is surrounded by an epimysium, which is a layer of connective tissue. The muscle is divided into different fascicles. Each fascicle is surrounded by a perimysium. Inside each fascicle several muscle fibers can be found. Each muscle fiber is surrounded by an endomysium. Inside each muscle fiber there are several myofibrils. These myofibrils contain sarcomeres that are arranged end on end. A sarcomere is the functional unit of a muscle. This nice neat arrangement is what gives muscles their striated appearance. Notice that the muscle fibers are innervated by a motor neuron coming from the central nervous system. A single motor unit can innervate only a few or many muscle fibers, and thus an action potential coming from a motor neuron will cause contraction of differing strengths. A motor neuron, in conjunction with the muscle fibers it innervated, is referred to as a motor unit. Sarcomeres are made up of myosin and actin filaments that are arranged in an overlapping fashion. The M line or middle line anchors the myosin filaments.The Z line on the outer edges hold the actin filaments. When a muscle contracts, the Z lines on each side will move closer toward the M line. The actin filaments contain myosin binding sites, and are surrounded by a protein string called tropomyosin. Each tropomyosin string contains a number of troponins. Troponin consists of three proteins that regulate muscle contraction. In the relaxed position, the troponin tropomyosin complex sits over the actin active sites and blocks interaction with myosin. Each myosin head contains an actin binding site and a myosin ATPase binding site. The heads are oriented outwards and towards the Z lines. When myosin heads bind to actin binding sites, they will undergo a power stroke, which pulls the actin molecule towards the M line. Revision: excitation-contraction coupling Terminal button T tubule 1. ACh released by axon terminal, crosses synaptic cleft and binds to receptor 2.AP generated in response to binding of ACh and travels through the sarcolemma to the T-tubules 3.AP in T- tubules triggers Ca2+ release from Sarcoplasmic reticulum 4.Ca2+ ions released bind to troponin on actin filaments, leads to tropomyosin being physically moved aside to uncover binding sites on actin 6. Ca2+ actively (ATP pump) taken up back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum when there is no longer local AP 7. With Ca2+ no longer bound to troponin, tropomyosin slips back to its blocking position over binding sites on actin, contraction ends 5. Myosin attach to actin and pull actin filaments towards center of sarcomere, powered by energy. Upon excitation, the motor neuron releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Ach). Ach will diffuse across the synaptic cleft (as per the mechanism described in the previous slide). An action potential is created on the sarcolemma. The action potential will travel down the T-tubule, where it will cause the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium that is released will diffuse to the contractile proteins, where it will bind to troponin. Binding of calcium to troponin will cause a conformational change whereby the tropomyosin- troponin complex is moved. This exposes the actin binding site. The myosin head can then bind to the actin binding site and contraction takes place. Following, the contraction, calcium is no longer bound to troponin and myosin dissociates from actin. The calcium is actively taken back up into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, where it is stored for the next contraction. Revision: excitation-contraction couplingRevision: cross bridge cycle An important side note here is that muscular contraction requires ATP at various locations. 1) ATP is hydrolysed by myosin during each power stroke. Remember that many power strokes are completed with each muscular contraction. 2) A fresh ATP is also required before the myosin head can detach from the actin (which is used during the next power stroke). 3) ATP is also needed to actively pump the calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum after each contraction. This action is performed by the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pump. Sliding Filament Theory During a muscle contraction, the myosin or actin filaments themselves do not shorten - rather the degree of overlap between the filaments will increase. During a contraction the actin filaments are pulled closer to the M line. Please watch the video on muscle contraction which can be found under the resources tab on SAKAI Watch the video below that provides a light- hearted summary of muscle contraction. Press play Fuel sources 1. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are stored in muscle and in the liver as glycogen. Glycogen therefore acts as an important fuel source for working muscles. Glycogen that is broken down enters the circulation as blood glucose, which can be taken up by cells under the action of insulin. Total glycogen stores are relatively small (300g in the muscles and 100g in the liver) and are normally depleted after approximately 90 minutes of high intensity exercsie. Liver glycogen is depleted within one day of starvation. Carbohydrates also have important roles as protein sparers. Since protein has many other important structural roles to play in the body, it should ideally not be oxidised for energy. Excessive use of protein for ATP energy results in loss of muscle mass and therefore strength. In this regard, the use of carbohydrates during exercise prevents excessive protein oxidation. Carbohydrates serve as primers for fat oxidation. It is important to appreciate that a reduction in Krebs cycle intermediates (due to glycogen depletion) results in a diminished rate of ATP production from fat metabolism, since fat can only be oxidised via Krebs cycle oxidation. Insufficient carbohydrates result in the production of ketone bodies from fatty acids which may contribute to metabolic acidosis and a reduction in the activity of enzymes involved in energy production. Lastly, carbohydrates serve as an important fuel source for the central nervous system, and red blood cells. Recall that red blood cells rely solely on anaerobic glycolysis for energy production. The production of ATP energy also requires some kind of substrate. There are three main macronutrients, which can act as fuel sources during exercise. Their roles during exercise is outlined below. 2. Lipids Free fatty acids that are derived from triglycerides can be used as fuel sources during mild to moderate exercise only. Fatty acids are the primary fuel source used for energy during rest. However, since the rate of energy production by beta-oxidation is slow (more details provided on page 27), high intensity exercise requires that energy production be supplemented by carbohydrates. During low-intensity, prolonged exercise, blood levels of epinephrine rise, which increases hormone sensitive lipase activity and thus promotes lipolysis. This increase in lipolysis results in increased FFA acid concentrations and thus promotes fat metabolism. 3. Protein To be used as a fuel source, proteins must first be degraded to amino acids. The role that amino acids play during exercise is relatively small and principally dependent on branched-chain amino acids, as well as the amino acid alanine. Skeletal muscle can directly metabolize branched-chain amino acids (eg valine, leucine and isoleucine) to produce ATP. Further, in the liver alanine can be converted to glucose and returned to the blood, whereby skeletal muscle can utilize it as a substrate. The enzymes that degrade muscle protein (proteases) are only activated during long-term exercise. Therefore, protein is generally only used as a fuel source when exercise is prolonged (3-4 hours) and when glycogen stores are depleted. Energy Systems Because ATP stores are limited, metabolic pathways must exist in the cell with the capability to produce ATP rapidly. There are three main biochemical processes whereby ATP can be produced in order to meet energy demands. These are referred to as energy systems and include 1. Breakdown of phosphocreatine 2. Anaerobic glycolysis 3. Oxidative phosphorylation Anaerobic Energy production and high energy phosphates A small amount of energy stored as ATP is found in muscles. ATP is often called the universal energy donor. It couples the energy released from food stuff into a usable form of energy required by all cells. This stored ATP is important during the first ~2 seconds of muscle contraction and/or movement. Thereafter, ATP needs to be produced by one of the three energy systems. ADP + Pi + energyATPaseATP Anaerobic Systems 1. Creatine phosphate (PC) PC +ADP ATP + C Creatine kinase The simplest, and consequently, the most rapid method of producing ATP involves the donation of a phosphate group and its bond energy from phosphocreatine (PC) to ADP to form ATP. Phosphocreatine is effectively broken down in this reaction, which is catalysed by the enzyme creatine kinase. The combination of stored ATP and PC is called the ATP-PC system. It provides energy for muscular contraction at the onset of exercise and during short-term, high intensity exercise. PC reformation requires ATP and occurs only during recovery from exercise. The amount of phosphocreatine stored within a muscle is limited. 2. Anaerobic glycolysis Glucose Lactic acid + 2 ATP many steps Advantages of anaerobic metabolism are: Energy is available immediately. Stored where needed. Does not require oxygen. Disadvantages: Limited supply Glycolysis involves the breakdown of glucose to form two molecules of pyruvic acid. However, when oxygen is not available (as in anaerobic glycolysis) two molecules of lactic acid is formed instead. This process involves a series of enzymatically catalysed, coupled reactions. Glycolysis occurs in the sarcoplasm of the muscle cell and produces a net gain of two molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of lactic acid. 3. Oxidative phosphorylation (aerobic) Aerobic ATP production occurs inside the mitochondria and involves the interaction of two cooperative metabolic pathways: 1) the Krebs cycle and 2) the electron transport chain. Importantly, oxidative phosphorylation requires oxygen, and if oxygen is available glycolysis feeds into the Krebs cycle (if not, lactic acid is formed). Oxidative phosphorylation consists of three stages: 1) generation of the 2 carbon molecule, acetyl-CoA. 2) oxidation of acetyl-CoA in the Krebs cycle. 3) oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain. Oxidative phosphorylation has a high ATP yield, but many steps are required from this process (energy production is slower than anaerobic systems). This system is always active and provides the majority energy required during resting conditions. It is also primarily responsible for energy production during long duration, submaximal exercise. Blood glucose Liver glycogen Muscle glycogen Glucose Glycolysis Pyruvic acidLactic acid O2 O2 present No O2 Oxidative phosphorylation Fatty acids (Amino acids) Rare CO2 H20 Fat stores ATP ATP ATP Myosin ATPase Contraction Main source when O2 not present Main source when O2 present ATP+Creatine Creatine phosphate + ADP Relaxation Ca2+ pump of SR Creatine kinase During rest During contraction During rest During contraction Muscle fibre Myoglobin All substrates can be used for the generation of ATP. The pathway of ATP production is dependent on the type of exercise and the availability of substrates. It is not only glucose and glycogen that can enter the Krebs cycle. Triglycerides can be broken down to fatty acids, which can then undergo a series of reactions to form acetyl-CoA (this process is termed beta-oxidation). The glycerol that is produced as a by-product during beta oxidation is not an important fuel source during exercise. Although protein is not a major fuel source during exercise, amino acids can enter bioenergetics pathways in a variety of places. Some amino acids are converted to glucose, others to acetyl-CoA, and others still to Kerbs cycle intermediates. Below is a figure summarizing the interaction between the major fuel sources and energy systems. The stored ATP in muscle, in conjunction with the three energy systems produce an energy continuum. This is particularly important during the transition from rest to exercise. Energy stores will be used in order of availability. The first to be used is the stored, pure ATP in the muscles. This ATP is enough for one big jump or a dead lift (the one that serious weightlifters do) and lasts only about two seconds. The phosphocreatine system is used next. Phosphocreatine is broken down to produce ATP and creatine, and this reaction is catalysed by the enzyme creatine kinase. The ATP-PC system lasts roughly 20 seconds, depending on how well it is developed. The glycolytic system will serve as the major energy system from about 20 seconds into exercise. The aerobic (oxidative phosphorylation) system will increase very slowly and will become the major energy producing system from approximately 2 minutes into exercise. This is due to the fact that it takes a few minutes for the cardiovascular and respiratory systems to increase the oxygen uptake sufficiently. From about two to three minutes onwards, the exercising person will reach steady state. Importantly, this energy continuum depicts how energy is used at the start of moderate exercise. Thereafter, the type of exercise (intensity and duration) will determine which energy system and substrate is used. 5 sec 20 sec 2 min 2 hrs time Interaction between the three energy systems The first differentiation that needs to be made is between anaerobic and aerobic metabolism. Energy to perform exercise comes from an interaction between aerobic and anaerobic pathways. Long duration exercise relies predominantly on aerobic metabolism. However, as the intensity of exercise increases, the contribution of anaerobic metabolism also increases. With short-term, high-intensity exercise the anaerobic energy system contributes mostly. With long-term, moderate-intensity exercise the majority of ATP is produced from aerobic sources. Therefore, aerobic and anaerobic metabolism will contribute differentially, depending on the sporting type. Interaction between aerobic and anaerobic systems Utilization of the energy systems during different types of exercise The type of exercise performed governs the energy system utilized. For example, energy production will rely more heavily on anaerobic systems during shorter distance, high-intensity running. Likewise, the contribution of energy from anaerobic sources will also be much greater when doing resistance exercise. Energy systems used during different running distances Energy systems used during resistance exercise Practice question 1 Metabolic consequences of short-term (90 seconds), high-intensity exercise include an increase in a) the rate of glycolysis. b) the synthesis of NADH + H+. c) the rate of -oxidation. d) plasma lactate concentration. e) muscle creatine phosphate concentration. Just as the energy systems utilized are dependent on the type of exercise, the fuel source selected will also vary. Factors governing fuel utilization during exercise include: 1. Intensity of exercise 2. Duration of exercise 3. Diet and substrate availability 4. Training status 1. Exercise intensity – the “crossover” concept This graph describes the metabolic shift that occurs during exercise as the intensity progressively increases. At resting levels, approximately 70% of our energy is derived from fatty acids, with the remainder of energy coming from carbohydrates. As the intensity of exercise increases, the proportion of energy derived from fatty acids becomes progressively lower, while the proportion of energy derived from carbohydrates becomes progressively higher. At a certain point, the production of energy from carbohydrates exceeds that from fatty acids. This is known as the cross over point. At maximal exercise intensities, carbohydrates are solely oxidised for energy. The physiological mechanism underlying the crossover concept is as follows: Exercising at higher intensities results in the recruitment of fast fibers. These muscle fibers contain many glycolytic enzymes (but few lipolytic enzymes) and are well equipped for anaerobic metabolism (that preferentially utilizes carbohydrates). Secondly, with increasing exercise intensities, circulating concentrations of adrenaline will be increased. High levels of adrenaline increase muscle glycogen breakdown, carbohydrate metabolism and lactate production. The increased production of lactate inhibits hormone sensitive lipase enzymes and lipolysis. This reduces the availability of fatty acids as a substrate. The lack of fatty acids as a substrate for working muscles under these conditions dictates that carbohydrates will be the primary fuel. Moreover, at very high exercise intensities, the uptake of oxygen may not be sufficient. Anaerobic metabolism will need to supplement energy production. Since anaerobic metabolism oxidizes glucose as a sole substrate, carbohydrate utilization will increase. Fuel sources at differing exercise intensities The diagrams above show the relative contribution of the various fuel sources, at different exercise intensities. Based on the information provided here, one might be tempted to conclude that low intensity exercise (~20% VO2 max) will then be best for burning fat. Although this is partially true, notice that the total energy expended is low at this exercise intensity. If a person is exercising at moderate intensities (~50% VO2 max), a smaller proportion (~40%) of energy from fat will be burned. However, the total fat oxidation will still be greater than low intensity exercise (for the same duration of exercise). Which exercise intensity is best for burning fat? Why don’t we burn primarily fats? It is a very complex process. Triglycerides must first be broken down to glycerol and free fatty acids. This process also starts at one site and ends at another. The steps of fat metabolism are as follows: • Mobilization (from adipose) • Circulation • Uptake • Activation • Translocation • β-oxidation (acetyl-CoA + NAHD formation from FFA) • Mitochondrial oxidation (Krebs cycle & ETC) Thus: the rate of energy release is too low to supply the energy needs during moderate to high intensity exercise. 2. Exercise duration As the intensity of exercise increases, there is greater reliance on carbohydrates. However, the opposite is true for exercise duration. At resting conditions, a mixture of fatty acids (derived from muscle triglycerides and plasma free fatty acids) is utilized in conjunction with blood glucose (derived from muscle glycogen and blood glucose). As the duration of submaximal exercise continues, muscle glycogen stores gradually become depleted. There is an increased reliance on plasma free fatty acids and blood glucose (derived from liver gluconeogenesis). What factors control the rate of fat metabolism? Fat metabolism is controlled by the variables that control the rate of lipolysis. Hormone sensitive lipases break down triglycerides into free fatty acids, and the activity of these enzymes is stimulated by adrenaline, noradrenaline and glucagon. During low-intensity, prolonged exercise adrenaline concentrations increase, which stimulates lipolysis and thus fat metabolism. Note that the mobilization of free fatty acids into the blood is inhibited by insulin and high blood lactate levels. In summary, as the duration of submaximal, steady-state exercise increases, the greater the contribution of energy from fatty acids. 3. Diet and substrate availability The third factor affecting substrate utilization during exercise, is the diet and whether supplementation during exercise is available. At the start of exercise, glucose is rapidly oxidised and blood glucose concentrations decline. In order to maintain blood glucose concentrations during exercise, glucagon is secreted. Glucagon promotes the breakdown of liver glycogen to glucose. This increases blood glucose levels. Glucagon also promotes gluconeogenesis from other fuel sources and promotes lipolysis to stimulate fat metabolism. This is the normal hormonal response to exercise. However, if carbohydrates are consumed 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, blood glucose concentrations increase as the carbohydrates are absorbed. Shortly thereafter, insulin will be secreted, to promote the uptake of glucose into cells. The release of insulin inhibits hormone sensitive lipase activity and thus prevent the mobilization of free fatty acids for energy during exercise. This will decrease fat metabolism. Therefore, carbohydrate supplementation prior to or during exercise results in a higher blood glucose concentrations pared with the unavailability of fatty acids. Thus, blood glucose will become the main fuel source for energy production under these conditions. Blood glucose concentrations hereafter will need to be maintained using muscle and liver glycogen stores. One situation where carbohydrate supplementation could be helpful, is during prolonged exercise when glycogen stores are depleted. For example, cyclists commonly consume easily digestible carbohydrate supplements towards the end of a race. The consumed carbohydrates are rapidly absorbed, and functions to increase blood glucose concentrations during the final stages of a race. This prevents fatigues associated with glycogen depletion. 4. Training status With regular aerobic training, various adaptations occur that improves the ability of muscle to make use of fatty acids. Therefore, the fitter you are, the more readily your body will make use of fatty acids as a fuel source. These factors will be discussed in detail in the section on muscle fiber types. The respiratory exchange ratio We can determine which fuel source is being utilized by means of the respiratory quotient. The respiratory quotient is the ratio of oxygen consumed to carbon dioxide produced by a cell during respiration. Since more oxygen is required to oxidize one molecule of fat compared to one molecule of carbohydrate, this ratio gives us an indication of the fuel source that is being metabolized (see next slide for an explanation). Since millions of cells are metabolizing either fatty acids or carbohydrates during exercise (remember that proteins do not normally contribute to energy production), we can take this one step further and measure the amount of oxygen inspired in relation to the amount of carbon dioxide expired during exercise. This ratio is termed the respiratory exchange ratio. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) assumes that the exchange of CO2 and O2 at the lungs reflects what is happening at the cellular level. It is therefore only an accurate measure of cellular respiration during steady state conditions. The ratio of inspired O2 to expired CO2. RER = VCO2 / VO2 Estimation of Fuel Utilization During Exercise • Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) • RER for fat (palmitic acid) • RER for carbohydrate (glucose) • Protein: 77 molecules of O2 for every 63 CO2 produced. Thus the RER = 0.8 VCO2 VO2 R = C16H32O2 + 23 O2 → 16 CO2 + 16 H2O VCO2 VO2 =R = 16 CO2 23 O2 = 0.70 C6H12O6 + 6 O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O VCO2 VO2 =R = 6 CO2 6 O2 = 1.00 A total of 23 oxygen molecules are required for the oxidation of 1 fatty acid (palmitic acid) molecule. On the other side of the balanced chemical equation, 16 carbon dioxide molecules and 16 water molecules (and ATP) is produced. The ratio of oxygen consumed to carbon dioxide produced is approximately 0.7. To oxidise one carbohydrate (glucose) molecule, 6 oxygen molecules are consumed. One the other side of the balanced equation, 6 carbon dioxide molecules and 6 water molecules are produced (in addition to the energy as ATP). The oxygen to carbon dioxide ratio is therefore 1.00. For protein, the chemical equation is more complex, but simply note that the carbon dioxide to oxygen ratio will be 0.8. An RER of 0.8 could however also indicate that a mixture of fats and carbohydrates is being metabolised. Take a look at the chemical equations below to make this clearer: Carbon dioxide produced (expired) Oxygen consumed (inspired) Please watch VoPP 1 (The bioenergetics of exercise) before continuing. Practice question 2 The respiratory exchange ratio a) is the ratio between oxygen consumption and oxygen utilization in cells. b) is lower at rest than during high-intensity exercise. c) is higher following high carbohydrate supplementation. d) for fatty acid oxidation, is less than 0.4. e) decreases with prolonged exercise. Muscle fibers Aerobic Anaerobic From the picture above it is clear that athletes participating in different sporting types have different body compositions. Due to the differences in the type of exercise (intensity, duration, frequency) different energy systems are developed within the muscles themselves. This results in different muscle fiber types. Muscle Fibers • Biochemical properties – Oxidative capacity. – Number of mitochondria. – Capillaries. – Myoglobin concentration. – Type of ATPase enzyme. – Type of LDH enzyme. • Contractile properties –Maximal force production. –Speed of contraction. –Muscle fiber efficiency. Muscle fibers can be categorised based on their biochemical properties, as well as their contractile properties. Muscle fibre types Slow twitch Slow oxidative (Type I) Fast twitch Fast oxidative (Type IIa) Fast twitch Fast glycolytic (Type IIb) Colour of fibre RED Intermediate WHITE Oxidative capacity HIGH HIGH LOW Capillaries MANY MANY FEW Myoglobin content HIGH HIGH LOW Mitochondria MANY MANY FEW Fatigue resistance HIGH Intermediate LOW Fibre diameter SMALL Intermediate LARGE Anaerobic enzyme content LOW Intermediate HIGH Myosin ATPase activity LOW HIGH HIGH Glycogen content LOW Intermediate HIGH Speed of contraction SLOW FAST FAST Please watch VoPP 2 (Muscle fiber types) before continuing. Adaptations to aerobic training With regular aerobic training, various adaptations occur directly in the muscle. These are termed peripheral adaptations (the cardiovascular system also adapts to training and this is referred to as central adaptations to aerobic exercise). These adaptations include: 1. A greater degree of capillarisation within muscle. This increases blood flow to the muscles and also decreases the diffusion distance of oxygen and nutrients in the blood to the myocyte. 2. A greater number of mitochondria and greater mitochondrial volume. Oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondria and therefore the oxidative capacity increases. 3. Increased myoglobin content. This increases oxygen ‘shuttling’ from the haemoglobin in the blood to the tissues. 4. Increased amounts of oxidative enzymes. This includes most enzymes involved in aerobic metabolism (for example, enzymes in the Krebs cycle). All of these adaptations together improve the oxidative capacity of the muscle, and improves oxygen extraction. These adaptations will occur in response to the training volume (the amount of training). Adaptations to aerobic training – muscle fiber types Given the adaptations that occur within muscle it then makes sense that, with regular and consistent aerobic training the proportion of slow oxidative (Type I) muscle fibers will increase. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Pre training Post training The effect of an aerobic training program on muscle fiber composition Slow oxidative, % Intermediate, % Fast glycolytic, % Adaptations to resistance training – muscle fiber types Regular resistance training also induces significant adaptations within the muscle fiber. This includes a greater amount of glycolytic enzymes, and an increase in the amount of actin and myosin filaments within the muscle fibers. These adaptations are discussed in more detail in the section on resistance training (slide 87). Ultimately, these adaptations to resistance training result in a shift in the muscle fiber types. The graph below shows the relative proportion of muscle fiber types prior to and following a resistance training program. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Pretraining Post training The effect of a resistance training program on muscle fiber composition Slow oxidative, % Intermediate, % Fast glycolytic, % Practice question 3 Compared to an elite marathon runner, an elite sprinter will have skeletal muscle that has a) increased mitochondrial density. b) increased glycolytic enzyme activity. c) increased myoglobin concentration. d) greater force production per muscle fiber. e) increased proportion of fast twitch fiber. Oxygen uptake The graph below depicts oxygen consumption by muscle during aerobic exercise The amount of oxygen that is used by the working muscles during exercise can be measured absolutely (L.min-1) or relative to body weight (mL.kg-1.min-1). Relative measures are generally more accurate, as they take into account differences in body size. From this graph, note that oxygen consumption by muscles increases immediately. BUT oxygen uptake by the respiratory and cardiovascular system lags. It takes between 1 and 4 minutes for oxygen uptake to reach submaximal, steady-state levels.Oxygen consumption (L/min) Exercise intensity (% of VO2 max) 10 20 4030 50 60 70 80 90 10 0 Oxygen deficit Energy is consumed by muscle from the moment that exercise is started, but the cardiorespiratory system takes a few minutes to increase oxygen uptake. This results in an ‘oxygen deficit’ at the start of exercise. Energy is produced from anaerobic sources at the start of exercise, and only after one to two minutes will the oxygen delivery to muscle increase sufficiently to allow the aerobic system to become the major energy producing system. The oxygen deficit is greater with higher exercise intensities, as it takes longer for oxygen consumption to increase to these higher levels. Importantly, this oxygen deficit will need to be ‘paid back’. Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption The way in which the body ‘repays’ the oxygen deficit is by increasing oxygen consumption after exercise. Simply stated, for some time following exercise, minute ventilation will still be increased, even though exercise has stopped. This is referred to as the excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). The oxygen deficit is therefore the amount of oxygen needed to ‘pay back’ what was used at the onset of exercise. The EPOC is usually divided into a fast portion and a slow portion. The fast portion is characterized by significant increases in minute ventilation, which lasts 2-3 minutes following exercise. The slow portion demonstrates slightly increased minute ventilation that lasts approximately 30 minutes after exercise. The fast portion of EPOC is used to • resynthesize phosphocreatine (used at the start of exercise). • replace oxygen stores in muscle and blood (fully saturating haemoglobin and myoglobin with oxygen once again). The slow portion of EPOC goes towards • gluconeogenesis (converting lactic acid back to glucose). • energy production needed to sustain the increased heart rate and breathing rate. • the increased metabolic rate associated with an increase in body temperature and the release of (nor)adrenaline. The greater the exercise intensity, the greater the oxygen deficit. The EPOC will also be greater and will remain elevated for longer. Steady state exerciseWork intensity During the first few minutes of exercise, oxygen uptake will increase linearly up to a point where the rate of oxygen uptake is high enough to meet the oxygen demand. Despite the oxygen debt incurred at the start of exercise, a steady state is reached during exercise. At this point, the amount of oxygen taken up is sufficient to meet the metabolic demands. The graph below shows typical oxygen consumption graphs for three individuals. Importantly, with increasing exercise intensity, oxygen consumption will need to be maintained at increasingly higher levels. The capacity to maintain steady state at increasingly higher levels depends on the ability of the cardiorespiratory system to supply oxygen, and on the muscle tissue to extract oxygen continuously. VO2 = (HR x SV) x (a-v)O2difference O2 delivery (central factors) O2 uptake (peripheral factors) The combination of the factors mentioned above determines the endurance capacity. VO2 = CO x (a-v)O2 diff Oxygen transport depends on: Heart rate Stroke volume Blood pressure Total peripheral resistance Heamoglobin concentration Arterial and venous oxygen saturation. For exercise to be maintained at a certain intensity, adequate oxygen needs to be delivered to the muscle for contraction. The cardiorespiratory system needs to take up the oxygen from the environment, and thereafter oxygen rich blood needs to be circulated to the muscles. These central factors govern oxygen delivery. For exercise to be maintained at a given intensity, the muscles also need to extract the oxygen from the blood. Fuel sources need to be adequately oxidised to produce energy. These peripheral factors control oxygen extraction. Maximal aerobic capacity The graph below shows that oxygen uptake increases linearly until VO2max is reached • No further increase in oxygen uptake (VO2) with increasing work rate. • Can be due to either central or peripheral limitations. • At VO2max, the athlete experiences volitional fatigue. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 5 10 15 20 25VO2 (ml/min/kg) Time (min) Press play Please watch the video on VO2 max testing Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) Although the VO2max is initially determined by genetics, regular aerobic training can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and thus the VO2 max to a certain extent. Therefore, athletes participating in certain sporting types have characteristically high VO2max values. This is due to the well-developed aerobic system obtained through consistent aerobic training. Perhaps having a high starting VO2 max when participating in these sporting types is what makes a person good at it, and then motivates them to train harder. Which ever way it is around, these sporting types include, cross country skiing, running, swimming, skating and others. VO2 max is conventionally reported as indexed to body weight, as a person with a greater body and muscle mass will naturally have a higher absolute oxygen consumption. The relative VO2 max is usually higher in men than in women, and this is due to the testosterone induced increases in relative muscle mass. VO2 max is a fundamental measure of physiologic functional capacity for exercise – how big is your engine? Running economy The VO2max describes the cardiorespiratory fitness level of an individual very well, and elite athletes will most certainly possess greater VO2max values compared to sedentary individuals or recreational athletes. However, the ability of the VO2max to predict performance has recently been questioned. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, because performance is dependent on several other factors including skill, tactics, motivation and environment. Secondly, the majority of endurance races are not run at VO2max levels, but rather at a submaximal level. Therefore, oxygen utilization at submaximal levels can be the difference between winning and losing. This brings us to the concept of running economy. Running economy or efficiency has a major influence on the energy cost of a sport and interacts with the VO2max. The economy of running is quantified by measuring the steady state oxygen cost of running on a horizontal treadmill at several speeds. The oxygen requirement is then graphed as a function of the running speed. So, for a given running speed, runner B requires less oxygen and therefore expends less energy than runner A. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 140 160 180 200 220 240 260Oxygen uptake (ml/kg/min) Velocity (m/min) Running economy Runner A Runner B Please watch VoPP 3 (Oxygen uptake and the VO2 max) before continuing.

Blood leaving the lungs will have a partial pressure of oxygen of 95 mm Hg. This translates into an arterial oxygen content of roughly 181ml O2/L of blood. The blood circulates to the tissues and muscles where oxygen is extracted. Following oxygen extraction from tissues at rest, the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood drops to 40 mm Hg. This correlates to a mixed venous oxygen content of approximately 139 ml O2/L of blood. Thus, approximately 40 ml of oxygen is extracted from each litre of blood at resting conditions. The deoxygenated blood then circulates back to the heart and lungs for re- oxygenation. Also note that carbon dioxide is uploaded at the tissues and is transported back to the lungs in one of four ways (as a bicarbonate ion either inside or outside the RBC, bound to haemoglobin or dissolved in plasma). Blood gases during exercise PaO2 = 95mmHg = 180mL O2/L blood PvO2 < 10 mmHg = 25 mL O2/L blood a-vO2 diff = ±155mL O2 /L blood PAO2 = 100 mmHg PACO2 = 40 mmHg PaO2 = 95 mmHg PaCO2 = 40 mmHg PaO2 = 95 mmHg PaCO2 = 40 mmHg PvO2 < 10 mmHg PvCO2 = 46 mmHg PvO2 < 10 mmHg PvCO2 = 46 mmHg PO2 < 10 mmHg PCO2 > 46 mmHg CO2 + H2O H2CO3 H+ + HCO3- During exercise, the blood leaving the lungs will still have a partial pressure of 95 mm Hg so the starting arterial oxygen content will be identical to resting conditions. However, at the tissues more oxygen is extracted, and the partial pressure of oxygen leaving the tissues can be as low as 10 mm Hg (with intense exercise). Carbon dioxide is also uploaded at the tissues and transported back to the lungs. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide does not increase in the venous blood due to the fact that excess carbon dioxide is converted to carbonic acid, and it will also be transported to the lungs in this form back, for excretion.

Since arterial blood will, under normal conditions, have the same partial pressure and thus oxygen content, a greater arteriovenous oxygen difference indicates better oxygen extraction. The graph above shows that as muscle oxygen consumption increases, the arteriovenous oxygen difference will also increase progressively. How is this greater extraction of oxygen achieved? Oxygen transport You may recall from your respiration lectures that red blood cells contain haemoglobin. Oxygen is transported in the blood bound to haemoglobin and each haemoglobin molecule can transport up to 4 oxygen molecules. The unloading of oxygen from haemoglobin is dependent on the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in the blood and the affinity or bond strength between haemoglobin and oxygen. The unloading of oxygen from haemoglobin is described by the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve. Deoxyhaemoglobin +O2 Oxyheamoglobin The shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is well designed to meet human oxygen transport needs. The relatively flat portion of the curve (above 90 mm Hg) allows arterial PO2 to oscillate between 90mm Hg and 100 mm Hg, without large changes in the haemoglobin saturation (Hb O2%). This is important since there is a decline in in arterial PO2 with aging and upon ascent to altitude. At the other steep end of the curve,(0 - 40 mm Hg), small changes in PO2 result in the unloading of large amounts O2 from haemoglobin. This is critical during exercise when the tissue oxygen consumption is high. Please watch VoPP 4 (Respiratory responses to exercise) before continuing. Left shift (↑d O2 affinity) ↓ temperature ↓ 2,3 BPG ↑ pH ↓ PCO2 CO Right shift (↓d O2 affinity) ↑ temperature ↑ 2,3 BPG ↓ pH ↑ PCO2 Factors affecting the affinity of oxygen for haemoglobin include pH, temperature and the production of 2,3 BPG. A decrease in pH reduces the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen, resulting in greater unloading. In this case hydrogen ions bind to haemoglobin, reducing the ability of haemoglobin to bind oxygen. The right shift seen in the oxyheamoglobin dissociation curve seen in metabolic acidosis is called the Bohr effect. An increase in temperature will also cause the oxyheamoglobin dissociation curve to shift to the right, and oxygen will be unloaded more readily. Of course, with exercise body temperature increases and pH decreases, allowing oxygen to be unloaded much more easily. The release of 2,3 BPG will also cause oxygen to be unloaded more readily. 2,3 BPG is released by RBC’s upon exposure to altitude (it is a by-product of glycolysis) and in anemia. This is important, because at high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen is lower in the environmental air, and thus RBC’s are not as well oxygenated in the lungs. 2,3 BPG helps to unload oxygen when the oxygen supply is chronically low. However, note that 2,3 BPG is present in the entire circulation and thus also decreases the ability to load oxygen onto haemoglobin at the lungs. Lastly, carbon monoxide has a 210 times greater affinity for heamoglobin, and even small concentrations are toxic to humans. After the carbon monoxide has selectively bound to haemoglobin the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve of the remaining oxyhaemoglobin shifts to the left, reducing oxygen release. Myoglobin Where one haemoglobin carries four oxygen molecules, myoglobin has only one haem group and therefore only carries one oxygen molecule at a time. Myoglobin accepts oxygen at the muscle cell membrane and shuttles it to the mitochondria. It aids the diffusion of oxygen from capillary to mitochondria. Myoglobin has a greater affinity for oxygen than haemoglobin. It is thus capable of accepting oxygen below 20mmHg. Myoglobin unloads oxygen to mitochondria at 2mmHg. Acts as an oxygen reserve during transition from rest to exercise. Respiratory adaptations to exercise • Increased strength of muscles involved in breathing. • Modest increases in alveolar capillarisation. The Cardiovascular System • Cardiac output = heart rate x stroke volume PNS SNS Contraction strength End diastolic volume (venous return) Frank- Starling Mean arterial pressure As exercise continues reflex feedback from muscle mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors modulate circulatory needs. Cardiovascular responses to exercise are mediated largely by sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. With the anticipation of exercise SNS activation will occur. The sympathetic nervous system will be switched ‘on’ and the parasympathetic nervous system will be switched ‘off’. The withdrawal of parasympathetic activation in combination with sympathetic activation will firstly increase the heart rate. As the exercise intensity increases, the heart rate will increase linearly up to the maximal heart rate (which is approximately 220 beats per minute minus the age). SNS activation also increases cardiac contractility. This will increase the stroke volume for any given end diastolic volume. These responses occur within the first minute of exercise. As exercise continues, the venous return will be enhanced. This will increase the end-diastolic volume further and activates the Frank-Starling mechanism to increase the stroke volume further. We will now discuss these factors in more detail. Revision: Regulation of stroke volume During exercise, stroke volume changes due to 4 physiologic mechanisms: 1. Greater systolic emptying • Greater myocardial contractile force is noted. • Due to ejection of functional residual blood volume. • This is mediated by increased SNS activity during exercise. • Effective immediately. 2. Enhanced diastolic filling • Recall that EDV = volume of blood in ventricles at end of diastole (“preload”). • During exercise, the venous return increases. • Increased venous return during exercise stretches the myocardial fibres and initiates a more powerful contraction. • Activation of the Frank-Starling mechanism • Not immediate – only occurs n first few minutes. 3. Average aortic blood pressure • In order to eject blood, the pressure in the left ventricle must exceed the pressure in the aorta. • Therefore, the pressure in the aorta (MAP) represents a barrier to the ejection of blood from the ventricles. • Increases in aortic pressure produces a decrease in stroke volume. • Afterload is minimised during exercise through arteriolar dilation. 4. Cardiovascular drift • Occurs when blood is distributed to periphery for cooling (15 min after the onset of exercise). • Fluid moves from plasma to tissues (and evaporates as sweat). • This decreases the blood volume which decreases the preload and stroke volume. • To maintain the same cardiac output, there will be a compensatory increase in heart rate. • These physiological changes are detrimental to performance. 1. Greater systolic emptying Firstly, with the anticipation of exercise, there will be SNS activation. With increased sympathetic activity, the entire Frank-Starling curve will move upwards and left (as indicated by the blue arrow). This occurs immediately, and at the start of exercise, for any given EDV the stroke volume will be increased. After a few minutes of exercise, the venous return will be increased (mechanisms to be discussed shortly). This will move the person upwards along the Frank Starling curve, causing the stroke volume to increase even further (as indicated by the green arrow). These two mechanisms will cause substantial increases in stroke volume during exercise.Stroke volume (mls) End diastolic volume (mls) Rest Exercise 2. Enhanced diastolic filling Improvements in venous return will enhance diastolic filling to increase the end-diastolic volume. This will activate Frank-Starling to enhance systolic emptying (as described on the previous slide). The venous return is affected by • Venoconstriction. • The skeletal muscle pump. • The respiratory pump. Each of these factors during exercise will be explained next. 1. Venoconstriction Recall that the veins have a large storage capacity for blood. When the volume capacity of the veins decreases, venous return increases. During exercise, venoconstriction occurs via reflex sympathetic constriction of the smooth muscles in veins. This “squeezes” the blood upwards and towards the heart, to increase the venous return. Venoconstriction 3. Respiratory pump • Rhythmic breathing pattern works to produce a mechanical pump. • During each inspiration there is a decrease in intrathoracic pressure. The intrathoracic pressure is lower than the abdominal pressure at this point in time. The movement of blood from the area of higher pressure (in the abdomen) to the area of lower pressure (in the thorax) will thus be promoted with each inspiration. 2. Skeletal muscle pump Rhythmic skeletal muscle contractions also increase the venous return during exercise. As the muscles contract, blood is squeezed upwards and towards the heart. When the muscles relax, one-way valves in the veins prevent backflow of blood. In putting everything together, the normal response to exercise is as follows: As the exercise intensity increases, the heart rate will increase linearly up to the maximal age-related value. Stroke volume will increase up to 40% VO2 max firstly as a result of SNS activation and secondly due to improved venous return. However, the volume of the ventricle is finite and the end diastolic volume can only increase up to a certain point. As the heart rate and stroke volume increases, the cardiac output will also increase with increasing exercise intensities. Due to the fact that the stroke volume plateaus at 40% of the VO2 max, increases in cardiac output thereafter are attributed to increases in heart rate only. Tissue oxygen extraction will increase as the exercise intensity increases, due to increased blood flow, vasodilation and greater unloading of oxygen from haemoglobin. Finally, the systolic blood pressure increases as the intensity of exercise increases (as a result of greater contractility and stroke volume). However, the diastolic blood pressure will not change (or will decrease slightly) during exercise, as a result of arteriolar vasodilation (that decreases the total peripheral resistance). Therefore, as systolic pressure increases during exercise but diastolic pressure does not, the mean arterial pressure will increase only modestly during exercise. Blood pressure and vascular resistance This graphs above show the typical responses to exercise of progressively increasing intensity. As previously mentioned, with increasing exercise intensity the oxygen uptake (VO2) will also increase linearly, up to a maximal point (VO2 max). Local mediators of vasodilation are listed in the diagram on the right. Specific to exercise, there is a reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood and an increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide. This is detected by the endothelium, whereby nitric oxide is released. Nitric oxide is a potent inducer of vasodilation. Thus, the relative tissue hypoxia noted during exercise is an important factor responsible for vasodilation during exercise. Additionally, there is considerable evidence that actively metabolizing cells surrounding arterioles release vasoactive substances that cause vasodilation. This is termed the metabolic theory of blood flow regulation. One example is adenosine, which is formed from cellular AMP acted upon by 5'-nucleotidase. The AMP is derived from hydrolysis of intracellular ATP and ADP. Adenosine formation increases during hypoxia and exercise, especially if the latter is accompanied by inadequate oxygen delivery, to cause vasodilation. Metabolic heat production by contracting muscles also induce vasodilation. Finally, lactic acid is also a mediator of vasodilation, largely through its pH effect. Muscular vascular resistanceResistance (mmHg/l/min) Exercise intensity (% of VO2 max) 10 20 4030 50 60 70 80 90 100 The physiological mechanism for a decreased total peripheral resistance during exercise is as follows: SNS activation causes the release of noradrenaline from postganglionic sympathetic neurons. Noradrenaline binds to β2 receptors in skeletal muscle, which induces vasodilation. These vasodilatory effects are further enhanced by local factors mentioned in the preceding slide. Please watch the voice over presentation on the cardiovascular responses to exercise, for a detailed description of SNS effects on the vasculature. Taken together, blood flow to muscle is increased substantially during exercise and these effects occur as a result of SNS activation and release of local vasodilatory substances. Please watch VoPP 5 (Cardiovascular responses to exercise) before continuing.

Exercise intensity Physiological response a) A Plasma lactate concentration greater than 7 mmol/ℓ. b) B Right-shift in oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve. c) C Increased oxidative phosphorylation. d) A compared to B Decreased heart rate. e) C compared to A Increased ventilation. Redistribution of blood flow during exercise The SNS effects described on the previous slide allow for the redistribution of blood flow during exercise. In the pie chart on the left, the normal distribution of blood flow is seen during rest. On the right we see that blood flow is diverted away from the internal organs, towards the actively exercising muscles. SNS activation will cause vasoconstriction of arterioles in the viscera and will cause vasodilation of arterioles in skeletal muscle. At rest, the muscles receive about 20% of the cardiac output, whereas during exercise the muscles receive 84% of the total cardiac output. Conversely, the liver and kidneys receive about 49% of the cardiac output at rest, whereas during exercise this decreases to approximately 3%. Also notice that the brain receives roughly 14-15% of the cardiac output at rest and only 3-4% of the cardiac output during exercise. Maintenance of blood pressure and vascular resistance during exercise In the previous slide it is mentioned that blood flow is redistributed such that more blood flows to the contracting muscles, and less flows to the internal organs and brain. Since the brain requires a constant supply of oxygenated blood and is particularly sensitive to hypoxic conditions, you may wonder whether it will be getting enough blood during exercise? Importantly here, although the relative percentage of blood received by the brain decreases from 15% to about 3%, the cardiac output increases substantially. At rest the cardiac output is normally around 5 litres per minute, but during heavy exercise this increases to about 25 litres per minute. This means that the absolute blood flow to the brain is maintained even during heavy exercise. At rest, the brain receives 15% of 5 litres, per minute. This is equal to 0.75 litres per minute. During exercise, the brain receives 3% of 25 litres per minute. Thus 0.75 litres per minutes. Cardiac output = 20 L/min Cardiac output = 5 L/min 5 L/min Onset of exercise Vagus tone decreases (PNS inhibition removed, SNS predominates) HR increases Vasoconstriction of peripheral blood vessels Vasodilation of muscle vasculature (Noradrenaline effects) CO increases Venous return increases EDV increases Respiratory rate increases Muscle blood flow increases (a-v)O2 difference increases Summary This diagram provides a summary of the cardiovascular responses to exercise at the onset of exercise. Firstly, PNS activity will be withdrawn and SNS activation will occur. This will increase the heart rate and rate of respiration. SNS activation will cause redistribution of blood flow, so as to ensure greater blood flow to the muscles. At the start of exercise blood flow to muscles increases and thus venous return increases. With greater venous return, diastolic filling is enhanced, which results in a greater end diastolic volume. A greater end diastolic volume activates the Frank-Starling mechanism to increase the stroke volume. With an increase in stroke volume and heart rate, the cardiac output increases, which in turn improves blood flow to muscles. As exercise continues Muscle pump facilitates further increase in venous return EDV increases Greater myocardial contractile force increases SV CO increases SNS and PNS in balance • TPR decreases • VE increases • a-vO2 diff increases further As exercise continues, a steady-state develops. The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems will be in balance. After a few minutes of exercise, the muscle pump will help to improve venous return further, which will cause modest increases in end-diastolic volumes. This will activate the Frank-Starling curve to increase contractility and thus the cardiac output. As exercise continues, the total peripheral resistance may decrease further, as a result of local vasodilatory mediators. With ongoing heat production and changes in pH, the haemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve will shift to the right, resulting in greater unloading of oxygen from haemoglobin and improved oxygen extraction.

Kreb’s cycle O2 final electron acceptor Acetyl Co-AATP Steady state exercise In light to moderate exercise, sufficient oxygen is available to cells. Acetyl-CoA is formed, which can then enter the Kreb’s cycle. NADH and FADH is produced and shuttled to the mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation and thus energy production. A steady state can be maintained at this exercise intensity and the predominant energy system is thus oxidative phosphorylation. Lactate Kreb’s cycle O2 final electron acceptor + H+ Acetyl Co-A At strenuous exercise intensities However, during strenuous exercise, where energy demands exceed oxygen supply, oxygen is not available to be the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. Therefore, oxidation of NADH to NAD+ decreases in the electron transport chain. This results in an accumulation of NADH and FADH at the start of the electron transport chain. NADH inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and thus pyruvate cannot be converted to Acetyl-CoA. The accumulation of pyruvate and NADH stimulates lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which converts pyruvate to lactate. Therefore, with increasing exercise intensity, there is an observable increase in blood lactate concentrations. For many years, lactate was considered a waste product of glycolysis, with little metabolic use. However, new evidence shows that lactate is not necessarily a waste product but can play a beneficial role during exercise by serving as a substrate for the liver to synthesize glucose and as a direct fuel source for skeletal muscle and the heart. Importantly, lactate does NOT accumulate in the muscles. Lactic acid that is produced by skeletal muscles is transported to the liver via the blood. Upon entry to the liver, lactate can be converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis. This “new” glucose than then be recirculated in the blood where muscles can use it for energy production. This process is termed the Cori cycle. The glucose produced from lactate can then be used for energy production, and therefore, when lactate concentrations are high, and contributes to energy production, the respiratory exchange ratio can increase to values above one (as high as 1.15) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0 10 20 30 40 50 60Blood Lacate (mM) VO2 (ml/kg/min) Lactate Threshold The lactate threshold The mechanisms described previously brings us to the lactate threshold. Most energy for muscular contraction during the early stages of an incremental exercise test comes from aerobic sources. However, as exercise intensity increases, lactate concentrations also increase. In most cases, there is a distinctive “turning point” where blood lactate concentrations begin to rise appreciably. This is termed the lactate threshold and represents a point of increasing reliance on anaerobic metabolism. Historically, rising blood lactate levels have been considered as an indication of increased anaerobic metabolism within the contracting muscle due to low levels of oxygen in the individual muscle cells. However, other factors can also affect the rate of production of lactate. Firstly, if the rate of glycolysis is rapid, then NADH production may exceed the transport capacity of the shuttling mechanisms that move the hydrogens from the sarcoplasm into the mitochondria. When circulating adrenaline concentrations rise, at approximately 50% VO2 max, glycolysis is stimulated. This increases the rate of glycolysis and NADH production. Failure of the shuttle system to keep up with the rate of NADH production would result in pyruvic acid accepting some “unshuttled” hydrogens, which increases the rate of lactic acid production. A second explanation for the formation of lactic acid production in exercising muscle is related to the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme that catalyses the conversion of pyruvate to lactic acid. Lactate dehydrogenase exists in different isoforms throughout the body. Recall that the reaction is as follows: This reaction is reversible in that lactic acid can be converted back to pyruvic acid under the right conditions. Recall that human skeletal muscle can be classified into three different fiber types. As the name implies, fast glycolytic (Type IIb or fast-twitch) are recruited during rapid, intense exercise, while slow oxidative (Type I or slow twitch) muscle fibers are recruited during low intensity exercise. The LDH isozyme found in fast fibers has a greater affinity for attaching pyruvic acid and promoting the formation of lactic acid. In contrast, slow oxidative fibers contain an LDH isoenzyme that promotes the formation of pyruvate. Therefore, lactic acid formation might occur in fast fibers during exercise simply because of the type of LDH present (independent of oxygen availability). As the exercise intensity increases, the recruitment of fast twitch fibers also increases, and thus lactic acid will also increase. The final explanation for the lactate threshold may be related to the removal of lactic acid from the blood during incremental exercise. The concentration of lactic acid in the blood is the difference between the lactic acid produced and the lactic acid that is removed by the liver. As blood flow is redistributed during exercise (especially high intensity exercise), blood flow to the liver decreases as exercise intensity increases. This inhibits the liver’s ability to remove lactate from the blood. Therefore, as exercise intensity increases, lactate production increases and lactate clearance decreases. Onset of Blood Lactate Accumulation 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350Blood Lactate (mM) Power (W) OBLA Another commonly used term that is related to the lactate threshold is the “onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA)”. OBLA differs from blood lactate accumulation in one important way. Rather than defining the blood lactate inflection point , the OBLA is defined as the exercise intensity (or oxygen consumption) at which blood lactate levels reach 4 millimoles per litre. The reason for this definition is that, often the lactate threshold is not very clear. Blood lactate levels may rise progressively and may not show a definite inflection point. In these cases, OBLA may serve as a more accurate marker of lactate accumulation. Practical use of the lactate threshold The point of exponential rise in lactic acid during graded exercise has important implications for predicting sports performance and perhaps implications for training programs for endurance athletes. It serves as a marker for aerobic training status and gives an indication of the athlete’s aerobic capacity. The sooner the lactate threshold occurs, the more unfit the athletes is. It can therefore be used to monitor improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness during a season. It can also be used to predict success in distance running. It may also serve as a useful guideline for coaches and athletes in planning the level of exercise intensity needed to optimize training results. Serves 3 important functions: - sensitive marker of aerobic training status. - predicts endurance performance. - establishes an effective training intensity geared to the active muscles’ aerobic metabolic dynamics. Why is lactate bad? Lactic acid partially dissociates into lactate (La- en H+). If the free H+ is not buffered by bicarbonate (HCO3), pain is experienced and performance decreases. Fatigue will occur that has both a metabolic and muscular origin. Metabolic fatigue: - Metabolic acidosis causes reductions in 1. enzyme activation 2. membrane transport mechanisms 3. availability of substrate (high [H+] slows down the glycogen break down and the mobilization of free fatty acids in the blood). Muscle fatigue: - Local increases in acidity also decrease force and velocity of muscle contraction through 1. Inhibition of myosin ATPase (decreased hydrolysis of ATP on the myosin head) 2. decreased binding of calcium to troponin C 3. Decreased calcium release and re-uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Please watch VoPP 6 (Lactate) before continuing. Adaptations to aerobic training Following an aerobic training program, the lactate threshold will occur at a higher intensity. As the aerobic capacity increases there will be a reduced reliance on anaerobic metabolism. The lactate threshold that occurs at a later stage or at a higher intensity is due to a decreased rate of lactate formation during exercise and an increased rate of lactate clearance during exercise. Press play Please watch the video on the lactate threshold Practice question 6 During exercise, lactate a) is converted to urea. b) is produced when oxygen demand exceeds oxygen supply. c) is converted to glucose in skeletal muscle. d) is produced from pyruvate. e) accumulation occurs at a higher workload in elite athletes than in sedentary individuals. Ventilatory threshold The accumulation of lactate corresponds with an increase in ventilation • During exercise, the muscles produce large amounts of carbon dioxide. • The carbon dioxide in venous blood is carried as carbonic acid as per the following reaction • CO2 + H2O H2CO3 H+ + HCO3 - • Carbonic acid dissociates into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions, and this will increase the concentration of free hydrogen ions and decrease the pH. • At the start of exercise, ventilation will increase linearly as a function of oxygen uptake up to about 60% of the VO2 max. Thereafter, as a result of the increased carbonic acid present in the blood, ventilation will increase exponentially. This is termed the ventilation threshold (Tvent). • The ventilation threshold (Tvent) occurs in an attempt to blow off more carbon dioxide and to prevent decreases in pH. • The ventilation threshold generally coincides with the lactate threshold. Exercise physiology: resistance training Resistance training increases muscle strength by making your muscles work against a weight or force. Different forms of resistance training include using free weights, weight machines, resistance bands and your own body weight. Skeletal muscle strength and power Definitions: Strength = maximum force exerted by a muscle. Power = rate of force production. Both determined by not only muscle mass but also neural control - Please recap neural control of movement (CNS) The motor unit makes up the functional unit of movement. A motor unit consists of a motor neuron and the specific muscle fibres it innervates The ratio of muscle fibers per motor neurone is generally related to a muscle’s movement function e.g. The eye performs small movements that require precise neuronal control. A neuron will innervate as few as 10 muscle fibres. In contrast, less complex movements of large muscles such as the quadriceps can be under the control of one neuron innervating 2000- 3000 muscle fibres. The more complex the movement the fewer muscle fibres a motor neuron innervates. Types of muscle contraction With neural stimulation of muscle, muscle fibres attempt to shorten in a longitudinal axis (according to the sliding filament theory). Several different types of muscle contraction exists. For example, it is possible for a muscle to generate force without a large amount of muscle shortening. The term ‘muscle action’ is used to describe all processes of force development. Isometric action – is referred to as a static exercise when a muscle generates a force, but changes in muscle length does not occur. Isometric actions are used to keep the body in a certain position. For example, postural muscles commonly undergo isometric contraction to maintain a static body position. http://www.dietsinreview.com/diet_column/07/top-5-isometirc-core-exercises/ Dynamic activity includes force production with a change in muscle length. There are 2 types of dynamic muscle activity: • Concentric muscle contraction: • Most common type of contraction. • Muscle shortens and joint movement occurs as tension develops. • Eccentric muscle contraction: • External resistance exceeds muscle force. • Muscle lengthens while generating tension. • This type of exercise most often associated with delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). http://clevelandfitnessrevolution.com/bootcamp/method-behind-the-madness-eccentric-interval-training/ Factors affecting force regulation in muscle 1. Types and number of motor units recruited Variations in strength of contraction within an entire muscle depend on the type and the number of muscle fibers that are stimulated to contract. If only a few motor units are recruited, the force is small. If more motor units are stimulated, the force increases. Also recall that fast fibers exert a greater specific force than do slow fibers. Therefore, the type of motor units recruited also influence force production. 2. Nature of the motor unit neural stimulation Normal bodily movements involve sustained contractions (not just simple muscle twitches), and therefore require a series of successive stimuli. A single stimulation (or action potential) produces a simple twitch. As the frequency of stimulation increases, twitches are summated to produce a contraction. If the frequency of stimulation is increased further individual contractions are blended to produce a single, sustained contraction called tetanus. 3. The initial length of the muscle The force exerted by a muscle is dependent on the initial length of the muscle at the start of the contraction. There exists an ideal length of the muscle fiber, where it exerts a maximal force. The explanation for the ideal length is related to the overlap between actin and myosin. When the length of the muscle is longer than optimal, the overlap between actin and myosin is limited and fewer cross bridges can attach. This decreases the force of contraction. When the muscle is stretched to a point where no overlap exists between actin and myosin, cross bridges cannot attach and thus tension cannot be developed. At the other extreme, when the muscle is shortened to about 60% of its resting length, the Z lines are very close to the thick myosin filaments, and thus only limited additional shortening can occur. Resting length Optimal length Adaptations to resistance (strength) training Strength Neural Hypertrophy Training durationProgressMost training studies Most serious strength athletes It has become clear that a portion of the gains in strength that occurs with resistance training is due to neural adaptations. Neural adaptations related to strength training include an improved ability to recruit motor units to enable a person to match the strength elicited by electrical stimulation. These factors include an improved ability to inhibit antagonistic muscles and Golgi tendon organs, an increased firing rate of motor neurons, and increased synchronicity between agonistic muscles. Therefore, adaptations in nervous system functions that elevate motor neuron output account for the rapid and large increases in strength early in training, often without an increase in muscle size or cross-sectional area. In contrast, long term resistance training results in physiological changes associated with increases in muscle size (hypertrophy and hyperplasia). Muscle size may begin to increases from approximately 4 weeks after the onset of training. Increases in muscle size require increased protein synthesis and satellite cell proliferation. Adaptations to resistance training Muscle size will increase in one of two ways 1) An increase in muscle fiber diameter (hypertrophy). This involves increases in myosin and actin filament size, as well as increases in muscle fiber nuclei (myocytes contain multiple nuclei). 2) An increase in muscle cell numbers (hyperplasia). • This involves an increase in proliferation of connective tissue cells and satellite cells. In addition, regular strength training results in an increase in intramuscular stores of phosphocreatine and glycogen (which are important for anaerobic energy production). These adaptations will be accompanied with increases in the content of glycolytic enzymes. Taken together, these adaptations increase the anaerobic capacity. Importantly, resistance training does not induce increases in capillarisation, mitochondrial volumes, numbers or enzymes. Exercise training induces metabolic changes within the muscle fibres that we have so that they mimic the characteristics of the muscle fibre type preferable to the type of sport. The major adaptations are summarized below: Adaptation Significance ↑ Muscle mass ↑ Muscle strength ↑ Cross sectional area of muscle ↑ Contractile capacity ↑ Type I and II fibre area ↑Strength ↑ Intracellular glycogen content ↑Glycolytic capacity ↑ Intramuscular high-energy phosphate pool ↑Phosphagen metabolism ↑ Intramuscular ATP utilisation rate ↑Capacity for maximum contraction ↑ Rate of motor unit activation ↑Rate of force development ↑ Motor unit synchronisation ↑ Force ↑ efficiency in application of force ↑ Inhibition of golgi tendon organ ↓ Inhibition of maximal muscle contraction Speed of muscle action If a muscle is given a single stimulus, such as a brief electrical shock applied to nerve endings, the muscle responds with a simple twitch. Different muscle fiber types will respond differently to a twitch stimulus. When stimulated, fast fibers contract in a shorter period of time than do slow fibers. The speed of shortening is greater in fast fibers than in slow fibers because the sarcoplasmic reticulum in fast fibers releases calcium at a faster rate, and fast fibers possess a higher ATPase activity compared to slow muscle fibers. The higher ATPase activity results in a more rapid splitting of ATP and a quicker release of the energy required for the power stroke. The sprint star Usain Bolt, who holds the Olympic and world titles and world records in the 100m, 200m was honoured as the 'fastest man in the world'. Bolt's haul of nine golds is the joint highest among Olympic athletics. Force/velocity relationships Historically, the force-velocity relationship has been used to define the dynamic properties of the cross-bridges which cycle during muscle contraction. Experimentally, a muscle is allowed to shorten against a constant load. The relationship between movement velocity and force production for a concentric muscle action is shown below. As the velocity of movement increases, maximal force production will decrease. However, the opposite relationship is present for eccentric contractions. As the velocity of movement increases, force production will also increase. For any given velocity, force production during eccentric movements is always higher. This is also why eccentric exercise is associated with a greater degree of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) Watch the video on force velocity relationships below Press play Anaerobic capacity - The Wingate test The Wingate test is the most used measure of anaerobic capacity. The Wingate test is used to assess peak power output (PPO), relative PPO (to body weight), anaerobic fatigue and total anaerobic work. Watch the video below to see how it is performed. Power output during exercise Please watch the video on the Wingate test above Assessment of muscle strength • Requires specificity: i.e. similar muscles involved in sport movement, movement pattern, contraction type, contraction velocity. • Options include: • Isometric measurements • Free-weight testing • 1 Repetition maximum (RM) • Variable resistance measurement of strength • Isokinetic strength assessment (pictured below) Practice question 7 During a one repetition maximum test to measure maximum strength, greater force is produced when a) the myofibril is shortened at a slow rate than when it is shortened at a fast rate. b) the myofibril is lengthened at a slow rate than when it is lengthened at a fast rate. c) the myofibril is maximally stretched. d) a greater number of motor units are recruited. e) more type IIb muscles are recruited.
