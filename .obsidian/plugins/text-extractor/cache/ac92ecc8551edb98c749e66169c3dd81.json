Why the term ‘Germinal’ Tunica Albuginea: A collagenous dense connective tissue capsule. Cortex: Comprised of a connective tissue stroma and numerous ovarian follicles. Each follicle contains an oocyte, surrounded by a layer of follicular cells. Follicles are at different developmental stages Medulla: Formed by loose connective tissue and a rich neurovascular network, which enters via the hilum of the ovary. The purpose of follicular development includes to ❖ Provide a conducive environment for the ❖ Developing oocyte till maturation ❖ Release of the oocyte ❖ Nutrition ❖ Steroidogenesis for its own growth Follicular development is under the influence of hormones produced by: ❖ Hypothalamus ❖ Anterior pituitary ❖ Posterior pituitary ❖ Ovaries FOLLICULAR DEVELOPMENT Primordial germ cells ❖ Extragonadal origin (embryonic yolk sac, cortex of embryonic gonad) Primordial follicles ❖ First appear during 3rdmonth of fetal development ❖ At birth oocytes are arrested in development at the first meiotic division ❖ During puberty follicles undergo cyclic changes and maturation. Growing follicles (microenvironment for developing oocyte) ❖ Primary unilaminar follicles to Primary multilaminar follicles ❖ Secondary antral follicles ❖ Mature Graafian follicles Stages of follicular development OVARIAN FOLLICLES ❖ Primordial follicle ❖ Primary oocyte –Ooplasm with eccentric nucleus, dispersed chromatin and 1-2 nucleoli ❖ Follicular cells -single layer of squamous follicle cells + Basal lamina (outer surface) OVARIAN FOLLICLES ❖ Primary (unilaminar) follicle ❖ Centrally placed primary oocyte ❖ Surrounded by zonapellucida (ZP) (glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins) ❖ Follicular cells are granulosacells (GC) –single layer of cuboidal cells ❖ Stromal cells form theca folliculi ❖ Primary multilaminar follicle ❖ Primary oocyte enlarging ❖ Granulosa layer – stratified layer of follicle cells ❖ Theca interna-LH influence (LH receptors) -androgen > oestrogen + fibroblasts, collagen fibers and rich blood supply ❖ Theca externa-smooth muscle and collagen fibers ❖ Boundaries between thecas and maturation of the oocyte OVARIAN FOLLICLES ❖ Secondary antral follicle ❖ Stratum granulosum or granulosa cells (GC) 6-12 layers ❖ Increase in fluid accumulation in the antrum (liquor folliculi) to form cavities ❖ Antrum eventually forms a single crescent shape towards the end ❖ Primary oocyte eccentrically displaced and there is no further growth. ❖ As of follicular maturation continues; ❖ Under the influence of pituitary lutenising hormone (LH), theca interna cells become steroid producing cells. ❖ These cells secrete androgens that are precursors to estrogens ❖ Androgens are transported to the granulosa cells, and in response to pituitary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) hormone, androgens are converted to estrogens ❖ Estrogens stimulate the granulosa cells to proliferate and enlarge thus increasing the size of the follicle. ❖ Spaces between granulosa cells enlarge while the granulosa cell layer increases in size ❖ Cumulus oophorus and corona radiata ❖ Meiosis is complete, secondary oocyte is formed, and first polar body formed ❖ Secondary oocyte ready to be released surrounded by corona radiata ❖ Ovulation OVARIAN FOLLICLES Mature graafian follicle OVARIAN FOLLICLES Mature graafian follicle ❖ Vesicular (Graafian) follicle—growing follicle with a maturing oocyte ❖ Spaces between GC enlarge while the GC layer increases in size ❖ Cumulus oophorus is formed ❖ Secondary oocyte ready to be released surrounded by corona radiata ❖ After ovulation, a corpus luteum is formed. ❖ In the absence of fertilization and implantation the corpus luteum of menstruation is formed. ❖ With fertilization and signal from the Human chronic gonadotropin (hCG) produced by the developing trophoblast, the corpus luteum of pregnancy is formed and is active for 6 weeks until placenta takes over . Ovary Primordial and primary follicle Secondary antral follicle Graafian vesicular follicle The actual release of the secondary oocyte influenced by: ❖ Increase in volume and pressure of the follicular fluid ❖ Enzymatic proteolysis of the follicular wall by activated plasminogen ❖ Hormonally directed deposition of glycosaminoglycans between the oocyte –cumulus complex and the stratum granulosum ❖ Contraction of the smooth muscle fibers in the theca externa triggered by prostaglandins The release of the secondary oocyte OVULATION ❖ Corpus haemorrhagicum ❖ Graafian follicle forms a temporary structure with a central clot ❖ CT from stroma invades the lumen ❖ LH influence – Corpus Haemorragicum becomes Corpus luteum CORPUS HAEMORRHAGIUM & CORPUS LUTEUM ❖ Granulosa lutein cells and Theca lutein cells increase in size and filled with lipid ❖ Lipochrome – yellow appearance ❖ Highly vascularized structure ❖ Luteal phase - Secretion of P and E preparation for implantation ❖ Corpus luteum of menstruation - If implantation does not occur (active for 14 days) ❖ Corpus luteum of pregnancy - If implantation occurs - active for 6 weeks until placenta takes over ❖ Ovulation results in the release of the secondary oocyte from the mature Graaffian follicle. ❖ The remains of the collapsed Graaffian follicle undergoes reorganisation into the corpus luteum ❖ The corpus luteum has centrally located blood clot initially occupied by the oocyte ❖ Blood clot is surrounded by granulosa lutein cells, derived from granulosa cells, and peripherally located theca lutein cells derived from theca the interna cells. ❖ The cells of theca externa forms connective tissue septa of the corpus luteum. ❖ The corpus luteum is a transient endocrine organ that secretes estrogen and progesterone in preparation for possible fertilization and implantation. CORPUS LUTEUM ❖ Corpus albicans forms in the absence of fertilization (absence of hCG) ❖ Decreased P and E – degeneration of corpus luteum (10-12 days after ovulation) ❖ Cells loaded with lipids and fibrous tissue, decrease in size, degenerate and undergo autolysis ❖ Later phagocytosed by macrophages ❖ Intercellular hyaline material (white scar) ❖ Scar tissue on the ovarian surface ❖ Remnant of the corpus luteum post ovulation CORPUS ALBICANS Mature Graafian follicle Secondary (antral) follicle Primordial and primary follicles Corpus luteum ❖ Production of gametes –gametogenesis ❖ Female -Oogenesis ❖ Developing gametes -oocytes ❖ Mature gametes -ova ❖ Oogonia (fetal life) oocytes (at birth) ova (puberty) ❖ Production of hormones –steroidogenesis ❖ Oestrogen- produced by follicles for growth and maturation of internal and external sex organs and development of female sex characteristics (puberty) + mammary gland development ❖ Progesterone-produced by corpus luteum for secretory changes in the endometrium + mammary gland proliferation (lactation) FUNCTIONS OF THE OVARY❖ Female reproductive organs undergo regular structural and functional cyclic changes from puberty to menopause ❖ Changes related to neural activity and changes in hormone levels during each menstrual cycle and pregnancy ❖ Menarche – occurs in females between 9-14 years - End of puberty and beginning of the reproductive life ❖ Menstrual cycle ❖ Menopause (climacterium) – “change of life” CYCLIC CHANGESUTERUS ❖ Endometrium ❖ Inner layer (mucosa) ❖ Site of implantation of a fertilized egg ❖ Sloughs off if no pregnancy occurs (menstruation or menses) ❖ Myometrium is the middle layer of smooth muscle that contracts during labour ❖ Perimetrium (visceral peritoneum) is the outermost serous layer of the uterus. ❖ Primarily endometrium (& myometrium) undergo cyclic changes (menstrual cycle) STRUCTURE OF UTERINE TUBES ❖Infundibulum ❖Distal, funnel-shaped end ❖Fimbriae ❖Finger like projections of the infundibulum ❖Receive the oocyte from the ovary ❖Cilia located inside the uterine tube transport the oocyte ❖Suspensory ligaments secure the ovaries to the lateral walls of the pelvis ❖Ovarian ligaments anchor ovaries to the uterus medially ❖Broad ligaments, a fold of peritoneum, enclose and supports the ovaries and uterine tubes. SURFACE EPITHELIUM ❖ Lines the lumen of the uterus ❖ A single layer of secretory simple columnar cells and ciliated columnar cells that lie on a basement membrane ❖ Below is the lamina propria ❖ Uterine glands are embedded in the lamina propria HISTOLOGICAL LAYERS OF THE UTERUS STRATUM FUNCTIONALE ❖ Contains the rest of the uterine glands ❖ Stratum functionale undergoes changes during the menstrual cycle while basale is mostly unchanged STRATUM BASALE ❖ Adjacent to the myometrium ❖ It is within the lamina propria ❖ Uterine glands begin within stratum basale MYOMETRIUM ❖ The thickest layer of the uterus composed of: bundles of smooth muscle fibres separated by connective tissue, large blood vessels, lymphatic vessels ❖ It undergoes hyperplasia (increase in the number of smooth muscle) and hypertrophy (increase in cell size) during pregnancy ❖ The smooth muscles contract during labour UTERINE CYCLE ❖ Proliferative–influenced by Oestrogen coincides with follicular maturation (follicular phase or pre-ovulatory phase of the ovary) ❖ Secretory–influenced by Progesterone coincides with corpus luteum (CL) function (luteal or post-ovulatory phase of the ovary) ❖ Menstrual- coincides with CL degeneration ❖ After menstruation the uterine mucosa is thin, about 0.5 mm ❖ The beginning of the proliferative phase coincides with a rapid growth of ovarian follicles. ❖ These follicles begin to actively secrete estrogens. ❖ Estrogens induce cell proliferation within the endometrium PROLIFERATIVE PHASE ❖ The endometrium is divided into the stratum functionale (SF) which is shed at menstruation; and stratum basalis (SB). ❖ The surface epithelium (columnar)is shown by red arrow *The glands (GL) are straight and seen in the stroma (S). ❖ The arrow (black) show the junction between the SB and M. ❖ This inset (P) on right low corner, show the lumen (L), endometrium E, myometrium M. PROLIFERATIVE PHASE ❖ Epithelial cells reconstitute the glands and migrate to cover endometrial surface ❖ Stromal cells proliferate ❖ Spiral arteries lengthen (bottom 2/3 of endometrium) ❖ Glands with narrow lumina and relatively straight ❖ The endometrium is 2-3mm thick by the end of the proliferative phase ❖ Secretory phase starts after ovulation ❖ Due to high levels of progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum ❖ Progesterone reinforces the action of estrogen on the uterine glands. It stimulates the gland cells. ❖ The glands become highly coiled, lumina become dilated, filled with glycoproteins secreted by the glands. ❖ Endometrium is highly vascularilized ❖ Endometrium reaches its maximum thickness (5mm) due to glandular secretions and edema in the stroma ❖ This is in preparation for implantation SECRETORY PHASE SECRETORY PHASE ❖ Levels of progesterone rise and increase the blood supply to the endometrium, which becomes more vascular ❖ Endometrium increases in size and readies for implantation ❖ If fertilization of the oocyte(egg) and implantation do not occur. ❖ Levels of progesterone and estrogen decrease rapidly. ❖ Spiral arteries contract, cutting off blood supply to the endometrium ❖ This causes necrosis(death) of the spiral arteries and stratum functionale. ❖ The endometrium shrinks in size ❖ Periodic contraction of the spiral artery walls ❖ Stratum functionale becomes ischemic ❖ Glands stop secretion ❖ Endometrium shrinks, stroma less edematous ❖ Disruption of the surface epithelium ❖ Vessels rupture MENSTRAL PHASE http://medcell.med.yale.edu/histology/female_genital_tract_uterine_cycle.php MENSTRAL PHASE ❖ Functional layer of the endometrium is sloughed ❖ Bleeding occurs for 3 to 5 days ❖ Ovarian hormones are at their lowest levels ❖ By day 5, growing ovarian follicles are producing more estrogen. ❖ At the end of the menstrual cycle the endometrium is a thin layer ❖ However, it is ready to begin a new cycle as cells start to divide and reconstitute the mucosa. ❖Elaine, N., Marieb, K. and Suzanne, M., 2017.
