This perception can be considered as the brain’s interpretation of a physical stimulus received by pain receptors in the skin. Figure 1.1: A model for the human feeling of physical pain a) Calculate an expression for the ‘feeling’ of pain experienced by a person due to a single pin prick. (Hint: you can model the pin prick as an impulse function.) b) How long after the pin prick event does the brain register a maximum ‘feeling’ of pain? c) Draw a graph showing the change in the intensity of the pain experienced due to and after the pin prick event. Show the calculations for a few points on the graph that you used to determine the shape of the graph. d) Draw a graph of the pain experienced by a person due to three consecutive pin pricks, spaced 10 s apart.
