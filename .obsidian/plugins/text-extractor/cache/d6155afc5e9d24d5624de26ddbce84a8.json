Micrograph (a) shows part of a glomerular capillary tuft. The capillaries are enveloped by podocytes which have large flattened cell bodies and bulging nuclei N. Each podocyte has several long primary processes P1 that embrace one or more capillaries. Each primary process has numerous secondary foot processes (pedicels) which rest on the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane. At higher magnification in micrograph (b), the secondary foot processes P2 can be seen as extensions of the large primary processes P1. The secondary foot processes interdigitate with those of other primary processes, separated by filtration slits of uniform width.

Micrograph (a) shows several capillary loops C lined by a thin layer of fenestrated endothelial cytoplasm. The endothelial cell nuclei E can be seen bulging into the capillary lumina. The capillary endothelial fenestrations F are better seen at higher magnification in micrographs (b) and (c). The nuclei of several podocytes P can be seen, their primary processes P1 giving rise to numerous secondary foot processes P2 that rest on the glomerular basement membrane BM. At right midfield a branched mesangial stalk comprising mesangial cells M and mesangial matrix MM provides support for the capillary loops. The mesangium is separated from the capillary lumen only by the cytoplasm of the endothelial cells, while the podocytes and their basement membrane continue around the mesangial stalk, separating it from Bowman’s space. Part of Bowman’s capsule BC is seen at the periphery, consisting of a squamous epithelial cell and underlying basement membrane. The subpodocyte space SPS and interpodocyte space IPS are easily identified, although the subpodocyte space exit pore is not seen. At the periphery of the glomerulus, Bowman’s space BS is delineated by the podocyte cell bodies on one side and the parietal epithelial cells on the other. Micrograph (b) shows three glomerular capillaries C lined by attenuated endothelial cytoplasm E with wide fenestrations F. A podocyte P extends several primary processes P1 onto the capillaries, these in turn giving rise to multiple secondary foot processes P2 separated by filtration slits FS. The subpodocyte space SPS can again be identified. The glomerular basement membrane BM separates the podocytes and capillary endothelium. The thickness of the basement membrane appears variable, but this is due to the slightly oblique plane of section; the basement membranes are in fact of uniform width. At even higher magnification in micrograph (c), three of the components of the glomerular filter are seen. The fenestrated capillary endothelium E is closely applied to the luminal surface of the glomerular basement membrane BM; on the opposite side are podocyte secondary foot processes P2, separated by filtration slits of uniform width and bridged by the slit diaphragms. Part of the subpodocyte SPS space is seen, but the podocyte cell body which delimits the subpodocyte space is not apparent The wide central lamina densa of the glomerular basement membrane can be seen bordered on each side by a narrow lamina rara. The glycocalyces of the endothelial cells and podocytes are not apparent in these micrographs; special fixation and processing techniques are required to demonstrate them.

The capillary lumen is lined by the delicate fenestrated endothelium E. Podocyte primary processes P1 and secondary foot processes P2 are easily seen, as well as subpodocyte space SPS. The mesangium is composed of fibrillary basement membrane-like material MM within which is embedded a mesangial cell MC. Mesangial cells have long cytoplasmic processes CP that ramify through the mesangium and form cell junctions with the processes of other mesangial cells. Several of these cell junctions J can be seen in this field. Thus the mesangial cells form a network supporting the glomerular capillaries. One function of mesangial cells is the secretion of mesangial matrix; they also secrete vasoactive factors and cytokines and phagocytose particles such as immune complexes from the blood. The majority of mesangial cells have a well-developed filamentous cytoskeleton rich in actin and are thought to be specialised pericytes, but a small proportion of these cells display phagocytic characteristics such as the expression of surface Fc and C3 receptors. Mesangial cells with this phagocytic phenotype are able to phagocytose and destroy large particles such as immune complexes taken up from the blood. This micrograph demonstrates the close relationship between the mesangial and endothelial cells. These are not separated from each other by a basement membrane and in fact lie within the same basement membrane–bound compartment. Conceptually it might be helpful to consider the mesangium as a modified segment of the glomerular capillary wall. Also in this electron micrograph the morphological difference between the glomerular basement membrane BM and the mesangial matrix MM is apparent; this reflects the differences in chemical composition between the two. The main structural components of mesangial matrix are type IV collagen, laminin, fibronectin and proteoglycans such as decorin and biglycan. BM SPS E L CP J J P2 P1 CP CP MC MM Diabetic renal disease Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of renal failure in affluent countries. The incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing, an increase that is felt to be largely due to changing lifestyles, with increasing obesity and decreasing exercise, although there is little doubt that genetic factors are also important. Usually one of the earliest signs of diabetic nephropathy is proteinuria, which may eventually progress to the nephrotic syndrome and progressive chronic renal failure. The microscopic features in these cases include thickening of the mesangial basement membrane and an increase in mesangial matrix, often called diabetic glomerulosclerosis. In normal glomeruli, the balance between deposition of new and removal of old mesangial matrix is very tightly controlled. Recent research is beginning to tease out the mechanisms underlying these clinical features, including chemical mediators such as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) that induce increased deposition of mesangial matrix in response to high glucose concentrations. This mesangial matrix has a different composition to normal matrix, including increased amounts of type I and type III collagen which are not easily removed from the glomerulus. However, other factors, including direct podocyte injury and changes in the slit pore membrane, also contribute to the characteristic proteinuria that precedes frank renal failure. Diabetics also tend to suffer from vascular disease, hypertension and increased infections in the kidney, and all of these tend to contribute to the downward spiral towards end-stage renal failure. 305ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 16: Urinary system FIG. 16.16  Proximal and distal convoluted tubules  (a) PCT, Azan (HP) (b) PCT, PAS (HP) (c) DCT, H&E (HP) (d) DCT, PAS (HP) These micrographs compare the appearances of the proximal and distal convoluted tubules. The intervening loop of Henle is discussed in Fig. 16.19. The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is a coiled tube measuring approximately 14 mm in length and random sections of PCT thus occupy most of the renal cortex. Approximately 65% of the glomerular filtrate is reabsorbed from the PCT, a function reflected in the structure of the epithelial lining. Micrograph (a) shows a proximal convoluted tubule PCT arising from a renal corpuscle; convolutions of the PCT are also seen in longitudinal, oblique and transverse sections. The simple cuboidal epithelium has a prominent blue-stained brush border of tall microvilli, increasing the surface area of the plasma membrane some 20-fold. The cytoplasm of PCT epithelial cells stains intensely due to a high content of organelles, principally mitochondria. Basement membranes stain blue by this technique, thus highlighting the tubular and glomerular basement membranes and that of Bowman’s capsule. The PAS staining method has been used in micrograph (b) to demonstrate the prominent brush border BB projecting into the lumen of the PCT. The brush border is PAS-positive, since the surfaces of the microvilli are coated with a prominent glycocalyx (see Fig. 1.2). Like those elsewhere, the basement membrane BM supporting the tubular epithelium is strongly PAS-positive. In both micrographs, note that the epithelial cells of the PCT have round nuclei with prominent nucleoli. A rich network of peritubular capillaries C arising from the efferent arteriole of the glomerulus (see Fig. 16.11) surrounds the proximal tubules and returns molecules reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate back into the general circulation. The distal tubule is a continuation of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle after its return to the cortex and forms the third segment of the renal tubule. Distal tubules are thus found within the cortex among the proximal convoluted tubules. The first part of the distal tubule forms the macula densa (see Fig. 16.18) while the remainder makes up the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). In the DCT, sodium ions are reabsorbed from the tubular fluid, with one hydrogen or potassium ion being secreted in exchange. This adjustment of acid-base balance is controlled by the hormone aldosterone secreted by the adrenal cortex (see Fig. 16.18). As seen in micrograph (c), distal convoluted tubules DCT may be differentiated from proximal convoluted tubules PCT by the absence of a brush border, a larger more clearly defined lumen, more nuclei per cross-section (since DCT cells are smaller than PCT cells) and paler cytoplasm (due to fewer organelles). In addition, sections of DCT are less numerous than sections of PCT, since the DCT is much shorter than the PCT. In micrograph (d) the prominent brush border of the proximal convoluted tubule PCT is contrasted with the lack of brush border in the distal convoluted tubule DCT.

Micrograph (a) of the proximal tubule reveals profuse tall microvilli Mv constituting the brush border seen with light microscopy. The cytoplasm immediately beneath the brush border contains many pinocytotic vesicles V (that are just visible at this magnification) and lysosomes L, both of which are involved in reabsorption and degradation of small amounts of protein that have leaked through the glomerular filter. Reabsorbed solutes are transported into surrounding peritubular capillaries Cap, with attenuated endothelium E resting on a very thin basement membrane BME; note the narrow intervening supporting tissue layer S in micrograph (b). The epithelial cells of the PCT form multiple lateral processes P (micrograph b) which interdigitate with each other to form a complex lateral intercellular space, with a plasma membrane area equivalent to the luminal plasma membrane. The lateral intercellular space is separated from the lumen of the PCT by a ring of junctional complexes J near the luminal surface. The mitochondria M in these processes are elongated and arranged at right angles to the basement membrane BM. These mitochondria supply ATP for the active transport of Na + by the Na +-K+ ATPase (sodium pump) located in the basolateral plasma membrane. Thus active transport of Na+ occurs across the plasma membrane into the lateral intercellular space. This active transport of Na + out of the cell is accompanied by facilitated transport into the cells of Na+, glucose and amino acids by means of transport proteins found in the membrane of the brush border. Almost 100% of the filtered glucose and amino acids is reabsorbed by the PCT. The distal convoluted tubule (c) has many ultrastructural features in common with the proximal convoluted tubule, in particular the lateral cell interdigitations and large numbers of mitochondria M. The basolateral plasma membrane contains the Na +-K+ ATPase which drives active transport of sodium ions. The most striking difference is that the DCT lacks a brush border, having only a few irregular microvilli Mv at the luminal surface. The DCT cells have less cytoplasm than those of the PCT, although the nucleus is of about the same size and consequently occupies much more of the cell. The nuclei of the DCT cells lie close to the luminal surface and tend to bulge into the lumen; the overlying cytoplasm is devoid of mitochondria but contains large numbers of tiny pinocytotic vesicles (not seen at this magnification).

Mitochondria are scattered throughout the cytoplasm, and Na+ pump activity is absent. The basement membrane between the macula and underlying cells is extremely thin. The cells of the macula densa are sensitive to the concentration of sodium ions in the fluid within the DCT; a decrease in systemic blood pressure results in decreased production of glomerular filtrate and hence decreased concentration of sodium ions in the distal tubular fluid. • Juxtaglomerular cells. Juxtaglomerular cells J are modified smooth muscle cells of the wall of the afferent arteriole, forming a cluster around it just before it enters the glomerulus. Juxtaglomerular cell cytoplasm contains immature and mature membrane-bound granules of the enzyme renin. • Extraglomerular mesangial cells. Also called Goormaghtigh cells or lacis cells L, these cells form a conical mass, the apex of which is continuous with the mesangium of the glomerulus; laterally it is bounded by the afferent and efferent arterioles, and its base abuts the macula densa. The lacis cells are flat and elongated, with extensive fine cytoplasmic processes extending from their ends and surrounded by a network (‘lacis’) of mesangial material. These cells participate in the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism by which changes in Na + concentration at the macula densa give rise to signals that directly control glomerular blood flow. The extraglomerular mesangial cells are thought to be responsible for transmission of a signal arising in the macula densa to the intraglomerular mesangial cells, which then contract or relax to make the capillary loops narrower or wider. Role of the JGA in the control of blood pressure The juxtaglomerular apparatus is believed to act as both a baroreceptor and a chemoreceptor, controlling systemic blood pressure by the secretion of renin by the juxtaglomerular cells. The juxtaglomerular cells are suitably placed to monitor systemic blood pressure, with a fall in blood pressure resulting in renin secretion. Reduction in blood pressure results in reduced glomerular filtration and consequently a lower concentration of sodium ions in the DCT. Acting as chemoreceptors, the cells of the macula densa in some way then promote renin secretion. Renin diffuses into the bloodstream, catalysing the conversion of angiotensinogen, an α2-globulin synthesised by the liver, into the decapeptide angiotensin I. In the lungs, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) cleaves two amino acids from angiotensin I to form angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor. Angiotensin II raises blood pressure in three ways: constriction of peripheral blood vessels, release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex and via a direct effect on the renal tubules, where it promotes the reabsorption of sodium ions (and therefore water) from the DCT, thus expanding the plasma volume and increasing blood pressure. As mentioned above, the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism is also thought to operate at a local level to control glomerular blood flow and therefore indirectly influencing systemic blood pressure. Hypertension and the kidney Hypertension is a common condition in middle-aged and elderly persons. Most cases are considered to be idiopathic (which simply means that the mechanism has not yet been elucidated). However, there are certainly genetic factors as well as lifestyle components underlying many, if not most, cases. A much smaller proportion of hypertensive patients, especially younger patients, have hypertension associated with renal disease. Many different types of renal disease may lead to hypertension; a classic example is the acute hypertension seen in patients with post-infectious glomerulonephritis. Many other chronic renal conditions, including diabetic nephropathy, IgA nephropathy and a range of other common conditions lead to secondary hypertension. Conversely, hypertension can also lead to renal failure. The classic example of this is patients with accelerated hypertension who have acute renal failure with classic vascular changes in their renal biopsy at presentation. However, chronic untreated lower-level hypertension also typically leads to chronic renal damage in a pattern sometimes called ‘benign nephrosclerosis’, a misleading name as it can lead to chronic renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. The juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) is a specialisation of the glomerular afferent arteriole AA and the distal convoluted tubule DCT of the same nephron and is involved in the regulation of systemic blood pressure via the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (RAAS). The juxtaglomerular apparatus is made up of three components: the macula densa of the DCT, renin-secreting juxtaglomerular cells of the afferent arteriole and extraglomerular mesangial cells. • Macula densa. On returning to the cortex from the renal medulla, the ascending thick limb of the loop of Henle becomes the first part of the distal tubule and comes to lie in the angle between the afferent and efferent arterioles at the vascular pole of the glomerulus. The macula densa MD is an area of closely packed, specialised DCT epithelial cells where the DCT abuts the vascular pole of the glomerulus. 310The renal medullaTHE RENAL MEDULLA The renal medulla consists of closely packed tubules of two types: the loop of Henle and the collecting tubules and ducts, as well as the vasa recta. The loop of Henle is a con- tinuation of the proximal convoluted tubule. It dips down into the medulla, where it loops back on itself and returns to the cortex to its own renal corpuscle, becoming the first part of the distal convoluted tubule. FIG. 16.19  Loop of Henle  (a) H&E, TS (HP) (b) EMSB, LS (HP) The loop of Henle is made up of four parts: • Thick descending limb (pars recta of the PCT) • Thin descending limb • Thin ascending limb • Thick ascending limb (pars recta of the DCT) The thick descending limb is the second, straight part of the proximal tubule that extends down into the outer medulla. There is an abrupt transition to the thin descending limb, which loops down into the medulla for a variable distance. The thin limbs of juxtamedullary nephrons extend down to the inner medulla before turning back on themselves, while those in the outer cortex only extend a short way into the medulla. After the hairpin bend, the tubule becomes the thin ascending limb for a short distance before abruptly changing into the thick ascending limb. Thus the thin descending limb is longer than the thin ascending limb. The thin limbs T have a simple squamous epithelium and may be differentiated from the vasa recta V by the absence of erythrocytes and their regular rounded shape in transverse section. Erythrocytes, stained orange by this staining method, are easily seen in the vasa recta in micrograph (b). The thick ascending limbs A are lined by low cuboidal epithelium and are also round in cross-section. Neither thick nor thin limbs of the loop of Henle have a brush border. Collecting tubules CT have a similar epithelial lining to the ascending limbs but are wider and less regular in shape. The collecting ducts CD are easily recognised by their large diameter and pale stained columnar epithelial lining. The function of the loop of Henle is to produce an increasing osmotic gradient from the cortex to the tip of the renal papilla by the counter-current multiplier mechanism (see Fig. 16.26). In brief, the parts of the loop of Henle with a thick (cuboidal) epithelium participate in active transport of various ions and molecules out of the lumen and into the interstitium. On the other hand, the thin limbs are lined by a flattened squamous epithelium with little capacity for active transport. The thin descending limb allows free diffusion of H2O but is fairly impermeable to NaCl, while the thin ascending limb is permeable to NaCl but not to H2O. The vasa recta take up water from the medullary interstitium and return it to the general circulation. As the urine flows into the thick ascending limb, active transport of NaCl again occurs, and this correlates with the appearances of the epithelium. Here the cuboidal epithelium exhibits basolateral processes that interdigitate with each other, forming an extensive basolateral intercellular space in a similar manner to the PCT. This active transport process is fuelled by ATP produced by the many mitochondria found in these processes. The thick ascending limb is also impermeable to water. Tamm-Horsfall protein is a unique glycoprotein produced only by the epithelium of the thick ascending limb. Tamm-Horsfall protein has protective functions, including binding to certain types of Escherichia coli to prevent the bacteria adhering to the renal tubular epithelium and prevention of the formation of renal calculi.

Several collecting tubules merge to form each collecting duct. The collecting tubules and ducts descend in the medullary rays (see Fig. 16.5) towards the renal medulla where they progressively merge to form the large ducts of Bellini which drain urine from the tip of the renal papilla into the pelvicalyceal system. The collecting tubules and ducts concentrate urine by passive reabsorption of water into the medullary interstitium following the osmotic gradient created by the counter-current multiplier system of the loops of Henle (see Fig. 16.26). The vasa recta return this water to the general circulation. The amount of water reabsorbed is controlled by antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin) secreted by the posterior pituitary in response to dehydration. ADH acts by increasing the permeability to water of the collecting tubule and ducts, resulting in retention of water by the body and the production of hypertonic urine. Conversely, ADH secretion is inhibited by water overload and an increased volume of hypotonic urine is thus produced. The collecting tubules and ducts are also the final site of H+, K +, Na + and HCO3− secretion and/or reabsorption to achieve homeostasis; these functions are modified and controlled by the RAAS and local paracrine factors such as kallikrein. The simple low columnar epithelium of the collecting ducts consists of two cell types, principal cells and intercalated cells. Principal cells have pale cytoplasm with scanty organelles and short microvilli. These cells have prominent infoldings of the basolateral plasma membrane but no lateral interdigitations. Principal cells actively reabsorb Na + and secrete K+, as well as reabsorbing water. Intercalated cells have darker cytoplasm due to the content of multiple mitochondria, polyribosomes and membrane-bound vesicles. These cells secrete H + and reabsorb bicarbonate and are thus important in acid-base homeostasis. The number of intercalated cells varies between different parts of the collecting duct and they are virtually absent in the inner medullary segment. The collecting tubules are lined by a mixture of DCT cells, collecting tubule cells, principal cells and intercalated cells. Overall, the epithelium is cuboidal and becomes increasingly tall distally until it merges with the columnar epithelium of the collecting duct. Micrograph (a) illustrates two collecting tubules in the renal cortex, the tubule on the left being more proximal and the tubule on the right more distal, as shown by the flatter cuboidal lining of the former. The majority of the lining cells are relatively poorly stained. The different cell types cannot be differentiated by light microscopy, except for a small number of dark intercalated cells IC with surface microvilli. Note the blue-stained tubular basement membranes BM and narrow intervening supporting tissue S, mainly occupied by capillaries. Micrograph (b) is from the renal medulla and illustrates two collecting ducts CD surrounded by loops of Henle and vasa recta that cannot be readily distinguished from one another. In the medullary portion of the collecting ducts, principal cells are predominant and no intercalated cells can be seen in this section.

Lying between the vasa recta and nephrons is the delicate interstitial supporting tissue S containing a little collagen along with renal interstitial medullary cells (RIMC). The collecting tubule in this section is lined mainly by principal cells whose basal mitochondria, associated with infoldings of the plasma membrane, can just be identified at this power and are seen clearly in micrograph (b) in the collecting tubule CT in the right upper corner. The cells of the thin limbs of loops of Henle are similar to capillary endothelial cells in structure, most of the wall consisting of a thin irregular layer of cytoplasm with a few very short luminal microvilli and the nucleus bulging into the lumen. The epithelium is supported by a thin basement membrane BM. The vasa recta can only be readily distinguished from the thin limbs by their content of erythrocytes, occasional leucocytes L and precipitated plasma proteins. The interstitium of the inner medulla in some species, including humans, contains unusual cells called renal interstitial medullary cells. These are illustrated in micrograph (b), a longitudinal section of the medulla, where the cell bodies of two such cells are identifiable by their nuclei N. These cells have plentiful lipid droplets D within the cytoplasm and long cytoplasmic processes P that form a network throughout the loose supporting tissue containing collagen fibrils C that fills the intervening space. Interestingly, there are also fragments of redundant basal lamina BL in the supporting tissue, implying that these RIMC may change their position over time. These cells are often arranged at right angles to the collecting tubules CT and vasa recta V. The function of these cells is not yet clear, but they may be involved in the production of prostaglandins and/or hormones that regulate blood pressure.

The lower urinary tract is specialised for the storage and excretion of urine at a convenient time; no further modification of the urine is possible after it leaves the renal medulla. FIG. 16.22  Renal papilla, monkey  Azan (LP) The renal papilla forms the apex of the medullary pyramid, where it projects into the pelvicalyceal system PCS. Ducts of Bellini DB, the largest of the collecting ducts, converge to drain urine through a number of holes (cribriform area) at the tip of the papilla. Between the ducts are the longest loops of Henle and vasa recta (not visible at this magnification). This papilla is a simple papilla, but at the poles of the human kidney, the papillae are often fused to form complex papillae. The pelvicalyceal system represents the proximal end of the ureter U and, as such, is lined by typical urinary (transitional) epithelium E. The wall of the pelvis contains smooth muscle SM, continuous with that of the ureter. DB PCS U E SM FIG. 16.23  Ureter  Masson trichrome (LP) The ureters are muscular tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Urine is transported from the pelvicalyceal system as a bolus, propelled by peristaltic action of the ureteric wall. The wall of the ureter contains two layers of smooth muscle, arranged as an inner elongated spiral but traditionally known as the longitudinal layer L and an outer tight spiral traditionally described as the circular layer C. Another outer longitudinal layer is present in the lower third of the ureter. However, in reality the three layers are often difficult to distinguish from each other. The lumen of the ureter is lined by transitional epithelium (urothelium) which is thrown up into folds in the relaxed state, allowing the ureter to dilate during the passage of a bolus of urine. Beneath the epithelium is a broad collagenous lamina propria LP, the collagen fibres of which are stained greenish-blue in this preparation. Surrounding the muscular wall is a loose collagenous adventitia A containing blood vessels V, lymphatics and nerves.

The general structure of the bladder wall resembles that of the lower third of the ureters. The wall of the bladder consists of three loosely arranged layers of smooth muscle and elastic fibres that contract during micturition. Note the inner longitudinal IL, outer circular C and outermost longitudinal OL layers of smooth muscle; together the three layers are called the detrusor muscle. As in the ureter, the layers are often difficult to distinguish. The transitional epithelium lining the bladder is thrown into many folds in the relaxed state. A delicate, often incomplete muscularis mucosa (not identifiable at this magnification) separates the lamina propria from the submucosa in some but not all individuals. The outer adventitial coat A contains arteries, veins and lymphatics. The urethra, the final conducting portion of the urinary tract, is discussed as part of the male reproductive tract in Ch. 18. IL OL C A FIG. 16.25  Transitional epithelium  H&E (HP) Transitional epithelium, also called urothelium, is found only within the conducting passages of the urinary system, for which it is especially adapted. The epithelium is stratified, comprising three to six layers of cells, the number of layers being greatest when the epithelium is least distended at the time of fixation. The cells of the basal layer are compact and cuboidal in form, while those of the intermediate layers are more columnar, with their nuclei orientated at right angles to the basement membrane. The surface cells are called umbrella Um or dome cells and have unique features that allow them to maintain the impermeability of the epithelium to urine, even when at full stretch. This permeability barrier also prevents water from being drawn through the epithelium into hypertonic urine. The umbrella cells are large and ovoid with round nuclei and plentiful eosinophilic cytoplasm; some surface cells are binucleate (not illustrated). The surface outline has a characteristic scalloped appearance and the superficial cytoplasm is fuzzy, indistinct and more intensely stained than the rest of the cytoplasm. Ultrastructural studies have revealed that much of the surface plasma membrane consists of thickened inflexible plaques, often called asymmetrical unit membrane, interspersed with narrow zones of normal membrane. These normal areas act as ‘hinges’, allowing sections of the membrane to fold inwards somewhat like a concertina, forming deep clefts and stacks of flattened plasma membrane segments, inappropriately called fusiform vesicles. This structure allows the umbrella cells to expand greatly and quickly when the bladder is distended and the epithelium is at full stretch. Plentiful junctional complexes between the cells maintain the cohesion of adjacent cells. These features of the urothelium allow it to store chemically toxic urine in considerable volumes for quite long periods of time without damage to the tissues. Urinary epithelium rests on a basement membrane that is often too thin to be resolved by light microscopy. The loose lamina propria LP is seen underlying the epithelium. LP Um 316Review FIG. 16.26  Summary of major activities of different parts of the renal tubule  The function of the renal tubule is to transform an ultrafiltrate of plasma into a concentrated solution of waste products such as urea, creatinine, excess H + and K+ and many other substances. At the same time, the tubule conserves essential water, Na +, bicarbonate, amino acids, glucose and low molecular weight proteins. This complex procedure is carried out by a variety of mechanisms in different segments of the tubule, including active transport, co-transport, passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion (see Ch. 1) and differential permeability of different parts of the tubule. The ability of the tubule to produce concentrated urine is dependent on the high osmolarity of the renal medulla, which is created by the unique structure of the loops of Henle and vasa recta dipping down into the medulla. This is known as the counter-current multiplier mechanism. In the presence of ADH, which renders the collecting tubule and duct permeable to water, the high osmolarity of the interstitium of the renal medulla draws water passively out of the tubule and into the medulla where it is carried away by the vasa recta. The counter-current multiplier mechanism is set up by the ability of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle to pump large amounts of NaCl into the interstitium against a concentration gradient while remaining impermeable to water. The thin descending limb is permeable to water but not NaCl, and water is reabsorbed into the medulla, resulting in hyperosmolar urine reaching the hairpin bend of the loop. This water, however, is removed by the vasa recta. The hyperosmolarity of the medulla is also partly due to the high concentrations of urea resulting from passive diffusion of urea from the medullary collecting duct into the interstitium along its concentration gradient. This diagram outlines the major movements of solutes and water into and out of the different parts of the renal tubule. For further detail of these processes the reader is referred to current physiology texts. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000••\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000••\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000••\u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 •\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000•\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000••\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 REVIEW 317ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 16: Urinary system TABLE 16.1 Review of the urinary system Kidney Part of nephron Important structural components Special features Functional significance Glomerulus Endothelium, glomerular basement membrane and podocytes with foot processes Glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) Allow water, ions and small molecules to pass into subpodocyte space while retaining large protein molecules Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) Simple cuboidal epithelium Microvilli (brush border) Facilitated diffusion of glucose and amino acids Extensive basolateral interdigitations Na + pump Plentiful mitochondria Energy for active transport Pars recta of proximal tubule Simple cuboidal epithelium Microvilli (brush border) Secretion of organic acids No basolateral interdigitations Thin descending/ ascending limbs Simple squamous epithelium No basolateral interdigitations or microvilli No active transport Mitochondria scanty Low energy requirement Thick ascending limb Simple cuboidal epithelium Microvilli absent No facilitated diffusion Extensive basolateral interdigitations Active transport of Na + Distal convoluted tubule (DCT) Simple cuboidal epithelium Active transport of Na+ Extensive basolateral interdigitations Mitochondria plentiful Energy for active transport Collecting tubule Simple cuboidal epithelium Principal cells Na + reabsorption, ADH-dependent H2O reabsorption, K+ secretion Intercalated cells Acid-base balance, K + reabsorption Collecting tubule cells DCT cells Active transport of Na+ Cortical collecting duct Simple columnar epithelium Principal cells Na + reabsorption, ADH dependent H2O reabsorption, K+ secretion Intercalated cells Acid-base balance, K + reabsorption Medullary collecting duct Simple columnar epithelium Mainly principal cells ADH-dependent water reabsorption Lower urinary tract Component Muscle structure Epithelium Function Pelvicalyceal system Smooth muscle, no distinct layer structure Transitional epithelium (urothelium) Conveys urine from the tips of the renal papillae into the ureter Ureter 3 muscle layers, inner spiral (longitudinal) and outer spiral (circular) layers + outermost longitudinal layer in lower third Carries urine to the bladder Bladder 3 muscle layers, inner and outermost longitudinal and middle circular Stores urine 318Pituitary gland INTRODUCTION •\t Amino\t acid\t derivatives,\t e.g.\t thyroxine,\t adrenaline\t (epinephrine)\tand\tnoradrenaline\t(norepinephrine). •\t Steroids\t derived\t from\t cholesterol,\t e.g.\t adrenal\t cortical\t hormones,\tovarian\tand\ttesticular\thormones.

These tumours are classified as benign because they do not invade adjacent tissues. However, they may have serious or even fatal consequences. They cause their effects by the excessive, continuous production of hormone, uncontrolled by any feedback mechanisms. Thus a tumour of corticotrophs secretes excess ACTH, stimulating the adrenals to produce large quantities of corticosteroid, leading to Cushing’s disease. Tumours of somatotrophs produce excess growth hormone, causing gigantism in children or acromegaly in adults. Some pituitary adenomas produce no hormones but grow locally so large that they grow upwards out of the sella turcica to compress and damage the overlying optic chiasma and nerves, leading to visual disturbance and eventual blindness. The pituitary gland can rarely be destroyed by disease blocking its arterial supply, leading to necrosis of the cells and failure of hormone output (panhypopituitarism). 323ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 17: Endocrine system THYROID GLAND The\t thyroid\t gland\t is\t a\t butterfly-shaped\t endocrine\t gland\t lying\tin\tthe\tneck\tin\tfront\t of\tthe\tupper\t part\tof\t the\ttrachea.\t The\tthyroid\tgland\tproduces\thormones\tof\ttwo\ttypes: •\t Iodine-containing\thormones\ttri-iodothyronine\t(T3),\tand\t thyroxine\t(tetra-iodothyronine,\tT4);\tT4\tis\tconverted\tto\tT3\t in\tthe\tgeneral\tcirculation\tby\tremoval\tof\tone\tiodothyro- nine\t unit,\t although\t a\t small\t amount\t of\t T3\t is\t secreted\t directly.\tT3\tis\tmuch\tmore\tpotent\tthan\tT4\tand\tappears\tto\t be\tthe\tmetabolically\tactive\tform\tof\tthe\thormone.\tThyroid\t hormone\tregulates\tthe\tbasal\t metabolic\trate\tand\thas\tan\t important\tinfluence\ton\tgrowth\tand\tmaturation,\tparticu- larly\tof\tnerve\ttissue.\tThe\tsecretion\tof\tthese\thormones\tis\t regulated\tby\tTSH\tsecreted\tby\tthe\tanterior\tpituitary. •\t The\t polypeptide\t hormone\t calcitonin;\t this\t hormone\t regulates\t blood\t calcium\t levels\t in\t conjunction\t with\t parathyroid\thormone.\tCalcitonin\tlowers\tblood\tcalcium\t levels\tby\tinhibiting\tthe\trate\tof\tdecalcification\tof\tbone\tby\t osteoclastic\t resorption\t and\t by\t stimulating\t osteoblastic\t activity.\t Control\t of\t calcitonin\t secretion\t is\t dependent\t only\ton\tblood\tcalcium\tlevels\tand\tis\tindependent\tof\tpitu- itary\tand\tparathyroid\thormone\tlevels.

The commonest cause of hyperparathyroidism is a benign tumour of one of the parathyroid glands (parathyroid adenoma) which constantly produces excessive PTH, unresponsive to normal feedback mechanisms related to the blood calcium levels. The excess parathormone stimulates excessive osteoclastic erosion of bone (see Fig. 10.6), with the release of bone calcium into the blood to produce hypercalcaemia. The results include bone pain with X-ray abnormalities and an increased risk of kidney stones. This pattern is called primary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a secondary response of all the parathyroid glands to a persistent low serum calcium level in patients with kidney failure who are constantly losing calcium in their urine. The feedback mechanism is triggered and all of the parathyroids become enlarged (parathyroid hyperplasia) and secrete excess PTH in an attempt to bring the serum calcium level back to normal. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when the hyperplastic glands of secondary hyperparathyroidism cease to respond to serum calcium levels. The glands secrete high levels of PTH autonomously. Hypoparathyroidism is rare and is usually due to inadvertent surgical removal of all parathyroid glands during total thyroidectomy. 328Adrenal glandADRENAL GLAND The\t adrenal\t (suprarenal)\t glands\tare\t small,\tflattened\t endo- crine\tglands\twhich\tare\tclosely\tapplied\tto\tthe\tupper\tpole\tof\t each\t kidney.\t In\t mammals,\t the\t adrenal\t gland\t contains\t two\t functionally\tdifferent\ttypes\tof\tendocrine\ttissue\twhich\thave\t distinctly\t different\t embryological\t origins;\t in\t some\t lower\t animals,\tthese\ttwo\tcomponents\texist\tas\tseparate\tendocrine\t glands.\t The\t two\t components\t of\t the\t adrenal\t gland\t are\t the\t adrenal cortex\tand\tadrenal medulla.

More common is hyperadrenalism where there is excess secretion of one or more of the cortical hormones, mainly glucocorticoids (producing Cushing’s syndrome) or mineralocorticoids (producing Conn’s syndrome). The excess hormone may be produced by a benign tumour (adrenal cortical adenoma) or a malignant tumour (adrenal cortical carcinoma) or by diffuse hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex. In adrenal cortical carcinoma, the excessive output may affect all three types of cortical hormone, including androgens, and hirsutism or virilisation are sometimes present.

Diabetes mellitus Diabetes mellitus is a common and important disease of insulin metabolism, resulting in hyperglycemia. There are two main types: • Type 1 diabetes usually begins in childhood or adolescence and is the result of loss of endocrine cells in the pancreatic islets, including those which secrete insulin. The islet cell destruction is thought to be due to an abnormal autoimmune response, possibly triggered by a viral infection, and results in insulin deficiency. This has widespread metabolic effects on carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism, leading to complex metabolic and structural effects. • Type 2 diabetes begins in late adult life (maturity onset) and is the result of the resistance of target cells to the effect of insulin, rather than a failure of insulin production by the pancreatic islets. Tumours of the islets of Langerhans Rarely, tumours of the islets of Langerhans may produce disease as a result of excessive secretion of one of the islet hormones, for example, an insulin-secreting tumour produces hyperinsulinism with hypoglycaemic symptoms. 334Diffuse neuroendocrine system DIFFUSE NEUROENDOCRINE SYSTEM This\t is\t the\t name\t given\t to\t a\t scattered\t system\t of\t neuroen- docrine\t cells\t which\t secrete\t hormones\t and\t active\t peptides.\t Neuroendocrine\t cells\t possess\t characteristic\t membrane- bound\t neurosecretory\t vesicles,\t usually\t spherical,\t with\t an\t electron-dense\t central\t core\t (dense core vesicles).\tAlthough\t neuroendocrine-type\t cells\t form\t part\t of\t other\t endocrine\t organs\t (e.g.\t adrenal\t medulla)\t and\t some\t non-endocrine\t organs\t (e.g.\t islets\t of\t Langerhans\t in\t the\t pancreas,\t juxta- glomerular\t apparatus\t in\t kidney),\t they\t are\t particularly\t important\tin\tthe\tdiffuse\tneuroendocrine\tsystems\tin\tthe\tgas- trointestinal\tand\trespiratory\ttracts.

The most frequent, and most important, is a highly malignant tumour of neuroendocrine cells of the bronchial tree, called small cell (oat cell) carcinoma. This tumour grows very rapidly and infiltrates and destroys nearby tissues, but also spreads to distant sites such as bones, liver, and brain (metastases). Some of these tumours retain some capacity to synthesise and, secrete, hormones or hormone- precursor molecules and, rarely, excessive secretion of these can cause fatal metabolic disorders. Small cell carcinoma of the lung often secretes an ACTH-like substance which stimulates excessive and uncontrolled secretion of hormones from the adrenal cortex. The most common tumour of the neuroendocrine cells in the alimentary tract is the carcinoid tumour. These are most common in the small intestine and appendix, and grow slowly. They secrete 5-HT which usually has no systemic effect because it passes from the tumour in the gut via the hepatic portal vein to the liver where it is broken down into inactive products. Although these tumours are slow-growing, they are potentially malignant and can spread to secondary sites away from the gut. In this case, 5-HT can enter the systemic blood circulation and produce metabolic effects; this is called carcinoid syndrome. 335ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 17: Endocrine system FIG. 17.23  Gastrointestinal  neuroendocrine cells   (a) Immunohistochemical stain for  chromogranin A (MP) (b) EM ×12 500 Neuroendocrine\tcells\tare\tvery\tdifficult\tto\t identify\ton\tH&E\tstained\tsections,\tbut\t immunohistochemistry\tand\telectron\t microscopy\tmake\tthe\ttask\teasy.\tMicrograph\t(a)\t shows\tduodenal\tmucosa\twith\tthe\tcrypts\tC\tas\t well\tas\tthe\tlower\tsegments\tof\tthe\tvilli\tV\t stained\tby\tan\timmunohistochemical\tmethod\t for\tchromogranin\tA.\tChromogranin\tA\tis\ta\t component\tof\tall\tneurosecretory\tgranules\tand\t so\tmerely\tidentifies\tthe\tcells\tas\tneuroendocrine\t cells,\twithout\tgiving\tany\tclue\tas\tto\ttheir\t secretory\tproduct.\tThe\tneuroendocrine\tcells\t Ne\t(dark\tbrown)\tare\tpyramidal-shaped,\twith\ta\t broad\tbase\tsitting\ton\tthe\tbasement\tmembrane\t of\tthe\tepithelium\tand\ta\tnarrower\tpart\t approaching\tthe\tlumen\tof\tthe\tgland.\tIn\t so-called\topen-type\tmucosal\tneuroendocrine\t cells,\tthe\tnarrow\tend\tof\tthe\tcell\tis\tin\tcontact\t with\tthe\tlumen\tand\tits\tcontents.\tNote\tthat\tthe\t neuroendocrine\tcells\tare\tconcentrated\tin\tthe\t crypts,\tbut\toccasional\tcells\tare\talso\tseen\twithin\t the\tvillous\tepithelium.

Semen, the fluid expelled during ejaculation, consists of seminal fluid and spermatozoa, plus some desquamated duct- lining cells. • The penis is the organ of copulation. A pair of small accessory glands, the bulbourethral glands of Cowper, secrete a fluid which lubricates the urethra for the passage of semen during ejaculation. 18 Male reproductive system The male reproductive system is responsible for the produc- tion of spermatozoa and their delivery into the female reproductive tract and may be divided into four major func- tional components: • The testes or male gonads, paired organs lying in the scrotal sac, are responsible for production of the male gametes, spermatozoa, and secretion of male sex hor- mones, principally testosterone. • A system of ducts consisting of ductuli efferentes, epidi- dymis, ductus (vas) deferens and ejaculatory duct col- lects, stores and carries spermatozoa from each testis. The ejaculatory ducts converge on the urethra, from FIG. 18.1 Male reproductive system \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 338TestisFIG. 18.2 Testis During embryological development, each testis with the first part of its duct system, blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves descends from the posterior wall of the peritoneal cavity to the scrotum. During migration, the testis carries with it an investing layer of peritoneum so that in the scrotum the testis is almost completely surrounded by a double layer of mesothelium, enclosing a potential space. This double lining is called the tunica vaginalis and, like the pleura, consists of visceral and parietal layers, separated by a thin layer of serous fluid. The fluid is secreted by the mesothelial cells and acts as a lubricant, allowing the testis to move freely in the scrotal sac. The visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis rests on the capsule of the testis, the tunica albuginea, which gives rise to numerous incomplete collagenous septa. These divide the testis into about 250 testicular lobules. Within each lobule, there are one to four highly convoluted tubes, the seminiferous tubules, in which spermatozoa are produced. The seminiferous tubules converge upon a plexus of channels, the rete testis. From the rete testis, 15 to 20 small ducts called the ductuli efferentes carry spermatozoa to the extremely tortuous first part of the ductus deferens, which is known as the epididymis. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 FIG. 18.3 Testis, monkey H&E (LP) This micrograph illustrates the macroscopic features of a testis; cut in the sagittal plane, it shows the relationship to the epididymis E, which lies on its posterior aspect. The testis is packed with coiled seminiferous tubules which can just be seen in various planes of section at this magnification. Groups of up to four seminiferous tubules are segregated into testicular lobules by fine interlobular septa S. The dense fibrous capsule which invests the testis, and which is continuous with many of the interlobular septa, is called the tunica albuginea TA. It contains fibroblasts and abundant myofibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, particularly in the posterior aspect close to the rete testis, which subject the seminiferous tissue to rhythmic contractions. Scattered Leydig cells are also found within the tunica albuginea. The deepest layer of the tunica albuginea consists of loose connective tissue containing blood and lymphatic vessels, sometimes called the tunica vasculosa. Spermatozoa pass from the seminiferous tubules into the rete testis RT, which is connected to the epididymis via the ductuli efferentes at the upper posterior pole of the testis; the ductuli are not included in the plane of this section. The epididymis is a tightly coiled tube which forms a compact mass extending down the whole length of the posterior surface of the testis and is the major site of storage of newly formed spermatozoa. At the lower pole of the testis, the epididymal tube becomes continuous with the relatively straight ductus (vas) deferens, not seen in this section. TA RT E S S 339ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 18: Male reproductive system GAMETOGENESIS In all somatic cells, cell division (mitosis) results in the formation of two daughter cells, each one genetically identi- cal to the mother cell. Somatic cells contain a full comple- ment of chromosomes (the diploid number) which function as homologous pairs (see Ch. 2). The process of sexual re- production involves the fusion of specialised male and female cells called gametes to form a zygote, which has the diploid number of chromosomes. Each gamete contains only half the diploid number of chromosomes, one repre- sentative of each pair; this half complement of chromosomes is known as the haploid number. The production of haploid cells involves a unique form of cell division called meiosis, which occurs only in the germ cells of the gonads during the formation of gametes; meiotic cell division is thus also called gametogenesis. Meiosis involves two cell division cycles, of which only the first is preceded by duplication of chromosomes (see Ch. 2). Thus, meiotic cell division of a single diploid germ cell gives rise to four haploid gametes. In the male, each of the four gametes undergoes morphological development into a mature spermatozoon. In contrast, in the female, unequal distribution of the cytoplasm during meiosis results in one gamete gaining almost all the cytoplasm from the mother cell, while the other three acquire almost no cytoplasm; the large gamete matures to form an ovum and the other three, called polar bodies, degenerate. The primitive germ cells of the male, the spermatogonia, are present only in small numbers in the male gonads before sexual maturity. After puberty, spermatogonia multiply continuously by mitosis to provide a supply of cells which then undergo meiosis to form male gametes. In contrast, the germ cells of the female, called oogonia, multiply by mitosis only during early fetal development, thereby pro- ducing a fixed complement of cells with the potential to undergo gametogenesis. Gametogenesis in the female is discussed more fully in Ch. 19. The production of male gametes is called spermatogenesis and the subsequent development of the male gamete into a motile spermato- zoon is called spermiogenesis, the whole process taking approximately 70 days; both these processes occur within the testes, although final maturation of spermatozoa occurs in the epididymis. FIG. 18.4 Seminiferous tubules H&E (MP) This micrograph illustrates seminiferous tubules cut in various planes of section. The seminiferous tubules are highly convoluted and are lined by: • Germ cells in various stages of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis, which are collectively referred to as the spermatogenic series • Non–germ cells, called Sertoli cells, which support and nourish the developing spermatozoa are also found within the seminiferous tubules. • In the interstitial spaces between the tubules, endocrine cells called Leydig cells are found either singly or in groups in the supporting tissue. In this micrograph of normal testis at medium power, note the seminiferous tubules Se cut in various planes of section, giving round and ovoid profiles. Between the seminiferous tubules the interstitium I contains Leydig cells (which cannot be discerned at this magnification) and small capillaries C. Larger arteries and veins are found in the fibrous septa that divide the organ into lobules.

The processes of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis are synchronised, with waves of activity occurring sequentially along the length of each tubule. Thus in a single cross-section of a tubule, not all development phases will be represented (b). The undifferentiated diploid germ cells, found in the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubule, are called type A spermatogonia. These go through several cycles of mitosis to produce further type A spermatogonia, which maintain the germ cell pool, and type B spermatogonia, which are committed to production of spermatozoa. Spermatogonia type A SA are characterised by a large round or oval nucleus with condensed chromatin; peripheral nucleoli and a nuclear vacuole may be prominent. Spermatogonia type B SB have dispersed chromatin, central nucleoli, and no nuclear vacuole. Both types of spermatogonia have sparse poorly stained cytoplasm. Type B spermatogonia undergo further mitotic divisions to produce primary spermatocytes. These migrate to the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous tubule before commencing the first meiotic division. Primary spermatocytes S1 are readily recognised by their copious cytoplasm and large nuclei containing coarse clumps or thin threads of chromatin; dividing cells may be seen. In humans, the first meiotic division cycle takes approximately 3 weeks to complete, after which time the daughter cells become known as secondary spermatocytes. The smaller secondary spermatocytes rapidly undergo the second meiotic division and are therefore seldom seen. The gametes thus produced, called spermatids S3, then proceed through the long maturation process known as spermiogenesis to become recognisable as spermatozoa. During this process, the nuclei of the spermatids assume the small pointed form of spermatozoa S4 (see Fig. 18.7). Examination of different sections of the tubules of a normal testis shows about half the spermatogenic cells to be in the late spermatid stage. During the developmental process, the cells of the spermatogenic series are supported by Sertoli cells St, whose nuclei are usually found towards the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubule. The Sertoli cell nucleus is typically triangular or ovoid in shape with a prominent nucleolus and dispersed chromatin. The basal layer of germinal cells is supported by a basement membrane which is surrounded by a lamina propria containing several layers of spindle-shaped myofibroblasts M and fibroblasts. a SA SA St S1 S3 S4 SB SB SB M S1 St M Spermatogonia type A 1st meiotic division Secondary spermatocytesSpermatidsSpermatozoa 2nd meiotic division Spermatogonia type B Primary spermatocytes Migrate to adluminal compartment Mitosis Mitosis b 341ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 18: Male reproductive system FIG. 18.6 Spermiogenesis Spermiogenesis is the process by which spermatids, the gametes produced by meiotic division, are transformed into motile mature spermatozoa. This involves the following major stages: 1. The Golgi apparatus elaborates a large membrane bound vesicle, the acrosomal vesicle, which accumulates carbohydrates and hydrolytic enzymes. 2. The acrosomal vesicle becomes applied to one pole of the progressively elongating nucleus to form a structure known as the acrosomal head cap. 3. Meanwhile, both centrioles migrate to the end of the cell opposite to the acrosomal head cap; the centriole aligned parallel to the long axis of the nucleus elongates to form a flagellum which has a basic structure similar to that of the cilium (see Fig. 5.13). 4. As the flagellum elongates, nine coarse fibrils, which may contain contractile proteins, become arranged longitudinally around the core of the flagellum. Further rib-like fibrils then become disposed circumferentially around the whole flagellum. 5. The cytoplasm migrates to surround the first part of the flagellum. The remainder of the flagellum appears to project from the cell but in fact remains surrounded by plasma membrane. This migration of cytoplasm thus concentrates mitochondria in the flagellar region. 6. As the flagellum elongates, excess cytoplasm is phagocytosed by the enveloping Sertoli cell prior to release of the spermatid into the lumen, a process called spermiation. The mitochondria become arranged in a helical manner around the fibrils which surround the first part of the flagellum. The structure of fully formed spermatozoa varies in detail from species to species but conforms to the basic structure seen in this diagram of a human spermatozoon. Throughout the entire developmental process from spermatogonia to spermatozoa, hundreds of spermatids remain connected to one another by narrow cytoplasmic bridges which only break down upon release of spermatozoa into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. This explains the synchronous development of spermatozoa at any one part of the tubule. Sertoli cells are important in the regulation of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis. Sertoli cells form tight junctions with each other as well as with the developing germ cells. It is well established that high concentrations of androgen hormones, secreted by Leydig cells of the testicular interstitium (see Fig. 18.10), are essential for production and maturation of spermatogenic cells. Sertoli cells secrete an androgen-binding protein which transports testosterone and dihydrotestosterone to the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. These hormones are also necessary for function of the epithelium of the rete testis and epididymis; production of this binding protein is believed to be dependent on the pituitary gonadotrophin follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000• \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 •\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 •\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 •\u0000\u0000\u0000 M myofibroblast SA type A spermatogonium SB type B spermatogonium S1 primary spermatocyte S3 spermatid S4 spermatozoon St Sertoli cell 342Gametogenesis AC acrosomal cap An annulus AV acrosomal vesicle Ax axoneme BM basement membrane C chromatin body Cy cytoplasm F outer dense fibres G Golgi apparatus M myofibroblast Mi mitochondrion Nu nucleolus PM plasma membrane Rb fibrous ribs Rn fibrous rings S spermatogonium St Sertoli cell S1 primary spermatocyte S3 spermatid S4 spermatozoon FIG. 18.7 Spermatozoa (a) Head, LS, EM ×14 000 (b) Neck (middle piece and principal piece), LS, EM ×17 000 (c) Middle piece, TS, EM ×48 000 The ultrastructural features of human spermatozoa are shown in these micrographs. The spermatozoon is an extremely elongated cell (about 65 µm long) consisting of three main components: the head, neck and tail. The tail is subdivided into three segments: the middle piece, principal piece and end piece (see Fig. 18.6). The head is the most variable structure between different mammalian species. In humans the head is about 7 µm long and has a flattened pear shape. As seen in micrograph (a), the nucleus, which occupies most of the head, is composed of very condensed chromatin; in humans, this contains a variable number of areas of dispersed chromatin called nuclear vacuoles. Surrounding the anterior two-thirds of the nucleus is the acrosomal cap AC, a flattened membrane-bound vesicle containing a range of glycoproteins and a variety of hydrolytic enzymes, principally hyaluronidase; the enzymes disaggregate the cells of the corona radiata and dissolve the zona pellucida during fertilisation (see Ch. 19). Note the plasma membrane PM, which has become partially separated during preparation. The neck is a very short segment connecting the head with the tail. It contains vestiges of the centrioles, one of which gives rise to the axoneme Ax of the flagellum, which is seen in micrograph (c). The axoneme has the standard ‘nine plus two’ arrangement of microtubule doublets seen in cilia (see Fig. 5.13). The axoneme of the neck is surrounded by several condensed fibrous rings Rn seen in micrograph (b). In human spermatozoa, a significant amount of cytoplasm Cy often remains in the neck region. The middle piece, the first part of the tail, is about the same length as the head and consists of the flagellar axoneme surrounded by nine coarse (outer dense) fibres F arranged longitudinally. External to this core, elongated mitochondria Mi are arranged in a tightly packed helix providing the energy required for flagellar movement. A fibrous thickening beneath the plasma membrane, called the annulus An, prevents the mitochondria from slipping into the principal piece. The principal piece, which constitutes most of the tail length, consists of a central core comprising the axoneme and the nine coarse fibres continuing from the middle piece. Surrounding this core are numerous fibrous ribs Rb arranged in a circular manner and seen in micrograph (b). Two of the longitudinal fibrils of the core are fused with the surrounding ribs so as to form dorsal and ventral columns extending throughout the length of the principal piece (not illustrated). This arrangement divides the principal piece longitudinally into two functional compartments, one containing three coarse fibrils and the other containing four. Little is known of the mechanism of flagellar motion, but this asymmetry may account for the more powerful stroke of the tail in one direction, the so-called power stroke; this can easily be observed in fresh live preparations of spermatozoa viewed with the light microscope. The end piece, not shown in these micrographs, is merely a short, tapering portion of the tail containing the axoneme only.

The Sertoli cell rests on the basement membrane BM of the seminiferous tubule and its cytoplasm extends to the lumen of the tubule. Sertoli cells have an extensive cytoplasm which ramifies throughout the whole germinal epithelium, enclosing all the cells of the spermatogenic series. The cytoplasmic outline of the Sertoli cell is thus highly irregular and constantly changing to permit the progressive movement of developing spermatozoa towards the luminal surface. The oval nucleus of the Sertoli cell is characteristically orientated at right angles to the basement membrane and often exhibits a deep indentation. A prominent nucleolus Nu is a constant feature and dense chromatin bodies C are often associated with the nucleolus. The cytoplasm contains a moderate number of mitochondria, lipid droplets and a small amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum. Plentiful smooth endoplasmic reticulum is also present, as well as lamellar protein arrays known as Charcot-Bottcher crystals (not shown in this cell). Sertoli cells are bound to one another by junctional complexes containing extensive tight junctions (see Ch. 5). The junctional complex is located towards the basal layer of the spermatogenic epithelium so as to divide the tubule into basal and adluminal compartments. The latter contains the spermatids, which are thus isolated by a blood-testis barrier. The Sertoli cells mediate all metabolic exchange with the systemic compartment. The function of this barrier is to prevent exposure of gametes, which are antigenically different from somatic cells, to the immune system, thus preventing an autoimmune response. Sertoli cells have multiple functions including: • Secretion of factors which regulate spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis • Secretion of factors which regulate the function of Leydig cells and peritubular cells • Secretion of inhibin which regulates hormone production • Secretion of tubular fluid • Phagocytosis of discarded spermatid cytoplasm A variety of cells of the spermatogenic series are seen in this micrograph. Spermatogonia S rest upon the basement membrane BM, beneath which is a myofibroblast M. Above the germ cell layer, primary spermatocytes S1 are seen; secondary spermatocytes are short-lived and therefore rarely seen. Spermatids S3 in different phases of spermiogenesis are seen in upper layers; these cells have developing acrosomal vesicles AV elaborated by a large Golgi apparatus G (see Fig. 18.6). At the luminal surface, the Sertoli cell partly envelops the head of an almost fully formed spermatozoon S4.

However, this micrograph demonstrates the extensive cytoplasm of the Sertoli cells as they ramify around the cells of the spermatogenic series. The immunohistochemical stain uses an antibody directed against inhibin, a product of Sertoli and Leydig cells, and so the cytoplasm of both of these cell types is strongly stained brown; note the cluster of Leydig cells L in the interstitium. The nuclei are not stained. Note the maturing spermatozoa S towards the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. S L S FIG. 18.10 Interstitial (Leydig) cells of the testis H&E (HP) Leydig cells L, the principal cell type found in the interstitial supporting tissue between the seminiferous tubules, synthesise and secrete the male sex hormones and other non-steroid substances. They occur singly or in clumps and are embedded in the rich plexus of blood and lymph capillaries which surrounds the seminiferous tubules. The nucleus is round with dispersed chromatin and one or two nucleoli at the periphery. The extensive eosinophilic cytoplasm contains variable numbers of lipid vacuoles and, seen by electron microscopy, closely resembles the steroid-secreting cells of the adrenal cortex (see Fig. 17.16). In humans (and wild bush rats) but no other species, Leydig cells also contain elongated cytoplasmic crystals of Reinke which are large enough to be seen with light microscopy when suitably stained; these crystals are found only in adults but their function is unknown. Testosterone is the main hormone secreted by Leydig cells. Testosterone is not only responsible for the development of male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty but is also essential for the continued function of the seminiferous epithelium. The secretory activity of Leydig cells is controlled by the pituitary gonadotrophic hormone luteinising hormone, sometimes called interstitial cell stimulating hormone (ICSH) in the male. L FIG. 18.11 Rete testis H&E (LP) The seminiferous tubules converge upon the mediastinum testis, which consists of a plexiform arrangement of channels, the rete testis RT, surrounded by highly vascular collagenous supporting tissue containing myoid cells. The rete testis is lined by a single layer of low cuboidal epithelial cells with surface microvilli and a single cilium. Myoid cell contraction helps to mix the spermatozoa and move them towards the epididymis. The lining epithelium reabsorbs protein and potassium from the seminal fluid. Ciliary activity is presumed to aid the progress of spermatozoa, which do not become motile until after maturation is completed in the epididymis.

It is important because it may undergo torsion leading to loss of blood supply and necrosis (infarction), an extremely painful process. The appendix testis is a remnant of the müllerian duct and is present in approximately 80% of men. The appendix testis A has a fibrovascular core and a cuboidal to columnar surface epithelium which may be ciliated (not visible at this magnification). Note the seminiferous tubules ST in the adjacent testis. Other appendages in this area are the less common appendix epididymis, the vas aberrans (organ of Haller) and the paradidymis (organ of Giraldes). A ST FIG. 18.13 Ductulus efferens H&E (MP) The rete testis drains into the head of the epididymis via some 15 to 20 convoluted ducts, the ductuli efferentes DE. The ductuli are lined by a single layer of epithelial cells, some of which are tall columnar and ciliated and others which are short and non-ciliated; both cell types often contain a brown pigment of unknown composition. Ciliary action in the ductuli propels the still non-motile spermatozoa towards the epididymis. The non-ciliated cells reabsorb some of the fluid produced by the testis. Basal cells, which do not reach the lumen, are also present and probably act as stem cells. A thin band of circularly arranged smooth muscle SM surrounds each ductulus and aids propulsion of the spermatozoa towards the epididymis. DE SM FIG. 18.14 Epididymis (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (HP) The epididymis is a long, extremely convoluted duct extending down the posterior aspect of the testis to the lower pole where it becomes the ductus (vas) deferens. The epididymis consists of a head at the upper pole of the testis, a body lying along the posterior margin and a tail at the lower pole of the testis. The major function of the epididymis is the accumulation, storage and maturation of spermatozoa S; in the epididymis, the spermatozoa develop motility. The epididymis is a tube of smooth muscle lined by a pseudostratified epithelium. From the proximal to the distal end of the epididymis, the muscular wall increases from a single circular layer SM, as in these micrographs, to three layers organised in the same manner as in the ductus deferens (see Fig. 18.15). Proximally, the smooth muscle exhibits slow, rhythmic contractility which gently moves spermatozoa towards the ductus deferens. Distally, the smooth muscle is richly innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, which produces intense contractions of the lower part of the epididymis during ejaculation. The epithelial lining of the epididymis exhibits a gradual transition from a tall pseudostratified columnar form in the head, as seen in micrograph (b), to a shorter pseudostratified form at the tail. The principal cells of the epididymal epithelium bear tufts of very long microvilli, inappropriately called stereocilia (see Fig. 5.15), which are thought to be involved in absorption of an excess of fluid accompanying the spermatozoa from the testis. The ultrastructure of the cells strongly suggests an additional secretory function but the nature of epididymal secretory products, if any, remains unknown. Basal cells B are prominent at the base of the epithelium. S S SS a SM b B SM 346Seminal vesicles and prostateFIG. 18.15 Vas deferens H&E (LP) The vas (or ductus) deferens, which conducts spermatozoa from the epididymis to the urethra, is a thick-walled muscular tube consisting of inner I and outer O longitudinal layers and a thick intermediate circular layer CI. Like the distal part of the epididymis, the vas deferens is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, producing strong peristaltic contractions to expel its contents into the urethra during ejaculation. The vas deferens is lined by a pseudostratified columnar epithelium similar to that of the epididymis (see Fig. 18.14); the epithelial lining and its supporting lamina propria are thrown into longitudinal folds, permitting expansion of the duct during ejaculation. The dilated distal portion of each vas deferens, known as the ampulla, receives a short duct draining the seminal vesicle, thus forming the short ejaculatory duct; the ejaculatory ducts from each side converge to join the urethra as it passes through the prostate gland. In this low-power micrograph, the adipose tissue A, arteries AA and veins V that accompany the vas are easily seen; together these structures comprise the spermatic cord. AA A V I CI O AA FIG. 18.16 Seminal vesicle (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (HP) Each seminal vesicle is a complex glandular diverticulum of the associated ductus deferens. Between them, the seminal vesicles secrete 50–70% of the total volume of seminal fluid, most of the rest being secreted by the prostate gland. The lumen of each seminal vesicle is highly irregular and recessed, giving a honeycomb appearance at low magnification. The epithelial lining is usually of a pseudostratified tall columnar type and consists of secretory cells with lipid droplets in the cytoplasm, giving it a foamy appearance. The seminal vesicles produce a yellowish viscid alkaline fluid containing a wide range of substances, including fructose, fibrinogen, vitamin C and prostaglandins. The epithelial cells often contain brown lipofuscin granules L and characteristically have rather variable nuclear shape and size. Both of these features are seen in micrograph (b). Although not thought to store spermatozoa, seminal vesicles are often seen to contain spermatozoa which have probably entered by reflux from the ampulla. The prominent muscular wall M is arranged into inner circular and outer longitudinal layers and is supplied by the sympathetic nervous system; during ejaculation, muscle contraction forces secretions from the seminal vesicles into the urethra via the ampullae.

The urethra courses through the prostate to become the membranous urethra at the apex of the prostate. In the substance of the gland, the urethra merges with the ejaculatory ducts and at this point angles anteriorly. The prostate consists of branched tubulo-acinar glands, embedded in a fibromuscular stroma. There is a partial capsule enclosing the posterior and lateral aspects of the prostate but the anterior and apical surfaces are bounded by the anterior fibromuscular stroma, a part of the gland consisting, as the name implies, only of collagenous stroma and muscle fibres. In the past, the prostate was described as consisting of a number of ill-defined lobes. However, this terminology has been replaced by the concept of prostate zones and the gland is now described as consisting of four zones of unequal size: • The transition zone surrounds the proximal prostatic urethra and comprises about 5% of the glandular tissue. • The central zone (20%) surrounds the ejaculatory ducts. • The peripheral zone makes up the bulk of the gland (approximately 70%). • The anterior fibromuscular stroma contains no glandular tissue and lies anteriorly. Ejaculatory ducts Central zone Peripheral zone Apex Urethra Anterior fibromuscular stroma Transition zoneBladder Seminal vesicles FIG. 18.18 Prostate gland, dog H&E (LP) This low-power view of the prostate of a dog shows the general architectural features of the gland. The urethra U lies centrally, surrounded by a fibrous stroma St. The ejaculatory ducts ED also lie in this central stroma as they course towards their junction with the prostatic urethra. The zones of the prostate are not clearly demarcated from each other anatomically. Partial fibrous septa Sp separate the gland into lobules. The transition zone TZ surrounds the first part of the prostatic urethra. The central zone CZ lies posterior to the transition zone and encircles the ejaculatory ducts ED. The peripheral zone PZ makes up the main bulk of the gland. The ducts of the peripheral zone glands empty into the posterolateral recesses of the urethra on either side of the verumontanum (urethral crest) C. The different zones of the prostate are important because they tend to be the sites of different disease processes. Most cases of carcinoma of the prostate arise in the peripheral zone, while the transition zone harbours almost all cases of benign nodular hyperplasia (see below). At this power the anterior fibromuscular stroma appears continuous with the capsule Cap and its content of muscle fibres cannot be discerned. St U C TZ CZ PZ PZ ED Sp Cap Sp Common prostatic disease The most common disease of the prostate is called benign prostatic hyperplasia and occurs in men over 50. The prostatic glands around the urethra (transition zone, see Fig. 18.17) become greatly increased in size and number and the gland lumina become distended by secretions and corpora amylacea. At the same time, the stromal smooth muscle fibres become greatly enlarged. This increase in bulk enlarges the prostate gland as a whole, and compresses the urethra, leading to interference with bladder emptying. 348Penis B basal cell CC corpus cavernosum CS corpus spongiosum F fibrocollagenous capsule G gland HA helicine artery P para-urethral gland S skin Si vascular sinus SS supporting stroma U urethra FIG. 18.19 Prostate gland (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (HP) The prostate gland is composed of glands and stroma. The supporting stroma SS is a mixture of collagenous fibrous tissue and smooth muscle fibres, which are best seen at higher magnification in micrograph (b). The glands G show a convoluted pattern with the epithelium thrown up into folds, sometimes into almost a papillary pattern. The secretory product of the prostate, which makes up about 30–50% the seminal fluid volume, is a thin liquid rich in citric acid and proteolytic enzymes, including fibrinolysins, which liquefies the coagulated semen after it has been deposited in the vagina. Inspissated secretions may accumulate in some glands to form spherical concretions (corpora amylacea) which increase in number with age and may become calcified (not seen in this example). Micrograph (b), taken at higher magnification, shows the detail of the epithelium of the prostate glands. The main epithelial cell type is the tall columnar secretory cell with prominent round basal nuclei and pale-staining cytoplasm. There is also a scanty population of small, flat, basal cells at the base of the gland in contact with the basement membrane. The basal cells are easily seen in this micrograph. These cells act as stem cells and may become quite prominent in prostatic hyperplasia. a G G SS SS b G B SS FIG. 18.20 Penis H&E (LP) This transverse section of the human penis shows the arrangement of the erectile tissues, which exist in the form of three columns. The two dorsal columns are called the corpora cavernosa CC and the single ventral column is the corpus spongiosum CS through which runs the penile urethra U. At its distal end, the corpus spongiosum expands to form the glans penis. The erectile corpora are enclosed within and separated by a fibrocollagenous capsule F. The erectile centre of the penis is enclosed in a sheath of skin S to which it is connected by a loose subcutis containing prominent blood vessels. CC CC CS S S F F U 349ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 18: Male reproductive system FIG. 18.21 Corpus spongiosum H&E (LP) The corpus spongiosum is composed of erectile tissue, large irregular interconnected vascular channels with fibrocollagenous stroma between; the stroma contains some smooth muscle fibres. Running through the centre of the corpus spongiosum is the penile urethra U. Small paraurethral mucus glands open into the urethra. U FIG. 18.22 Penile erectile tissue H&E (LP) The vascular sinuses Si of the cavernous bodies of the penis are supplied by numerous anastomosing thick-walled arteries and arterioles called helicine arteries HA, since they follow a spiral course in the flaccid state. Blood drains from the sinuses via veins which lie immediately beneath the dense fibroelastic tissue investing the cavernous bodies. During erection, dilatation of the helicine arteries, mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system, results in engorgement of the vascular sinuses, which enlarge, compressing and restricting venous outflow. The process is enhanced by relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the trabeculae of the cavernous bodies. HA Si Si FIG. 18.23 Penile urethra H&E (HP) Apart from the prostatic urethra, which is lined by transitional epithelium, the male urethra is lined by stratified or pseudostratified columnar epithelium, although small areas of stratified squamous epithelium may also be found in human adult males. The external opening (urethral meatus) is lined by stratified squamous epithelium which becomes continuous with the epithelium of the glans. The urethra is lubricated by mucous secretions from the para-urethral glands P and the bulbo-urethral glands of Cowper (see Fig. 18.1), which have a similar but more discrete organisation. P P P 350ReviewFIG. 18.24 Semen H&E (HP) Semen, the product of ejaculation, consists of spermatozoa and seminal fluid, which is derived principally from the seminal vesicles and prostate gland. The volume of each human ejaculate is about 3.5 mL, containing from 50 to 150 × 106 spermatozoa per mL. In normal fertile human males, up to 25% of the ejaculated spermatozoa are abnormal or degenerate forms. By the time of ejaculation, spermatozoa have matured and acquired the property of motility; nevertheless, they remain incapable of fertilising an ovum until after undergoing a process called capacitation within the female genital tract.

The uterus is a mus- cular organ, the mucosal lining of which undergoes cyclical proliferation under the influence of ovarian hor- mones. This provides a suitable environment for implan- tation of the fertilised ovum and subsequent development of the placenta. This is the means by which the develop- ing fetus is nourished throughout gestation. At birth (parturition), strong contractions of the muscular uterine wall expel the fetus through the lower part of the uterus, the uterine cervix, into the birth canal or vagina. The vagina is an expansile muscular tube specialised for the reception of the penis during coitus and for the passage of the fetus to the external environment. At the external opening of the vagina there are thick folds of skin, the labia which, along with the clitoris, constitute the vulva. • The breasts are highly modified apocrine sweat glands which, in the female, develop at puberty and regress at menopause. During pregnancy, the secretory compo- nents expand greatly in size and number in preparation for milk production (lactation). In the non-pregnant state, the female reproductive system undergoes continuous cyclical changes from puberty to menopause. When ovulation is not followed by the implantation of a fertilised ovum, the thickened mucosal lining, the endometrium, degenerates and a new ovulation cycle commences. In humans, the thickened endometrium is shed in a period of bleeding known as menstruation. The first day of bleeding marks the beginning of a new cycle of endometrial proliferation which is known as the menstrual cycle. In humans, the standard menstrual cycle is of 28 days duration, but there is considerable variation among normal individuals. Ovulation usually occurs at the midpoint of the cycle. In other mammals, the proliferated uterine mucosa is absorbed rather than shed, and the female is receptive to the male only during the period of ovulation, which is known as oestrus (or heat). The remaining part of the cycle is called the dioestrus, and the whole cycle is known as the oestrus cycle. The general anatomy of the female genital tract is illus- trated in Figs 19.1 and 19.2. 19 Female reproductive system The female reproductive system has six major functions: • Production of female gametes, the ova, by the process of oogenesis • Reception of male gametes, the spermatozoa • Provision of a suitable environment for the fertilisation of ova by spermatozoa • Provision of an environment for the development of the fetus • Expulsion of the developed fetus to the external environment • Nutrition of the newborn These functions are all integrated by an elegant system of hormonal and nervous mechanisms. The female repro- ductive system may be divided into three structural units on the basis of function: • The ovaries, which are the site of oogenesis, are paired organs lying on either side of the uterus adjacent to the lateral wall of the pelvis. In sexually mature mammals, ova are released by the process of ovulation in a cyclical manner, either seasonally or at regular intervals through- out the year. This cycle is suspended during pregnancy. The ovaries are also endocrine organs, producing the hormones oestrogen and progesterone. Both ovulation and ovarian hormone production are controlled by the cyclical release from the anterior pituitary of the gonadotrophic hormones luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Oestrogen and pro- gesterone in turn regulate LH and FSH production by feedback mechanisms. Thus, ovulation is coordinated with preparation of the uterus to receive the fertilised ovum. • The genital tract extends from near the ovaries to an opening at the external surface and provides an environ- ment for reception of male gametes, fertilisation of ova, development of the fetus and expulsion of the fetus at birth. The genital tract begins with a pair of Fallopian tubes, also called oviducts or uterine tubes, which conduct ova from the ovaries to the uterus where fetal development occurs. Fertilisation of ova by spermatozoa Embryology of the female genital tract Most of the structures of the female genital tract are derived from the paired Müllerian or paramesonephric ducts. These give rise to the right and left Fallopian tubes and fuse centrally to form the structures of the uterus, cervix and vagina. Occasionally, congenital anomalies can occur because of failure of this process of embryological fusion. This can result in a persistent short septum dividing the fundus of the uterus or, in more extreme cases, reduplication of the uterus, cervix and vagina may occur. The structures of the male genital tract are derived from the Wolffian or mesonephric duct system; in the female, these structures normally regress during fetal life. Small embryological remnants of the Wolffian ducts may persist into adulthood and can be noted in sites such as the paratubal tissue (or mesosalpinx) and in the lateral walls of the cervix. An awareness of these embryological remnants is important for diagnostic pathologists, as the unexpected finding of small epithelial-lined tubules in unusual sites may lead to misdiagnosis. 352Ovary FIG. 19.1 Female reproductive system, sagittal view \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 FIG. 19.2 Female reproductive system, coronal view \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 The ovaries Whilst most of the structures of the female reproductive system arise from the Müllerian duct system as described above (see textbox), the ovaries arise from the genital ridge, a thickening in the mesothelium high on the posterior wall of the peritoneal cavity. The ovaries later descend to their adult position in the pelvis. As a result, the blood supply and lymphatic drainage of the ovaries is derived from the upper abdomen, with the paired ovarian arteries arising from the abdominal aorta, just proximal to the origin of the renal arteries. This rather unexpected fact is important in understanding why ovarian (and, indeed, testicular) tumours typically spread to para-aortic lymph nodes, rather than to local lymph nodes in the pelvic or inguinal area. FIG. 19.3 Ovary (illustrations (a) and (b) opposite) (a) Monkey, Azan (LP) (b) Human, H&E (LP) The ovaries of all mammals have a similar basic structure. There are, however, considerable variations in accordance with species differences in the ovarian cycle and the stage in the cycle at which the ovary is examined. These micrographs compare the ovarian appearance of the monkey with that of the human. The ovaries, which are some 3 to 5 cm long in humans, have a flattened ovoid shape. The body of the ovary consists of spindle-shaped cells, fine collagen fibres and ground substance that together constitute the ovarian stroma. The stromal cells resemble fibroblasts, but some contain lipid droplets. Bundles of smooth muscle cells are also scattered throughout the stroma. In the peripheral zone of the stroma, known as the cortex, there are numerous follicles that contain female gametes in various stages of development. In addition, there may also be post- ovulatory follicles of various kinds, namely corpora lutea (responsible for oestrogen and progesterone production, see Fig. 19.8), degenerate and former corpora lutea (corpora albicantes, see Fig. 19.11) and degenerate (atretic) follicles (see Fig. 19.10). The superficial cortex is more fibrous than the deep cortex and is often called the tunica albuginea. However, unlike the testis, this is not an anatomically distinct capsule. On the surface of the ovary is an epithelial covering, misleadingly called germinal epithelium, which is a continuation of the peritoneum. In the monkey ovary, numerous follicles F are seen in various sizes and states of development. In contrast, developing follicles are difficult to see in the human ovary (b) at this magnification. An active corpus luteum CL and several degenerating corpora lutea D and corpora albicantes A dominate this human ovary. The central zone of the ovarian stroma, the medulla M, is highly vascular and contains hilus cells, which are morphologically very similar to Leydig cells of the testis. The ovarian artery (a branch of the aorta) and ovarian branches of the uterine artery form anastomoses in the mesovarium and the broad ligament L. From this arterial plexus, approximately 10 coiled arteries, the helicine arteries H enter the hilum of the ovary, best seen in micrograph (a). Smaller branches form a plexus at the corticomedullary junction, giving rise to straight cortical arterioles that radiate into the cortex. Here, they branch and anastomose to form vascular arcades, giving rise to a rich network of capillaries around the follicles. Venous drainage follows the course of the arterial system, the medullary veins being large and tortuous. Lymphatics arise in the perifollicular stroma, draining to larger vessels which coil around the medullary veins. Innervation of the ovary is by sympathetic fibres that not only supply blood vessels but also terminate on smooth muscle cells in the stroma around the follicles, possibly playing some part in follicular maturation and ovulation. In micrograph (b), the nearby Fallopian tube FT is included in the plane of section. 353ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 19: Female reproductive system F H H H F L M F CL a A M D D CL A FT b A corpus albicans CL corpus luteum D degenerating corpus luteum F follicle FT Fallopian tube H helicine artery L broad ligament M medulla FIG. 19.3 Ovary (caption opposite) (a) Monkey, Azan (LP) (b) Human, H&E (LP) 354Follicular developmentFOLLICULAR DEVELOPMENT During early fetal development, primordial germ cells called oogonia migrate into the ovarian cortex where they multiply by mitosis. By the fourth and fifth months of human fetal development, some oogonia enlarge and assume the potential for development into mature gametes. At this stage, they are called primary oocytes and com- mence the first stage of meiotic division (see Ch. 2). By the seventh month of fetal development, a single layer of flat- tened follicular cells surrounds the primary oocytes to form primordial follicles, of which there are approximately 500 000 in the human ovary at birth. This encapsulation arrests the first meiotic division and no further development of primordial follicles then occurs until after the female reaches sexual maturity (puberty). The process of meiotic division is only completed during follicular maturation, leading up to ovulation and fertilisation. Thus, all the female germ cells are present at birth, but the process of meiotic division is only completed some 15 to 50 years later! In contrast, in males, meiotic division of germ cells commences only after sexual maturity and formation and maturation of spermatozoa are accomplished within about 70 days (see Ch. 18). Female germ cells may undergo degeneration (atresia) at any stage of follicular maturation. During each ovarian cycle, a cohort of up to 20 primor- dial follicles is activated to begin the maturation process. Usually, only one follicle reaches full maturity and under- goes ovulation while the remainder regress before this point. The reason for this apparent wastage is unclear. During maturation, however, the follicles have an endocrine function which may be far beyond the capacity of a single follicle and so the primary purpose of the other follicles may be to act as an endocrine gland. Follicular maturation involves changes in the oocyte, in the follicular cells and in the surrounding stromal tissue. Follicular maturation is stimulated by FSH (follicle stimu- lating hormone) secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. FIG. 19.4 Ovarian cortex (a) Monkey, Azan (MP) (b) Human, H&E (MP) Micrograph (a), taken from a monkey, shows the typical appearance of follicles in the ovarian cortex and illustrates several stages in early follicular development. In the mature ovary, undeveloped follicles exist as primordial follicles PF which are composed of a primary oocyte surrounded by a single layer of flattened follicular cells. The primary oocyte has a large nucleus with dispersed finely granular chromatin, a prominent nucleolus and little cytoplasm. At the lower right of the field, a primordial follicle has been stimulated, increasing in size to form a primary follicle. Its oocyte O has greatly enlarged and the follicular cells F have multiplied by mitosis and become cuboidal in shape. They are now known as granulosa cells. A thick homogeneous layer of glycoprotein and acid proteoglycans, the zona pellucida ZP, develops between the oocyte and the follicular cells. Both cell types probably contribute to its formation. With further follicular development, as seen in the large follicle at lower left, the surrounding stromal cells begin to form an organised layer around the follicle called the theca folliculi TF, separated from the granulosa cells by a basement membrane. Theca cells are derived from the fibroblast-like cells of the ovarian stroma. The primary follicle continues to enlarge and the granulosa cells continue to proliferate, forming a layer several cells thick called the zona granulosa ZG. Note also in this micrograph the fibrous tunica albuginea TA and the single layer of cuboidal or columnar mesothelial cells M on the surface of the ovary. In humans, this mesothelial layer is low cuboidal rather than columnar. This layer is continuous with the mesothelial lining of the peritoneal cavity and was formerly known as the germinal epithelium, based upon the mistaken belief that these cells were the origin of the female germ cells. Micrograph (b) illustrates a section of human ovary, showing the next stage in follicular maturation. Fluid-filled spaces develop between the granulosa cells G, and these begin to coalesce to form the follicular antrum FA. This is now known as a secondary follicle. The zona pellucida ZP is well seen in this micrograph, but the nucleus of the oocyte O does not lie in this plane of section. Details of the secondary follicle are illustrated at higher magnification in Fig. 19.5.

By now they are usually situated deeper in the ovarian cortex. The zona granulosa ZG continues to proliferate, and small fluid-filled spaces appear within it. These fuse to form the follicular antrum FA, in which follicular fluid accumulates. At this stage, the oocyte O has almost reached its full size and becomes situated eccentrically in a thickened area of the granulosa called the cumulus oophorus CO. At the periphery of the follicle, the theca folliculi has developed two layers, the theca interna TI, comprising several layers of rounded cells, and the less well-defined theca externa TE, consisting of spindle-shaped cells that merge with the surrounding stroma. The cells of the theca interna have the features of typical steroid-secreting cells (see Fig. 17.16) and produce oestrogen precursors (e.g. androstenedione), oestrogen and, in the preovulatory stage, progesterone. In the ovary, these steroid- secreting cells are often described as luteinised. Follicular hormones promote proliferation of the endometrium in readiness for the implantation of a fertilised ovum. The theca externa is composed of flattened stromal cells and has no endocrine function. The granulosa cells also produce hormones from the stage of antral formation onwards. Oestrogen is produced from precursors secreted by the theca interna, as well as small amounts of intrafollicular FSH and, at ovulation, the FSH inhibitor inhibin F. TE TI FA CO ZG O FIG. 19.6 Graafian follicle Azan (LP) Approaching maturity, further growth of the oocyte ceases and the first meiotic division is completed just before ovulation. At this stage, the oocyte becomes known as the secondary oocyte and commences the second meiotic division. The first polar body (see Ch. 2), containing very little cytoplasm, remains inconspicuously within the zona pellucida. The follicular antrum FA enlarges markedly and the zona granulosa ZG now forms a layer of even thickness around the periphery of the follicle. The cumulus oophorus diminishes, leaving the oocyte O surrounded by a layer several cells thick, the corona radiata CR, which remains attached to the zona granulosa by thin bridges of cells. Before ovulation, these bridges break down and the oocyte, surrounded by the corona radiata, floats free inside the follicle. Note the surrounding theca interna TI, consisting of plump luteinised cells. By this stage, the follicle has reached between 1.5 and 2.5 cm in diameter and bulges under the ovarian surface. The overlying surface epithelial cells are flattened and atrophic and the thin intervening stroma becomes degenerate and avascular. At ovulation, the mature follicle ruptures and the ovum, made up of the secondary oocyte, zona pellucida and corona radiata, is expelled into the peritoneal cavity near the entrance to the Fallopian tube. The second meiotic division of the oocyte is not completed until after penetration of the ovum by a spermatozoon.

Corpus luteum of menstruation (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (MP) (c) H&E (HP) Following ovulation, the ruptured follicle collapses and fills with a blood clot to form the corpus luteum of menstruation, which has a brief career as an endocrine organ. The corpus luteum of menstruation is about the same size as the antecedent ovulatory follicle (i.e. 1.5 to 2.5 cm). Under the influence of luteinising hormone (LH) secreted by the anterior pituitary, granulosa cells increase greatly in size and begin secretion of progesterone. The granulosa cells acquire the characteristics of steroid-secreting cells and are now called granulosa lutein cells. Progesterone promotes the changes in the endometrium that make it ready for implantation of the embryo should fertilisation occur (see Figs 19.15 to 19.19). Thus the cycles of production of oocytes and the preparation of the endometrium (the menstrual cycle) are coordinated by the same set of hormones. The cells of the theca interna also increase somewhat in size and acquire similar cytoplasmic features to the luteinised granulosa cells. Although interrupted by ovulation, these cells (as well as the granulosa cells) continue to secrete oestrogens which are necessary to maintain the thickened uterine mucosa. These cells become known as theca lutein cells. The basement membrane between the zona granulosa and the theca interna breaks down and these layers are invaded by capillaries and larger vessels from the theca externa to form a rich vascular network, characteristic of endocrine glands. Progesterone production by the corpus luteum is dependent on LH from the anterior pituitary, but rising progesterone levels inhibit LH production. Without the continuing stimulus of LH, the corpus luteum cannot be maintained and, 12 to 14 days after ovulation, it regresses, ultimately forming a functionless corpus albicans (see Fig. 19.11). Once the corpus luteum regresses, secretion of both oestrogen and progesterone ceases. Without these hormones, the endometrial lining of the uterus collapses, resulting in the onset of menstruation. Micrograph (a) shows a corpus luteum of menstruation. In the centre, the remnant of the post-ovulatory blood clot B is seen, surrounded by a broad zone of granulosa lutein cells G, penetrated by septa S containing the larger blood vessels. Peripherally, a thin zone of theca lutein cells T can be seen. Externally, the corpus luteum is bounded by a zone of condensed stromal tissue, representing the theca externa of the antecedent Graafian follicle. Micrograph (b) shows the margin of a corpus luteum at intermediate magnification. Most of the field is occupied by granulosa lutein cells G, large polygonal cells with abundant pale eosinophilic (pink-stained) cytoplasm and round nuclei. The cytoplasm contains plentiful smooth endoplasmic reticulum, abundant mitochondria, lipid droplets and some lipofuscin, giving the corpus luteum a yellow colour macroscopically. At the periphery, there are theca cells which also extend in a finger-like extension, forming a sheath Sh around blood vessels V. The theca externa cells TE have darker-stained cytoplasm while the luteinised theca interna cells TI have pale cytoplasm due to their content of lipid droplets. At high magnification in micrograph (c), granulosa lutein cells G may be compared with theca lutein cells T. The eosinophilic cytoplasm of the granulosa lutein cells contains numerous small lipid droplets which give rise to the vacuolated appearance seen in this preparation. Their larger spherical nuclei contain one or two prominent nucleoli. Theca lutein cells are smaller, with a more densely staining cytoplasm but with larger lipid vacuoles. Their ovoid nucleus has a single large nucleolus. The ultrastructure of the endocrine cells of the corpus luteum is characteristic of all steroid secretory cells (see Fig. 17.16). As previously described, the granulosa lutein cells secrete progesterone (and a small amount of oestrogen) and the theca lutein cells secrete oestrogen precursors which are converted to oestrogen by the granulosa cells.

After implantation, a hormone called human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is secreted into the maternal circulation by the developing placenta; hCG has an analogous function to LH and maintains the function of the corpus luteum in secreting oestrogen and progesterone until about the 9th week of pregnancy. After this time, the corpus luteum of pregnancy slowly regresses to form a functionless corpus albicans and the placenta takes over the major role of oestrogen and progesterone secretion until parturition. This micrograph shows a human ovary during the first trimester of pregnancy. The corpus luteum CL is greatly enlarged and by now occupies most of the ovary. The organisation of the corpus luteum of pregnancy is similar to that of menstruation, but there are some histological changes that are almost specific for the corpus luteum of pregnancy. In particular, the granulosa lutein cells contain hyaline, eosinophilic inclusion bodies that tend to enlarge and then calcify as the pregnancy progresses. CL FIG. 19.10 Atretic follicles (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (MP) The process of follicular atresia (degeneration) may occur at any stage in the development of the ovum. By the sixth month of development, the fetal ovary contains several million primordial follicles yet, by the time of birth, only about half a million remain. Atresia continues until puberty and thereafter through the reproductive years. In addition, with each ovarian cycle approximately 20 follicles begin to mature, usually all but one becoming atretic at some stage before complete maturity. The histological appearance of atretic follicles varies enormously, depending on the stage of development reached and the progress of atresia. The atretic follicle seen in micrograph (a) is a secondary follicle in early atresia. The oocyte O has degenerated and the granulosa cells G have begun to disaggregate. Advanced atresia, as seen in micrograph (b), is characterised by gross thickening of the basement membrane between the granulosa cells and the theca interna, forming the so-called glassy membrane GM. Atretic follicles are ultimately replaced completely by collagenous tissue known as the corpus fibrosum. Most corpora fibrosa eventually disappear completely. In the postmenopausal woman, primordial follicles are absent, and the cortex consists of stroma and corpora albicantes only, with no developing follicles. The postmenopausal ovary is smaller than that in premenopausal women. Ovarian cysts Ovarian cysts are common and arise from a wide variety of causes. Most common of all are follicular cysts, due to enlargement of normal follicles, and corpus luteum cysts, which result from a similar expansion of a normal corpus luteum. Other cysts in the ovary arise from more sinister causes, including neoplasms. These include epithelial cysts such as the serous cystadenoma at the benign end of the spectrum, the serous cystadenocarcinoma at the malignant end and the in-between borderline serous tumour. There is a similar range of mucinous tumours. A fairly common type of ovarian cyst in young women is the dermoid cyst or mature cystic teratoma, a lesion that is virtually always benign. Another common type of cyst is the endometriotic cyst or endometrioma, where abnormal deposits of endometrial glands and stroma are found in the ovary and, indeed, in many other sites in the body. Endometriosis is often associated with infertility, as is polycystic ovarian syndrome, a condition where multiple follicular cysts are associated with obesity, hirsuitism and other metabolic abnormalities such as impaired glucose tolerance. From this brief and incomplete summary of ovarian cysts, the variety of pathologies and therefore of treatments is clear. Diagnosis often requires biopsy or oophorectomy (removal of the ovary).

The secretory cells of the degenerate corpus luteum undergo autolysis and are phagocytosed by macrophages M, a few of which, containing cytoplasmic haemosiderin pigment, can be seen here. The vascular supporting tissue regresses to form a relatively acellular collagenous scar containing a few fibroblasts. In the human ovary, corpora albicantes are a dominant feature, increasing in number with age and often appearing to occupy almost the whole ovarian stroma. Most regress completely leaving no trace, otherwise the postmenopausal ovary would contain approximately 500 corpora albicantes. M C FIG. 19.12 Fetal ovary H&E (HP) In this micrograph of ovary from a term fetus, the ovarian cortex is seen to be packed with primordial follicles P. The surrounding stroma S is much more delicate than in an adult woman. These ova are arrested in the first meiotic division and remain so until the onset of puberty signals the waves of maturation of follicles that occur with each cycle in the reproductive years. P S S THE GENITAL TRACT The genital tract consists of the Fallopian tubes, the uterus and the vagina, all of which have the same basic structure, consisting of a wall of smooth muscle with an inner mucosal lining and an outer layer of loose supporting tissue. The mucosal and muscular components vary greatly according to their location and functional requirements. The whole tract undergoes cyclical changes under the influence of ovarian hormones which are released during the ovarian cycle. The cyclical changes which occur in the genital tract facilitate the entry of ova into the Fallopian tube, the passage of spermatozoa through the uterine cervix and into the Fal- lopian tube, the passage of the fertilised ovum into the uterus and the implantation and development of the ferti- lised ovum in the mucosal lining (endometrium) of the uterus. Implantation of a fertilised ovum results in secretion of hormones that inhibit the ovarian cycle and produce changes in the genital tract necessary for fetal development and parturition. FIG. 19.13 Fallopian tubes The Fallopian tubes (also called uterine tubes or oviducts) carry ova from the surface of the ovaries to the uterine cavity and are also the site of fertilisation by spermatozoa. The Fallopian tube is shaped like an elongated funnel and is divided anatomically into four parts as shown in the diagram. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 360Fallopian tube FIG. 19.14 Fallopian tube (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (MP) (c) H&E (HP) (d) Azan (HP) At the time of ovulation, the infundibulum moves so as to overlie the site of rupture of the Graafian follicle. Finger-like projections called fimbriae extending from the end of the tube envelop the ovulation site and direct the ovum into the tube. Movement of the ovum along the tube is mediated by gentle peristaltic action of the longitudinal and circular smooth muscle layers of the oviduct wall. This is aided by a current of fluid, propelled by the action of the ciliated epithelium lining the tube. The mucosal lining of the Fallopian tube is thrown into a labyrinth of branching longitudinal folds, a feature that is most prominent in the ampulla (a), which is the usual site of fertilisation. Note also in this micrograph, the muscular wall M and the vascular supporting tissue of the serosa S, which is continuous with the broad ligament BL. The serosal layer and broad ligament have a surface lining of mesothelium. The muscular wall has two layers, an inner circular and an outer longitudinal, not discernible at this magnification. Micrograph (b) focuses on one of the mucosal folds of the ampulla. These have a branching core of vascular supporting tissue ST and are invested by a single layer of tall columnar epithelial cells E. Micrograph (c) shows the tip of a mucosal fold at high magnification. The columnar cells of the epithelium are of three types: ciliated, non-ciliated secretory and intercalated cells. The non-ciliated cells produce a secretion that is propelled towards the uterus by the wave-like beating of the cilia of the ciliated cells, carrying with it the ovum. This secretion probably also has a role in the nutrition and protection of the ovum. The intercalated cells may be a morphological variant of the secretory cells. The ratio of ciliated to non-ciliated cells and the height of the cells undergo cyclical variations under the influence of ovarian hormones. The ciliated cells are generally shorter than the secretory cells, making the epithelial surface somewhat irregular in outline. Scattered intraepithelial lymphocytes are also present. Micrograph (d) employs a method that stains the secretory cells blue. Note that the collagen of the supporting tissue core of the mucosal fold is also stained blue. S M BL a ST E ST Eb c d 361ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 19: Female reproductive system Pathology of the Fallopian tube The Fallopian tube can be damaged by a variety of pathological processes and such tubal injury may then lead to a range of other problems including subfertility and even tubal ectopic pregnancy, where the fertilised ovum implants in the wall of the Fallopian tube, rather than passing along to enter the uterine cavity. Common causes of tubal injury include pelvic inflammatory disease (where tubal inflammation and scarring occurs due to infection with organisms such as Chlamydia or Gonococcus) and endometriosis, a disorder in which small deposits of endometrium are found outside the uterine cavity. Endometriosis often affects the Fallopian tubes and, again, this results in scarring and peritoneal adhesions which can block the Fallopian tubes, leading to reduced fertility. As well as preventing the normal passage of the ovum to the uterus, such tubal blockage can result in cystic dilatation of the tube, forming a hydrosalpinx. If such a fluid collection becomes infected and consists of pus, it is called a pyosalpinx. BL broad ligament E epithelial cells M muscular wall S serosa ST supporting tissue THE HUMAN MENSTRUAL CYCLE The uterus is a flattened pear-shaped organ approximately 7 cm long in the non-pregnant state. Its mucosal lining, the endometrium, provides the environment for fetal develop- ment. The thick smooth muscle wall, the myometrium, expands greatly during pregnancy and provides protection for the fetus and a mechanism for the expulsion of the fetus at parturition. The endometrium is variable in thickness, measuring between 1 and 5 mm at different stages of the menstrual cycle. The myometrium makes up the bulk of the uterus, measuring up to about 20 mm in a woman of reproductive age (see Fig. 19.2). In women of child-bearing age, the endometrial lining of the uterine cavity consists of a pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium forming numerous simple tubular glands, supported by the cellular endometrial stroma. Under the influence of oestrogen and progesterone secreted during the ovarian cycle, the endometrium undergoes regular cyclical changes so as to offer a suitable environment for implantation of a fertilised ovum. These changes are summarised in Fig. 19.15 (overleaf). For successful implan- tation, the fertilised ovum requires an easily penetrable, highly vascular tissue and an abundant supply of glycogen for nutrition until vascular connections are established with the maternal circulation. The cycle of changes in the endometrium proceeds through three distinct phases: menstruation, proliferation and secretion. These changes involve both the epithelium and supporting stroma. • The menstrual phase. The first day of menstruation is, by convention, taken as the first day of the cycle, simply because it is easily identified. This is the phase of endometrial shedding that only occurs if there is failure of fertilisation and/or implantation of the ovum. Proges- terone production by the corpus luteum is inhibited by negative feedback on the anterior pituitary, thus sup- pressing LH release and leading to involution of the corpus luteum. In the absence of progesterone, the endometrium cannot be maintained. Reactivation of FSH secretion initiates a new cycle of follicular develop- ment and oestrogen secretion. This, in turn, initiates a new cycle of proliferation of the endometrium from the endometrial remnants of the previous cycle. • The proliferative phase. The endometrial stroma prolif- erates, becoming thicker and richly vascularised. The simple tubular glands elongate to form numerous long, coiled glands that begin secretion coincident with ovula- tion. The proliferative phase is initiated and sustained until ovulation by the increasing production of oestro- gens from developing ovarian follicles. • The secretory phase. Release of progesterone from the corpus luteum after ovulation promotes production of a copious, thick, glycogen-rich secretion by the endome- trial glands. A typical menstrual cycle is 28 days in length, although there is wide variation among normal women. Menstrua- tion lasts on average 5 days. The proliferative phase contin- ues until about the 14th day when ovulation occurs and the secretory phase begins. The secretory phase culminates at the onset of menstruation on about the 28th day. The endometrium is divided into three histologically and functionally distinct layers. The deepest or basal layer, the stratum basalis, adjacent to the myometrium, under- goes little change during the menstrual cycle and is not shed during menstruation. The broad intermediate layer is char- acterised by a stroma with a spongy appearance and is called the stratum spongiosum. The thinner superficial layer, which has a compact stromal appearance, is known as the stratum compactum. The compact and spongy layers exhibit dramatic changes throughout the cycle and both are shed during menstruation. These layers are jointly referred to as the stratum functionalis. The arrangement of the arterial supply of the endometrium has important influences on the menstrual cycle. Branches of the uterine arteries pass through the myo- metrium and immediately divide into two different types of arteries, straight arteries and spiral arteries. Straight arter- ies are short and pass a small distance into the endometrium, then bifurcate to form a plexus supplying the stratum basalis. Spiral arteries are long coiled and thick-walled and pass to the surface of the endometrium, giving off numerous branches which give rise to a capillary plexus around the glands and in the stratum compactum. Unlike the straight arteries, the spiral arteries are responsive to the hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle. The withdrawal of proges- terone secretion at the end of the cycle causes the spiral arteries to constrict and this precipitates an ischaemic phase that immediately precedes menstruation. 362The human menstrual cycle FIG. 19.15 The hormonal integration of the ovarian and menstrual cycles \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 •\u0000•\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 ••\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 ••\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 •\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 •\u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000 \u0000•\u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 -\u0000\u0000•\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000•\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000•\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000••\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000••\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000••\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 The menstrual cycle The illustration above shows the changes which occur during a typical 28-day-long menstrual cycle, but there is significant variation in the length of the menstrual cycle in normal women, often ranging from 21 days up to 40 days or sometimes more. In such cases, there is variation in the duration of both the follicular and the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, but the luteal phase seems to be of more fixed duration and typically lasts around 14 days, with more of the difference in cycle length being attributable to variation in the duration of the follicular part of the cycle. 363ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 19: Female reproductive system FIG. 19.16 Endometrium, the onset of menstruation (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (MP) (c) H&E (HP) In the absence of implantation of a fertilised ovum, degeneration of the corpus luteum results in cessation of oestrogen and progesterone secretion. In turn, this initiates spasmodic constriction in the spiral arterioles of the endometrial stratum functionalis F. The resulting ischaemia is initially manifest by degeneration of the superficial layers of the endometrium and leakage of blood L into the stroma. This is illustrated in micrographs (a) and (b). Stromal cells disaggregate and the endometrial glands collapse. These features are indicative of early necrosis of glands and stroma. At high magnification in micrograph (c), nuclear debris of endometrial cells (apoptotic bodies) B can be seen at the onset of menstruation. These cells have died by apoptosis (see Ch. 2). Further ischaemia leads to degeneration of the whole stratum functionalis, which is progressively shed as menses. Menses is thus composed of blood, necrotic epithelium and stroma. Normally, menstrual blood does not clot due to the local release of inhibitory (anticoagulant) factors and its expulsion is enhanced by uterine contractions. By day 3 to 4 of menstruation, most of the stratum functionalis has been shed and proliferation of the basal layer of the endometrium has begun again. a F L b B B c FIG. 19.17 Endometrial surface H&E (HP) This micrograph illustrates the surface epithelium of the endometrium, which is tall and columnar in form. Some of the cells bear cilia, the remainder having surface microvilli. Stromal cells have plump, spindle-shaped nuclei and scanty cytoplasm.

The bottom of the field includes part of the muscular wall, the myometrium My. The relatively thin endometrium consists of the stratum basalis B, stratum spongiosum S and stratum compactum C. The glands at this stage are fairly sparse and straight. As the glands, stroma and vessels proliferate, the endometrium gradually becomes thicker. By day 5 to 6 of the cycle, the surface epithelium has regenerated. During the proliferative phase, the epithelial cells acquire microvilli and cilia as well as the cytoplasmic organelles required for the secretory phase. At higher magnification in micrograph (b), the straight tubular form of the endometrial glands G can be seen. At very high magnification in micrograph (c), the proliferating glandular epithelium is seen to consist of columnar cells with basally located nuclei exhibiting prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures M can be seen, both in the epithelium and in the stroma. Note the highly cellular stroma which is almost devoid of collagen fibres. By the late proliferative stage, shown at low magnification in micrograph (d), the endometrium has doubled in thickness. Note that in contrast to the stratum functionalis F, the appearance of the stratum basalis B is little changed when compared with the early proliferative phase. With further magnification, micrograph (e) shows that the tubular glands are now becoming coiled and more closely packed. At very high magnification in micrograph (f), mitotic figures M are more prevalent in both the glandular epithelium and the supporting stroma. The stroma is also somewhat oedematous at this stage. During the proliferative phase, there is a continuum of change that makes the precise dating of the cycle inaccurate in histological specimens. Lymphocytes and occasional lymphoid aggregates are a normal feature of late proliferative phase endometrium, but plasma cells are abnormal, indicating chronic infection (endometritis).

At low magnification in micrograph (a), the coiled appearance of the glands is now more pronounced and the endometrium approaches its maximum thickness. Under the influence of progesterone, the glandular epithelium is stimulated to synthesise glycogen. Initially, the glycogen accumulates to form vacuoles V in the basal aspect of the cells, thus displacing the nuclei towards the centre of the now tall columnar cells. This basal vacuolation of the cells appears on day 16 and is the characteristic feature of early secretory endometrium as seen at intermediate and high magnification in micrographs (b) and (c), respectively. Glycogen is an important source of nutrition for the fertilised ovum. The late secretory phase is characterised by a saw-tooth appearance of the glands, containing copious thick glycogen- and glycoprotein-rich secretions Se. This is illustrated at low and intermediate magnification in micrographs (d) and (e), respectively, At very high magnification in micrograph (f), the cytoplasmic vacuoles V can now be seen on the luminal aspect of the cell, and the nucleus has returned to its basal position. These vacuoles contain glycogen and glycoproteins that are secreted Se into the glandular lumen by apocrine-type secretion. Mitotic figures are absent. The stroma is by now at its most vascular and interstitial fluid begins to accumulate between the stromal cells. Endometrial stromal granulocytes, which are probably large granular lymphocytes, are found in the stroma at this stage. These changes in secretory phase endometrium make more precise dating possible on histological specimens than in the proliferative phase. Such examinations may be helpful in the investigation of infertility. a V b V c d Se Se e Se V V f B stratum basalis C stratum compactum F stratum functionalis G endometrial gland M mitotic figure My myometrium S stratum spongiosum Se secretions V vacuoles 366Myometrium FIG. 19.20 Post-menopausal endometrium (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (LP) (c) H&E (MP) (d) H&E (HP) After the menopause, the cyclical production of oestrogen and progesterone from the ovaries ceases and the whole genital tract undergoes atrophy. As seen in micrograph (a), the endometrium E is thin, consisting only of the stratum basalis, and the glands G are sparse and inactive. In some women, the glands become dilated to form cystic spaces C as shown in micrograph (b). The reason for this is unknown, but this appearance is so common as to be considered a normal variant. At higher magnifications in micrographs (c) and (d), the glandular epithelial cells are cuboidal or low columnar with no mitotic figures or secretory activity. The epithelium which lines cystically dilated glands C, as shown in micrograph (c), is often flattened. The stroma S is much less cellular and contains more collagen fibres than during the reproductive years and no mitotic activity is seen. The myometrium also becomes atrophic after the menopause and the uterus shrinks to about half its former size. G E a C C C b C C S c d Hormonal effects on the endometrium A variety of drug treatments have effects on the endometrium. Commonly used agents include the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) and post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). These treatments may use a combination of oestrogenic and progestagenic agents to mimic the changes of a normal menstrual cycle or sometimes use progestagenic agents alone. Other drugs used in treatment of malignant disease have hormonal effects, including the anti-oestrogenic drugs which are used in patients with hormone sensitive breast cancer. These agents may have unpredictable effects on the endometrium. 367ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 19: Female reproductive systemFIG. 19.21 Myometrium (a) H&E (MP) (b) H&E (HP) The main bulk of the uterus consists of smooth muscle, the myometrium, which is composed of interlacing bundles of long slender fibres arranged in ill-defined layers. This is readily seen in micrograph (a), which contains bundles of fibres in transverse T, longitudinal L and oblique sections O. Within the muscle, there is a rich network of arteries and veins which are supported by collagenous supporting tissue. Micrograph (b) shows detail of the smooth muscle cells at high magnification, highlighting the closeness with which the muscle fibres are packed. During pregnancy, in response to increased levels of oestrogens, the myometrium increases greatly in size, mainly by increasing cell size (hypertrophy), although some increase in cell numbers (hyperplasia) due to cell division may also occur. At parturition, strong contractions of the myometrium are reinforced by the action of the hormone oxytocin, secreted by the posterior pituitary. These contractions expel the fetus from the uterus and also constrict the blood supply to the placenta, thus precipitating its detachment from the uterine wall. T O L a b Smooth muscle tumours The uterine leiomyoma, colloquially known as a fibroid, is a very common benign tumour of women of reproductive age. They tend to increase in size and number with age and cause a range of symptoms, including abnormal bleeding, a feeling of pain or dragging in the lower abdomen, urinary frequency if they compress the bladder, and infertility. A typical leiomyoma is illustrated in Fig. 19.22. Uterine fibroids are usually multiple. In contrast, leiomyosarcomas, the malignant counterpart of the benign fibroid, are much rarer, are typically solitary and occur in older women. These tumours are characterised by an infiltrative margin, marked cytological atypia, necrosis and mitotic figures. FIG. 19.22 Uterine ‘fibroid’ H&E (LP) The leiomyoma Le consists of bland smooth muscle fibres which are very like their normal counterparts in appearance. The smooth muscle fibres form whorls and are embedded in a fibrous stroma. The resulting nodule has a very well-circumscribed margin and there is a pseudocapsule of compressed smooth muscle separating it from the normal myometrium M. The endometrium E is seen at the top of this micrograph. Although this example is a small leiomyoma, they may reach considerable size, and examples 15 cm in diameter or larger are not uncommon. Leiomyomas may be described as submucosal, intramural or subserosal, based upon their position within the myometrium. Submucosal leiomyomas occur just beneath the endometrium and may greatly enlarge and distort the endometrial cavity, resulting in very heavy menses (menorrhagia).

The function of the cervix is to admit spermatozoa to the genital tract at the time when fertilisation is possible, i.e. around the time of ovulation. At other times, including pregnancy, its function is to protect the uterus and upper tract from bacterial invasion. In addition, the cervix must be capable of great dilatation to permit the passage of the fetus during parturition. As seen in this micrograph, the endocervical canal EC is lined by a single layer of tall columnar mucus-secreting epithelial cells. Where the cervix is exposed to the more hostile environment of the vagina V, the ectocervix, it is lined by thick stratified squamous epithelium as in the vagina and the vulva. The cells of the ectocervix often have clear cytoplasm due to their high glycogen content (not apparent in this specimen). The junction J between the ecto- and endocervical epithelium is quite abrupt and is normally located at the external os, the point at which the endocervical canal opens into the vagina. The main bulk of the cervix is composed of tough collagenous tissue containing a little smooth muscle. At the squamocolumnar junction, the cervical stroma is often infiltrated with leucocytes, forming part of the defence against ingress of microorganisms. EC V J FIG. 19.24 Endocervix (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (MP) As seen in micrograph (a), the mucus-secreting epithelial lining of the endocervical canal is thrown into deep furrows and tunnels, giving the appearance in two dimensions of branched tubular glands, hence the rather inaccurate term endocervical glands. The columnar mucus-secreting cells lining the ‘glands’ are shown at higher magnification in micrograph (b). Note the leucocytic infiltrate in the superficial stroma and the presence of leucocytes in the endocervical mucus on the surface. Some inflammation is considered to be normal at this site. During the menstrual cycle, the endocervical epithelium undergoes cyclical changes in secretory activity. In the proliferative phase, rising levels of oestrogen promote secretion of thin, watery mucus which permits the passage of spermatozoa into the uterus around the time of ovulation. Following ovulation, the cervical mucus becomes highly viscid, forming a plug that inhibits the entry of microorganisms (and spermatozoa) from the vagina. This is particularly important should pregnancy occur. a b 369ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 19: Female reproductive system FIG. 19.25 Cervical cytology Papanicolou (HP) The cervical stroma is influenced by ovarian hormones, particularly oestrogens, which soften the tissues by reducing collagenous cross-linkages and increasing uptake of water by the ground substance. At its most extreme, this provides the means by which the cervix stretches, thins and dilates in late pregnancy and during parturition. To a much lesser extent, similar changes occur during the normal menstrual cycle. One effect of this is that the volume of the cervical stroma varies during each cycle, causing eversion of the columnar epithelium near the squamocolumnar junction and exposing it to the vaginal environment. This ectropion is known colloquially as ‘cervical erosion’. This induces the growth of stratified squamous epithelium (squamous metaplasia) over the exposed area, considered a normal variant in women of reproductive age. The importance of this transformation zone is that it may undergo malignant change, causing cancer of the cervix. This area can be studied by scraping cells from the surface using various types of spatula or brush, smearing them on a glass slide and staining them by the Papanicolaou method (the cervical smear or ‘Pap test’). This technique is known as exfoliative cytology and is demonstrated here from a normal healthy cervix. The surface cells of the stratified squamous epithelium have small, contracted nuclei and are stained pink due to the cytoplasmic keratin. Deeper cells have plump nuclei of normal appearance, and the cytoplasm is stained blue/green. An adequate Pap smear should also contain some endocervical cells (demonstrating that the transformation zone has been sampled), as well as cervical mucin and inflammatory cells. A more recent development of the cervical smear suspends the exfoliated cells in a special alcohol-based fixative medium and then layers them evenly onto a glass slide, a technique known as liquid-based cytology. This gives superior visibility of the cells and improves the ability of the cytologist to see abnormal cells. Various computerised technologies are also becoming available to screen the slides and detect abnormal cells. FIG. 19.26 Vagina (a) Masson trichrome (LP) (b) Masson trichrome (MP) The wall of the vagina, micrograph (a), consists of a mucosal layer lined by stratified squamous epithelium E, a layer of smooth muscle SM and an outer adventitial layer A. In the relaxed state, the vaginal wall collapses to obliterate the lumen, and the vaginal epithelium is thrown up into folds. The fibrous lamina propria LP contains many elastin fibres, has a rich plexus of small veins and is devoid of glands. The vagina is lubricated by cervical mucus, a fluid transudate from the rich vascular network of the lamina propria, and mucus secreted by glands of the labia minora. The smooth muscle bundles of the muscular layer are arranged in ill-defined inner circular and outer longitudinal layers. The adventitial layer of the vagina merges with the adventitial layers of the bladder anteriorly and rectum posteriorly. The combination of a muscular layer and a highly elastic lamina propria and outer adventitia permits the gross distension that occurs during parturition. Conversely, after coitus, involuntary contraction of the smooth muscle layer ensures that a pool of semen remains in the cervical region. Micrograph (b) illustrates the stratified squamous epithelium that lines the vagina. During the menstrual cycle, this epithelium undergoes cyclical changes in glycogen levels. Throughout the cycle, the superficial cells produce glycogen that is anaerobically metabolised by vaginal commensal bacteria to form lactic acid which inhibits the growth of pathogenic microorganisms.

The structure of the placenta varies greatly from one species to another and the following discussion is thus necessarily confined to the human placenta. At various stages during fetal development, the placenta performs a remarkable range of functions until the fetal organs become functional. These include gaseous exchange, excretion, maintenance of homeostasis, hormone secretion, haematopoiesis and hepatic metabolic functions. FIG. 19.27 Fertilisation and implantation (illustrations below and opposite) Within about 24 to 48 hours after ovulation, fertilisation of an ovum by a spermatozoon occurs in the ampulla of the Fallopian tube, with the formation of a zygote. The zona pellucida remains intact (see Fig. 19.4). Within 24 hours, the zygote undergoes its first mitotic cell division, the process continuing until there are some 12 to 16 cells called blastomeres, each with a small portion of the original cytoplasm. The mass, now called a morula (for its resemblance to a mulberry), remains enclosed by the zona pellucida, through which it is nourished by diffusion of oxygen and low molecular weight metabolites from Fallopian tube secretions. The morula reaches the uterus 2 to 3 days after fertilisation and begins to absorb uterine fluid, forming a central cavity. The blastocyst, as it is now known, consists of a peripheral layer of blastomeres forming the trophoblast, with a mass of cells at one aspect, the polar trophoblast, bulging into the central lumen and known as the inner cell mass. The trophoblast (along with a maternal contribution) eventually gives rise to the placenta while the inner cell mass develops into the embryo. By this time, the blastocyst has grown to about twice the size of the original ovum and the zona pellucida has become quite thin. When the blastocyst has been within the uterine cavity for 2 to 3 days, the zona pellucida disappears and implantation occurs. The polar trophoblast invades the endometrium so that, by the 10th day after conception, the blastocyst is completely buried. The trophoblast gives rise to two layers, an inner cytotrophoblast layer of mononuclear cells and an outer syncytiotrophoblast layer, formed by fusion of cytotrophoblast cells to form a continuous multinucleate syncytium in which there is no internal cytoplasmic demarcation by plasma membranes. The cytotrophoblast remains as a single layer of cells, whereas the syncytiotrophoblast becomes increasingly broad and develops finger-like projections into the endometrium. A third type of trophoblast known as intermediate trophoblast has histological features intermediate between cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast and has a major role in invading the endometrium. Within a short time, a sponge-like network of spaces called lacunae develops within the syncytiotrophoblast, initially filled with tissue fluid and uterine secretions. Soon afterwards, invasion by the intermediate trophoblast causes disintegration of endometrial capillaries with leakage of maternal blood into the lacunae. Progressively, the trophoblast envelops maternal capillaries, expanding the lacunar network and establishing an arterial supply and venous drainage system. By now, the syncytiotrophoblast also secretes a variety of hormones including human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), human chorionic somatotrophin (previously human placental lactogen, hPL), oestrogen and progesterone, which are necessary to sustain the endometrial tissues. In the meantime, the blastocyst cavity becomes filled with extraembryonic mesoderm (mesenchyme), which completely surrounds the early embryo, developing from the inner cell mass. The embryo by now comprises plates of embryonic endoderm and ectoderm on either side of which lie the yolk sac and amniotic cavities, enclosed by extraembryonic endoderm and extraembryonic ectoderm, respectively. Subsequently, a cavity forms within the extraembryonic mesoderm; this extraembryonic coelom eventually surrounds the developing embryo, which remains attached to the trophoblast by a connecting stalk of extraembryonic mesoderm. The trophoblast, along with the mesodermal layer remaining beneath it, now constitutes the chorion. Meanwhile the trabeculae of syncytiotrophoblast and intermediate trophoblast between the lacunae are invaded by columns of cytotrophoblastic cells called primary chorionic villi. These grow out to the periphery and spread out over the interface between the trophoblast and endometrium, forming the cytotrophoblast shell. Extraembryonic mesoderm now invades the primary villi, which thus develop a mesenchymal core, becoming known as secondary chorionic villi. By about 2 weeks after implantation (i.e. about 24 days after fertilisation), primitive blood vessels begin to develop in the chorionic mesoderm simultaneously with development of the primitive embryonic circulatory system, the embryo now being too large to rely on mere diffusion for its growth and metabolic requirements. When the mesenchymal cores of the villi become vascularised, they become known as tertiary villi (not illustrated). The form of the placenta is essentially established by the end of the fourth month, after which the placenta grows in diameter, complementing growth in the size of the uterus.

373ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 19: Female reproductive system FIG. 19.28 Decidua formation and early placental development (illustration opposite, upper) During the process of implantation, secretion by the syncytiotrophoblast of hCG (which is functionally analogous to luteinising hormone) interrupts the ovarian cycle. This results in growth and proliferation of stromal cells of the endometrial stratum functionalis at the implantation site into large polyhedral decidual cells, a change that has already begun in the late secretory phase. The decidua beneath the developing embryo is known as the decidua basalis and, with the trophoblast, will form the future placenta. The decidua overlying the embryo is known as the decidua capsularis, and the decidual lining of the rest of the uterus is called the decidua parietalis. Ultimately, expansion of the embryo and its enveloping fluid-filled membrane system results in fusion of the capsular and parietal layers of the decidua, with complete obliteration of the uterine cavity. During the first 2 months of embryological development, the chorion grows fairly uniformly around the whole periphery of the vesicle. From the third month, the chorion in contact with the decidua basalis develops extensive frond-like villous outgrowths into the decidua, becoming known as the chorion frondosum, while the superficial chorion in contact with the decidua capsularis atrophies to become the smooth chorion laeve. Progressively, the chorion frondosum and decidua basalis develop into the flattened placenta and the vessels connecting the chorion to the embryonic circulation become the umbilical cord. FIG. 19.29 Structure of placental villi (illustration opposite, lower) From the time maternal blood appears within the trophoblastic lacunae, the trabeculae between the lacunae become increasingly robust, with stem villi forming anchorage points with the cytotrophoblastic shell. Side branches grow out into the lacunae, progressively forming a complex villous structure. Each villus has a mesenchymal core containing capillaries served by afferent and efferent fetal blood vessels. Between the villous capillaries and the maternal blood, there is a continuous layer of syncytiotrophoblast supported by a layer of proliferating cytotrophoblast cells. From the fourth month onwards, the cytotrophoblast layer becomes atrophic. As more and more branches are added to the villous tree, the villi become smaller and smaller, and the tissue barrier between fetal capillaries and maternal blood is greatly diminished. As the placenta develops, the decidua basalis regresses so that all that remains are a number of anastomosing septa of maternal supporting tissue projecting into the cytotrophoblastic shell. When the placenta is shed immediately after childbirth, its maternal surface is seen to be divided into about 20 irregular segments called cotyledons that are demarcated from each other by the positions of the former maternal (placental) septa.

The decidual cells proliferate and enlarge greatly, their cytoplasm staining pink (eosinophilia) due to the presence of numerous mitochondria and intermediate filaments. Dilated blood vessels V and endometrial glands G are apparent. At higher power in micrograph (b), multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast cells S can be seen infiltrating the decidua. Intermediate trophoblast cells I are actually present in greater numbers than syncytiotrophoblast cells but are less easily identified. In the centre of the field, there is a dilated gland G. Micrograph (c) shows the deeper part of the endometrium in pregnancy. Here, the decidual reaction is inconspicuous, but the secretory nature of the glands is greatly exaggerated. It is thus often called hypersecretory endometrium. Note the prominent infolding of the glandular epithelium and the vacuolation of the epithelial cell cytoplasm.

Nucleated fetal erythrocytes E, which in humans persist until 9 weeks gestational age, can be seen in the capillary in micrograph (c). At low magnification in micrograph (a), the main feature is the large numbers of villi V projecting into the lacuna system L that, in vivo, would be filled with maternal blood. Some villi show evidence of branching. Solid cores of cytotrophoblast and intermediate trophoblast I can be seen extending away from the villi to form new branches. With further magnification in micrograph (b), the villi are seen to have a core of primitive mesenchyme M. The villi are invested by trophoblast, comprising an inner layer of cytotrophoblast cells C and a broader outer syncytiotrophoblast layer S. In some areas, solid buds of trophoblast can be seen forming new branches. The specimen is a little broken up as it is derived from a curettage specimen following incomplete spontaneous abortion. Micrograph (c) focuses on the margin of a villus at high magnification, the cellular preservation being again less than ideal due to its origin from a spontaneous miscarriage. The syncytiotrophoblast layer S can be distinguished from the single layer of cytotrophoblast cells C, which are smaller. The mesenchymal cells MC are large with extensive branching cytoplasmic processes and the intercellular matrix is myxoid due to its high content of glycosaminoglycans. I L V L V I a SC I IM M b C S E E MC c Abnormalities of the placenta The normal placenta invades into the uterine wall in order to establish circulation with a supply of oxygen and nutrients for the developing fetus. In some cases, the placenta becomes abnormally adherent and invades too deeply into the uterus, preventing the normal process of separation which occurs after parturition. This can lead to serious maternal blood loss. The least severe form of this is known as placenta accreta, where the placenta does not invade significantly into the myometrium. Placenta increta describes deeper attachment which extends further into the myometrium. In its most severe form, placenta percreta, the placenta may penetrate through to the serosal surface of the uterus and can even attach to other pelvic organs. 375ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 19: Female reproductive system BM basement membrane C cytotrophoblast D desmosome E nucleated erythrocytes G Golgi apparatus I intermediate trophoblast L lacuna M mesenchyme MC mesenchymal cell Mi mitochondrion Mv microvilli Nu nucleolus R polyribosomes rER rough endoplasmic reticulum S syncytiotrophoblast sER smooth endoplasmic reticulum V villus L Mv sER S G rER D D Mi R D R BM Nu C FIG. 19.32 Trophoblast EM ×16 000 This micrograph shows the general ultrastructural features of the trophoblastic components. These show considerable variation from one region to another and from early to late stages of placental development. The syncytiotrophoblast S typically presents large numbers of irregular microvilli Mv to the lacunae L, greatly enhancing the surface area for physiological exchange. The plasma membranes of the microvilli incorporate a wide variety of enzymes and receptors involved in membrane transfer processes, as well as receptors for many hormones and growth factors. Microfilaments extend into the microvilli from a cytoskeletal network concentrated immediately below the free surface. Some areas of the syncytiotrophoblast contain rough endoplasmic reticulum while, in other areas, as shown here, smooth endoplasmic reticulum sER predominates, presumably involved in steroid hormone synthesis. The cytotrophoblast layer C has ultrastructural features of relatively undifferentiated stem cells, exhibiting profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum rER, a well-defined Golgi apparatus G, relatively few mitochondria Mi and numerous polyribosomes R. The nucleus is typically large with dispersed chromatin and nucleoli Nu. The cytotrophoblast is usually tightly bound to the overlying syncytiotrophoblast by desmosomes D, but in some areas, as in this specimen, spaces can be seen between the cell layers. The reason for this is unclear. Separating the cytotrophoblast from the underlying collagenous stroma is a relatively thick basement membrane BM. 376The placenta FIG. 19.33 Term placenta (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (MP) (c) H&E (HP) These micrographs illustrate placenta from a full-term fetus. At low magnification in micrograph (a), huge numbers of villi can be seen, cut in various planes of section and varying in diameter from large mainstem villi to very small terminal branch villi. Compared with early placenta shown in Fig. 19.31, the villous pattern is much more highly developed and the average villous diameter is much smaller, reflecting the extensive branching growth of the villi as the placenta enlarges. Note the large blood vessels V in the largest villi. Micrograph (b) demonstrates the branching nature of the villi at higher magnification. Compare the marked vascularity of the villous cores with that of the much earlier placenta in Fig. 19.31 and the greatly increased villous surface area exposed to the lacunae L filled with maternal blood. A feature of the term placenta is the syncytial knot K, where syncytiotrophoblast nuclei are aggregated together in clusters, leaving zones of thin cytoplasm devoid of nuclei between. Micrograph (c) focuses on a small branch villus and highlights the proximity of blood in fetal capillaries C to maternal blood in the surrounding lacuna L. The trophoblast is reduced to a thin layer of syncytiotrophoblast only and the capillaries tend to be located in the periphery of the core. The diffusion barrier between maternal and fetal circulations comprises five layers: trophoblast, trophoblast basement membrane, villous core supporting tissue, capillary endothelial basement membrane and endothelium. In many cases, fetal capillaries are so close to the trophoblast that their basement membranes fuse F, reducing the diffusion barrier to only three layers.

The outer mesenchymal layer of the amnion then comes to lie in contact with (and often fuses with) the inner mesenchymal layer of the chorion, forming the chorioamnion or fetal membranes. The two layers are often difficult to separate from one another at birth. The amniotic membrane Am comprises a single layer of epithelial cells E derived from extraembryonic ectoderm, resting on a thick basement membrane BM. Beneath this, there is a delicate avascular mesenchymal layer M which is a remnant of the extraembryonic mesoderm. The chorionic membrane Ch consists of three layers. A vascular collagenous inner layer I is also derived from extraembryonic mesoderm. The intermediate zone In, seen here separating it from the amnion, represents the remnant of the extraembryonic coelom and varies greatly in thickness. The trophoblast T of the chorion laeve is represented by the middle layer of eosinophilic epithelial cells, whilst the outermost vascular collagenous layer D is of maternal origin, representing the decidua capsularis (see Fig. 19.28). T BM AmCh D I M In E FIG. 19.35 Umbilical cord (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (HP) The development of the umbilical cord begins with the formation of the extraembryonic coelom which almost surrounds the early embryo and which remains attached to the chorion by the connecting stalk of mesenchyme (see Fig. 19.28). With further embryonic development, the site of attachment of the connecting stalk becomes located ventrally, just caudal to the point where the vitello-intestinal duct connects the yolk sac to the mid-gut. As the embryo grows, the amniotic sac expands greatly, filling the extraembryonic coelom and compressing the vitello-intestinal duct and yolk sac remnant (surrounded by a sleeve of extraembryonic coelom) up against the connecting stalk. These structures ultimately fuse to form the umbilical cord, which now is surrounded by the amnion and amniotic cavity. By the middle of the fifth month, the remnants of the vitello-intestinal duct, yolk sac and sheath of extraembryonic coelom atrophy and disappear. As seen in micrograph (a), all that remains are two umbilical arteries A and a single umbilical vein Ve, embedded in mesenchyme consisting mainly of ground substance and known as Wharton’s jelly W. Mesenchymal cells MC and surface amnion Am are shown at high magnification in micrograph (b). The umbilical arteries convey deoxygenated fetal blood to the placenta while the umbilical vein conveys oxygenated blood back to the fetus.

In humans, only one gland develops on each side of the thorax, although accessory breast tissue may be found anywhere along the milk lines. The breasts of both sexes follow a similar course of development until puberty, after which the female breasts develop under the influence of pituitary, ovarian and other hormones. Until the menopause, the breasts undergo cyclical changes in activity which are controlled by the hormones of the ovarian cycle. After menopause, the breasts, like the other female reproductive tissues, undergo progressive atrophy and involutional change. Paget’s disease of breast Invasive breast cancer or carcinoma in situ (see Fig. 19.42) may spread through ducts and along the lactiferous sinus from the underlying breast lobe and may even spread into the surface epidermis, where it is known as Paget’s disease of the breast. Clinically, this disease typically presents as a patch of red, scaly, seemingly inflamed skin around the nipple, closely mimicking eczema, a common inflammatory skin disease. In this setting, it is important to examine to look carefully for any underlying breast lump. Skin biopsy may be performed to allow definitive diagnosis. FIG. 19.36 Structure of the breast This highly schematic diagram illustrates the general organisation of the breast. Each breast consists of 15 to 25 independent units called breast lobes, each consisting of a compound tubulo-acinar gland (see Fig. 5.25). The size of the lobes is quite variable and the bulk of the breast is made up of a few large lobes that connect to the surface. Immediately before opening onto the surface, the duct forms a dilatation called the lactiferous sinus. Smaller lobes end in blind ending ducts that do not reach the nipple surface. The lobes are embedded in a mass of adipose tissue, subdivided by collagenous septa. The nipple contains bands of smooth muscle, orientated in parallel to the lactiferous ducts and circularly near the base. Contraction of this muscle causes erection of the nipple. Within each lobe of the breast, the main duct branches repeatedly to form a number of terminal ducts, each of which leads to a lobule consisting of multiple acini. Each terminal duct and its associated lobule is called a terminal duct–lobular unit. The lobules are separated by moderately dense collagenous interlobular tissue, whereas the intralobular supporting tissue surrounding the ducts within each lobule is less collagenous and more vascular. The skin surrounding the nipple, the areola, is pigmented and contains sebaceous glands which are not associated with hair follicles. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 FIG. 19.37 The nipple H&E (LP) This low-magnification micrograph of the nipple demonstrates the structure of the lactiferous sinuses and shows their connection to the surface of the skin of the nipple. Several lactiferous sinuses L are seen coursing through the dermis towards the skin surface. Only the lactiferous sinus on the right can be seen connecting to the surface in this micrograph, but this is probably due to a slightly oblique plane of section, rather than indicating blind-ending sinuses. The undulating surface of the epidermis Ep is seen, and a single sebaceous gland S is also identifiable. The epithelium of the lactiferous sinuses is similar to that of the ducts in the rest of the breast until close to the surface, where the epithelium becomes stratified squamous in type.

Micrograph (a) shows terminal duct–lobular units (TDLU) at low magnification. The extensive branching duct system is surrounded by relatively dense fibrous interlobular tissue F and adipose tissue A. The interlacing (reticular) arrangement of the coarse collagen of the interlobular tissue is seen at higher magnification in micrograph (b), as is the branching duct system of the lobule. The breast ducts and acini are lined by two layers of cells, a luminal layer of epithelial cells and a basal layer of flattened myoepithelial cells. In the larger ducts, as shown in micrograph (c), the luminal epithelial cells E are tall columnar in type whereas, in the smaller ducts and acini shown in micrograph (d), the epithelial cells are cuboidal. A discontinuous layer of stellate myoepithelial cells M with pale cytoplasm surrounds the ductal lining cells.

Breast proliferation is also dependent on prolactin, human chorionic somatomammotropin (a prolactin- like hormone produced by the placenta), thyroxine and corticosteroids. At low magnification in micrograph (a), the breast lobules Lo are seen to have enlarged greatly at the expense of the intralobular tissue and interlobar adipose tissue, although septa S of interlobular tissue still remain. At higher magnification in (b) the acini A are dilated. The lining epithelial cells E vary from cuboidal to low columnar and contain cytoplasmic vacuoles. The intralobular stroma is much less prominent and contains an infiltrate of lymphocytes, eosinophils and plasma cells. As pregnancy progresses, the acini begin to secrete a protein-rich fluid called colostrum, the accumulation of which dilates the acinar and duct lumina as seen in micrograph (b). Colostrum is the form of breast secretion available during the first few days after birth. It contains a laxative substance and maternal antibodies. Unlike milk, colostrum contains little lipid. Breast secretion is controlled by the hormone prolactin. During pregnancy, prolactin secretion progressively increases, but high levels of circulating oestrogens and progesterone suppress its activity. S Lo S Lo a E E A A b FIG. 19.40 Lactating breast (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (MP) After parturition, the levels of circulating progesterone and oestrogens, which inhibit milk secretion, fall precipitously. Prolactin stimulates milk production in conjunction with several other hormones. As seen in micrograph (a), the lactating breast is composed almost entirely of acini distended with milk, the interlobular tissue now being reduced to thin septa S between the lobules. At higher magnification in (b), the acini are filled with an eosinophilic material containing clear vacuoles caused by lipid droplets which have dissolved out during tissue preparation. The epithelial cells are flattened and the acini distended by secretions. However, in different areas, the epithelium may be thicker and the acinar lumina smaller. Milk production proceeds for as long as suckling continues and can continue for some years after childbirth. A neurohormonal reflex in which nipple stimulation by suckling causes release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary controls the process. A different neurohormonal reflex, also initiated by suckling, causes the release of the hormone oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. Oxytocin causes contraction of the myoepithelial cells which embrace the secretory acini and ducts, thus propelling milk into the lactiferous sinuses (milk ‘let-down’). Withdrawal of the suckling stimulus, and hence the release of pituitary hormones at weaning, results in regression of the lactating breast and resumption of the normal ovarian cycle.

As a result, a substantial proportion of women have lactactional amenorrhoea whilst breast feeding. High levels of prolactin act to suppress production of LH and so effectively inhibit ovulation. This is an important means of birth control in some cultures. FIG. 19.41 Lactating breast EM ×9000 This micrograph shows two secretory cells of adjacent acini in a lactating breast. Their nuclei N are large, with prominent nucleoli. Each acinus is bounded by a basement membrane BM, the basement membranes in this example being separated by only a shred of intralobular supporting tissue. Between each basement membrane and the secretory cells are the cytoplasmic processes of myoepithelial cells M, contraction of which expels milk from the gland. The composition of milk varies somewhat during lactation and even during each suckling episode, but its main constituents are as follows: water (88%), ions (particularly sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium and phosphate), protein (1.5%, mainly lactalbumin and casein), carbohydrate (7%, mainly lactose), lipids (3.5%, mainly triglycerides), vitamins and antibodies (mainly IgA). Secretion of different components of the milk occurs by different mechanisms. Water and some ions diffuse freely through the apical cell membrane. Proteins are synthesised on the rough endoplasmic reticulum rER, packaged in the Golgi apparatus G and secreted in vacuoles V by exocytosis. Protein in the milk is represented by small electron-dense granules. The Golgi apparatus is extensive and the protein-containing secretory vacuoles also contain a considerable amount of other less electron-dense material, including lactose and calcium. The cytoplasm of the secretory cells contains lipid droplets L of various sizes which are not bounded by membrane. These contain triglycerides, although whether this is derived directly from blood or synthesised in the secretory cells is uncertain. The lipid is discharged by apocrine secretion, which involves the lipid droplet, surrounding cytoplasm and plasma membrane being cast off into the lumen. A large lipid droplet L1 with thin overlying rim of cytoplasm can be seen in the lower acinus, just prior to secretion. An even larger droplet L2 surrounded by a remnant of cytoplasm and plasma membrane is seen in the lumen close by. IgA, taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis at the base of the cell from the bloodstream, is transported across the cell in small membranous vesicles and released by exocytosis into the milk, a process known as transcytosis.

In many countries, breast cancer screening programmes are in operation in the hope that early detection of cancer or even precancerous lesions will cure the disease. Women in the age groups at risk are subjected to mammography, an uncomfortable and undignified procedure that is nevertheless better than dying of breast cancer. Lesions identified at mammography are biopsied, and the pathologist determines whether the lesion is indeed a cancer or one of many benign breast lesions that may cause a lump or a mammographic abnormality. A typical breast carcinoma is illustrated in Fig. 19.42. FIG. 19.42 Breast cancer H&E (MP) This micrograph shows a medium-power view of an area of breast carcinoma in a middle-aged woman. The cancer is of the commonest type, known as ductal carcinoma, NOS (not otherwise specified). Note how clusters of malignant epithelial cells Ca invade into the normal breast stroma S, destroying it. In the left side of the field, there is a single expanded duct which appears to be filled and expanded by similar malignant cells. This is an area of ductal carcinoma in situ CIS. Breast carcinoma in situ often calcifies, allowing the disease to be identified on mammograms. Obviously, the earlier the cancer is identified, the better the chance of a complete cure. Breast cancer is typically treated by a combination of surgery, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, depending upon the type and extent of the tumour.

They provide mechanical support as well as mediating the exchange of metabolites between neurones and the vascular system. They also form part of the blood-brain barrier. Astrocytes play an important role in repair of CNS tissue after damage • Microglia are the CNS representatives of the monocyte- macrophage system and have defence and immunologi- cal functions. • Ependymal cells make up a specialised epithelium which lines the ventricles and spinal canal Central nervous tissue proper lacks collagenous sup- porting tissue which is confined to the immediate surrounds of penetrating blood vessels and to the meninges that invest the outer surface of the brain. The CNS also contains little extracellular material. While the basic organisation of grey and white matter remains consistent throughout the brain, in detail they form complex arrangements of the basic components to give a rich microscopic anatomy (histology) which is highly related to the macroscopic anatomy and function. In this chapter after description of the specialised supporting cells and tissues, including CSF production (choroid plexus), we will illustrate the microanatomy of some major structures in the CNS. 20  Central nervous system The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal cord and is composed of neurones, neuronal proc- esses, supporting cells of the CNS (glial cells) and blood vessels. The CNS is invested with meninges and is sus- pended in fluid, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which is pro- duced by specialised choroid plexus structures. Macroscopically, all parts of the CNS are made up of grey matter and white matter. Grey matter contains most of the neurone cell bodies and their dendritic processes while the white matter contains the axons. The lipid-rich myelin sheaths around the axons accounts for the white appearance of the white matter. Central nervous tissue consists of a vast number of neu- rones and their processes embedded in a mass of support cells, collectively known as neuroglia, which form almost half of the total mass of the CNS. These are highly branched cells that occupy the spaces between neurones; they have intimate functional relationships with the neurones, provid- ing both mechanical and metabolic support. Four principal types of neuroglia are recognised: • Oligodendrocytes are the CNS equivalent of the Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system and are responsi- ble for the formation of myelin sheaths in the CNS. • Astrocytes are highly branched cells that pack the interstices between the neurones, their processes and FIG. 20.1  Grey matter  H&E (HP) Common staining methods permit neurones N to be readily distinguished from glial cells. While neurones vary greatly in different regions of the brain, they are usually recognisable by their large nuclei, prominent nucleoli and dispersed chromatin. There is usually extensive basophilic granular cytoplasm, and parts of one or more processes may be visible, often due to processing artefact. Types of neuroglia are difficult to differentiate from each other with certainty by common staining methods. In the mature CNS, as in this specimen, oligodendrocytes O have small round condensed nuclei; their cytoplasm is unstained by routine methods, including H&E. In grey matter, oligodendrocytes are not only scattered between the nerve cell bodies along with the astrocytes but also tend to be aggregated around the neurone cell bodies. Other glial cells in the image, marked A, are probably astrocytes. The nuclei of both neurones and neuroglia are surrounded by a dense network of branching cytoplasmic cell processes, axons and dendrites. This is seen as a fibrillar eosinophilic material on H&E and is called neuropil Np. Only some of the fibres are myelinated axons.

They have long, branched processes which occupy much of the interneuronal spaces in the neuropil. In grey matter, many of the astrocyte processes end in terminal expansions adjacent to the non-synaptic regions of neurones. Other processes of the same astrocytes terminate upon the basement membranes of capillaries; these perivascular feet cover most of the surface of the capillary basement membranes and form part of the blood-brain barrier as illustrated in the diagram (a). Similar foot processes invest the basement membrane between the CNS and the innermost layer of the meninges, the pia mater (see Fig. 20.9), forming a relatively impermeable barrier called the glia limitans. Astrocytes mediate metabolic exchange between neurones and blood and regulate the composition of the intercellular environment of the CNS. All astrocytes contain bundles of intermediate filaments and microtubules. The intermediate filaments are formed of GFAP, which is characteristic of astrocytes. The astrocytes of grey matter have numerous short, highly branched cytoplasmic processes and are described as protoplasmic astrocytes. These are demonstrated in micrograph (b) by using immunohistochemical staining for GFAP. By contrast, the astrocytes of white matter have relatively few and straight cytoplasmic processes rich in intermediate filaments and are known as fibrous astrocytes. Micrograph (c) shows an astrocyte A lying adjacent to a nerve cell body N in the cerebral cortex. The astrocyte cytoplasm contains many ribosomes, a little rough endoplasmic reticulum and a few small mitochondria and lysosomes. The origins of several cytoplasmic extensions C can be identified. The cytoplasm appears moderately electron-dense due to its content of intermediate filaments IF, which can be seen at higher magnification in micrograph (d). Typical of CNS grey matter, the adjacent neuropil Np contains numerous neuronal and glial processes in various planes of section; some myelinated axons M are included in the field. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 b C Np N A C M M Np C N c IF d 386White matter FIG. 20.3  White matter CNS myelin and  oligodendrocytes (illustrations (e) and (f) opposite)  (a) H&E (MP) (b) H&E (HP) (c) TS, solochrome cyanin  (HP) (d) LS, solochrome cyanin (HP) (e) EM ×13 000  (f) Schematic diagram White matter consists of nerve fibres (axons), often myelinated by oligodendrocytes, organised in tracts, with supporting astrocytes, microglia and vessels. Oligodendrocytes were so named because original heavy metal impregnation methods showed that they only had a small number of short, branched processes (Greek: oligos = few, dendron = tree). It is now known that oligodendrocytes are responsible for myelination of axons and the processes originally described are the short pedicles that connect the cell body to the myelin sheaths. A single oligodendrocyte can contribute to the myelination of up to 50 axons from the same or different fibre tracts, as illustrated in the diagram (f). Conversely, any one axon will require the services of numerous different oligodendrocytes because of the limited length of the myelin segments (internodes) produced by each oligodendrocyte. The mechanism of myelin sheath formation is very similar to that of Schwann cells in peripheral nerve (see Fig. 7.6). Oligodendrocytes are the predominant type of neuroglia in white matter, as well as being abundant in grey matter. Micrographs (a) and (b) show CNS white matter, with the oligodendrocyte nuclei ON often having an artefactual perinuclear halo and a few larger astrocyte nuclei A. Micrographs (c) is of a myelin stain, with the transverse ring-shaped profiles of blue-stained myelin each surrounding an axon, unstained and not visible in this preparation. Micrograph (d) is of longitudinal fibres using the same stain. Oligodendrocyte nuclei ON can be seen as rounded red-stained profiles. Oligodendrocytes aggregate closely around nerve cell bodies in the grey matter, where they are thought to have a support function analogous to that of the satellite cells which surround nerve cell bodies in peripheral ganglia (see Fig. 7.20). The electron micrograph (e) shows an oligodendrocyte O lying adjacent to a nerve cell body N, with a neuronal dendrite D at the upper right. The oligodendrocyte contains prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes and Golgi apparatus G. The commencement of a cytoplasmic process C is seen. The remainder of the image shows the complexity of the neuropil Np, comprising glial and neuronal processes including myelinated axons M. Myelin sheath formation begins in the CNS of the human embryo at about 4 months gestation, with the formation of most sheaths at least commenced by about the age of 1 year. From this time, successive layers continue to be laid down, with final myelin sheath thickness being achieved by the time of physical maturity.

As shown in the diagram, microglia have elongated nuclei and relatively little cytoplasm, which forms fine highly branched processes. In consequence, they are difficult to identify in conventional preparations for light microscopy. Immunohistochemical staining provides the best way to see microglia. Micrograph (b) shows the ramified profile of microglia cells, identified by staining using ricinus communis agglutinin which binds to sugars on the membrane of this cell type. Micrograph (c) highlights the distribution of this cell type in white matter from the cerebral hemisphere. The rounded nuclei in the background are mainly oligodendrocytes. In response to tissue damage, microglia transform into large amoeboid phagocytic cells and are thus the CNS representatives of the macrophage-monocyte defence system (see Fig. 4.19). CD68 stains cells of macrophage lineage, including microglial cells. Other macrophages, distinct from microglia, are present in the space surrounding the CNS capillaries but are separated from the CNS compartment proper by the perivascular feet of astrocytes. Microglial cell a b c FIG. 20.5  Main anatomical divisions in the CNS  This diagram shows the brain and spinal cord viewed in a sagittal section. The main part of the brain consists of the paired cerebral hemispheres H which are invested by the cerebral cortex. Deep within the brain are large grey matter structures which form the diencephalon Di. Included in this region are the basal ganglia and thalamus. The cerebral hemispheres are connected to structures below by the midbrain B. In this region, there are important nuclei including the substantia nigra. The pons P connects to the medulla M as well as to the cerebellum C. The pons, medulla and midbrain are often collectively termed the brainstem. The spinal cord S extends from the lower end of the medulla. Specific terms are used to describe arrangements of cells and their connections: • The grey mater over the surface of the brain is termed the cortex. • A discrete arrangement of neurones, often with a specific function, is termed a nucleus. • An arrangement of neuronal cells running along the spinal cord is termed a column. • A defined bundle of axons running in white matter is termed a tract or a fascicle. • The crests of folds are termed gyri (singular: gyrus) while the clefts between folds are termed sulci (singular: sulcus). In the cerebellum these folds are termed folia. \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 389ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 20: Central nervous system FIG. 20.6  Choroid plexus  (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (HP) The choroid plexus is a vascular structure arising from the wall of each of the four ventricles of the brain and responsible for the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF drains from the interconnected ventricular cavities via three channels connecting the fourth ventricle with the subarachnoid space which surrounds the CNS. CSF is produced at a constant rate and is reabsorbed from the subarachnoid space into the superior sagittal venous sinus, via finger-like projections called arachnoid villi. Thus the CNS is suspended in a constantly circulating fluid medium which acts as a support and shock absorber. Each choroid plexus consists of a branching system of blood vessels which run in fronds composed of collagenous tissue and covered by a cuboidal or columnar epithelium. The choroid plexus is therefore a villous structure. Micrograph (a) shows the choroid plexus CP within a ventricle of the brain V. Micrograph (b) shows detail of one of the choroid plexus processes. The capillaries and vessels of the choroid plexus are large, thin-walled and sometimes fenestrated lying in a fibrous core. The epithelial cells rest on a basal lamina. At the ultrastructural level, long bulbous microvilli project from the luminal surfaces of the choroid plexus epithelial cells and their cytoplasm contains numerous mitochondria, features which suggest that the elaboration of CSF is an active process. The mode of CSF secretion involves active secretion of sodium ions by choroid epithelial cells into the CSF, followed by passive movement of water from the local vessels. Continuous tight junctions (zonula occludens) between epithelial cells contribute to a blood-CSF barrier, preventing ingress of almost all other molecules. V V CP a b B midbrain C cerebellum CP choroid plexus Di diencephalon H hemisphere M medulla P pons S spinal cord V ventricle FIG. 20.7  Ependyma  H&E (HP) Ependymal cells form the lining of the ventricles and spinal canal. Cuboidal or low columnar in shape, the cells are tightly bound together at their luminal surfaces by the usual epithelial junctional complexes. Unlike epithelia, however, ependymal cells do not rest on a basement membrane but, rather, the bases of the cells taper and then branch into fine processes which ramify within the underlying layer of processes derived from astrocytes. At the luminal surface, there are a variable number of cilia. Microvilli are also present and probably have absorptive and secretory functions. The ependymal layer tends to become incomplete with increasing age. 390Meninges FIG. 20.8  Meninges  (a) Diagram (b) Dura mater, H&E (MP) (c) H&E (LP) The brain and spinal cord are invested by three layers of supporting tissue, collectively called the meninges. The surface of the nervous tissue is covered by a delicate layer called the pia mater, containing collagen fibres, fine elastin fibres and occasional fibroblasts, separated from the astrocytic processes of underlying CNS parenchyma by a basement membrane. The basement membrane is completely invested by astrocytic processes, the two layers forming the impermeable glia limitans. Overlying the pia mater is a thicker fibrous layer, the arachnoid mater, which derives its name from the presence of cobweb-like strands which connect it to the underlying pia; since the pia and arachnoid are continuous, they may be considered as a unit, the pia-arachnoid, also called the leptomeninges. The space between the pia and arachnoid is called the subarachnoid space and, in places, forms large cisterns. This subarachnoid space is connected with the ventricular system by three foramina in the fourth ventricle (in the brainstem), and CSF circulates continuously from the ventricles into the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space is lined by flattened arachnoidal cells. The outer surface of the arachnoid mater is also lined by flat cells. As shown in the diagram, arteries and veins passing to and from the CNS pass in the subarachnoid space loosely attached to the pia mater and invested by subarachnoid meningothelium. As the larger vessels extend into the nervous tissue, they are surrounded by a delicate sleeve of pia mater. Between the penetrating vessels and the pia there is a perivascular space. In humans, the pia blends with the adventitia of the vessel as it penetrates the brain, thus \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 •\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000• •\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 D b A P S c A arachnoid mater D dura mater F fibrous strand P pia mater PVS perivascular space S sulcus SS subarachnoid space V vessel separating the perivascular space from the subarachnoid space. This pia component is not present around the capillaries of the CNS. External to the arachnoid mater is a dense fibroelastic layer called the dura mater D, micrograph (b), which is lined on its internal surface by flat cells. The dura is closely applied to but not connected with the arachnoid layer and there is the potential for a space, the subdural space, to develop between the two layers. In the cranium, the dura mater merges with the periosteum of the skull but also extends into the brain space as several folds. A large fold, the falx, extends along the midline from top of the skull into the space between the cerebral hemispheres while a horizontal fold, the tentorium, is attached to the posterior skull and extends into the space between the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum. These folds help support the brain and contain venous sinuses, forming part of the brain’s venous return system. Around the spinal cord, dura is suspended from the periosteum of the spinal canal by denticulate ligaments, the intervening epidural space being filled with loose fibrofatty tissue and a venous plexus. The pia and arachnoid layers of the brain meninges are illustrated in micrograph (c). Pia mater P is attached to the surface of the brain and continues into the suclus S and around the penetrating vessels. The arachnoid mater A appears to be a completely separate layer and bridges the sulcus. Meningeal vessels lie in the subarachnoid space. 391ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 20: Central nervous system FIG. 20.9  Meninges  (a) H&E (MP) (b) H&E (HP) (c) Immunohistochemical  method for GFAP (HP) The pia and arachnoid layers of the brain meninges are illustrated in micrograph (a). In this micrograph, delicate fibrous strands F can be discerned traversing the subarachnoid space SS to connect the pia and arachnoid layers. Small vessels V can be seen in the subarachnoid space. A penetrating vessel is also seen, surrounded by a perivascular space PVS. The perivascular space is extremely narrow, although it often appears artefactually wider as in this micrograph. The CNS contains no lymphatics and interstitial fluid is thought to drain outwards from the brain substance to join the subarachnoid CSF via the perivascular spaces, contributing as much as 20% of its volume. As seen in micrograph (b), by light microscopy the capillaries of the CNS are similar to those elsewhere in the body, with flattened endothelial cells resting on a basement membrane; however, unlike elsewhere, these endothelial cells are not fenestrated and are bound together by continuous tight intercellular junctions (zonula occludens). Externally, the basement membranes are covered by the perivascular foot processes of astrocytes, shown in micrograph (c), where brown-stained processes form a continuous layer. Perfusion studies show that the CNS capillaries are impermeable to certain plasma constituents, especially larger molecules, forming a blood-brain barrier. The capillary endothelium plays the central role, since the junctions between endothelial cells are sealed; the endothelial cells exhibit little or no pinocytosis. Luminal surface membranes contain various enzymes which destroy neurotoxic metabolites and neuroactive humoral substances. Maintenance of barrier-type endothelium appears to be under the control of astrocyte foot processes. The blood-brain barrier provides neurones with a relatively constant biochemical and metabolic environment, protection against endogenous and exogenous toxins and infective agents and insulates the neurones from circulating neurotransmitters and other humoral agents. The capillaries of the choroid plexus, the pituitary and pineal glands and the vomiting centre of the hypothalamus are, however, devoid of this barrier to allow for their specialised functions. F V SS PVS a b c Meningeal spaces: site of several disease processes • The subarachnoid space contains the main blood vessels supplying the brain. If there is damage to these vessels (e.g. rupture due to a weakness of the vessel wall), then blood enters the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), termed subarachnoid haemorrhage. • The subarachnoid space contains CSF. In bacterial meningitis, infective organisms invade the CSF and there is an inflammatory response. A count of lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils in the CSF, usually performed on a sample drawn from the lumbar thecal space (lumbar puncture), is helpful in diagnosis of meningitis. • The subdural space is the potential space between the dura and the arachnoid. Veins traverse this tissue plane. In the elderly and in patients with impaired blood clotting, minor trauma can tear veins, causing bleeding into this space (subdural haemorrhage). • The dura is firmly attached to the inner surface of the skull. If there is bleeding associated with skull fracture, blood can accumulate in this tissue plane between bone and dura, producing an extradural haemorrhage. 392Spinal cordFIG. 20.10  Spinal cord transverse  sections   Luxol fast blue, H&E photomontage, (LP)   (a) Cervical (b) Thoracic (c) Lumbar   (d) Sacral The structure of the spinal cord is similar throughout its length, with four regions demonstrated in this series of micrographs. In transverse sections, the central mass of grey matter has the shape of a butterfly, the ventral horns V being prominent and containing the cell bodies of the large alpha lower motor neurones. The dorsal horns D contain the cell bodies of small second-order sensory neurones. These relay upwards sensory information on pain and temperature and participate in spinal reflexes. Small lateral horns L are found in the thoracic and upper lumbar regions and contain cell bodies of sympathetic nervous system efferent neurones. The volume of grey matter is more extensive in the cervical and lumbar regions and the cord is larger, corresponding to innervation of the limbs. The central canal lies in the central commissure C of grey matter; it is lined by ependymal cells and contains CSF. The white matter consists of ascending tracts of sensory fibres and descending motor tracts; passing up the spinal cord towards the brain, more and more fibres enter and leave the cord so that the volume of white matter increases progressively from the sacral to cervical regions. The spinal cord has a deep ventral (anterior) median fissure F but, dorsally, there is only a shallow dorsal midline sulcus. On each side, a dorsolateral sulcus S marks the line of entry of the dorsal nerve roots R, part of which can be seen in micrograph (a). The white matter between the dorsal horns represents the ascending dorsal columns DC which convey fibres for senses of vibration, proprioception and fine touch to the medulla where they synapse with second-order sensory neurones in the gracile and cuneate nuclei. In the cervical region, each dorsal column is subdivided into two fascicles: the medial fasciculus gracilis FG, conveying fibres from the lower limbs, and the lateral fasciculus cuneatus FC, conveying fibres from the upper limbs. Ventrolateral sulci VS may be discernible, marking the line of exit of the ventral nerve roots. The ventrolateral white matter contains most notably the lateral spinothalamic tract (pain and temperature), the ventral spinothalamic tract (light touch), the spinocerebellar tracts and the corticospinal tract (motor). The spinal cord is invested by meninges, with the dura mater being loosely connected to the periosteum of the vertebral canal by denticulate ligaments; the residual epidural space is filled by adipose tissue and a venous plexus. During development, the vertebral column lengthens more than the enclosed spinal cord and the segmental levels of the lower part of the cord therefore lie above the corresponding intervertebral foramina. Below the cervical region, the nerve roots NR pursue an increasingly oblique course in the subarachnoid space before passing through the intervertebral foramina and are thus found adjacent to the cord, particularly in the lumbar and sacral regions.

Both images (a) and (b) illustrate the central commissure C where both grey matter (pink-staining cells and their processes) and blue-staining myelinated nerved fibres cross the midline. The spinal canal E with its ependymal cell lining is identified in both images but can only be seen clearly in image (b). Micrograph (c) illustrates part of the grey matter, the anterior horn with large neurones with their purple-staining cytoplasmic Nissl substance. Parts of their dendritic processes or axons are visible as a result of shrinkage artefact. These cells are the alpha motor neurones N (lower motor neurones) responsible for voluntary skeletal muscle control and thus voluntary movement. They are situated in a background of small cells, cell processes and nerve fibres. Micrograph (d) is a high-power view of the cord white matter, formed of massed nerve fibres with axons Ax and their surrounding myelin sheaths M. Large numbers of small myelinated axons and unmyelinated axons are also present but are not visible at this power and in this kind of section. C F E a E C b N c M Ax d Poliomyelitis Polio viruses, in some infected patients, cause destruction of the alpha motor neurones, resulting in permanent paralysis. This is a flaccid paralysis also known as lower motor neurone (LMN) paralysis, where the muscles innervated by the neurones become weak or paralysed, lose tone, cease to resist forced movements and become floppy. Without their neural stimulation, these muscles then permanently atrophy. Immunisation against poliomyelitis has taken this virus group to the edge of extinction (native type 2 Polio has not existed outside laboratories for years). However, other viruses do rarely produce spinal cord inflammation and paralysis.

The medulla also contains a spinal nucleus which is part of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) and associated tract; this spinal nucleus of the trigeminal tract SNT is recognisable dorsolaterally throughout the medulla, with its tract of white matter lying superficially. The hypoglossal nucleus HN can also be identified in micrograph (c). In the most caudal medulla, image (a), grey matter can be seen still roughly resembling the butterfly shape seen in sections of the spinal cord. The ventral grey matter horns contain cell bodies of lower motor neurones running in the spinal accessory and first cervical nerves. A prominent feature of the upper medulla is the inferior olivary nucleus O, named for a gross anatomical resemblance to an olive. It has a convoluted appearance in transverse section and is associated with several smaller accessory nuclei D, including the dorsal accessory olivary nucleus N and the medial accessory olivary nucleus MO. The neurones of this inferior olivary complex relay central and spinal afferent stimuli to the cerebellar cortex. Dorsally, the spinal canal opens into the fourth ventricle V. The medulla oblongata is the most caudal part of the brainstem and connects to spinal cord. The images are in order (a) to (d) from caudal (towards tail) to rostral (towards head). The Weigart-Pal used in images (a) and (c) is a myelin stain which leaves the grey matter relatively unstained. The prominent ventral pyramid P on each side of the medulla are the corticospinal tracts which transmit voluntary motor signals from the motor cortex to alpha motor neurones in the anterior horns of the spinal cord. About 85% of fibres cross to the opposite side in the decussation of the pyramids located in the medulla (remember, the left brain cortex supplies the right side of the body). All of the ascending (sensory) pathways in the spinal cord pass through the medulla, although their arrangement differs from the spinal cord. The easiest traced are the dorsal white matter columns of the spinal cord which convey ascending proprioceptive, vibration and discriminatory touch fibres. These axons relay with neurones in the similarly situated gracile FGN and cuneate FCN nuclei located in the dorsum of medulla, micrograph (b), at the rostral end of the gracile FG and cuneate FC fasciculi of the dorsal columns, seen in micrograph (a). The axonal fibres of the tract (after the relay) then pass upwards to the thalamus via the medial lemniscus ML which lies medially. 395ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 20: Central nervous system FIG. 20.13  Pons  (a) Mid-pons, Weigart-Pal (LP)   (b) Basal pons, H&E (MP) The pons is the middle portion of the brainstem, lying between the midbrain rostrally and medulla caudally. In transverse section, it comprises two parts, a bulky ventral region (basal pons) and a smaller dorsal (tegmental) region. The basal pons consists of crisscrossed bundles of longitudinal and transverse fibres between which lie collections of neurone cell bodies known as pontine nuclei. The longitudinal fibres of the basal pons consist of descending fibres of two main types. There are axons of the corticospinal tract which transmit voluntary motor signals from the motor cortex to the alpha motor neurones of the ventral horns of the spinal cord. On traversing the pons, these axons converge to form the pyramids of the medulla. A second group of descending fibres originate in various areas of the cortex and synapse in the pontine nuclei, from which fibres then pass in the transverse bundles, crossing the midline to enter the cerebellum via the middle peduncles M. The dorsal tegmentum contains the ascending spinothalamic (sensory) tracts and the nuclei of the fifth, sixth and seventh cranial nerves. On each side, the medial lemniscus ML is readily identifiable; this represents the upward continuation of proprioceptive, vibration and fine touch pathways of the spinal dorsal columns, relayed via the gracile and cuneate nuclei of the medulla. The cerebellum is located on the dorsum of the brainstem at the pons and is connected via the cerebellar peduncles, which are subdivided into superior, middle, and inferior peduncles reflecting the three main fibre tracts. Part of the middle peduncle M is present in sections through the mid-pontine level, as in micrograph (a), while the superior cerebellar peduncles SCP are very prominent. The main bulk of the superior cerebellar peduncles is made up of fibres from the central nuclei of the cerebellum passing upwards to the thalamus and then to the motor cortex. Image (b) is a higher-power view of the basal pons and shows in transverse section T the rostral-caudal fibre bundles, including the cortical spinal motor tracts. In longitudinal section L are fibres crossing between the cerebellar hemispheres. There is also the interspersed grey matter with its neurones representing the pontine motor nuclei PN.

It consists of a cortex of grey matter with a central core of white matter containing four pairs of nuclei. Afferent and efferent fibres pass to and from the brainstem via inferior, middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, linking medulla, pons and midbrain, respectively. As seen in micrograph (a), the cerebellar cortex forms a series of deeply convoluted folds or folia supported by a branching central white matter M (sometimes called the medulla of the cerebellum, but not to be confused with the nearby medulla oblongata). At higher magnification in micrograph (b), the cortex is seen to consist of three layers. The outer molecular layer ML contains relatively few neurones and large numbers of unmyelinated fibres. The inner granular cell layer GL is extremely cellular. Between the two is a single layer of huge neurones called Purkinje cells PL. Purkinje cells P are seen at higher magnification in micrograph (c); they have very large cell bodies, a relatively fine axon extending down through the granular cell layer GL and an extensively branching dendritic system which arborises in the molecular layer ML. The extraordinary dendritic system of Purkinje cells is best demonstrated by heavy metal methods as in micrograph (d). The deep granular cell layer of the cortex contains numerous small neurones, the non-myelinated axons of which pass outwards to the molecular layer where they bifurcate to run parallel to the surface to synapse with the dendrites of Purkinje cells. Micrograph (e) demonstrates these granular cell axons in the molecular layer. The axons A are stained black with silver and their cell bodies in the granular cell layer GL are counter- stained with neutral red. In addition to the Purkinje P and granular cells already described, there are three other types of small neurones in the cerebellar cortex: stellate cells and basket cells scattered in the molecular layer ML and Golgi cells scattered in the superficial part of the granular cell layer. Note black-stained fibrils of basket cell axons surrounding the Purkinje cell bodies P in micrograph (e). Afferent fibres enter the cerebellum from the brainstem and then pass via the central white matter to make complex connections with granular cells; these, in turn, connect with Purkinje dendrites via basket cells and other neurones of the cerebellar cortex. The efferent fibres from the cerebellar cortex are the Purkinje cell axons which traverse the granular cell layer to synapse in the central nuclei of the cerebellum. M a ML GL PL b ML P GLc d ML P P P A GL e Cerebellar ataxia Diseases that damage the cerebellar cortex lead to the development of cerebellar ataxia, in which there is poor coordination of voluntary movement and loss of balance. Causes include tumours, trauma, familial neurodegenerative disease, alcohol and hypoxic damage. 397ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 20: Central nervous system FIG. 20.15  Substantia nigra  (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (HP) The substantia nigra is a large mass of grey matter extending throughout the midbrain; on each side it divides the cerebral peduncles into dorsal and ventral parts and, in sections of the midbrain as in micrograph (a), it is easily recognised by neurones containing dark pigment from which its name derives. The substantia nigra has extensive connections with the cortex, spinal cord, corpus striatum and reticular formation and appears to play an important part in the fine control of motor function. The neurones of the substantia nigra are multipolar in form, and, in adults, the cytoplasm contains numerous granules of neuromelanin pigment as seen in micrograph (b). The pigmented neurones of the substantia nigra contain dopamine, which appears to act as a neurotransmitter causing inhibitory effects, particularly on neurones in the corpus striatum (one of the basal ganglia of the diencephalon). Neuromelanin is contained in membrane-bound granules. Very little neuromelanin is present at birth, with the amount increasing during childhood and thereafter rising with increasing age. The origin of neuromelanin is still debated, with proposals that it is enzymatically generated or is merely an oxidation byproduct of dopamine synthesis. Functionally, it may sequester metals such as iron, as well as toxic organic compounds. a b Parkinson’s disease Parkinson’s disease is a common neurodegenerative disease, usually seen in later life. It is clinically characterised by tremor, muscular rigidity and slowness of movement. Neuropathology shows degeneration and death of neurones in the substantia nigra. This leads to a marked reduction in dopamine levels in the brain that in turn leads to the movement disorder. Macroscopic examination of the brain of a patient who has died with Parkinson’s disease shows abnormal pallor of the substantia nigra, correlating with loss of the pigment-containing nigral neurones. Symptoms can be alleviated by the drug L-dopa, a dopamine precursor which crosses the blood-brain barrier to increase brain dopamine levels. FIG. 20.16  Thalamus  H&E (HP) The thalami are large masses of grey matter lying on each side of the third ventricle and comprising the main bulk of the diencephalon, the central core of the cerebrum. Other large basal ganglia include the corpus striatum and caudate nucleus. Functionally, the thalamus is subdivided into a large number of nuclei, including reticular and motor nuclei as well as specific sensory nuclei containing the cell bodies of neurones with axons projecting to the cerebral cortex. The thalamus constitutes an extremely complex relay and integration centre for information from almost all parts of the CNS. This micrograph shows the histological appearance of a typical basal nucleus, consisting of a loose aggregation of neurone cell bodies N in a background of neuropil. As an age-related change, these neurones have accumulated light brown lipofuscin pigment consisting of indigestible lipid byproducts.

Histologically, the neurones of the cerebral cortex can be divided into five different morphological types which are arranged in several layers. The biologically oldest part of the cortex is concerned with olfaction (smell) and the neurones are arranged into three layers. In mammals, most of the cortex is called neocortex and consists of six layers. In humans, this constitutes about 90%; the three-layered pattern persists only in the olfactory cortex and in the cortical part of the limbic system in the temporal lobe. The synaptic interconnections within the cortex are complex, with any one neurone synapsing with several hundred others. However, there are several basic principles of cortical organisation and function: • Functional units are disposed vertically, corresponding to the general orientation of axons and major dendrites. • Afferent fibres (incoming axons) generally synapse high in the cortex with the dendrites of efferent neurones whose cell bodies sit in deeper layers of the cortex. • Efferent (outgoing) pathways, typically axons from pyramidal cells, tend to give off branches which pass back into more superficial layers and communicate with their own dendrites via interneuronal connections with other cell types. The five characteristic types of cortical neurone are shown diagrammatically in (a), the pyramidal and stellate cells being by far the most common types: • Pyramidal cells have pyramid-shaped cell bodies with the apex directed towards the cortical surface. From the apex, a thick branching dendrite passes towards the surface where it has an array of fine dendritic branches. An axon arises from the base of the cell and passes into the white matter though, in the case of small superficial cells, the axon may synapse in the deep layers of the cortex. Short dendrites also arise from the edges of the base and ramify laterally. The size of pyramidal cells varies, with the smallest tending to sit superficially. The huge upper motor neurones of the motor cortex, known as Betz cells, are the largest pyramidal cells in the cortex. • Stellate (granule) cells are small neurones with a short vertical axon and several short branching dendrites, giving the cell body the shape of a star, although other shapes have been described. With routine histological methods, the cells look like small granules, giving rise to their alternative name. • Cells of Martinotti are small polygonal cells with a few short dendrites; the axon extends towards the surface and bifurcates to run horizontally, usually in the most superficial layer. • Fusiform cells are spindle-shaped cells oriented at right angles to the surface of the cerebral cortex. The axon arises from the side of the cell body and passes superficially. Dendrites extend from each end of the cell body, branching into deeper and more superficial layers. • Horizontal cells of Cajal are small and spindle-shaped but oriented parallel to the surface. They are the least common cell type and are only found in the most superficial layer, where their axons pass laterally to synapse with the dendrites of pyramidal cells. In addition to neurones, the cortex contains supporting neuroglial cells (astrocytes), oligodendroglia and microglia. The neocortex is arranged into six layers, with the layers differing in neurone morphology, size and population density. They merge with one another, rather than being sharply demarcated. They also vary in thickness and detail from one region of the brain to another. Micrographs (b) and (c) illustrate the typical layered appearance of the cerebral cortex and its layers: I. Plexiform (molecular) layer. The superficial layer contains dendrites and axons of cortical neurones making synapses with one another; nuclei are sparse and are those of neuroglia and horizontal cells of Cajal. II. Outer granular layer. This contains a dense population of small pyramidal cells and stellate cells, admixed with various axons and dendritic connections from deeper layers. III. Pyramidal cell layer. Pyramidal cells of moderate size predominate in this broad layer, the cells increasing in size deeper in the layer. Martinotti cells are also present. IV. Inner granular layer. This layer consists mainly of densely packed stellate cells. V. Ganglionic layer. Large pyramidal cells and smaller numbers of stellate cells and cells of Martinotti make up this layer, its name originating from the huge pyramidal (ganglion) Betz cells of the motor cortex. VI. Multiform cell layer. This is named for the wide variety of differing morphological forms found in this layer. It contains numerous small pyramidal cells and cells of Martinotti as well as stellate cells, especially superficially, and fusiform cells in the deeper part. Dementia Medical conditions with progressive generalised deterioration in brain function, especially higher cortical functions, are called dementia. There are many different forms of dementia with varying genetic components. Alzheimer’s dementia is common, with a prominent age-related incidence, being uncommon in the young and common in the elderly. Alzheimer’s is characterised, amongst other pathological findings, by numerous microscopic cortical lesions called senile plaques. 400Review FIG. 20.18  Cortex  (a) Golgi method (MP) (b) Nissl method (MP) Micrograph (a) shows a part of layer V; a thick section is employed, stained with a heavy metal impregnation technique which demonstrates considerable morphological detail.

The eye and the FIG. 21.1  Taste buds  (a) H&E (MP) (b) H&E (HP) Taste buds, the chemoreceptors for the sense of taste (gustation), are in humans mainly located in the epithelium of the circumvallate papillae of the tongue (see Fig. 13.12), although they are also found scattered in other parts of the tongue, palate, pharynx and epiglottis. In the circumvallate papillae, taste buds face into the deep troughs surrounding the papillae. Serous glands called the glands of von Ebner secrete a serous fluid into the troughs to act as a solvent for taste- provoking substances. The human tongue has approximately 3000 taste buds. The taste bud is a barrel-shaped organ, occupying the full thickness of the epithelium and opening at the surface via the taste pore P. Each taste bud contains about 50 long, spindle- shaped cells which extend from the basement membrane to the taste pore. Classically, two types of cell are described in the taste bud: light gustatory cells and dark supporting or sustentacular cells. A third cell type, the basal cell, is now generally recognised and may constitute the precursor of one or both of the other cell types. Both gustatory and sustentacular cells have long microvilli extending into the taste pore, which contains a glycoprotein substance, thought to be secreted by the sustentacular cells. Ultrastructural studies have shown that non-myelinated nerve fibres are associated with both cell types, but there appears to be a more intimate synapse-like relationship between the nerve fibres and the gustatory cells. Although the gustatory cells are thought to be the taste receptors, the sustentacular cells may also serve some receptor function. Like the oral epithelium, all the cells of the taste bud, which represent highly specialised epithelial cells, are renewed continuously, although the gustatory and sustentacular cells are replaced at different rates. Four taste modalities are recognised: sweet, bitter, acid and salt. Each modality tends to be principally perceived in a specific region of the tongue; however, no structural differences have been demonstrated between taste buds from different areas. The sensations of taste and smell are closely associated, and loss of olfactory sense is accompanied by diminished gustatory perception. a P b 403ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 21: Special sense organs FIG. 21.2  Olfactory receptors  (a) Schematic diagram (b) H&E (HP) The receptors for the sense of smell are located in a modified form of respiratory epithelium called olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity; although extensive in some mammals such as the dog, the olfactory epithelium is restricted to a small area in the roof of the nasal cavity in humans. The olfactory epithelium is very tall pseudostratified columnar in form and contains cells of three types: olfactory receptor cells, sustentacular (supporting epithelial) cells and basal epithelial cells. The olfactory receptor cells are true bipolar neurones (see Fig. 7.2), the cell bodies of which are located in the middle stratum of the olfactory epithelium. A single dendritic process extends from the cell body to the free surface where it terminates as a small swelling, the olfactory knob, which gives rise to about a dozen extremely long modified cilia. These cilia, or olfactory hairs, contain the usual 9 plus 2 arrangement of microtubules in their proximal portion but become thinner distally where they contain variable numbers of single microtubules in different species. The cilia are non-motile and lie flattened against the epithelial surface in the surface mucous layer. The cilia are the sites of interaction between odoriferous substances and the receptor cells. At the basal aspect, each receptor cell gives rise to a single fine non-myelinated axon which penetrates the basement membrane to join the axons of other receptor cells. The bundles of axons pass via about 20 small holes on each side of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to reach the olfactory bulbs of the forebrain where they synapse with second-order sensory neurones. The supporting or sustentacular cells are elongated with their tapered bases resting on the basement membrane. Many long microvilli extend from their luminal surfaces to form a tangled mat with the cilia of the receptor cells. At the luminal surface, the plasma membranes of the sustentacular and receptor cells are bound together by typical junctional complexes J. The functions of the sustentacular cells are poorly understood, but they probably provide mechanical and physiological support for the receptor cells. The basal cells are small conical cells which appear to be stem cells for both olfactory and sustentacular cells. In histological section, it is difficult to distinguish individual cell types within the olfactory epithelium; however, the nuclei of sustentacular cells occupy the uppermost stratum, those of the receptor cells the middle stratum and those of the basal cells lie close to the basement membrane. Note the terminal bar B at the luminal surface, representing junctional complexes; note also the fuzzy surface contour representing the tangled meshwork of microvilli and cilia on the surface. The olfactory epithelium is supported by loose vascular tissue containing bundles of afferent nerve fibres N and numerous serous glands called Bowman’s glands G which produce the watery surface secretions in which odoriferous substances are dissolved. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 B G N b B terminal bar G Bowman’s gland J junctional complex N afferent nerve fibres P taste pore 404The eyeTHE EYE The eye is the highly specialised organ of photoreception, a process which involves the conversion of light energy into nerve action potentials. The photoreceptors are modified dendrites of two types of nerve cells, rod cells and cone cells. The rods are integrated into a system which is recep- tive to light of differing intensity; this is perceived in a form analogous to a black and white photographic image. The cones are of three functional types, receptive to the colours blue, green and red, and constitute a system by which coloured images are seen. The rod and cone receptors and a system of integrating neurones are located in the inner layer of the eye, the retina. The remaining structures of the eye serve to support the retina or to focus images of the visual world upon the retina. In addition, several accessory structures, namely the eyelids, lacrimal gland and conjunctiva, protect the eye from external damage. FIG. 21.3  The eye (illustration opposite)  The eye is made up of three basic layers: the outer corneo- scleral layer, the intermediate uveal layer (uveal tract) and the inner retinal layer. Corneo-scleral layer The corneo-scleral layer forms a tough fibroelastic capsule which supports the eye. The posterior five-sixths, the sclera, is opaque and provides insertion for the extraocular muscles. The anterior one-sixth, the cornea, is transparent and has a smaller radius of curvature than the sclera. The cornea is the principal refracting medium of the eye and roughly focuses an image onto the retina; the focusing power of the cornea depends mainly on the radius of curvature of its external surface. The corneo-scleral junction is known as the limbus and is marked internally and externally by a shallow depression. Running from the junction of the cornea and limbus, the surface of the eye is covered by conjunctiva which is reflected into the eyelids. Uveal layer The middle layer, the uvea or uveal tract, is a highly vascular layer which is made up of three components: the choroid, the ciliary body and the iris. The choroid lies between the sclera and retina in the posterior five-sixths of the eye. It provides support for the retina and is heavily pigmented, thus absorbing light which has passed through the retina. Anteriorly, the choroid merges with the ciliary body, which is a circumferential thickening of the uvea lying beneath the limbus. The ciliary body surrounds the coronal equator of the lens and is attached to it by the suspensory ligament or zonule. The lens is a biconvex transparent structure, the shape of which can be varied to provide fine focus of the corneal image upon the retina. The ciliary body contains smooth muscle, the tone of which controls the shape of the lens via the suspensory ligament. The lens, suspensory ligament and ciliary body divide the eye into a large compartment containing a thick gel called the vitreous body and a compartment part in front containing a watery fluid called the aqueous humor. The iris, the third component of the uvea, forms a diaphragm extending in front of the lens from the ciliary body, so as to incompletely divide the anterior compartment into two chambers; these are known by the terms anterior and posterior chamber. The highly pigmented iris acts as an adjustable diaphragm which regulates the amount of light reaching the retina. The aperture of the iris is called the pupil. The anterior and posterior chambers contain the aqueous humor, which is secreted into the posterior chamber by the ciliary body and circulated through the pupil to drain into a canal at the angle of the anterior chamber, the canal of Schlemm. The aqueous humor is a source of nutrients for the non-vascular lens and cornea and acts as an optical medium which is non-refractive with respect to the cornea. The pressure of aqueous humor maintains the shape of the cornea. The large posterior compartment of the eye contains a specialised connective tissue largely composed of a transparent gel known as the vitreous body. The vitreous body supports the lens and retina from within, as well as providing an optical medium which is non-refractive with respect to the lens. In life, the vitreous body contains a canal which extends from the exit of the optic nerve to the posterior surface of the lens; this hyaloid canal represents the course of the hyaloid artery which supplies the vitreous body during embryological development. The vitreous body and hyaloid canal are rarely preserved in histological preparations. Retinal layer The photosensitive retina forms the inner lining of most of the posterior compartment of the eye and terminates along a scalloped line, the ora serrata, behind the ciliary body. Anterior to the ora serrata, the retinal layer continues as a non- photosensitive epithelial layer which lines the ciliary body and the posterior surface of the iris. The visual axis of the eye passes through a depression in the retina called the fovea which is surrounded by a yellow- pigmented zone, the macula lutea. The fovea is the area of greatest visual acuity. Afferent nerve fibres from the retina converge to form the optic nerve which leaves the eye through a part of the sclera known as the lamina cribrosa. The retina overlying the lamina cribrosa, the optic papilla (optic disc), is devoid of photoreceptors and thus represents a blind spot. Loss of visual acuity Loss of visual acuity, leading to blurring of vision, is common and can have several causes. Certain disorders of the eye cause problems with accommodation such that light is not brought into a correct focus on the retina. For example, ageing is associated with difficulty focusing on objects that are close (presbyopia), due to loss of elasticity of the lens. In other disorders, the normal transparent structures of the eye become opaque and visual acuity is reduced. Diseases of the cornea that cause scarring lead to abnormal opacification and light scattering, reducing visual acuity. Diseases that cause abnormal opacification of the lens (cataracts) lead to loss of visual acuity and, when severe, blindness. The retina may be the seat of several diseases which cause problems with visual acuity. The retina may become detached from the uvea (retinal detachment), leading to loss of light perception in the affected part. Any condition that causes loss of the specialised photoreceptors from the retina causes loss of visual acuity. Common conditions affecting the retina include macular degeneration, in which there is loss of specialised retinal cells, and diabetes mellitus, in which pathology affecting small blood vessels causes retinal damage and cell death. 405ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 21: Special sense organs \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000•\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000• •\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000• \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 •\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 •\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000•\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Inflammatory diseases of the eye The different compartments of the eye can be the focus of specific inflammatory diseases. • Conjunctivitis refers to inflammation of the conjunctival surface of the eye, also involving the lining of the eyelids. • Uveitis describes inflammation of the uveal tract, including the uvea and ciliary body. When uveal inflammation is limited to the iris it is termed iritis. • Inflammation of the sclera is termed scleritis. • Certain diseases cause inflammation of the retina known as retinitis.

CB I C L O FIG. 21.5  Wall of the eye  H&E (HP) The three layers of the wall of the eye are illustrated in this micrograph. The inner photosensitive retina is a multilayered structure, the outermost limit of which is defined by a layer of pigmented epithelial cells, the pigment epithelium P. The choroid Ch is a layer of loose vascular supporting tissue lying between the sclera S externally and the retina R internally. The choroid and retina are separated by a membrane known as Bruch’s membrane which is composed of the basement membranes of the pigmented epithelium of the retina and the endothelium of the choroid capillaries plus intervening layers of collagen and elastin fibres. The blood supply of the uveal layer of the eye is provided by branches of the ophthalmic artery, which penetrates through the sclera. Larger vessels predominate in the superficial aspect of the choroid, with a rich capillary plexus in the deeper aspect providing nourishment for the outer layers of the retina by diffusion across Bruch’s membrane. The choroid contains numerous large, heavily pigmented melanocytes which confer the dense pigmentation characteristic of the choroid. The pigment absorbs light rays passing through the retina and prevents interference due to light reflection. The sclera consists of dense fibroelastic tissue, the fibres of which are arranged in bundles parallel to the surface. This layer contains little ground substance and few fibroblasts. The sclera varies in thickness, being thickest posteriorly and thinnest at the coronal equator of the globe. P Ch S R 407ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 21: Special sense organs FIG. 21.6  Retina  (a) Schematic diagram (b) H&E (HP) The retina is made up of three cell types: neurones, pigmented epithelial cells and neurone support cells. The neurones are divided into three functional groups: photoreceptor cells (rod cells and cone cells), the cells of afferent fibres passing in the optic nerve and a group of neurones interposed between the first two types which integrate sensory input from the photoreceptors before transmission to the cerebral cortex. The integrating neurones are further subdivided into three types: bipolar cells, horizontal cells and amacrine cells. Histologically, the retina is traditionally divided into 10 distinct histological layers, as shown in the micrograph; the distribution of the different cell types being illustrated in a highly schematic manner in the diagram. The outermost layer (1) consists of the pigmented epithelial cells forming a single layer resting on Bruch’s membrane, which separates them from the choroid. The next layer is the photoreceptor layer, made up of the rod and cone processes (2) with a thin eosinophilic structure known as the outer limiting membrane (3) separating them from a layer of densely packed nuclei described as the outer nuclear layer (4). The outer nuclear layer contains the cell bodies of the rod and cone photoreceptors. The almost featureless layer next to this is known as the outer plexiform layer (5) and contains synaptic connections between the short axons of the photoreceptor cells and integrating neurones, the cell bodies of which lie in the inner nuclear layer (6). In the inner plexiform layer (7), the integrating neurones make synaptic connections with dendrites of neurones whose axons form the optic tract. The cell bodies of the optic tract neurones (retinal ganglion cells) comprise the ganglion cell layer (8). Internal to this is the layer of afferent fibres (9) passing towards the optic disc to form the optic nerve. Finally, the inner limiting membrane (10) demarcates the innermost aspect of the retina from the vitreous body VB. Note in the diagram that only bipolar cells are represented in the integrating cell layer; this layer also contains the cell bodies of the horizontal and amacrine cells as illustrated in Fig. 21.8. Note that light impinging on the retina passes through many layers before reaching the photoreceptor cells. Towards the left of the diagram there is an extremely elongated support cell extending between inner and outer limiting membranes; it has its nucleus in the same layer as the integrating neurones, the inner nuclear layer. These cells, known as Müller cells, are analogous to the neuroglia of the central nervous system and have long cytoplasmic processes which embrace and sometimes even encircle the retinal neurones, filling all the intervening spaces. Müller cells provide structural support and may also mediate the transfer of essential metabolites such as glucose to the retinal neurones. The outer limiting membrane is not a true membrane but merely represents the line of intercellular junctions between Müller cells and the photoreceptor cells (shown diagrammatically in Fig. 21.7). In contrast, the inner limiting membrane represents the basement membrane of the Müller cells resting on the vitreous body. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 10 VB 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 b C cornea CB ciliary body Ch choroid I iris L lens O optic nerve P pigment epithelium R retina S sclera VB vitreous body 408The eye FIG. 21.7  Retinal photoreceptors  (a) H&E (HP) (b) Schematic diagram The rod and cone photoreceptor layer of the retina is shown at very high magnification in micrograph (a), the cell bodies of the rod and cone cells lying internal to the outer limiting membrane M. Peripherally, the rods and cones mingle with long microvilli extending from the pigmented epithelial cells P. As shown in the diagram (b), the rod photoreceptors are long slender bipolar cells, the single dendrite of each cell extending beyond the outer limiting membrane as the rod proper. The rod proper consists of inner and outer segments connected by a thin eccentric strand of cytoplasm containing nine microtubule doublets, similar to those of a cilium but without the inner pair of microtubules. The inner segment contains a prominent Golgi apparatus and many mitochondria. The outer segment has a regular cylindrical shape and contains a stack of flattened membranous discs which incorporate the pigment rhodopsin (visual purple). The membranous discs are continuously shed from the end of each rod and phagocytosed by the pigmented epithelial cells. The discs are continuously replaced from the inner part of the outer segment. In essence, the transduction process involves the interaction of light with rhodopsin molecules which promotes a conformational change in the rhodopsin molecule, thus initiating an action potential. The action potential then passes inwards along the dendrite and axon to the layer of integrating neurones. Cones are similar in basic structure to the rods, but they differ in several details. The outer segment of the cone is a long conical structure, about two-thirds the length of a rod, and contains a similar number of even more flattened membranous discs. Unlike the situation in the rods, however, the disc membrane is continuous with the plasma membrane so that, on one side, the spaces between the discs are continuous with the extracellular environment. The discs are not shed, although the tips of the cones are invested by processes of pigmented epithelial cells. The cones contain visual pigments similar to rhodopsin, receptive to blue, green and red light, and the mechanism of transduction is probably similar. The bodies of the cone cells are generally continuous with the inner segment of the cone proper, without an intervening dendritic process, and the nuclei of cone cells thus form a row immediately deep to the outer limiting membrane. As seen in micrograph (a), the pigmented epithelial cells are cuboidal in shape with the nuclei located basally towards Bruch’s membrane B. Apically, the cells are crammed with melanin granules, numerous mitochondria and lipofuscin, a residual product of phagocytosis (see Fig. 1.25). The pigmented cell microvilli, which are 5 to 7 µm long, extend between the photoreceptors and, with electron microscopy, are seen to contain membranous lamellae similar to those in the rod outer segments; these appear to disintegrate as they pass deeper into the pigmented cells. In addition to phagocytosis, the pigmented epithelial cells provide structural and metabolic support for the rods and cones and also absorb light, thus preventing back reflection.

This junction can be the site of separation of the retinal layers in the condition of retinal detachment. Symptoms include loss of vision corresponding to the detached part of the retina described as ‘like a dark curtain’ in the visual field. If the retina can be surgically re-attached then vision can be restored. 409ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 21: Special sense organs FIG. 21.8  Neuronal interconnections in the retina  This diagram demonstrates the basic pattern of neuronal interconnections between the photoreceptor cells and the afferent neurones of the optic tract. The interneurones consist of three basic cell types, bipolar cells, horizontal cells and amacrine cells, their cell bodies all being located in the inner nuclear layer (along with those of the supporting Müller cells). Bipolar cells, the most numerous of the integrating neurones, in general make direct connections between one or more photoreceptors and one or more optic tract neurones, as well as with horizontal and amacrine cells. Horizontal cells have several short processes and one long process, the terminal branches of each making lateral connections between adjacent and more distant rods and cones in the outer plexiform layer. Horizontal cells also synapse with the dendrites of bipolar cells. The amacrine cells have numerous dendrites which make connections with bipolar and optic tract neurones in the inner plexiform layer, as well as making occasional feedback connections with photoreceptors in the outer plexiform layer. As seen in Fig. 21.7(b) opposite, the axons of the rod photoreceptors terminate in spherical processes into which are invaginated their small number of synaptic connections. In contrast, the cone photoreceptors have a flattened pedicle which accommodates hundreds of intercellular contacts. In all, there are more than 100 million rods and 6 million cones. The cones are particularly dense in the macula and the immediately surrounding area and, in the fovea itself, the photoreceptors are almost exclusively cones. The density of both rods and cones diminishes towards the retinal periphery. The foveal cones have an almost one-to-one relationship with optic tract neurones, giving maximal visual discrimination. There are only about 1 million optic tract neurones and, the more peripheral the photoreceptors, the greater the number of photoreceptors synapsing with each optic tract neurone. This is consistent with the main function of the more peripheral receptors (predominantly rods), which is for determination of light and dark, rather than fine two-point discrimination. \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 ••\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 •\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000•\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 •\u0000\u0000•\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Retinal degenerations The retina is affected by several diseases classed as retinal degenerations. These lead to loss of specialised photoreceptor cells and progressive loss of visual acuity, often causing total blindness. Macular degeneration is a condition which is mainly seen in people over the age of 60. It is one of the commonest causes of loss of visual acuity in the elderly. Abnormal masses of lipid-rich material accumulate in the choroid (drusen), leading to failure of support for photoreceptor cells. The macula is the retinal region serving fine-detailed colour vision in the centre of the visual field (Fig. 21.9). Loss of receptor cells in this area leads to severe visual impairment, but peripheral vision served by rods is preserved. Retinitis pigmentosa is the name given to a family of inherited degenerative diseases of the retina. There are several genetic forms of disease which all cause death of specialised retinal elements. In the commonest forms, there is preferential degeneration of rod cells, leading to gradual loss of peripheral vision, sometimes described as ‘tunnel vision’ as the macula, composed of cones, is affected last. B Bruch’s membrane M outer limiting membrane P pigment epithelial cell 410The eyeFIG. 21.9  Fovea  Masson trichrome (HP) The fovea is a conical depression in the retina, corresponding to the point where the visual axis of the cornea and lens meets the retina and lying about 4 mm lateral and slightly inferior to the exit of the optic nerve fibres at the optic disc. Consequently, the fovea is the area subject to the least refractory distortion. To complement this, the foveal retina is modified to obtain the maximum photoreceptor sensitivity and is thus the area of the retina with the greatest visual discrimination; however, its function is poor in conditions of low light intensity. Surrounding the fovea is an ovoid yellow area about 1 mm wide called the macula lutea. As seen in this micrograph, at the fovea the inner layers of the retina are flattened laterally so as to present the least barrier to light reaching the photoreceptors. Retinal blood vessels are absent at the fovea, as can be readily seen with the ophthalmoscope, and the brownish colour of the choroidal melanin shows through the much attenuated retina. At the fovea, the photoreceptors are almost exclusively cones which are elongated and closely packed (approximately 100 000 cones are contained in the fovea). Neuronal interconnections in the bipolar cell layer provide for a one-to-one ratio of these cones to optic nerve fibres, which means that each foveal photoreceptor is individually represented at the visual cortex. FIG. 21.10  Optic nerve  H&E (LP) The afferent fibres from the retina converge at a point medial to the fovea, the optic papilla or optic disc, fibres from the lateral quadrants sweeping above and below the macula to avoid the fovea. The fibres then penetrate the sclera S through the lamina cribrosa to form the optic nerve ON. Note the thickness of the optic tract layer overlying the disc and the absence of photoreceptor cells from the optic papilla, which is thus a blind spot on the retina. In their course across the retina, the afferent fibres are not myelinated as this would obstruct light passing to the photoreceptors. Myelination commences at the optic disc, which imparts the white colour seen with the ophthalmoscope. The optic nerve and retina develop embryologically as an outgrowth of the primitive forebrain and thus the optic nerve is invested by meninges. The dura mater D becomes continuous with its developmental equivalent, the sclera, while the pia-arachnoid P continues into the eye as the uveal tract U. The main blood supply of the retina is provided by the central artery of the retina A, a branch of the ophthalmic artery. This divides at the optic disc into four branches supplying the quadrants of the retina. These vessels course within the optic nerve fibre layer, breaking up into a rich capillary network which drains back into a venous system, closely following the course of the arterial supply. The vessels are confined to the optic nerve fibre layer and more superficial layers are dependent on diffusion, the most peripheral retinal layers being supplied likewise from the choroid.

As seen in micrograph (a), the ciliary body CB represents the forward continuation of the choroid layer of the uveal tract of the posterior five-sixths of the wall of the eye and, like it, is highly vascular and contains a considerable amount of dark-staining melanin pigment. Anteriorly, it is continuous with the third component of the uveal tract, the iris I, passing in front of the lens L. As seen in micrograph (c), the ciliary body is lined with a double layer of cuboidal epithelium E. The deep layer is highly pigmented and represents a forward continuation of the pigmented epithelial layer of the retina, while the surface layer, which is not pigmented, is a non-photosensitive forward extension of the receptor layer of the retina. The ciliary body is attached to the coronal equator of the lens by the suspensory ligaments SL which consist of extremely fine strands composed of the protein fibrillin. Tension in the suspensory ligament tends to flatten the lens which, in the relaxed state, assumes a more globular shape. The bulk of the ciliary body consists of smooth muscle M arranged in such a manner that, when it contracts, tension upon the suspensory ligament is reduced, thus permitting the lens to assume a more convex shape. This mechanism permits fine focusing of images already roughly focused upon the retina by the cornea. The ciliary muscle is innervated by parasympathetic nerve fibres. From that part of the ciliary body exposed to the angle of the posterior chamber PC, there project a number of branching epithelial folds called ciliary processes C with a supporting tissue core rich in fenestrated capillaries. The ciliary processes are responsible for the continuous production of aqueous humor, which then circulates into the anterior chamber via the pupil. Aqueous humor is continuously reabsorbed into the canal of Schlemm CS seen at the base of the irido-corneal angle of the anterior chamber ICA in micrograph (a). Aqueous humor is a clear watery fluid, somewhat similar in composition to cerebrospinal fluid and hypotonic with respect to plasma. The production of aqueous humor is an active process, mediated by the two epithelial layers lining the ciliary processes. Balanced rates of secretion and reabsorption of aqueous humor result in the maintenance of a constant intraocular pressure of about 15 mmHg which stabilises the lens and cornea. The flow of aqueous humor also provides for a continuous exchange of metabolites with the cells of the avascular cornea and lens. L SL I CB ICA CS a SL C M C PCb E C c Glaucoma If the drainage of aqueous humor is obstructed and the ciliary body continues to secrete, this may lead to a sustained increase in the intraocular pressure termed glaucoma. If untreated this causes damage to the neural retina and can cause blindness. • Some forms of glaucoma are inherited and are associated with abnormal filtration of aqueous humor at the canal of Schlemm. • Any disease which causes inflammation or scarring of the iridocorneal angle can lead to glaucoma by blocking the canal of Schlemm. • Proliferation of blood vessels in the iris root, usually as a response to poor blood supply to the retina, as may happen in patients with diabetes, may block aqueous drainage. 412The eye FIG. 21.12  Iris  (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (MP) The iris is the most anterior part of the uveal layer of the eye. It arises from the ciliary body and forms a diaphragm in front of the lens, dividing the anterior compartment of the eye into posterior PC and anterior chambers AC which communicate via the pupil. The pupillary edge of the iris rests on the anterior surface of the lens in life. The main mass of the iris consists of loose, highly vascular tissue which is pigmented due to the presence of numerous melanocytes scattered in the stroma. The anterior surface of the iris is irregular and consists of a discontinuous layer of fibroblasts and melanocytes; in the fetus, the surface is lined by endothelial cells but these disappear during early childhood. In contrast, the posterior surface is relatively smooth and is lined by epithelium which is derived embryologically as a continuation of the two layers which line the surface of the ciliary body. The surface layer, non-pigmented in the ciliary body, becomes heavily pigmented in the iris such that the individual cells are completely obscured. The deep layer, pigmented in the ciliary body, is transformed in the iris into lightly pigmented myoepithelial cells which constitute the radially orientated dilator pupillae muscle DP of the iris. Even at high magnification (b), these myoepithelial cells are difficult to distinguish. The constrictor muscle of the pupil (constrictor pupillae) CP consists of a band of circumferentially oriented smooth muscle fibres situated in the stroma near to the free edge of the iris. Like the smooth muscle of the ciliary body, the constrictor pupillae is innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system, whereas the myoepithelial cells of the dilator pupillae are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. The colour of the iris depends on the amount of pigment in the stroma, the amount of pigment in the posterior epithelial layer being relatively constant between individuals. Blue eyes contain little pigment, whereas brown eyes have plentiful stromal pigment. AC CP PC a DP CP b FIG. 21.13  Canal of Schlemm  H&E (MP) The canal of Schlemm CS is a circumferential canal lined by endothelium which is situated in the inner aspect of the corneal margin C, immediately adjacent to the angle of the anterior chamber AC. At the angle of the anterior chamber, there is a meshwork of fine collagenous trabeculae T lined by endothelium; aqueous humor percolates through the spaces between the trabeculae before reaching the canal of Schlemm. There is no direct communication between the trabecular spaces and the canal of Schlemm and thus reabsorption of aqueous humor involves passage across two layers of endothelium and intervening supporting tissue. The canal of Schlemm drains via minute channels through the sclera into the episcleral venous system, a pressure gradient being maintained to prevent reflux of blood. Note the close relationship between the root of the iris I and the canal of Schlemm. The smooth muscle of the ciliary body CB is easily seen in this micrograph.

The lens cells are highly modified epithelial cells, derived embryologically from ectoderm which forms a depression, the lens pit, overlying the embryonic optic vesicle. With further development, the lens pit becomes deeper, its margins fusing to form the lens vesicle which becomes detached from the surface and sinks deeper to become enveloped by the growing optic vesicle; at this stage, the lens vesicle merely consists of a single layer of epithelial cells. The posterior cells of the lens vesicle now become greatly elongated anteroposteriorly, filling the central cavity of the vesicle. This stage of development is shown in micrograph (a), showing the junction J between posterior and anterior cells of the former lens vesicle. Note the developing cornea C and retina R. The lens cells in the central anteroposterior axis then undergo maturation as seen in micrograph (b), losing their nuclei to become known as lens fibres. Proliferation of the cells at the lens equator E adds further fibres to the central mass, the growth process continuing at a slow rate even into old age. When fully developed, the lens substance consists of 2000 to 3000 anucleate fibres, each stretching between anterior and posterior poles of the lens. The fibres have the shape of extremely elongated six-sided prisms, the more peripheral fibres curving to follow the anteroposterior surface contour of the lens. The lens fibres are packed with proteins called crystallins and the cell membranes of adjacent fibres are fused, leaving little intervening extracellular substance. The whole lens is enveloped by a thick epithelial basement membrane forming the lens capsule, which is connected via the suspensory ligament to the ciliary body. The anterior lens surface is covered by a single layer of cuboidal cells which retain their nuclei, this layer merging with the residual proliferative cells at the equatorial margin of the lens. This cell layer lies deep to the capsule and is absent posteriorly. Micrograph (c) shows part of the mature lens, including the anterior cuboidal epithelium A and lens capsule CA. The lens substance is particularly prone to artefactual distortion during histological preparation. Micrograph (d) shows the equatorial region of the lens and nearby ciliary processes CPR. Note the anterior epithelial layer A and nuclei N in the more recently formed peripheral fibres. R CJ a E E b A CA c A CPR N d Cataracts The normal lens is translucent and elastic. If there is damage to the lens fibres or if the normally translucent crystallin proteins aggregate, the lens becomes opaque and light is either diffused or blocked. The lens opacity is called a cataract. Cataracts can occur due to ageing, trauma to the lens, inflammatory diseases within the eye or in response to some metabolic diseases. 414The eye FIG. 21.15  Cornea  (a) H&E (MP) (b) H&E (HP) (c) H&E (HP) The cornea is the thick transparent portion of the corneo-scleral layer enclosing the anterior one-sixth of the eye. The fixed convexity of the external surface provides the principal mechanism for focusing images upon the retina. Micrograph (a) shows the full thickness of the cornea, while micrographs (b) and (c) show the superficial and deep aspects at higher magnification. The cornea is an avascular structure consisting of five layers. The outer surface is lined by stratified non-keratinised squamous epithelium EP about six cells thick. This epithelium rests on a thin basal lamina, supported by a thick specialised layer of corneal stroma known as Bowman’s membrane BM, which is particularly prominent in humans. The bulk of the cornea, the substantia propria or stroma SP, consists of a highly regular form of dense collagenous tissue forming thin lamellae. Fibroblasts with elongated nuclei and barely visible cytoplasm termed keratocytes are scattered in the ground substance between the lamellae. The inner surface of the cornea is lined by a layer of flattened endothelial cells En which are supported by a very thick basement membrane known as Descemet’s membrane DM. The corneal endothelium is highly active in pumping fluid from the substantia propria, preventing excessive hydration which would result in the cornea becoming opaque. The cornea is sustained by diffusion of metabolites from the aqueous humor and the blood vessels of the limbus; some oxygen is derived directly from the external environment. There is a rich innervation by free nerve endings, making the cornea very pain sensitive. EP BM SP DM En a BM EP b DM Enc Corneal disease The cornea plays a vital role in refracting light into the eye. Although the endothelial cell layer looks inconspicuous, it is highly active in pumping fluid out of the corneal stroma. If the endothelial cell layer is damaged or cell numbers are reduced as happens with disease or age, then this fluid pumping function is impaired. Clinically, there is blurring of vision as the corneal stroma becomes waterlogged. The corneal epithelium develops areas of separation from Bowman’s membrane, forming small bullae which are very painful and can lead to ulceration of the surface epithelium. Diseases which cause inflammation of the cornea (e.g. viral infection by Herpes zoster) can lead to loss of Bowman’s membrane and replacement of the normal highly ordered collagen of the corneal stroma by haphazardly arranged collagenous scar tissue. Corneal scars are not transparent and produce an opacity that interferes with light transmission, so causing poor visual acuity. If the curvature of the cornea becomes abnormal, there may be loss of visual acuity because light is not focused correctly. An unusual condition called keratoconus can develop where the cornea develops a conical profile due to remodeling of the corneal collagen. A damaged cornea may be replaced by a transplant. 415ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 21: Special sense organs FIG. 21.16  Conjunctiva  H&E (MP) The conjunctiva is the epithelium which covers the exposed part of the sclera and inner surface of the eyelids. It is stratified columnar in form and, for a stratified epithelium, is unusual in that it contains goblet cells in the surface layers. Melanocytes are found in the basal layer. The conjunctival mucous secretions contribute to the protective layer on the exposed surface of the eye and allow the eyelids to move freely over the eye. Beneath the conjunctival epithelium is loose vascular supporting tissue. FIG. 21.17  Lacrimal gland  H&E (MP) The lacrimal gland is responsible for the secretion of tears, a watery fluid containing the antibacterial enzyme lysozyme and electrolytes of similar concentration to plasma. Histologically, the lacrimal glands are similar to the salivary glands in the lobular structure and compound tubulo-acinar form of the secretory units. The secretory cells have the typical appearance of serous (protein-secreting) cells, with basally located nuclei and strongly stained granular cytoplasm. Each gland drains via a dozen or more small ducts into the superior fornix. Tears drain to the inner aspect of the eye and then into the nasal cavity via the nasolacrimal duct. FIG. 21.18  Eyelid  H&E (LP) Each eyelid consists of a dense fibroelastic plate, the tarsus or tarsal plate T, covered externally by thin highly folded skin S and, on the internal aspect, by smooth conjunctiva C. The skin contains scattered fine hair follicles F, and the underlying supporting tissue is extremely loose and devoid of fat. Skeletal muscle M of the orbicularis oculi (and levator palpebrae in the upper eyelid) lies immediately superficial to the tarsal plate and is separated from it by a layer of supporting tissue A which, in the upper lid, represents a forward continuation of the sub-aponeurotic layer of the scalp. The clinical importance of this is that blood or inflammatory exudates collecting above the scalp aponeurosis may track forward into the superficial planes of the eyelid; being extremely lax, this area may become markedly swollen. This supporting tissue layer also contains the sensory nerves of the eyelid. Within the tarsal plate lie some 12 to 30 tarsal (Meibomian) glands G, oriented vertically and opening at the free margin of the eyelid via minute foramina. These glands are modified sebaceous glands, each consisting of a long central duct into which open numerous sebaceous acini. Associated with the eyelashes E are sebaceous glands known as the glands of Zeis and modified apocrine sweat glands known as the glands of Moll. Together, the glands of the eyelid produce an oily layer which is thought to cover the tear layer, thereby preventing evaporation of the tears.

Structurally, the system may be divided into three parts, the external ear, the middle ear and the internal ear. The specific sensory receptors for both movement and sound are situated in a membranous structure located in the internal ear, while the external and middle ear are concerned with reception, transmission and amplification of incoming sound waves. FIG. 21.19  The ear (caption opposite) 417ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 21: Special sense organs FIG. 21.19  The ear (illustration opposite)  The main structural elements of the vestibulocochlear apparatus are illustrated in this diagram. External ear The external ear is responsible for reception of sound waves which are funnelled onto the ear drum (tympanic membrane). It consists of the auricle (pinna), a modified cone-shaped structure composed of elastic cartilage covered by skin, which converges onto the external auditory meatus (canal). Elastic cartilage also forms the wall of the outer third of the canal, while the inner two-thirds of the canal lie in the petrous part of the temporal bone. The canal is lined by hairy skin containing sebaceous glands and modified apocrine glands which secrete a waxy material called cerumen. Middle ear The middle ear is an air-filled cavity, the tympanic cavity, located in the petrous temporal bone and separated from the external auditory canal by the tympanic membrane. Sound waves impinging on the tympanic membrane are converted into mechanical vibrations which are then amplified by a system of levers made up of three small bones called ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) and transmitted to the fluid-filled inner ear cavity. The ossicles articulate with one another via synovial joints and the malleus and incus pivot on tiny ligaments which are attached to the wall of the middle ear cavity. Small slips of muscle, the tensor tympani and stapedius, pass to the midpoint of the tympanic membrane and stapes bone, respectively, and damp down excessive vibrations which might otherwise damage the delicate auditory apparatus. The middle ear cavity communicates anteriorly with the nasopharynx via the auditory (Eustachian) tube, which permits equalisation of pressure changes with the external environment. Posteriorly, the middle ear cavity communicates with numerous interconnected air spaces which lighten the mass of the mastoid part of the temporal bone. The whole of the middle ear and mastoid cavities are lined by simple squamous or cuboidal epithelium. Internal ear The internal ear consists of an interconnected fluid-filled membranous labyrinth lying within a labyrinth of spaces of complementary shape in the temporal bone (the osseous labyrinth). The membranous labyrinth is bound down to the walls of the osseous labyrinth in various places but, in the main, is separated from the bony walls by a fluid-filled space. The fluid within the membranous labyrinth is known as endolymph and the fluid in the surrounding perimembranous space is known as perilymph. The perimembranous space is directly connected with the subarachnoid space and, like the latter, is crossed by delicate fibrous strands and lined by squamous epithelium; the perilymphatic fluid is thus similar in composition to cerebrospinal fluid. In contrast, the membranous labyrinth is a closed system with a sac, the endolymphatic sac, lying in the subdural space of the underlying brain. The membranous labyrinth is lined by a simple epithelium except in the endolymphatic sac, where the cells are columnar with morphological features suggesting that this is the site of endolymph absorption. The osseous labyrinth may be divided into three main areas: • The vestibule. The central space of the osseous labyrinth is called the vestibule; it gives rise to three semicircular canals posteriorly and to the cochlea anteriorly. The vestibule contains two components of the membranous labyrinth, the utricle and the saccule, which are connected by a short Y-shaped duct from which arises the endolymphatic duct. The walls of the utricle and saccule each contain a specialised area of sensory receptor cells known as a macula (see Fig. 21.27) from which axons pass into the vestibular nerve as part of sensory inputs to maintain equilibrium. Laterally, the vestibule is separated from the middle ear cavity by a thin bony plate containing two fenestrations or windows. The oval window is occluded by the base of the stapes bone and its surrounding annular ligament whereby vibrations are transmitted to the perilymph from the tympanic membrane via the ossicle chain. The round window is closed by a membrane similar to the tympanic membrane and is thus sometimes described as the secondary tympanic membrane. This membrane permits vibrations, which have passed the sensory receptors for sound, to be dissipated. • The semicircular canals. Three semicircular canals arise from the posterior aspect of the vestibule, two being disposed in vertical planes at right angles to one another and the other in a near-horizontal plane. Within each semicircular canal is a semicircular membranous duct filled with endolymph and continuous at both ends with the utricle; near one end of each semicircular membranous duct is a dilated area called the ampulla. In each ampulla, there is a ridge called the crista ampullaris (see Fig. 21.28) containing sensory receptors with axons converging on the vestibular nerve. Together with the receptors of the maculae of the utricle and saccule, these receptors help maintain balance and equilibrium. • The cochlea. The cochlea occupies a conical spiral-shaped space in the temporal bone, extending from the anterior aspect of the vestibule. The membranous component of the cochlea arises from the saccule and spirals upwards, with its blind end attached at the apex of the osseous space. The membranous canal is triangular in cross-section and attached to the bony walls of the cochlea in such a manner as to divide the osseous space into three spiral compartments (see Fig. 21.24). The middle compartment, the scala media, contains endolymph and the upper and lower compartments contain perilymph. At the base of the cochlea, the upper perilymph compartment is directly continuous with the perilymph of the vestibule and via this space, called the scala vestibuli, vibrations pass through the perilymph towards the apex of the cochlea. At the apex, the scala vestibuli becomes continuous with the lower perilymphatic space of the cochlear spiral via a minute hole called the helicotrema. This lower space terminates at the secondary tympanic membrane covering the round window and ‘spent’ vibrations are thus dissipated; the lower perilymphatic space is therefore known as the scala tympani. The sensory receptors for sound are located in a spiral-shaped structure known as the organ of Corti, shown in detail in Fig. 21.25. 418The ear FIG. 21.20  The ear  H&E (LP) This micrograph shows a horizontal section through the vestibulo-cochlear apparatus which lies within the temporal bone B. The tympanic membrane TM can be seen, stretched between the tympanic plate of the temporal bone anteriorly and the lateral part of the petrous temporal bone posteriorly, dividing the external auditory meatus EAM from the cavity of the middle ear ME. Part of one of the ossicles O, the handle of the malleus, can be seen attached to the inner aspect of the tympanic membrane. From the anterior aspect of the middle ear chamber, the auditory canal (Eustachian tube) AC passes forwards towards the nasopharynx; in the mastoid part of the temporal bone, there are numerous irregular mastoid air spaces MAS. Near the centre of the field is the vestibule of the inner ear V, containing two delicate membranous structures, the utricle U and saccule S, more anteriorly. Two of the semicircular canals SC can be identified deep in the posterior part of the petrous temporal bone. Immediately posterior to the middle ear cavity, the facial nerve FN is seen in transverse section as it passes inferiorly; just medial to it lies the stapedius muscle SM. Anterior to the vestibule, the conical spiral of the cochlea Co has been cut in longitudinal section through its central bony axis. From the base of the cochlea, the vestibulo-auditory (vestibulo-cochlear) nerve VAN passes towards the brainstem BS, behind which the cerebellum is easily recognisable. SC MAS FN SM O TM ME B Co VAN S U V B BS AC EAM FIG. 21.21  External auditory meatus  H&E (MP) The external auditory meatus is the canal leading from the auricle to the tympanic membrane. The wall of the outer third is formed by elastic cartilage, whereas the inner two-thirds is formed by the temporal bone. The canal is lined by skin which is devoid of the usual dermal papillae and closely bound down to the underlying cartilage or bone by a dense collagenous dermis. The skin of the outer third (as shown here) has fine hairs and the dermis contains numerous coiled tubular ceruminous glands G which secrete wax (cerumen) and which represent specialised apocrine glands. The ceruminous glands open directly onto the skin surface or into the sebaceous glands associated with hair follicles F. The meatal hairs provide protection from foreign bodies while the cerumen protects the skin of the external meatus from moisture and infection.

With the exception of a small triangular area superiorly, the pars flaccida, the membrane is tense (pars tensa), being firmly attached to the surrounding bone by a fibrocartilaginous ring. The handle of the malleus is attached to the centre of the membrane, the chain of ossicles pulling the membrane slightly inwards. The tympanic membrane is made up of three layers: an external cuticular layer, an intermediate fibrous layer and an inner mucous layer. The cuticular layer C consists of thin hairless skin, the epidermis being only about 10 cells thick and the basal layer being flat and devoid of the usual epidermal ridges. The thin dermis contains plump fibroblasts and a fine vascular network. The intermediate fibrous layer Fi consists of an outer layer of fibres radiating from the centre of the membrane towards the circumference and an inner layer of fibres disposed circumferentially at the periphery. These fibres contain a large amount of type II and type III collagen and a small amount of type I collagen, representing a distinct composition especially adapted for the function of the tympanic membrane. The inner mucous layer M represents a continuation of the modified respiratory-type mucous membrane lining the middle ear cavity, but in this situation it is merely a single layer of cuboidal cells devoid of cilia and goblet cells. The underlying lamina propria is thin with a blood supply separate from that of the dermis of the cuticular layer. A similar modified respiratory-type mucosa invests the ossicles, small muscles and nerves exposed to the middle ear cavity. The ossicles consist of compact bone CB formed by endochondral ossification, which accounts for the cartilage Ca seen in this specimen from a kitten. Note also the tensor tympani muscle Mu. Mu Ca CB Fi C M FIG. 21.23  Auditory (Eustachian) canal  H&E (HP) The auditory canal connects the cavity of the middle ear with the nasopharynx and allows for equalisation of air pressure between the middle ear and the external environment. From the middle ear, the tube first passes through bone, but towards the pharynx, the wall is supported on two sides by cartilage and on the remaining two sides by fibrous tissue. The tube is lined by typical pseudostratified respiratory epithelium with numerous goblet cells, particularly towards the pharyngeal end. The salpingo-pharyngeus, tensor palati and levator veli palati muscles are connected to the fibrocartilaginous part of the tube, causing it to dilate during swallowing. Conductive deafness Conductive deafness is caused by disorders that interfere with the conduction of sound through the outer and middle ear, affecting hearing before the sound reaches the cochlea. • A foreign body or wax in the external canal are common causes of impaired hearing. • Inflammation affecting the middle ear can result in secretions building up within the middle ear cavity (otitis media) which usually resolves with appropriate therapy. • Otosclerosis is an inherited disease where the ossicles fuse together, preventing conduction of sound. Surgery can re-establish conduction and restore hearing. 420The ear ST SM SV G G G G SV SM ST a FIG. 21.24  Cochlea (illustration (b) and caption opposite) (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (LP) 421ORGAN SYSTEMS n Chapter 21: Special sense organs FIG. 21.24  Cochlea (illustration (a) opposite)  (a) H&E (LP) (b) H&E (LP) The cochlea is the component of the internal ear which contains the auditory sense organ. The conical spiral-shaped form of the cochlea can be visualised in micrograph (a) which shows a cochlea cut in a plane of section which includes its long bony axis. Note that the cavity in the petrous temporal bone is reminiscent of the space inside a conical snail shell. The cochlea has two-and-a-half full turns; in this section, five separate cross-sections of the cochlea can be seen, each turn of the spiral being separated from the next by a thin plate of bone. A corkscrew-like bony structure, the modiolus, forms the central axis of the cochlea. Each turn of the cochlear canal can be seen to be divided into three compartments, shown at higher magnification in micrograph (b). The central compartment, the scala media SM, is roughly triangular in cross-section, with the apex attached to a spicule of bone spiralling outwards from the modiolus and known as the osseous spiral lamina O. Above the free edge of the osseous spiral lamina is a thickened mass of tissue known as the spiral limbus SL. The base of the scala media is thickened and attached to the outer wall of the cochlea. The membrane making up the walls of the scala media represents that part of the membranous labyrinth extending up into the cochlea from the saccule and the scala media is thus filled with endolymph. Above the scala media is the scala vestibuli SV, originating in the vestibule near the oval window and the base of the stapes; vibrations are conducted towards the apex of the cochlea in the perilymph of the scala vestibuli. Below the scala media is the perilymphatic space which spirals down from the apex to the secondary tympanic membrane, the scala tympani ST. The membrane separating the scala media and the scala tympani, known as the basilar membrane BM, supports the organ of Corti which contains the auditory receptor cells; the organ of Corti is described in detail in Fig. 21.25. The cells of the organ of Corti are derived from the simple epithelium lining the membranous labyrinth which, embryologically, is of ectodermal origin. The basilar membrane is composed of fibrous tissue. Axially, it is attached to the osseous spiral lamina and laterally to the spiral ligament SLig, which consists of a marked thickening of the endosteum of the lateral wall of the cochlear canal. The thickened outer wall of the scala media is highly vascular and lined by a stratified epithelium; this area, known as the stria vascularis SVasc, is responsible for maintaining the correct ionic composition of endolymph. The membrane between the scala media and scala vestibuli, the vestibular (Reissner’s) membrane VM, is composed of extremely delicate fibrous tissue lined by simple squamous epithelium on both sides. The scala vestibuli and scala tympani are lined by a simple unspecialised squamous epithelium of mesodermal origin. In micrograph (b), bundles of afferent nerve fibres N can be seen arising from the base of the organ of Corti and converging towards the spiral ganglion G in the modiolus at the base of the spiral lamina. These ganglion cells represent the cell bodies of bipolar sensory neurones and their proximal axons form the auditory component of the eighth cranial nerve (see Fig. 21.26).

The organ of Corti lies in the scala media SM, supported on the basilar membrane. The basilar membrane consists of a thin sheet of fibrous tissue stretched between the osseous spiral lamina O of the modiolus and the spiral ligament SLig laterally; its undersurface, exposed to the scala tympani, is lined by a simple epithelium. The basilar membrane is thinnest at the base of the cochlea and becomes progressively thicker as it spirals towards the apex. The organ of Corti consists of two basic types of cells, sensory (hair) cells and support cells of several different types, including the inner and outer pillar cells and inner and outer phalangeal cells. At the centre of the organ is a triangular- shaped canal, the inner tunnel or tunnel of Corti T, bounded on each side by a single row of tall columnar cells called pillar cells. Each pillar cell contains a dense bundle (pillar) of microtubules and the pillars on either side of the tunnel of Corti converge at the surface and then curve laterally to form a thin, hood-like structure containing small fenestrations. The cell bodies of the pillar cells lie in the acute angles formed by the pillars, and the basilar membrane at the floor of the tunnel. On the inner aspect of the inner row of pillar cells is a single row of flask-shaped cells, the inner phalangeal cells, which support a single row of inner sensory (hair) cells. The phalangeal cells contain microtubules, some of which support the base of the hair cells while others extend to the free surface around the hair cells. Beyond the outer row of pillar cells there are three to five rows of outer phalangeal cells which support the same number of rows of outer sensory (hair) cells. Cytoplasmic extensions of the phalangeal cells extend to the surface between and around the hair cells and their microtubules support the fenestrated hood-like structure formed by the pillar cells. Through the fenestrations project the free ends of the sensory cells. A variety of other specialised epithelial cells provides the remaining support for the organ of Corti. The sensory cells are known as hair cells because numerous stereocilia, i.e. very long microvilli (see Fig. 5.15), project from their free ends. The stereocilia are embedded in the surface of the tectorial membrane. As previously described, the spiral ganglion of the cochlea contains bipolar cell bodies of first order sensory neurones. From here, axons pass towards the base of the rows of hair cells, those going to the outer hair cells traversing the tunnel of Corti as shown in the diagram (b). The end of each fibre ramifies into a number of dendrites which make synaptic contact with several hair cells; each sensory cell may synapse with dendrites of several different sensory neurones. In addition, inhibitory neurones arising in the brainstem send fibres which also synapse with the sensory cells and exert a suppressive effect. From the layer of border cells which cover the spiral limbus SL, there extends a flap-like mass of glycosaminoglycans called the tectorial membrane TM overlying the sensory cells and within which the tips of the stereocilia are embedded. Function of the organ of Corti Only an outline of the mechanism of hearing is presented here; molecular details are being discovered at a rapid pace. Sound waves are funnelled into the external auditory meatus and impinge on the tympanic membrane, which vibrates at the appropriate frequency. These vibrations are transmitted to the stapes bone via the malleus and incus and, in the process, their amplitude is enhanced about 10-fold. The base of the stapes, which lies in the oval window, conducts the vibrations into the perilymph of the vestibule of the inner ear and pressure waves pass from here into the scala vestibuli of the cochlea. These pressure waves are probably conducted directly to the endolymph of the scala media across the delicate vestibular membrane, from which vibrations are induced in the basilar membrane upon which rests the organ of Corti. From here, spent vibrations are transmitted into the perilymph of the scala tympani and dissipated at the secondary tympanic membrane over the round window. The basilar membrane is thinnest at the base of the cochlea and thickest at the apex. It appears that at every point on the spiral, the membrane is ‘tuned’ to vibrate to a particular frequency of sound waves reaching the ear; the overall range of frequencies encompassed is of the order of 11 octaves, with the highest frequencies (pitch) being sensed towards the base of the cochlea and progressively lower frequencies being sensed along the spiral towards the apex. For any given sound frequency, only one specific point of the basilar membrane and organ of Corti is thought to vibrate and thereby activate the appropriate hair cells to initiate afferent sensory impulses which then pass to the auditory cortex of the brain. Deformation of the stereocilia of the hair cells results in either depolarisation or hypopolarisation of the cell membrane which, in turn, excites the sensory nerves which synapse with them. The sensory input from the cochlea is integrated in the brainstem and auditory cortex, from which efferent suppressor pathways can modulate receptor activity to enhance auditory acuity. Inherited deafness syndromes Approximately 50% of childhood deafness is caused by mutations in specific genes. Many of these genes have been found to code for proteins that affect function of the specialised sensory elements found in the inner ear. Approximately 70% of genetic hearing loss cases are nonsyndromic, meaning deafness is the only symptom, and 30% are syndromic, where deafness is part of a larger set of medical symptoms. Mutations in genes coding for connexin proteins involved in formation of gap junctions (see Fig. 5.12) account for a large proportion of cases. 424The earFIG. 21.26  Spiral ganglion  H&E (HP) The spiral ganglion is a spiral-shaped mass of nerve cell bodies lying in a canal at the extremity of the osseous spiral lamina of the modiolus. As seen in this micrograph, the ganglion cells G have the typical appearance of somatic ganglion cells (see Fig. 7.20) and represent the cell bodies of bipolar sensory neurones, relaying information from the receptors of the organ of Corti to the brain. Note the afferent fibres A entering the ganglion from the organ of Corti and numerous bundles of efferent fibres E which pass to the centre of the modiolus to form the cochlear nerve, the auditory component of the eighth cranial nerve; the cochlear nerve is readily seen in Fig. 21.24.

The walls of each are composed of a fibrous membrane which is bound down in places to the periosteum of the vestibule and, in other areas, is attached to the periosteum by fibrous strands, the intervening space being filled with perilymph. Internally, the saccule and utricle are lined by simple cuboidal epithelium but, in each, there is a small region of highly specialised epithelium called the macula, shown in micrographs (a) and (b), containing receptor cells which contribute part of the sensory input to that part of the brain responsible for maintaining balance and equilibrium. The macula of the utricle is oriented at right angles to that of the saccule. The maculae are made up of two basic cell types, sensory hair cells and support cells. The support cells are tall and columnar with basally located nuclei and microvilli at their free surface. The hair cells lie between the support cells, with their larger nuclei placed more centrally. Each hair cell has a single eccentrically located cilium of typical conformation, often called the kinocilium (see Fig. 5.13), and many stereocilia (long microvilli; see Fig. 5.15) projecting from its surface, hence the name hair cells. The ‘hairs’ are embedded in a thick, gelatinous plaque of glycoprotein, probably secreted by the supporting cells; this is lost during histological preparation. At the surface of the glycoprotein layer is a mass of crystals mainly composed of calcium carbonate and known as otoliths. These are shown in micrograph (c). There are two different forms of hair cells. Type I hair cells (goblet cells) are bulbous in shape and stain poorly, their nuclei tending to lie at a lower level than those of type II hair cells (columnar cells) which are more slender in shape. The type I hair cells are invested by a meshwork of dendritic processes of afferent sensory neurones, whereas the type II hair cells have only small dendritic processes at their bases. The hair cells also have synaptic connections with modulatory (inhibitory) neurones from the central nervous system. Function of the maculae The function of the maculae relates mainly to the maintenance of balance by providing sensory information about the static position of the head in space. This is of particular importance when the eyes are closed or in the dark or under water, and the maculae are consequently more developed in animals other than humans. When the head is moved from a position of equilibrium, the otolithic membrane tends to move with respect to the receptor cells, causing bending of their stereocilia. When the stereocilia are bent in the direction of the cilium, the receptor cell undergoes excitation and, when the relative movement is in the opposite direction, excitation is inhibited. The orientation of the hair cells in different directions in the maculae causes different hair cells to be stimulated with different positions of the head. The pattern of hair cell stimulation allows the central nervous system to determine the position of the head very accurately with respect to gravity. The neural pathways of the balance and equilibrium mechanism are complex, and the sensory input from the maculae is integrated with that of other proprioceptors, such as muscle spindles, to elicit reflex responses directed towards the maintenance of postural equilibrium.

Clinically, affected patients experience dizziness, disturbance of balance (vertigo), a high-pitched rushing or roaring sound in the ears (tinnitus) and fluctuating hearing loss. The symptoms of Ménière’s disease are associated with an increase in endolymph volume within the membranous labyrinth system, which is believed to cause the membranous labyrinth to swell (endolymphatic hydrops), leading to development of abnormal signalling from receptors. The cause of this increase in endolymph remains uncertain. One possibility is rupture of the membranous labyrinth which allows the endolymph to mix with perilymph. For patients with mild disease, treatment with symptomatic medication can be effective. For patients with debilitating disease, surgical ablation of parts of the labyrinthine system are effective but may involve permanent hearing loss. Infusion of drugs known to be toxic to the sensory-neural apparatus (e.g. gentamicin) in the middle ear is also used for treatment. Transient dysfunction of the labyrinthine system can be caused by viral infection (viral labyrinthitis). Patients develop severe dizziness, vertigo, nausea and vomiting which reaches a peak after about 24 hours and subsequently resolves within a week.

At one end of each duct is a dilated portion, the ampulla, which contains a receptor organ called the crista ampullaris, shown in micrograph (a). Each crista ampullaris is an elongated epithelial structure situated on a ridge of supporting tissue, arising from the membranous wall of the ampulla and oriented at right angles to the direction of flow of the endolymph in the semicircular canal. Structurally, the cristae ampullares bear many similarities to the maculae of the utricle and saccule (see Fig. 21.27). The hair cells are of the same two morphological forms, type I and type II cells, the former being invested by a basket of sensory dendrites and the latter having small dendritic endings at the base only. The hair cells are supported by a single layer of columnar cells which is continuous with the simple cuboidal epithelium lining the rest of the membranous labyrinth. Like those of the maculae, the hair cells of the cristae have numerous stereocilia and a single kinocilium, the kinocilium being situated at the margin of the cell nearest to the utricle. The stereocilia and the kinocilia of the hair cells are embedded in a ridge of gelatinous glycoprotein which is tall and cone shaped in cross-section, giving rise to the term cupula. In contrast to the macula, the cupula does not contain otolithic crystals. Traces of the cupola C can be seen on the surface of the crista ampullaris in micrograph (a), although most of it has been lost during histological preparation of the specimen. Function of the crista ampullaris When the head is moved in the plane of a particular semicircular canal, the inertia of the endolymph acts to deflect the cupula in the opposite direction. The stereocilia of the sensory cells are then deflected towards or away from the cilia, resulting in excitation or inhibition, respectively. In each ear, there are three semicircular canals, two at right angles to each other in vertical planes and one in a near-horizontal plane. Each is paired with a semicircular canal in the other ear, the members of each pair being oriented in parallel. The sensory input from the cristae ampullares mainly concerns changes in the direction and rate of movement of the head. Afferent impulses pass via bipolar sensory neurones with cell bodies in the vestibular ganglion which lies at the base of the internal auditory meatus. Afferent fibres pass via the vestibular part of the eighth cranial nerve to the brainstem, cerebellum and cerebral cortex, where sensory information from various other sources is integrated for the maintenance of balance, position sense and equilibrium.

Thus from LM, stu- dents can expect to gain an understanding of overall cell and tissue architecture. The superior resolution and magnification of EM permit visualisation of many features which simply cannot be seen by LM. Yet in some respects EM is less flexible than LM. For example, the available area in EM specimens is generally less than 1 mm2 and this may make it difficult to obtain representative fields. Few staining methods are available for EM and these produce only monochromatic (black and white) images. EM is also costly and time-consuming and usually not available to the average student. Hints for interpreting EMs Interpretation of EMs can be quite challenging due to the wide range of magnifications available (×500–190 000 in this book). In other words an EM image is not necessarily of very high magnification. In fact, there is an overlap in the mag- nification ranges of EM and LM. It is a good idea to con- sciously note the magnification and/or scale bar on each image in the book. The terms electron-dense and electron- lucent are used to describe the relative darkness and light- ness, respectively, as they appear in transmission EM images. Sections examined by EM are almost featureless unless stained with heavy metals (e.g. uranium and lead salts) that bind to cell and tissue components to varying degrees. Significant binding of metal stain to a particular structure will impede transmission of the electron beam through the specimen at that point; the structure will appear dark grey or black and is said to be electron-dense (really too dense to allow passage of electrons). Other structures with little or no affinity for the stain will appear lighter grey or white and are termed electron-lucent because they permit greater transmission of the electron beam. A useful starting point in interpreting EMs is to select several commonly found structures that you can confidently identify and memorise their dimensions. These can then be used as ‘internal rulers’ to gauge the dimensions of numer- ous other features in the field. For example, plasma mem- brane and organelle membranes will be visible at medium magnifications as thin electron-dense lines that measure about 10 nm wide. Thus, structures such as intermediate filaments (10 nm in diameter and solid) and microtubules (20–25 nm in diameter but hollow) can be identified. Simi- larly, individual ribosomes and glycogen particles are 20 to 30 nm in diameter. Being alert to major size differences between organelle types will instill further confidence. For example, nuclear diameter (5–10 µm in most cells) is up to 10 times greater than the diameter of lysosomes and mito- chondria (0.2–1.0 µm) and up to 100 times greater than indi- vidual Golgi transport vesicles (50–100 nm). The next step is to actively look for the unique set of features that charac- terises and distinguishes each organelle and inclusion. For example, only mitochondria and the nucleus possess a double membrane, and in mitochondria the inner of these two membranes is thrown into highly characteristic folds. High-magnification electron micrographs are often required to demonstrate particular features but usually display only a tiny region of the cell. Therefore, do not be surprised if many of the common organelles are not seen in 1 Introduction to microscopy The study of histology, the subject of this text and atlas, is carried out using microscopes of various types in order to visualise the structure of body tissues. Structure is closely related to function, and much can be deduced about the function of cells and tissues by careful examination of their component parts. Taken together with information gathered from biochemistry, physiology and other basic sciences, this study can provide a powerful tool to understand the normal functioning of the body. In addition, acquiring this knowl- edge is a necessary first step for the understanding of disease. Histology is about looking at structure, and in this introductory section we aim to provide some guidelines to assist the absolute beginner in examining and interpreting the images in this book. This book mainly uses photomicrographs taken with the light microscope (LM) (colour images) and the electron microscope (EM) (black and white images). Simply put, the LM and EM differ in optical resolution and available mag- nification. In practical terms ‘resolution’ refers to the capac- ity of an optical system to reveal detail in a specimen. The resolution available from a conventional LM is only about 0.2 µm. Thus at distances of less than 0.2 µm, objects that are actually separate from one another will appear to merge. In contrast, EM resolution for biological specimens is as little as 1 nm, so that the resolving power is about 200-fold better than LM. In addition, maximum ‘available magnifica- tion’ is limited to about ×1000 in most student LMs, whereas an EM readily achieves 100-fold greater magnification, or about ×100 000. EM images are therefore said to display cell and tissue ultrastructure. EM images may be two-dimensional or three-dimensional There are two types of electron microscope: scanning EM and transmission EM. Scanning EM produces three- dimensional (3D) images, but these are restricted to the surface of the object, with the internal structure concealed from view. Transmission EM is so named because the elec- tron beam must pass through the specimen to form an image. To achieve this, ultrathin sections (50–100 nm) must be cut. Transmission of the electron beam through the tissue results in a two-dimensional (2D) image of the plane of the section. In practice, transmission EM is more informative of biological ultrastructure, and these images predominate in this book. We have supplemented these with scanning EM images where it helps with 3D conceptualisation (cf. Figs 16.13 and 16.14). As a matter of convention the abbreviation EM can be assumed to be a transmission EM, while we have identified scanning EMs as SEM. Light and electron microscopy are complementary The strengths of LM and EM differ yet complement one another very effectively. With LM one can observe large areas of a specimen (usually several cm 2). A wide range of staining methods, some empirical, some specific, are avail- able for LM, permitting identification of cell and tissue fea- tures; many of these stains are polychromatic, i.e. they produce multiple colours in the specimen which, besides looking pretty, help to identify different components. For APPENDIX APPENDIX 1 n Introduction to microscopy 429 dyes, enzymes, tiny particles of colloidal gold). When the antibody is then applied to the tissue under study, it binds to the antigen. Hence, the site of antibody-antigen binding becomes flagged by the chosen visual marker (e.g. Fig. 1.14; Appendix 2, Notes on staining techniques). Constraints in LM and EM: Aspects of tissue preparation A problem common both to light and electron microscopy is the need to prevent autolytic degeneration and to pre- serve cellular ultrastructure. Fixatives such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are used for this purpose. Fixation causes cross-linking of macromolecules, which reduces and often arrests biological activity, at the same time rendering the cells more amenable to staining. Most tissues are too thick to be examined directly in the microscope and must therefore be cut into very thin slices (sections). To facilitate the cutting of thin sections, the tissue is usually embedded in a hard medium such as paraffin wax (LM) or a plastic resin (EM); fixed tissues generally require dehydration with organic solvents before the embedding step. Each stage in the fixation, dehydration, embedding, sectioning and final staining sequence may induce artefacts (distor- tions in cell and tissue architecture, e.g. shrinkage). In situ- ations where preservation of biological activity of cell constituents (e.g. enzymes) is the major objective, thin sec- tions for histochemistry can be obtained from minimally fixed or unfixed frozen tissue; such frozen sections have their own particular artefactual distortions. As noted above, unstained sections are quite lacking in contrast when viewed by conventional LM or EM. However, special types of LM (phase contrast, interference contrast, confocal micros- copy) have been developed to address this limitation and are frequently used, for example, to monitor living tissue cultures. the field. A reliable indicator of high magnification is if an individual membrane appears trilaminar rather than as a single electron-dense line. At low magnification, EM inter- pretation can actually be more difficult because membranes and the smallest organelles are no longer clearly visible. Get orientated by looking first for the biggest objects, i.e. nuclei and boundaries of the cells themselves and next for the mid- sized organelles such as mitochondria. Regions of interface between cells and extracellular tissue can give clues about tissue heterogeneity. Specific localisation methods for LM and EM The traditional staining techniques of histology, developed in the last two centuries from dyes used in the textile indus- try, remain valuable and widely used as empirical methods for LM. Subsequently, a range of specific methods was developed, enabling LM visualisation of defined intracel- lular and extracellular constituents. More recently, technical refinements have allowed conceptually similar specific localisations to be achieved at EM level. One major group of specific methods known as histo- chemical techniques employs reagents known to react with defined cellular constituents (e.g. lipids, glycogen and DNA), thereby producing selective colouration recognisable by LM. In a subset known as enzyme histochemistry the activity of enzymes can similarly be demonstrated by stain- ing for their specific substrates or end products; these methods are often applicable for both EM and LM. A further subset termed immunohistochemistry has gained rapid acceptance. Immunologically based, this newer method offers high specificity and sensitivity of localisation. In essence, antibodies are raised against specific cellular com- ponents (in this context, the antigen) and then conjugated with a visual marker appropriate for LM or EM (e.g. APPENDIX 2 n Notes on staining techniques 430 Nuclei may be counterstained blue with haematoxylin, or red with the dye neutral red. Azan This technique is traditionally classed as a connective tissue method but is excellent for demonstrating fine cyto- logical detail, especially in epithelium. Nuclei are stained bright red; collagen, basement membrane and mucin are stained blue; muscle and red blood cells are stained orange to red. Giemsa This technique is a standard method for staining blood cells and other smears of cells (e.g. bone marrow). Nuclei are stained dark blue to violet, background cytoplasm pale blue and erythrocytes pale pink. Toluidine blue This stain is one of the few stains which will differentially stain tissues in very thin epoxy resin sections (see Appendix 3) and is particularly used in the high-resolution investiga- tion of the structure of the glomerulus in health and disease, as well as for high-resolution light microscopy of nerves. This dye also stains mast cell granules reddish purple in paraffin sections, a property called metachromasia. Goldner’s trichrome stain This method is applied to acrylic resin sections (see Appen- dix 3) of undecalcified bone to distinguish between miner- alised bone and unmineralised osteoid, and has a haematoxylin component which also stains the nuclei of osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts and marrow cells. The von Kossa stain (a silver method) also distinguishes between mineralised bone and osteoid but shows no cellular detail. Silver and gold methods These methods were extremely popular at the end of the nineteenth century and are occasionally used today to dem- onstrate such fine structures as cell processes (e.g. in neu- rones, motor end-plates and intercellular junctions). Depending on the method used, the end product is black, brown or golden. Nissl and methylene blue methods These techniques use a basic dye to stain the rough endo- plasmic reticulum found in neurones; when this is seen as clumps it is called Nissl substance. Sudan black and osmium These dyes stain lipid-containing structures such as myelin a brownish-black colour for light microscopy. Osmium is also used as the staining agent that provides contrast in electron microscopy. Grids prepared for electron micros- copy are stained with osmium tetroxide in solution. Electron- dense structures are those that have affinity for osmium staining. 2 Notes on staining techniques Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) This is the most commonly used technique in animal histol- ogy and routine pathology. The basic dye, haematoxylin, stains acidic structures a purplish blue. Nuclei, ribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum have a strong affinity for this dye owing to their high content of DNA and RNA, respectively. In contrast, eosin is an acidic dye which stains basic structures red or pink. Most cytoplasmic proteins are basic and hence cytoplasm usually stains pink or pinkish red. In general, when the H&E staining technique is applied to animal cells, nuclei stain blue and cytoplasm stains pink or red. Periodic acid–schiff reaction (PAS) Staining methods that specifically stain components of cells and tissues are called histochemical staining techniques. Such techniques are invaluable for the understanding of cell and tissue structure and function, and for making a diagno- sis on diseased tissues. The PAS reaction stains complex carbohydrates a deep red colour, traditionally described as magenta. The mucin produced by goblet cells of the gas- trointestinal and respiratory tracts stains magenta with this technique (and is therefore termed PAS-positive). Basement membranes and the brush borders of kidney tubules and the small and large intestines are also PAS-positive, as is cartilage and to some extent collagen. Glycogen, the intra- cellular storage form of carbohydrate found in cells such as hepatocytes and muscle cells, is also PAS-positive. Masson trichrome This technique is a so-called connective tissue technique since it is used to demonstrate supporting tissue elements, principally collagen. As its name implies, the staining tech- nique produces three colours: nuclei and other basophilic structures are stained blue; collagen is stained green or blue depending on which variant of the technique is used; and cytoplasm, muscle, erythrocytes and keratin are stained bright red. Alcian blue Alcian blue is a mucin stain which may be used in conjunc- tion with other staining methods such as H&E or van Gieson (see below). Certain types of mucin, but not all, are stained blue by the Alcian blue method, as is cartilage. When the technique is combined with van Gieson, the Alcian blue colour becomes green. van Gieson This is another connective tissue method in which collagen is stained red, nuclei are blue and erythrocytes and cyto- plasm yellow. When used in combination with an elastic stain, elastin is stained blue/black in addition to the results described above. This staining technique is particularly useful for blood vessels and skin. Reticulin stain This method demonstrates the reticulin fibres of supporting tissue, which are stained blue/black by this technique. APPENDIX APPENDIX 2 n Notes on staining techniques 431 substance (antigen) can be specifically identified, provided antibodies for it are available. To demonstrate a particular substance (e.g. insulin) in sections of tissue, antibodies must be produced. This is done by injecting human insulin into a laboratory animal, which obligingly recognises the human peptide as foreign and produces antibodies to it. A virtually inexhaustible source of antibody can then be created using monoclonal technology. (In actual practice you order a vial of antibody from a recognised supplier.) Immunohistological techniques A variety of immunohistochemical techniques are vital for diagnostic purposes as well as for research. Micrographs employing this method are used in several chapters of this book to highlight specific histological features (e.g. see Figs 1.14, 11.10, and 17.21). For this reason the basic technique is described here in some detail. Immunohistochemical techniques depend on the exqui- site specificity of antibodies for their antigen. Thus any A section of tissue is placed on a glass slide (a), and a solution of antibody is laid over the tissue. The antibody binds to the antigen and excess antibody is washed away so that only cells containing the particular antigen have antibody bound to them. To demonstrate the position of antibody, the antibody is prelinked to an indicator substance. This may be a fluorescent substance such as fluorescein, in which case the technique is known as immunofluorescence, and the position of antibody can be visualised using a fluorescence microscope. It is more useful to bind to the antibody an enzyme that is able to convert a colourless substrate to a coloured product. A solution of the substrate is laid over the tissue section (b) with the bound antibody. After a period of incubation, the coloured product can be seen on the section using an ordinary light microscope (c). An enzyme commonly used for this purpose is horseradish peroxidase and the technique is then called the immunoperoxidase technique. A further modification of this principle for electron microscopy uses antibodies linked to gold which, as gold is electron-dense, can be detected by electron microscopy (immunogold labelling). Many other variants of this technique are available. Slide Cells Antigen Antibody with indicator a Coloured productColourless substrate b Cells stained cAPPENDIX 3 n Glossary of terms 432 rER – rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes and is the site of synthesis and processing of proteins for export. sER – smooth endoplasmic reticulum is a major site of lipid synthesis. In vitro – an experiment taking place outside of a living body (e.g. in a tissue culture dish). In vivo – occurring in a living body, used in experimental situations to describe events taking place in real life. Protein superfamilies – proteins can be grouped into super- families by similarities in structure and function. An example is the immunoglobulin superfamily that has a range of functions in antigen recognition and cell-cell interactions. Proximal – closer to the centre or the root of a limb (e.g., the elbow is proximal to the wrist). RNA – ribonucleic acid is a chemical structure that exists in three forms: messenger RNA, transfer RNA and ribos- omal RNA (see below). mRNA – messenger RNA is a chemical copy of the sequence of bases in DNA and acts as a template for the synthesis of proteins (see Ch. 1). rRNA – ribosomal RNA is the type of RNA that makes up the physical structure of the ribosome, the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomal RNA controls the docking of tRNA in the correct order as defined by mRNA to produce the correct sequence of amino acids in a particular polypeptide chain. tRNA – transfer RNA interacts with mRNA during protein synthesis to assemble the amino acids in the correct order to create a particular protein. Sagittal or median plane – an imaginary vertical plane through the body, dividing it into right and left halves. Additional paramedian or parasagittal planes are paral- lel to the sagittal plane. Section or tissue section – a very thin slice of tissue that is prepared in one of a number of ways for staining and microscopic examination: Frozen section – this type of section is used for urgent diagnosis intra-operatively. The tissue is snap frozen, sections cut and stained and a diagnosis given within a sort space of time (15–30 minutes). The disadvan- tage of this method is that tissue preservation is not nearly so good as with routine paraffin sections, and so diagnosis is more difficult. Frozen sections are also used for immunofluorescence microscopy, certain stains to detect lipids in tissue and for enzyme histochemistry. Paraffin sections – most of the photomicrographs in this book are of paraffin sections. The fixed tissues are dehydrated and infiltrated by hot liquid paraffin wax and cooled until the wax is solid (at room tem- perature). The wax provides support for the tissue and allows sections as thin as 1–2 µm to be cut. The wax is dissolved away by an organic solvent, and the tissue slice is rehydrated before stains are applied. This procedure requires hours to carry out, and most routine tissue sections are processed overnight. Resin sections – in some circumstances, paraffin wax offers inadequate support for tissue sectioning, and 3 Glossary of terms ATP – adenosine triphosphate is the small molecule used in cells as the primary source of readily available energy. Basophilic or haematoxophilic– structures that stain with the basic dye haematoxylin, one of the components of the standard haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) method (see Appendix 2). Acidic molecules such as DNA and RNA take up this dye, thus acquiring a blue colour. Complement cascade – a group of enzymes found in inac- tive form in the blood. Binding of immune complexes or certain bacterial products activates the first enzyme, which is then able to activate larger amounts of the second that in turn switches on larger amounts of the third and so on. This cascade can very quickly produce large quantities of effector molecules that fight infection and promote inflammation. Coronal planes – imaginary vertical planes at right angles to the median/sagittal plane (see below). Cytokines – proteins or peptides released by cells that convey signals to nearby cells. Distal – anatomical term meaning further from the centre or the root of a limb (e.g. the ankle is distal to the knee). DNA – deoxyribonucleic acid is the chemical structure that holds the genetic code, which contains the blueprint for every protein produced by an individual. DNA is found in the nucleus where it forms the chromosomes (see Ch. 2). Electron-dense – tissue stained for electron microscopy with heavy metals impedes the passage of electrons to a greater or lesser degree depending on the amount of heavy metal bound. Structures that take up large amounts of heavy metal stains are called electron-dense and appear dark grey to black. Electron-lucent – tissue stained for electron microscopy with heavy metals impedes the passage of electrons to a greater or lesser degree depending on the amount of heavy metal bound. Those structures that bind little heavy metal and allow the passage of the electron beam are said to be electron-lucent and appear white to pale grey. EM – two-dimensional electron micrograph views of objects, acquired by passing the electron beam through a thin section of the specimen (see Appendix 1). Almost all of the electron micrographs in this book are transmission electron micrographs and are referred to as ‘EMs’. Other authors sometimes use the abbreviation TEM, although by convention the abbreviation EM is assumed to be a transmission EM. SEM – scanning electron micrographs are three- dimensional views of the surface of objects. SEMs in this book are identified in figure captions as ‘SEM’ (see Appendix 1 for further details). Eosinophilic or acidophilic– these structures stain with the acidic dye eosin, the other component of the standard haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) method. Most cytoplas- mic structures are basic and therefore acidophilic to some extent, so that in most tissues the cell cytoplasm stains with eosin and appears pinkish-red. ER – endoplasmic reticulum is a membrane-bound cyto- plasmic compartment where certain chemical reactions take place sequestered from the rest of the cytoplasm. There are two types—rough and smooth. APPENDIX APPENDIX 3 n Glossary of terms 433 electron microscopy. Using special glass ‘knives’, very thin sections can be cut and stained with Tolui- dine blue (see Appendix 2, ‘Notes on stains’) for very high-resolution light microscopy, and even thinner sections (ultrathin sections) stained for transmission electron microscopy. resins are used as the embedding medium. Two main types are used. Acrylic resins are harder than paraffin wax and offer greater support when cutting hard tissues such as fingernail and undecalcified bone. A wide range of stains can be applied. Epoxy resins are even harder and are particularly used in This page intentionally left blank 435 A A bands, 104f, 106f–108f Absorption, 251, 251f Absorptive cells, in colon, 271f Accessory nuclei, 394f Accessory pancreatic duct, 287f Accessory salivary glands, 239, 240f, 248 ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme), 308f–309f Acetylcholine (ACh) in Alzheimer’s disease, 132 in gastric acid secretion, 259f, 260 in motor end plates, 134f–135f in muscle contraction, 106b in myasthenia gravis, 134 Acetylcholine receptors (AChR), in myasthenia gravis, 134 Acetylcholinesterase, in motor end plates, 134f–135f ACh.
