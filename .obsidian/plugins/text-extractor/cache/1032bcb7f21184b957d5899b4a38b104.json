The voltage induced in each phase is 120 Vrms. Calculate: a) The effective power dissipated in each resistor. (ans. 720 W) b) The effective power dissipated in the 3-phase load (ans. 2160 W). c) The peak power (Pm) dissipated in each resistor (ans.1440 W) d) The ratio of total 3-phase power to the peak power dissipated in each resistor (ans.1.5) 9","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
