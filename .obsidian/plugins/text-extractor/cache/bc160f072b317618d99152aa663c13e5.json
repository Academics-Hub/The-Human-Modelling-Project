Classification: • Synovial joint • Diarthrosis joint • Type: Ball & Socket. Articulating Surfaces • Head of humerus (H) • Glenoid fossa of scapula (S) • Glenoid labrum increases the concavity of the fossa H S 4 Classification by type of tissue: Fibrous – bones connected by fibrous tissue. Cartilaginous – bones connected by cartilage. Synovial – articulating surfaces enclosed within a fluid-filled joint capsule. Classification by degree of movement: Synarthrosis – immovable (e.g. fibrous joint) Amphiarthrosis – slightly moveable (e.g. symphysis joint) Diarthrosis – freely moveable (synovial joint). ***Each class of joint has different types Articular capsule (AC) • Thin fibrous membrane attached to margin of glenoid fossa & around anatomical neck of humerus • Deficient inferiorly • Synovial membrane lines the inner wall of the fibrous capsule • Supported by SITS tendons AC 5 Ligaments • Glenohumeral • 3 bands (superior, middle & inferior glenohumeral ligaments), visible from within joint • Transverse humeral • Coracoacromial • strong accessory ligament. • medial border of acromion to lateral border of coracoid • Coracohumeral • Strong ligament that blends with the fibrous capsule • From inferior surface of coracoid process to margin of greater tubercle of humerus Bursae • Several (8) • Located where a tendon rubs against a bone, ligament or tendon • Subacromial (or subdeltoid) • Highly pain sensitive • Large & under coracoacromial ligament, acromiom & deltoid muscle • Does not communicate with the synovial cavity 7 Interior of shoulder joint Note: 1. Glenoid labrum 2. Tendon of long head of biceps (intracapsular) 3. SITS muscles 4. Bursa 8 Acromioclavicular Joints • Synovial • Plane type • Articulations: btw the acromial end of clavicle and the clavicular facet of the acromion of scapula • Fibrocartilaginous cartilage with incomplete articular disc • Ligament: – Intrinsic: Superior& inferior acromioclavicular ligaments – Extrinsic: Coracoclavicular ligament (with conoid (C) and trapezoid (T) parts) • Movements: – Gliding & sliding producing • protraction-retraction, • elevation-depression, and • axial rotation • Muscles: – No specific muscle act on this joint T C Vascular Supply • Anterior & posterior circumflex humeral • Suprascapular • Subscapular (circumflex scapular branch) 10 Nerve Supply • Articular branches from: - Axillary nerve - Suprascapular nerve - Lateral pectoral nerve • Hilton’s Law - The motor nerve to a muscle tends to give a branch/twig to the joint which the muscle moves and another to the skin over the joint. 11 Movements at the Shoulder Joint 12 http://bestperformancegroup.com/ Movements & Muscles producing movements Movement Muscles Involved (Prime movers and synergists) Abduction Deltoid, Supraspinatus- initiates movement (first 15° degrees) Adduction Pectoralis major, Latissimus dorsi, (Teres major, long head of triceps, Subscapularis, Infraspinatus) Flexion Pectoralis major, Deltoid, (Coracobrachialis, biceps brachii) Extension Deltoid, (Teres major, Latissimus dorsi, long head of of triceps, Pectoralis major) Medial Rotation Subscapularis, (Pectoralis major, Deltoid, Latissimus dorsi) Lateral Rotation Infraspinatus, (Deltoid, Teres minor) Circumduction Combination of all movements above 13 *Endeavour to recall the prime movers Factors for Stability ➢Glenoid labrum ➢increase concavity ➢Coracoacromial arch • coracoid process, coracoacromial ligament & acromion prevent upward dislocation ➢Tendons of ➢Long head of biceps provides additional superior support ➢Rotator cuff muscles provide congruency and strong lateral stability ➢Long head of triceps provides inferior support especially during abduction ➢Ligaments ➢ Glenohumeral, coracoacromial, coracohumeral 14 Applied Anatomy Shoulder Joint ✓Most frequently dislocated joint ✓Dislocation (especially in violent abduction) occurs towards inferior aspect which is devoid of muscles ✓Axillary nerve • prone to tear in injury at surgical neck of humerus • close relation to inferior aspect of articular capsule H S 15 Muscles of posterior scapular region 16 Supraspinatus and infraspinatus - Originate from the two large on the posterior surface of the scapula. - They insert on the greater tubercle of the humerus. Teres minor and teres major Long head of triceps brachii Deltoid - large and triangular in shape, with its base attached to the scapula & clavicle and its apex attached to the humerus The back (extrinsic) • Bones – Vertebral Column, Scapula and ribs • Joints • Intervertebral Joints at body of vertebra • Vertebral arch • Superior and Inferior facets • Muscles • Superficial & • Intermediate groups 18 The back muscles conceptart.org Sabotta 19 Superficial and intermediate layers Superficial (extrinsic) – movers of the shoulder e.g. trapezius, latissimus dorsi, rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, and levator scapulae. Intermediate (extrinsic) – movers of the thoracic cage e.g. serratus posterior superior and inferior Deep (intrinsic) – movers of the vertebral column. Superficial Muscles of Back • Trapezius • Latissimus dorsi • Triangle of auscultation • Latissimus dorsi, trapezius & medial border of scapula • Post segments of lungs 20 • Levator scapulae • Rhomboid minor • Rhomboid major 21 Superficial Muscles of Back – cont’d 22 Superficial and intermediate muscles of Back – cont’dAnastomosis around scapula • What is an Anastomosis? 1. Transverse cervical artery (from thyrocervical trunk) of subclavian artery. • Gives off dorsal scapular artery 2. Suprascapular artery (from thyrocervical artery) 3. Subscapular artery (from Axillary artery) divides into • circumflex scapular and thoracodorsal 23 Quadrangular Space • Boundaries ❖Superior: Teres minor ❖Inferior: Teres major ❖Lateral: Surgical neck of humerus ❖Medial: Long head triceps • Contents ❖Axillary nerve ❖Posterior circumflex humeral artery 24 Triangular Space - Upper • Boundaries ❖Lateral: Long head of triceps ❖Superior: Teres minor ❖Inferior: Teres major • Contents ❖Circumflex scapular artery 25 Triangular Space - Lower Boundaries • Above - subscapularis anteriorly and teres major posteriorly • Medially - long head of triceps • Laterally - humerus Contents • Radial nerve • Profunda brachii vessels 26 Questions!!! • With the aid of a table, list the movements at the shoulder joint and the muscles producing each movement. • Describe the shoulder joint. • List the factors that stabilize the shoulder joint. • List the arteries involved in the scapular anastomosis. • What are the boundaries and contents of the quadrangular and triangular spaces. 27 Thank you!!!! 28","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
