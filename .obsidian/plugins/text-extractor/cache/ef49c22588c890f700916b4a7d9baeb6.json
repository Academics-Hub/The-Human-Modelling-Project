The essential fatty acids, linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, are required in diet. Dietary sources of fats: Fats such as butter, lard (meat fat) Oils such as sunflower, olive, canola, peanut oil etc. Foods such as meat, cheese, nuts, soya beans, oily fish (salmon, tuna, sardines) Metabolic sources of fats: Fatty acid synthesis in the liver (from glucose via acetyl-CoA) - lipogenesis Cholesterol synthesis in the liver Triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis in adipose tissue (from fatty acids and glucose) Consist mostly of carbon and hydrogen (hydrocarbons). Usually liquid at body temperature Insoluble in water. General physical properties: General physiological functions: Energy production Energy storage Insulation Substrate for the synthesis of phospholipids Substrate for the synthesis of signaling molecules (inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG)) 2. Classes of lipids a) Fatty acids (FAs) Stearic acid – an 18 carbon fatty acid Saturated fatty acids FAs are a hydrocarbon chain with a carboxyl (COOH) group at one end. Most have an even number of carbon atoms in the chain (usually 12-24). The general name for the carbon chain is an ‘acyl’ group. ‘Acyl’ refers to any length of carbon chain i.e. acyl-CoA Hydrophilic endHydrophobic end Fatty acids are amphiphilic – have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties Cis- and trans- arrangement Trans oleic acidCis oleic acid Mono-unsaturated fatty acids Oleic acid – an 18 carbon mono-unsaturated fatty acid 95% of unsaturated fatty acids are in the cis- conformation Trans- fatty acids increase the risk of heart disease. Poly-unsaturated fatty acids Linoleic acid – an 18 carbon poly-unsaturated fatty acid Notes: Saturated vs. unsaturated fats • Saturated FAs are preferred in energy metabolism. • Saturated FAs are associated with increased blood cholesterol. • Unsaturated FAs are important structurally and for hormone synthesis. • Unsaturated FAs are associated with decreased blood cholesterol. • The ratio of unsaturated:saturated FA in the diet should be about 3:1 Fatty acid nomenclature: β FA carbons are numbered from the ω (omega) carbon Therefore for above FA: cisC18:4ω3,6,9,12 Stearic acid = C18:0 cis Oleic acid = cisC18:1ω9 Linoleic acid = cisC18:2ω9,12 Essential fatty acids Human enzymes (desaturases) can insert double bonds in a saturated FA up to, but not further than, 8 carbons from the COOH. β No NoNo yes If an unsaturated fatty acid is required with double bonds further than 9 carbons from the COOH group, it must be obtained in the diet. The essential fatty acids are needed to synthesise the eicosanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxanes etc.) https://teach.lanecc.edu/yuia/225lectures/05b/l5byui.html b) Triacylglycerols (TAGs)(triglycerides) + 3 X fatty acids (acyls) Glycerol esterification hydrolysis TAGs are the storage form of fatty acids, they are found in adipocytes A triacylglycerol Monoacylglycerol (MAG) Diacylglycerol (DAG) Glycerol Triacylglycerol (TAG) F a t t y a c i d F a t t y a c i d F a t t y a c i d Glycerol F a t t y a c i d F a t t y a c i d Glycerol F a t t y a c i d O H O H O H Other types of ‘acyl’glycerolsNotes on triacylglycerols and fatty Acids The most common lipid in the diet is triacylglycerols. • Triacylglycerols consist of 3 fatty acids joined to glycerol by ester bonds. • Triacylglycerols are hydrophobic • Glycerol has 3 hydroxyl groups, which make it hydrophilic. • Fatty acids consist of a carboxyl group, which is hydrophilic, and a variable length CH tail, which is hydrophobic. • Fatty acids are amphiphilic (both hydrophilic & hydrophobic). • Fatty acids are unsaturated if they have double bonds, which may be cis or trans. • Essential fatty acids, linoleic acid and alpha linolenic acid, have cis double bonds in the ω-3 and/or ω6 position. • They are essential in the diet because humans cannot insert double bonds >9 carbons from the COOH group. c) Phospholipids Functions of phospholipids •Biological membranes •Signaling molecules •Pulmonary surfactant Phosphate head group (hydrophilic) 2 fatty acids (hydrophobic) glycerol Lipid bilayer http://www.childrens.com/healthlibrary/healthlibcontent.cfm?pageid=p02371 Phospholipid pathology – Neonatal respiratory diseaseNotes on phospholipids • Phospholipids consist of 2 fatty acids esterified to glycerol and a charged group containing phosphate attached to the 3rd position of glycerol. • The fatty acid chains may be saturated or unsaturated. • Phospholipids are amphiphilic, i.e. both hydrophilic and hydrophobic. • Phospholipids form lipid bilayers, which are hydrophobic inside and hydrophilic on both surfaces. • Some second messengers (IP3 & DAG) are derived from phospholipids. • A phospholipid, dipalmitidyl phosphatidyl choline, acts as a surfactant in the lungs, decreasing surface tension and facilitating O2 to dissolve. • Deficiency of surfactant in premature neonates causes neonatal respiratory distress. d) Sterols Cholesterol cholesterol Functions of cholesterol Affects membrane fluidity Cholesterol is used as a raw material to synthesise steroid hormones, bile salts, vitamin D Vitamin D Bile salts Testosterone hepatocyte intestine chylomicron lipoprotein lipasefatty acid triacylglycerol adipocyte with lipid droplet albumin-fatty acid fatty acid fatty acyl-CoA acyl-carnitine b-oxidation acetyl-CoA TCA cycleketones CNS CO2 & ATP acetyl-CoA TCA cycle CO2 & ATP lipolysis 3. Lipid Catabolism ketogenesis acyl-CoA mitochondria blood Adipocyte a) Intestinal digestion and absorption of fats Pancreatic lipase 2) Lipases degrade triacylglycerols into FAs and monoacylglycerols lipoprotein lipase chylomicron remnant Blood insulin + triacylglycerol fatty acids Summary: Lipid Digestion and Absorption • In the stomach, lipids are emulsified into droplets and partially hydrolyzed by salivary and gastric lipases. • The partially hydrolyzed lipids and free fatty acids form micelles with the hydrophobic chains on the inside and the hydrophilic COOH and OH groups on the surface (facing the watery environment). • In the duodenum bile salts make smaller micelles and pancreatic lipase hydrolyzes the lipids to monoacylglycerol and free fatty acids, both of which are absorbed by the enterocytes. • The fatty acids and monoacylglycerol are re-esterified to TAGs and packaged into lipoproteins called chylomicrons. • Chylomicrons transport TAGs to adipose tissue via lymphatic system and then blood. • Insulin stimulates lipoprotein lipase to hydrolyse the TAGs to fatty acids, which are transported into the adipocytes and stored as TAGs in the lipid droplet. b) Lipolysis – the breakdown of TAGs in adipose tissue Adipocyte triacylglycerides glycerol free fatty acids capillary albumin free fatty acids transported in blood attached to albumin and used for energy generation in tissues. glycerol (goes to liver, used in gluconeogenesis) Hormone sensitive lipase insulin Glucagon, adrenaline, cortisol + - c) Fatty acid oxidation – β-oxidation β Cut here acetate β-oxidation is the stepwise oxidation of fatty acids for energy. All the reactions of β-oxidation take place within the mitochondrial matrix The end product of β-oxidation is acetyl-CoA Transport of fatty acids into the mitochondrion On entry to the cell from blood, FFAs are converted to fatty acyl-CoA in the cytoplasm. Fatty acyl-CoA is then transported into the mitochondrial matrix via the carnitine palmitoyl transporters (CPT-I and CPT-II). cytosol β-oxidation acetyl-CoA Malonyl CoA- Insulin + FAs FA synthesis Regulation: Malonyl-CoA inhibits CPT-1 β-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria In β-oxidation, 2 carbons at a time are cleaved from fatty acyl-CoA to yield: • acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) and • a fatty acyl-CoA with 2 less carbons. C16 FA re-enters β-oxidation C18 fatty acyl-CoA C16 fatty acyl-CoA + acetyl-CoA NADH2 FADH2 CoA C16 fatty acyl-CoA C14 fatty acyl-CoA + acetyl-CoA NADH2 FADH2 CoA And so on….. The final C4 Fatty Acyl-CoA yields 2 x acetyl-CoA, 1 x NADH2 and 1 x FADH2 Summary of complete oxidation of a C18 fatty acid There are 7 rounds for a C18 FA. Each round generates: 1 x FADH2, 1 x NADH2 and 1 x Acetyl-CoA Last round (C4 FA) generates: 1 x FADH2, 1 x NADH2, and 2 x Acetyl-CoA Therefore: 8 x FADH2 = 16 ATPs 8 x NADH2 = 24 ATPs 9 x Acetyl CoA = 108 ATPs TOTAL energy production per molecule of a C18 FA = 148 ATPs. c) Ketone synthesis - Ketogenesis Synthesis of ketones occurs in the liver when there is accumulation of acetyl CoA i.e. a high rate of β-oxidation. 2 acetyl-CoA (2C) Acetoacetate (4C) CO2 + Acetone (3C) b-hydroxybutyrate (4C) Ketone bodies 2 CoA recycled Blown off at lungs (Fruity breath) Excreted in urine Ketone synthesis – contd… acetyl-CoA oxaloacetate fatty acids Ketogenesis increases when blood glucose is low. Why? glucagon glucose + + X   ketones CoA Notes regarding ketogenesis: • Ketogenesis increases in: - Fasting and starvation - Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (particularly type-1) - Excessive alcohol intake • Ketones are acidic and excess ketones cause a ketoacidosis (or ketosis) • When glucose is in short supply, ketones can be used by the CNS to regenerate acetyl-CoA. acetoacetate acetoacetate-CoA 2 acetyl-CoA TCA cycle CoA CoA Therefore the CNS can use ketones as an alternative fuel source when glucose is low. hepatocyte intestine chylomicron lipoprotein lipasefatty acid triacylglycerol adipocyte with lipid droplet albumin-fatty acid fatty acid fatty acyl-CoA acyl-carnitine b-oxidation acetyl-CoA TCA cycleketones CNS CO2 & ATP acetyl-CoA TCA cycle CO2 & ATP lipolysis 3. Lipid Catabolism - summary ketogenesis acyl-CoA mitochondrion blood Lipid Catabolism •When blood glucose decreases, decreased insulin and increased glucagon & adrenaline stimulate lipolysis of TAGs in the adipose tissue. • Free fatty acids are released into the blood, bind to albumin and are transported to the liver and other tissues. • Inside the cell fatty acids are combined with co-enzyme A to form acyl-CoA. • Acyl-CoA cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane. Therefore it is converted to acyl-carnitine (by carnitine-palmitoyl transferase 1, CPT1). Inside the mitochondrion, acyl-carnitine is converted back to acyl-CoA (by CPT2). • In the mitochondrion acyl-CoA is catabolized by b-oxidation and converted to acetyl-CoA. • Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle for energy metabolism. • Under certain conditions, acetyl-CoA saturates the TCA cycle in the liver and excess acetyl-CoA is converted to ketone bodies. intestine chylomicron glucose glucose Lipoprotein lipase fatty acid triacylglycerol adipocyte with lipid droplet fatty acid acyl-CoA acetyl-CoA TCA cycle acetyl-CoA malonyl-CoA fatty acyl-CoA triacylglycerols VLDL 4) Anabolic processes in lipid metabolism – An overview eicosanoids Lipogenesis cholesterol Eicosanoid synthesis hepatocyte CO2 & ATP Fatty acid synthesis Cholesterol synthesis a) Fatty acid synthesis • Fatty acid synthesis, from ‘glucose’, occurs in the cytosol of the liver. • The process concludes with the synthesis of palmitic acid (C16:0) • The raw materials needed for FA synthesis are: 1. Acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) 2. Malonyl-CoA (3 carbons) • The process is stimulated by insulin. • Essentially, FA synthesis involves the addition of 2 carbons at a time to an acyl chain. FA synthesis Step 1: Get Acetyl-CoA out of the mitochondria and into the cytoplasm “Glucose” Acetyl-CoA, produced from glucose catabolism, is exported from the mitochondrion into the cytosol via citrate shuttle. Inner mitochondrial membrane FA synthesis FA synthesis Step 2: Use some of the acetyl-CoA from step 1 to make malonyl-CoA (2C) (3C) * * Need to know Notes: • Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in FA synthesis • Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is stimulated by insulin and citrate. • Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is inhibited by glucagon, adrenaline and long- chain fatty acids. • Malonyl-CoA inhibits CPT-1 (thereby inhibiting fatty acid uptake into mitochondria and subsequent β-oxidation of fatty acids) FA synthesis Step 3: Add acetyl-CoA from step 1 to malonyl-CoA from step 2 to begin to make a FA chain Cys Pan Enzyme is Fatty acid synthase = Acetyl-CoA CoA Cys Pan CO-CH3 Cys Pan CO-CH3 CO-CH2-COO- Cys Pan CO-CH2-CO-CH3 CO2 Cys Pan CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 2xNADPH 2 x NADP Cys Pan Cys Pan CO(CH2)14CH3 Cys = Cysteine Pan = Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) Malonyl-CoA CoA CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 = 4C FA chain Repeat 7 times = 16C FA chain (palmitic acid)The end result = Summary: Fatty acid synthesis •Fatty acid synthesis requires acetyl-CoA and electrons from NADPH. They are provided (from glucose) by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate shunt respectively. • Acetyl-CoA is produced in the mitochondria whereas enzymes for fatty acid synthesis are in the cytosol. Therefore acetyl-CoA is converted to citrate (first step of the TCA cycle) and transported out of the mitochondrion. Citrate is cleaved to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate re-enters the mitochondrion as pyruvate. • Acetyl-CoA is combined with CO2 to form malonyl-CoA. This is the rate-limiting step of fatty acid synthesis. The enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is activated by insulin and citrate. ACC is inhibited by glucagon, adrenaline and long chain fatty acyl- CoA. • Fatty acid elongation starts with acetyl-CoA, which is condensed with 2 carbons of malonyl-CoA and reduced by NADPH. The addition of 2 carbons from malonyl-CoA is repeated until the chain is 16 carbons long. This gives palmitate/palmitic acid. b) Triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis In liver: + 3 x fatty acids glycerol Glycerol F a t t y a c i d F a t t y a c i d F a t t y a c i d In adipose tissue: TAG synthesis in adipose tissue requires glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate not glycerol. This is obtained from glucose via glycolysis. FAs synthesised in the liver are then used to synthesise TAGs in the liver http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/LIVEHTML/LIVER011.html This is the external surface of a normal liver. The color is brown and the surface is smooth. A normal liver is about 1200 to 1600 grams. This liver is enlarged and has a pale yellow appearance, seen both on the capsule and cut surface. This uniform change is consistent with fatty metamorphosis (fatty change). C) Cholesterol synthesis 3 acetyl-CoA HMG-CoA 2 CoA 2 NADPH2+ 2 NADP+ mevalonate (6C) HMG-CoA reductase Cholesterol is synthesised in the liver from acetyl-CoA. 3hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoAHMG-CoA = mevalonate (6C) cholesterol Lots of ATP, NADPH2, NADH and really complicated stuff that you don’t need to know. Insulin Statins (anti-cholesterol pharmacotherapy) + - Cholesterol Contd.. Occlusion of coronary artery Hypercholesterolaemia Summary – Lipid Anabolism - Synthesis of Fatty Acids, Triacylglycerol and Cholesterol • Fatty acid synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm, mostly in the liver, usually when excess carbohydrate energy is available. • Acetyl-CoA is transferred from the mitochondrion to the cytoplasm via the oxaloacetate shuttle, which involves conversion to citrate followed by regeneration of acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm. • Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the rate limiting production of the 3-carbon, malonyl-CoA, which is stimulated by citrate and insulin. It is inhibited by glucagon (low glucose), adrenaline and long chain fatty acyl-CoA (product inhibition). • Fatty acid synthase catalyzes transfer of 2-carbon fragments from malonyl-CoA to the nascent (growing) fatty acid chain, starting with acetyl-CoA, until there are 16 carbons (palmitate). • Triacylglycerol synthesis requires activation of glycerol to glycerol-phosphate. Adipose tissue lacks glycerol kinase, so it requires glycolysis to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate which is used fro TAG synthesis. • Cholesterol is synthesized, mostly in the liver, by condensation of acetyl-CoA. The rate-limiting step is production of mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase, which is stimulated by insulin and inhibited by glucagon, cholesterol and the “lipid lowering” statin drugs. • Triacylglycerol synthesized in the liver is packaged into VLDL for transport to peripheral tissues, where lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzes it to fatty acids and glycerol. Lipoprotein lipase is stimulated by insulin in adipose tissue. However, in muscles, which use fatty acids for energy production, lipoprotein lipase activity is increased by low glucose levels and adrenaline. VLDL remnants return to the liver. (See Lipid Transport and Lipoproteins) d) The fates of acetyl-CoA Acetyl-CoA Fatty acidsTCA cycleKetones ProteinsFatty acidsGlucose Cholesterol 5. Lipid transport TAGs, cholesterol and phospholipids are synthesised in the liver and are transported in the blood by lipoprototeins. Fatty acids (from lipolysis) are transported bound to albumin. Lipids are hydrophobic and so need a ‘carrier’ to be transported in the blood. A representation of a lipoprotein particle a) Types of lipoproteins - Chylomicrons - Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) - Low density lipoprotein (LDL) - High density lipoprotein (HDL) Summary of roles of lipoproteins Lipoprotein Size (nM) Major lipids transported General role in lipid transport Chylomicrons 30-1000 TAGs (from GIT) Transport of fats from GIT to adipose tissue. VLDL 25-30 TAGs and cholesterol (from liver) Transport of TAGs from liver to adipose tissue and peripheral cells. LDL 20-25 Cholesterol and phospholipids Transport of cholesterol from liver to periphery. HDL 9-12 Cholesterol and phospholipids Transport of cholesterol from periphery to liver. b) The apoproteins (apolipoproteins) The apoproteins serve to act as: • Hydrophilic ‘solubilisers’ of lipid droplets. • Signalling proteins for the interaction of lipoproteins with enzymes and receptors that bring about the transfer of lipoproteins, or the lipids they contain, into the cells. The apoproteins are synthesised in the liver Some important apoproteins: Apoprotein (apo) Lipoproteins Main function ApoB-100 LDL Recognised by the LDL-receptor on cells of the periphery. The LDL receptor brings about the uptake of the lipoprotein particle into the cell i.e. cholesterol move into cells. ApoC-1 and ApoC-11 All lipoproteins Recognised by lipoprotein lipase which then hydrolyses the TAGs in the lipoprotein to form FAs and glycerol in the cell ApoE VLDL, chylomicrons Recognised by the LDL receptor. ApoA-1 and ApoA-11 HDL Recognised by hepatic ‘scavenger receptors’ which bring about the uptake of cholesterol from HDL into the hepatocyte. The cholesterol is then excreted.

More is ‘better’. An increased blood cholesterol indicates an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Normal total cholesterol should be less than 5 mmol/l LDL is ‘bad cholesterol’ because it transports cholesterol from the liver and deposits it in the periphery. More is ‘worse’. Ideally the ratio of total [cholesterol]:[HDL] should be approx. 3:1 e.g. if total cholesterol = 5 mmol/l then [HDL] should be approx. 1.6 mmol/l The lipoproteinaemias Type Sign Features I Increased chylomicrons A rare deficiency in lipoprotein lipase activity. II Increased LDL A genetic deficiency in the LDL receptor. Relatively common in South Africa, particularly among people of Afrikaans descent. IV Increased VLDL Common. Associated with type-II diabetes mellitus. A group of potentially severe conditions relating to errors in lipoprotein metabolism. They are often genetic. 6. The eicosanoids The essential fatty acids (20 carbon’s with 2 extra double bonds) Note: The essential fatty acids are found in cells as components of membrane phospholipids. They are cleaved off these phospholipids before being converted into these eicosanoid precursors. The eicosanoids are the prostaglandins, prostacyclins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes. They are synthesised from precursors made from the essential fatty acids.
