Tshabalala Office no. 2P22, Second floor, Medical school Objectives • Pharyngeal arches and derivatives • Pharyngeal pouches and their derivatives • Pharyngeal grooves and their derivatives • Tongue development and associated abnormalities • Thyroid development and associated abnormalities Pharyngeal archesPharyngeal archesPharyngeal gut Oropharyngeal membrane Pharyngeal arches Pharyngeal arches Pharyngeal arches Pharyngeal arches First pharyngeal arch  Consists of the maxillary process (dorsal) and a ventral mandibular process  (You can use “prominence” and “process” interchangeably)  First pharyngeal arch  Mandibular prominence contains Meckel’s cartilage  Meckel’s cartilage forms incus and malleus of ear  The maxillary prominence gives rise to premaxilla, maxilla, zygomatic bone and part of temporal bone First pharyngeal arch cont…  Muscles include muscles of mastication, anterior belly of digastric, mylohyoid, tensor tympani, and tensor palatine  Muscle innervation is by the mandibular branch of the trigerminal nerve (cranial nerve of the first pharyngeal arch)  Primitive maxillary artery Second pharyngeal arch  Contains cartilage (of the Hyoid arch)  This cartilage gives rise to stapes, styloid process of the temporal bone, stylohyoid ligament, the lesser horn and upper part of the body of the hyoid bone • Muscles include the stapedius, stylohyoid, posterior belly of the digastric, auricular, and muscles of facial expression • These muscles are supplied by the facial nerve • Stapedial artery Third pharyngeal arch  Produces lower part of the body of the hyoid bone  Contributes to the mucosa of the posterior third of the tongue  Stylopharengeus muscles  The muscles are innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve  Internal carotid artery Fourth and sixth arches  Cartilage components fuse to form the thyroid, cricoid, arytenoids, corniculate, and cuneiform cartilages of the larynx  Muscles (cricothyroid, levator palatine, constrictors of pharynx) are innervated by the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus (superior part of the accessory nerve).  Intrinsic muscles of the larynx are supplied by the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus (superior part of the accessory nerve) .
