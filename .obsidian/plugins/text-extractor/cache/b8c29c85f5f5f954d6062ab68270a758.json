Determine the value of a proportional gain controller in a single DOF feedback control system to obtain a steady state error of 3 % for the following plants: a. 50 s + 4 b. 25 s2 + 5s + 4 c. 1 s2 + s + 4 2. Calculate the open and closed loop rise and settling times for the plants in question 1. 3. For the plants and controllers in question 1, determine the changes required to be made to the controller gain to make the closed loop settling times of the plants less than 20 % of their open loop values. This requirement is in addition to the control requirements of question 1. 4. Given the figure below, determine the bandwidth of the plant and the closed loop system. Adjust Kp such that the bandwidth of the closed loop system is 4 times that of the plant. 1 s(s + 2)(s + 6) K2=5K1=10 Y(s) Plant - Us(s) + 5. For the plants in question 1: a. Derive an expression for the sensitivity of the closed loop systems to any changes in the plants’ transfer function (from 1st principles) b. Determine the percentage change in the steady state gain of the closed loop systems if the DC gains of the plants increased by 50 % c. Determine the percentage change in the control systems’ bandwidths if the plants’ bandwidths doubled.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
