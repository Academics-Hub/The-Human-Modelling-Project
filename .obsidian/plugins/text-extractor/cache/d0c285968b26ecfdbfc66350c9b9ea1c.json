Structure and function of the intestinal epitheliumBacklinksMedical papersRegulation of Oxygen Homeostasis at the Intestinal Epithelial Barrier SiteAbstractThe unique biology of the intestinal epithelial barrier is linked to a low baseline oxygen pressure (pO2), characterised by a high rateof metabolites circulating through the intestinal blood and the presence of a steep oxygen gradient across the epithelial surface.These characteristics require tight regulation of oxygen homeostasis, achieved in part by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependentsignalling. Furthermore, intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) possess metabolic identities that are reflected in changes in mitochondrialfunction. In recent years, it has become widely accepted that oxygen metabolism is key to homeostasis at the mucosae. In addition,the gut has a vast and diverse microbial population, the microbiota. Microbiome-gut communication represents a dynamic exchangeof mediators produced by bacterial and intestinal metabolism. The microbiome contributes to the maintenance of the hypoxicenvironment, which is critical for nutrient absorption, intestinal barrier function, and innate and/or adaptive immune responses in thegastrointestinal tract. In this review, we focus on oxygen homeostasis at the epithelial barrier site, how it is regulated by hypoxia andthe microbiome, and how oxygen homeostasis at the epithelium is regulated in health and disease.b.

Oxygen homeostasis is crucial for maintaining overall body function.2. The intestinal epithelial barrier plays a significant role in regulating systemic oxygen balance.3. Oxygen sensing mechanisms, including HIF-1, PHDs, and IREs, are involved in this process.4. Dietary factors can influence oxygen sensing and homeostasis.5. Further research is needed to understand the intestinal epithelial barrier's role in oxygen regulation and its implications for humanhealth.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
