The Thigh • The thigh is the part of the lower limb between the hip and knee joints. • For descriptive purposes, the thigh is divided into three regions; • Front of the thigh • Medial side of the thigh • Back of the thigh • The front of the thigh corresponds to the back of arm. Surface Landmarks • Fold of the groin • It is a shallow curved groove extending from the pubic tubercle to the anterior superior iliac spine. • It corresponds to the underlying inguinal ligament and separates the anterior abdominal wall from the front of the thigh. • Anterior superior iliac spine • It is palpated at the lateral end of the fold of the groin. • Pubic tubercle • It is a small bony projection felt at the medial end of the fold of groin.

Superficial Fascia of the Thigh • The superficial fascia has two layers, • a superficial fatty layer and a deep membranous layer • both layers are continuous with the fascia layers of the anterior abdominal wall. • They are clearly marked in the uppermost part of the thigh, near the groin. • Here the cutaneous nerves, vessels and lymph nodes lie between the two layers. Superficial Fascia of the Thigh • The membranous layer loosely attaches to the deep fascia of the thigh except near the inguinal ligament, • Here it is firmly attached along a horizontal line called Holden's line. • It begins a little lateral to the pubic tubercle and extends laterally for about 8 cm • The superficial fascia contains • cutaneous nerves and arteries, • the great saphenous vein and its tributaries, • superficial inguinal lymph nodes. Cutaneous Nerves of the Anterior Thigh • Seven cutaneous nerves innervate the skin of the thigh and could be direct or indirect branches from the lumbar plexus. • The ilioinguinal nerve (L1) • Supplies • the skin at the root of the penis or over the mons pubis in the female, • the anterior one-third of the scrotum or labia majus, • the superomedial part of the thigh. • The femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve (L1, L2) • It pierces the femoral sheath and the overlying deep fascia 2 cm below the midinguinal point. • It supplies most of the skin over the femoral triangle. Cutaneous Nerves of the Anterior Thigh • The lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh (L2, L3) • It is a branch of the lumbar plexus and divides into anterior and posterior branches. • It supplies the skin on the anterolateral side of the thigh and on the anterior part of the gluteal region. • The medial cutaneous nerve of the thigh (L2, L3) • It is a branch of the femoral nerve, supplies the medial aspect of the thigh and joins the patellar plexus. • The intermediate cutaneous nerve of the thigh (L2, L3) • It is a branch of the femoral nerve, divides into two branches that supply the anterior aspect of the thigh and joins the patellar plexus.

The Great Saphenous Vein • It is the largest and longest superficial vein of the lower limb. • It begins on the dorsum of the foot from the medial end of the dorsal venous arch. • It then runs upward in front of the medial malleolus, on the medial side of the leg. • It enters the medial aspect of the thigh by passing behind the knee. • It reaches the saphenous opening by piercing the cribriform fascia and opens into the femoral vein. • Before piercing the cribriform fascia, it receives three tributaries: • Superficial epigastric vein, superficial external pudendal vein, and superficial circumflex iliac vein Superficial Inguinal Lymph Nodes • These lymph nodes are variable in their number and size and their efferent drain into the deep inguinal nodes. • There are of two sets. • The nodes of the upper horizontal set (5 or 6 in number) • Located a short distance below the inguinal ligament. • They can further be divided into upper lateral and upper medial groups. • The nodes of the lower vertical set (4 or 5 in number) • They lie along the upper part of the long saphenous vein. Deep Inguinal Lymph Nodes • The deep nodes are located beneath the deep fascia and lie along the medial side of the femoral vein. • The efferent vessels from these nodes enter the abdomen by passing through the femoral canal to lymph nodes along the external iliac artery. Deep Fascia of the Thigh (Fascia Lata) • It encloses the thigh and at its upper end is attached to the pelvis and the inguinal ligament. • It presents 2 modifications within the thigh (iliotibial tract & saphenous opening). • Iliotibial tract • It is the thickened form of the deep fascia on its lateral aspect. • It is attached above to the iliac tubercle and below to the lateral condyle of the tibia. • The iliotibial tract receives the insertion of the tensor fasciae latae and the greater part of the g. max. muscle. Deep Fascia of the Thigh (Fascia Lata) • The saphenous opening • It is an oval opening in the deep fascia just below the inguinal ligament. • It transmits the great saphenous vein, some small branches of the femoral artery, and lymph vessels. • The saphenous opening is situated about 4 cm below and lateral to the pubic tubercle. • It has a sharp, upper, lateral and lower margins which form the falciform margin and an ill defined medial margin. • The saphenous opening is filled with loose connective tissue called the cribriform fascia. https://www.jaypeedigital.com/book/9789351529637/chapter/ch23 Intermuscular Septa • The deepest aspect of the fascia lata gives rise to three intermuscular septa that attach centrally to the femur. • Three intermuscular septa divide the thigh into three compartments • The lateral intermuscular septum • It is the thickest and extends from the iliotibial tract to the lateral lip of the linea aspera. • It separates the anterior compartment of the thigh from the posterior compartment. • The medial intermuscular septum • It is attached to the medial lip of the linea aspera • It separates the anterior compartment of the thigh from the medial compartment. • The posterior intermuscular septum • It is poorly defined and separates the medial compartment of the thigh from the posterior compartment. Clinical Significance of the Deep Fascia • The fascia lata is attached to the inguinal ligament. • Extension of the thighs pull the abdominal wall downwards and makes it tense. • To relax the abdomen fully for palpation by an examining physician, the patient is asked to draw the legs up. • This overcomes the pull of the fascia lata on the abdominal wall.

Clinical Significance of the Femoral Artery • Compression of the femoral artery • The femoral artery can be compressed against the femoral head at the mid-inguinal point to control the bleeding in the distal part of the limb. • Palpation of the femoral artery • The pulsations of the femoral artery are felt by the clinicians in the femoral triangle just below the mid-inguinal point. • Cannulation of the femoral artery • It is the preferred artery for cannulation and injecting dye to perform procedures like angiography. • It is also the preferred vessel for performing the coronary angiography and angioplasty.

Clinical Significance of the Adductor Canal • Adductor Canal Block • It anesthetizes multiple distal branches of the femoral nerve in the adductor canal. • It could block the saphenous nerve in isolation, or together with the nerve to the vastus medialis or sometimes branches of obturator nerve. • Adductor Canal Compression Syndrome • It occurs following entrapment of the neurovascular structures within the canal . • Although rare, it could be as a result of hypertrophy of surrounding muscles. • It is most common in young males, who may present with claudication symptoms due to femoral artery occlusion • The femoral artery is exposed and ligated in the adductor canal during surgery for aneurysm of the popliteal artery.
