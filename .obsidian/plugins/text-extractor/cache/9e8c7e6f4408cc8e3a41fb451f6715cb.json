Human Brain • Weight constitute 2 - 2.5% of body weight • Receives about 15% or ⅟6 of cardiac output (approx. 750 ml of blood/minute) • Utilizes approx. 20-25% or ⅟5 of total oxygen of whole body • High metabolic rate 5 Sources of supply • Two (2) pairs of arterial trunks which form a complex anastomosis (circle of Willis), namely • Internal carotid artery • Forebrain & occipital lobe of cerebrum • Vertebral artery • Occipital lobe, brainstem & cerebellum, upper spinal cord 6 Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) • Origin • Bifurcation of common carotid artery • Course: • Extracranial part enters cranial cavity via carotid canal • Intracranial S-shape curve called carotid siphon • Petrous part of temporal bone • Side of sphenoid & within cavernous sinus in close relation with CN III, IV, V & VI, reaches base of brain lateral to optic chiasm • cerebral course pierces dura mater to reach anterior perforated space 7 ICA Extracerebral Branches of Internal Carotid Artery • Petrous part in petrous part of temporal bone • Caroticotympanic branch to tympanic cavity • Pterygoid artery to pterygoid canal • Cavernous part* in lateral wall of cavernous sinus • Cavernous brs • Meningeal brs • Hypophysial brs • After cavernous course • Ophthalmic to contents of orbital cavity 8 * Cerebral branches • Choroidal • Anterior cerebral • Middle cerebral • Choriodal • Choroidal plexus, globus pallidus, posterior limb of internal capsule, optic tract and radiation, hippocampus 9  Posterior communicating: ➢ branch of internal carotid artery Anterior cerebral Artery (ACA) • Smaller terminal branch of ICA • Cortical branches • medial surface & marginal area of superolateral surfaces of cerebrum • Central branches: • to deep structures in cerebral hemispheres • rostrum of corpus callosum, septum pellucidum, putamen, head of nucleus 10 ACA Middle cerebral artery (MCA)  Larger terminal branch of ICA  Cortical branches supply:  superolateral surface & temporal pole  Central branches: 2 sets  Medial striate: caudate nucleus, internal capsule, lentiform nucleus  Lateral striate: caudate nucleus  Charcot’s artery of cerebral haemorrhage – largest & most frequently ruptured in apoplexy 11 MCAVertebral Artery • Origin • First part of subclavian artery • Course • Prevertebral • Vertebral (Transverse foramen of C6 to C1 vertebrae) • Atlantic then passes through Foramen magnum to become intracranial • Ends at lower border of pons by joining opposite vertebral artery to form basilar artery 12 Branches of vertebral artery and area supplied ❖ Posterior spinal:  Dorsal 1/3rd of spinal cord & dorsal root ganglion ❖ Anterior spinal:  Ventral 2/3rd spinal cord ❖ Posterior inferior cerebellar (PICA):  Largest branch & supplies cerebellum ❖ Medullary:  Medulla oblongata ❖ Basilar:  Formed by union of vertebral arteries 13 Branches of Basilar artery  Anterior inferior cerebellar (AICA) o Inferior surface of cerebellum  *Labyrinthine (internal auditory) o Internal ear  Pontine o pons  Superior cerebellar (SC) o Superior surface of cerebellum and anastomose with AICA  Posterior cerebral (PC) 14 AICA * } Pontine SC PC PICA ICA AC Basilar Posterior cerebral Artery (PCA) • The terminal branches of basilar • Cortical • inferior surface of cerebrum, occipital pole (visual cortex) • Central • thalamus, 3rd ventricle, globus pallidus • Posterior choroidal • choroid plexus of lateral ventricle, thalamus, fornix & tectum of midbrain 15 PCA PCA Circle of Willis  Arterial anastomosis connecting vertebrobasilar & internal carotid systems  Location: ➢ Base of interpeduncular fossa  Branches Involved ➢ Anterior communicating ➢ Anterior cerebral ➢ Internal carotid ➢ Posterior communicating ➢ Posterior cerebral 16 Importance: 1. Equalise blood flow to various parts of brain maintaining a constant supply of oxygen & glucose even when a contributing artery is narrowed or in head movements 2. Furnishes collateral circulation in cases of occlusion of one or more of arteries contributing to circle © The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc, 2011 Vasculature of the Central Nervous System Note the cortical areas supplied by each cerebral artery on this superolateral surface © The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc, 2011 Vasculature of the Central Nervous System Note the cortical areas supplied by each cerebral artery on this medial surface Brain angiogram 19 Identify the arteries in the Angiogram Blood supply to spinal cord • At medulla, vertebral arteries give off anterior spinal artery (ASA) • 10 to 12 segmental (medullary) arteries (brs of aorta) join anterior spinal artery • Vertebral arteries (or PICA) give rise to paired posterior spinal arteries (PSA) that run along dorsal surface. 20 Disorder of blood supply to spinal cord • Most vulnerable in thoracic region & anterior part of spinal cord • Occlusion of anterior spinal artery leads to acute thoracic cord syndrome with paraplegia & incontinence (because sympathetic nerves emerge from lateral horns of thoracic segment of spinal cord) www.frca.co.uk/images/spinal-cord4.jpg Venous Drainage of brain Characteristic Features of the veins that drain the brain • No valves • Extremely thin walls • Lack muscular tissue in tunica media • Pierce arachnoid mater & inner layer of dura mater • End in dural venous sinuses Organized in three sets of veins • Superficial veins • Deep veins • Dural venous sinuses 22 Superficial & Deep veins • Superficial veins within subarachnoid space • Superior cerebral to superior sagittal sinus (SSS) • Superficial middle cerebral to Cavernous Sinus • Inferior cerebral veins empty into SSS, Transvers Sinus (TrS) & Straight sinus (SS) • Superior & inferior cerebellar veins into TrS & SS • Deep veins: Thalamostriate + choroidal = internal cerebral (2)+ basal vein = Great cerebral (of Galen) + inferior sagittal sinus = Straight sinus Dural Venous Sinus  Located between the 2 layers of dura mater  Namely  Superior sagittal sinus (SSS)  Inferior sagittal sinus (ISS)  Straight sinus (SS)  Transverse sinus (TrS)  Occipital sinus (OS)  Cavernous (CS) & intercavernous sinus  Superior petrosal sinus (SpS)  Inferior petrosal sinus (IpS) Review location, termination and whether single or paired. Pay special attention to the learning objective for cavernous sinus Clinical Anatomy  One of the most common causes of neurological disability is Stroke (Ischemic or hemorrhagic)  Sudden occlusion of a cerebral artery leading to death of brain tissue (Infarction)  Cerebral haemorrhage Aneurysm: abnormal ballon-like swelling of an artery which may rupture & blood enters subarachnoid space (subarachnoid haemorrhage) or into brain (intracerebral haemorrhage) www.stroke.org.nz/.../understand_stroke.html Rai et al 2018 The most common sites for developing aneurysm include the: ✓ Anterior Communicating artery (30 - 35%) ✓ Bifurcation of Internal Carotid and Posterior Communicating artery (30 - 35%) ✓ Bifurcation of Middle cerebral (20%) ✓ Basilar artery bifurcation (5%) ✓ Remaining posterior circulation arteries (5%) Note relationship between CNIII and PCA and SCA Questions • Use a well labelled diagram to show the branches of the arterial blood supply to the brain • Enumerate the branches involve in the ‘Circle of Willis’. Add a note on the clinical significance of the Circle of Willis • Draw a diagram of the cerebral hemispheres showing the areas supplied by the cerebral arteries • Describe the blood supply to the spinal cord • What are the characteristic features of the veins of the brain. • How is the great cerebral vein (of Galen) formed and where does it terminate • List the dural venous sinuses. • What structures are located in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
