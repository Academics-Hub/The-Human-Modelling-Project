Learning objectives 2 IMAGING MODALITIES: • X-RAY. • FLUOROSCOPY ( CONTRAST STUDY). • ULTRASOUND. • CT. • MRI. • NUCLEAR MEDICINE. • ANGIOGRAPHY. ❖ What radiological modalities are GOOD in imaging the abdomen mainly the STOMACH and BOWEL LOOPS? ✓ X-ray ✓ Fluoroscopy ✓ CT scan ✓ MRI X-ray ( plain radiography) • Often used as first imaging modality. • Cheap. • Fast. • Can be done bedside (portable) • Useful for free gas or bowel obstruction. ❖INDICATIONS ▪Abdominal pain ▪Bowel obstruction ▪Stones ▪Masses ▪Trauma ▪Others, foreign body, supportive lines.. Etc ❖CONTRAINDICATIONS: ▪Pregnancy Image key = shades White ----- bone and calcification Black ----- air Grey ------ soft tissue IMAGING MODALITIES Normal Abdominal X-Ray (AXR) Normal AXR 11th rib Hepatic flexure Gas in stomach T12 Gas in caecum Iliac crest Femoral head SI joint Gas in sigmoid Transverse colon Splenic flexure Psoas margin Sacrum Left kidney Liver Bladder • Stomach • Almost always air in stomach • Small bowel • Usually small amount of air in 2 or 3 loops • Large bowel • Almost always air in rectum and sigmoid • Varying amount of gas in rest of large bowel NORMAL X-ray First step of reading an Abdominal X- ray is assessing gas pattern 3, 6, 9 RULE Maximum Normal Diameter of bowel Small bowel 3cm Colon 6cm Caecum 9cm Bowel diameter ABNORMAL X-ray Small bowl obstruction characterized by: •Dilated bowel loops •Air fluid levels •Coiled springs SBO causes: 1-Adhesion from previous abdominal surgery (most common cause) 2-hernias containing bowl 3-neoplasm Small bowel obstruction (note the dilated loops of small bowel creating a “coiled-spring” appearance). ABNORMAL X-ray Large bowl obstruction characterized by: •Dilation of colon •Little/no air fluid levels (colon reabsorbs water) •Little /no air in rectum/sigmoid colon Causes of Large bowl obstruction: 1-Tumor (carcinoma) 2-Hernia 3-Volvulus 4-Diverticulitis 5-Intussusception Large bowel obstruction Sigmoid volvulus occurs when an air-filled loop of the sigmoid colon twists about its mesentery. Coffee Bean Sign Sigmoid volvulusCoffee Bean Sign Sigmoid volvulus Massively dilated sigmoid loop Sigmoid volvulus Caecal volvulus Extraluminal air ▪ Second step of reading an abdominal X-ray is assessing for extra luminal Air. ▪ Pneumoperitoneum Signs of free air: ▪ Riglers sign ▪ Football sign ▪ Falciform ligament sign Rigler’s Sign Rigler’s sign Pneumoperitoneum (free gas under the diaphragm) ▪ Bowel wall visualised on both sides due to extraluminal air ▪ Usually large amounts of free air ▪ May be confused with overlapping loops of bowel, confirm with upright view The Rigler sign, or double-wall sign, is an indication of free air enclosed within the peritoneal cavity (pneumoperitoneum), imprinting a visible pattern on a plain radiographic image of the abdomen, in supine technique. Football Sign Seen with massive pneumoperitoneum Most often in children with necrotising enterocolitis Paediatric Adult In supine position air collects anterior to abdominal viscera Falciform ligament sign Supine film, free air rises over anterior surface of liver The falciform ligament sign, also called the “silver sign” corresponds to the presence of air in the falciform ligament. The distance between loops of bowel is increased due to thickening of the bowel wall. The haustral folds are very thick, leading to a sign known as 'thumbprinting.' Inflammatory bowel disease: ▪ Thumbprinting 3rd step in reading an X-ray: Checking for calcifications Renal calculi Renal calculi Renal stones/calculi are concretions of inorganic material within the renal collecting system. 90% of renal calculi contain enough calcium to be visible on abdominal X-rays. Staghorn Calcification Renal stones are often small, but if large can fill the renal pelvis or a calyx, taking on its shape which is likened to a staghorn. Bladder calculi Bladder stones are hard masses of minerals in your bladder. They develop when the minerals in concentrated urine crystallize and form stones Other organs and structures • Lungs: inspect the lung bases for pathology (e.g. consolidation) as abdominal pain can, in some cases, be caused by basal pneumonia. • Liver: a large right upper quadrant structure. • Gallbladder: rarely visible on an abdominal X-ray, however, you should quickly inspect for calcified gallstones and cholecystectomy clips. • Stomach: visible between the left upper quadrant and midline, containing a variable amount of air. • Psoas muscles: the lateral edge is marked by a relatively straight line either side of the lumbar vertebrae and sacrum. • Kidneys: both are often visible, the right kidney is lower than the left due to the presence of the liver on the right. • Spleen: located in the left upper quadrant, superior to the left kidney. • Bladder: has a variable appearance depending on the fullness of the bladder. BONES Bony structures commonly visible on abdominal X-ray include: • Ribs • Lumbar vertebrae • Sacrum • Coccyx • Pelvis • Proximal femurs Kidney Kidneys are retroperitoneal organs and may be obscured by bowel loops Long axis of the kidneys is directed downward and outward, parallel to the lateral border of the psoas muscles Renal Stones • Radio-lucent (calcium , struvite) (can be seen in X-RAY) • Radio-opaque (uric acid , cysteine) (can’t be seen in X-RAY) The best modality for the diagnosis of renal stones is non-contrast CT Struvite: (magnesium ammonium phosphate) -Contrast CT will mask the stones because the whole area will become bright -In the other hand non-contrast CT will only make the stones appear bright as you can see in the picture. KIDNEY DISEASES Hydronephrosis -A block in the drainage of the renal system which causes the urine to accumulate in the renal pelvis. -When there is a complete obstruction to the ureter by a stone , the kidney eventually fills with urine and become swollen along the ureter Pyelonephritis • It is the infection of the kidney. • Acute pyelonephritis results from bacterial invasion of the renal parenchyma. Bacteria usually reach the kidney by ascending from the lower urinary tract. • CT scan for a patient with pyelonephritis, we do it only if the patient doesn't respond to the treatment or he had a recurrent pyelonephritis. -You can notice how the kidney pelvis is dilated or extended if you compare it to the normal ultrasound End-stage renal disease (ESRD) -ESRD causes Kidney atrophy -In the picture below we can see atrophy in the left kidney -The right kidney is trying to compensate, that’s why it’s hypertrophied Tumors 1-Benign most common type is angiomyolipoma. 2-Malignant most common type is renal cell carcinoma. Horseshoe Kidney Ectopic Kidney Polycystic Kidney Disease Congenital kidney diseases Ureter vesicoureteral reflux disease -This disease characterized by backflow of the urine -How do we diagnose it ? By giving the patient contrast , after that we will see it go from the ureter back to kidney Ureter pathology Urinary bladder Cystitis Image 1: an inflamed urinary bladder (thick surrounding walls). Image 2: This bladder has gas bubbles that could be due to inflammation or infection from ‘gas producing’ bacteria. Benign Prostate Hypertrophy Bladder Prostate -Hypertrophied prostate causing the bladder to be compressed Urinary bladder pathologiesQuiz 1)What modality is cheap and with no Ionized radiation? A- Ultrasound B- X-ray C- CT-scan D- MRI 2)What type of stones we can see under X-ray? A- Radio-opaque B- Radio-lucent 3)What is the best modality used to diagnose renal stones?
