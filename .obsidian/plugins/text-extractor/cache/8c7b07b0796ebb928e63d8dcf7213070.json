Contains peptide bonds Primary structure •Two regular folding patterns ( helix and  pleated sheet) are found as dictated by amino acids in primary sequence –secondary structure. •They result from hydrogen-bonding between the N–H and C=O groups in the polypeptide backbone Secondary structure •In a α helix, a single polypeptide chain twists to form a rigid cylinder. •Hydrogen bonds within polypeptide chain spaced four amino acids apart. Secondary structure:  helix •Rigid planar structures with hydrogen bonds between amino acids in adjacent strands. •β sheets can form either from neighbouring polypeptide chains that run in the same orientation (parallel chains) or from a polypeptide chain that folds back and forth upon itself, with each section of the chain running in the direction opposite to that of its immediate neighbours (antiparallel chains).

Protein Kinase 11 Methylation and Acetylation • Methylation –transfer of carbon methyl groups to nitrogen or oxygen to amino acid side chains increase the hydrophobicity of the protein and can neutralise a negative amino acid charge when bound to carboxylic acids. • Lysine amino acids particularly of the N- and C-terminal tails of histones can be methylated (addition of methyl CH3) or acetylated (addition of acetyl COCH3). + C + CH3 = • Acetylation regulates many diverse functions, including DNA recognition, protein- protein interaction and protein stability • Arginine residues can be methylated + COCH3 = 12 Ubiquitination / Ubiquitylation Ubiquitin is an 8-kDa polypeptide consisting of 76 amino acids •It is appended to the Îµ-NH2 of lysine in target proteins via the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin. •Plays role in regulating cell cycle, p53, signalling pathways e.g. Wnt and NFkB and endocytosis •Following an initial monoubiquitination event, the formation of a ubiquitin polymer may occur, and –polyubiquitinated proteins are then recognized by the 26S proteasome that catalyzes the degradation of the ubiquitinated protein and the recycling of ubiquitin. 13 Glycosylation •Addition of saccharides (sugars) to proteins to produce proteoglycans in ER, Golgi or cytoplasm •significant effects on protein folding, conformation, distribution, stability and activity e.g. ABO blood group proteins on red blood cells , gp120 of HIV Nature Chemical Biology 10, 990-999(2014) http://www.biochronicles.net 14 Protein Analysis Tools •SDS-PAGE •Isoelectric focusing •2D-Gel Electrophoresis •ELISA •Western Blot Separation and identification •ELISA •Protein arrays •Structure-based methods •Crystallography •NMR Quantification and Characterisation •Chromatography Purification 15 Lecture objectives By the end of the lecture students should be able to: •Describe the principles of protein separation methods •Discuss when and why protein tools are utilised •Analyse results obtained using protein analysis tools 16 SDS-PAGE 171819 2D-Gel Electrophoresis 20 Isoelectric focusing (IEF) 21 http://www.bio-rad.com/en-za/applications-technologies/isoelectric-focusing-2d-electrophoresis ELISA –enzyme linked immunosorbent assay •Detect presence and amount of analyte in a solution. •c 22 http://www.abcam.com/cytochrome-c-profiling-elisa-kit- ab110172.html Types of ELISAs 23 http://nptel.ac.in/courses/102103047/30 Western Blot •SDS-PAGE •Transfer proteins to nitrocellulose membrane producing a band for each protein •Blocking step •Membrane is incubated with primary Ab •Wash to remove unbound Ab •Incubate with secondary Ab conjugated to enzyme •Wash step •Measure the elicited signal 24 https://www.moleculardevices.com/systems/microplate-readers/multi-mode-readers/scanlater-western-blot-detection- cartridge Protein arrays • High-throughput ELISA. • Qualitative: Identification of novel protein-protein, receptor-ligand, Ab-Ag complexes • Quantitative: Evaluation of relative expression levels of different proteins between different tissue/cell types, or between the same sample under different conditions. 25 RECOMBINANT PROTEINS 26 Lecture objectives •Provide the definition of recombinant proteins •Explain the procedures used to produce recombinant protein. •Explain the principles responsible for the synthesis of recombinant proteins. •Describe the relevance of recombinant proteins in the medical field. After this lecture, students should be able to: 27 Introduction •Important role in structural and functional organisation of a cell. Proteins are the most abundant molecules of living organisms. •Recombinant material is introduced into a host cell. Recombinant technology refers to the recombination of the genetic material of one organism with another in vitro. Recombinant proteins (rProtein) result from the expression of recombinant DNA (rDNA) within living cells. Once rDNA is inserted into bacteria, these bacteria will make protein based on the rDNA being translated into rProtein. 28 Cloning ‘Expression Cassettes’ www.genetic-eng.blogspot.com DNA Restriction enzyme Gene Human Cell Bacterium DNA Plasmid Bacterium Restriction enzyme Plasmid 1. 2. 3. 4. 29 Host cell Recombinant Protein Expression •Bacteria (E coli) - Transformation » Electroporation (‘shock’) » Chemical (calcium salts + Heat shock) •Eukaryotic cells - Transfection » Electroporation (‘shock’) » Chemical (calcium salts (Old); Lipids (Modern) » Microinjection ‘overexpressed’ mRNA‘overexpressed’ protein can be up to 50% of the total protein in certain cases! 30 Host expression systems • Prokaryotic cells (E.coli), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), insect cells (bacilovirus), mammalian cells (CHO –Chinese hamster cells), in vitro expression systems Choosing expression system: 1. What type of protein do I want to express? Expressing protein of prokaryotic origin –E.coli Quick, cheap and the organism has all the required machinery for folding and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) 2. Do I get soluble protein when I express in E.coli First method of choice for expression of eukaryotic protein is normally bacteria. However, many eukaryotic proteins do not fold properly in E.coli resulting in the formation of insoluble aggregates called inclusion bodies –It is best to use a mammalian cell in this case 3. Does my protein need PTMs for structure/activity? Many proteins need to be modified after translation. This enable the protein to become active and/or adapt the proper structure. Complex modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are exclusively carried out in eukaryotic cells. 31 Protein expression and purification Isolation of gene Insertion of isolated gene into expression vector.
