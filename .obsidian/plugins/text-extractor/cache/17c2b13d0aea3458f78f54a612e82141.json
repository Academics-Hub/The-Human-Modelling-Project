We should select a cutoff frequency for the low-pass filter so that the oscillations in the signal are eliminated as much as possible. This doesn’t specify a precise criterion, however. Here is the signal before and after filtering with a 2 nd order Butterworth low-pass filter with ωc =100π : The next output plot uses ωc =20π, giving a smoother result, although it takes longer to get there: (b) Here is the signal after filtering with a 4 th order Butterworth filter with ωc =20π: 6.11, (c) [b, a] = butter(2, 20*pi, ‘s’); freqs(b, a); 101 102 103 -200 -150 -100 -50 0 Frequency (rad/s)Phase (degrees) 101 102 103 10-3 10-2 10-1 100 Frequency (rad/s)Magnitude Frequency Response for 2nd order Butterworth, ωc = 20π [b, a] = butter(4, 20*pi, ‘s’); freqs(b, a); 101 102 103 -200 -100 0 100 200 Frequency (rad/s)Phase (degrees) 101 102 103 10-5 100 Frequency (rad/s)Magnitude Frequency Response for 4th order Butterworth, ωc = 20π 6.11, (d) For the 2 nd order filter: [b, a]=butter(2, 20*pi, ‘s’); h = freqs(b, a, [377:378]); abs(h(1)); angle(h(1)); Gives: |H(377)| = 0.0278, θ(377) = -2.9.
