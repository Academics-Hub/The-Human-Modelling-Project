JOVANOVIĆ Layers of the (thin) skin D H http://www.histology-world.com/photoalbum/displayimage.php?album=23&pid=1701 E E D H • Slide 36: Skin of scalp Thin skin Epidermis (E) Dermis (D) Hypodermis (H) http://www.histology-world.com/photoalbum/displayimage.php?album=23&pid=1701 H Sebaceous gland Eccrine sweat gland Hair follicle E D E D Stratum corneum Stratum spinosum Stratum basale Stratum granulosum Note: Relatively thin stratum corneum and no stratum lucidum. Compare with the five layers of the epidermis in the thick skin, where stratum lucidum is present. Note: Stratum granulosum in thin skin is made up of one layer of cells or individual cells with keratohyaline granules, while in thick skin (see later) stratum granulosum is composed of 3 to 6 layers of granular cells. Note: Cuboidal cells of the stratum basale which give rise to all other keratinocytes of the epidermis. Note: Clear cells in between the keratinocytes of the stratum basale. Which clear cells are they? Clear cells Epidermis Papillary dermis Reticular dermis Dermal papilla Epidermal ridge (Rete peg) NOTE the randomly arranged collagen fibers of dense irregular connective tissue of the reticular dermis and more cellular connective tissue of the papillary dermis. ECCRINE SWEAT GLAND Refer to the road map on GLANDS and revise on the two glands found in thick and thin skin. Remember to cover their identification, classification, mode and nature of secretion! What is the functional significance and composition of sweat? The eccrine sweat gland duct labelled with an arrow, secretory end pieces encircled in black. Hypodermis SEBACEOUS GLAND opening into a hair follicle. What type of muscle is the arrector pili muscle and what is its function? Note: The nature of secretion of a sebaceous gland is not serous or mucous! These glands secrete sebum - composed of an oily mixture of lipids. Arrector pili muscle Secretory end piece • Slide 35 or 42 Skin of scalp or finger tip Thick skin Stratum corneum Stratum lucidum Stratum granulosum Stratum spinosum Stratum basale D H Stratum corneum Stratum lucidum Stratum granulosum Stratum spinosum Stratum basale Papillary dermis Reticular dermis Epidermis Dermis Melanin pigment “Spines” in between the cells of stratum spinosum Keratohyaline granules NOTE: Melanin pigment is produced and secreted by clear cells called melanocytes. These cells do not store the pigment but rather “injected” it into the surrounding keratinocytes. NOTE numerous darkly stained keratohyaline granules in the flattened cells of Stratum granulosum. Stratum spinosum Stratum lucidum Stratum granulosum (3 – 6 layers of cells) Clear cells NOTE: If the clear cell is found in the Stratum basale it is either a Merkel cell or melanocyte, if found in the Stratum spinosum it is a Langerhans cell. Epidermal ridge (Rete peg) DERMAL PAPILLA An area composed of loose connective tissue and situated in between two adjacent epidermal ridges Epidermal ridge (Rete peg) Dermal papilla NOTE interdigitations between epidermis and dermis. Outlined in black are two epidermal ridges (Rete pegs)and in between them are two dermal papillae. Outlined in dashed line is encapsulated nerve fiber called Meissner’s corpuscle situated within the connective tissue of dermal papilla (see later). NOTE the duct of an eccrine sweat gland (arrows) spiraling from the dermis and epidermis (through Stratum basale, spinosum, granulosum, lucidum and very thick corneum) eventfully reaching the free surface of the thick skin were the sweat is secreted. Reticular dermis Location: Pacinian corpuscle – Reticular dermis or hypodermis Meissner’s corpuscle – Papillary dermis of dermal papilla • Slide 29 Skin of axilla Apocrine sweat gland NOTE: secretory end pieces of apocrine sweat gland of axilla and the “pinched” apical portion of the secretory cells (arrow) typical for this mode of secretion.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
