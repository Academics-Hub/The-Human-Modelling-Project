supraclavicular lymph nodes POSTERIOR TRIANGLE CONTENTS: NERVES Accessory nerve: •Emerges from the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle about a 1/3 of the way down •It passes inferiorly and posteriorly to disappear beneath the anterior border of the trapezius muscle approximately between 3-5cm above the clavicle Clinical note: The accessory nerve is liable to injury in operations involving the lymph nodes, one or two of which may lie in contact with the nerve POSTERIOR TRIANGLE CONTENTS: CERVICAL PLEXUS (CUTANEOUS BRANCHES) LESSER OCCIPITAL NERVE (C2): •Slender branch hooking around the accessory nerve •Runs up along the posterior border of SCM •Supplies the upper parts of the neck & adjacent scalp behind the auricle and possibly the auricle •GREAT AURICULAR NERVE (C2,3): •Large trunk passing almost vertically upwards over SCM •Distributed to an area of skin on the face over the angle of the mandible, the parotid gland and the parotid fascia •Also supplies the skin of the auricle over the whole of its cranial surface and lower part of its lateral surface below the external acoustic meatus and skin over the mastoid region •Branches passing deep to the parotid gland supply the deep layer of the parotid fascia POSTERIOR TRIANGLE CONTENTS: CERVICAL PLEXUS (CUTANEOUS BRANCHES) TRANSVERSE CERVICAL (C2,3): •Curves around the posterior border of SCM •Perforates the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia and divides into ascending and descending branches that innervate the skin of the front of the neck from the chin to the sternum •The ascending branch also communicates with the cervical branch of the facial nerve SUPRACLAVICULAR NERVE (C3,4): •Emerges with the other superficial nerves at the posterior border of SCM and then soon divides into several branches •Branches are distributed into 3 main groups •The medial group – supply the skin as far down as the sternum •The intermediate group – pass anterior to the clavicle and supply the skin as far

SUPRASCAPULAR NERVE INJURY: •Vulnerable to injury in fractures of the middle third of the clavicle •Injury of the nerve results in loss of lateral rotation of the humerus at the glenohumeral joint •Consequently relaxed limb rotates medially into the waiter’s tip position •The ability to initiate abduction of the limb is also affected POSTERIOR TRIANGLE CONTENTS: CERVICAL PLEXUS (MUSCULAR BRANCHES) •Branches are given off segmentally to the prevertebral muscles (longus capitis, longus colli and scalenes) •Branch from C1 to the hypoglossal nerve, by which the fibers are carried to the superior root of the ansa cervicalis and the nerves of thyrohyoid and geniohyoid •Branches from C2 & C3 to sternocleidomastoid and from C3 & C4 to trapezius •These fibers are mainly proprioceptive but occasionally the whole of the trapezius muscle is not paralyzed when the accessory nerve is damaged POSTERIOR TRIANGLE CONTENTS: CERVICAL PLEXUS (MUSCULAR BRANCHES) SUPERIOR ROOT OF ANSA CERVICALIS: •Branch of the hypoglossal nerve containing only C1 fibers, which have hitched along the hypoglossal nerve •Runs down the front of the internal and common carotid arteries giving a branch to the superior belly of omohyoid INFERIOR ROOT OF ANSA CERVICALIS: •Formed by the union of a branch each from C2 & C3 anterior rami •The single nerve so formed spirals from behind around the internal jugular vein and runs down to join the superior root in a wide loop over the lower part of the vein, from which branches arise for the infrahyoid muscles Sometimes the inferior root passes between the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery PHRENIC NERVE: •Formed mainly from C4 with contributions from C3 & C5 and runs down vertically over the obliquity of the scalenus anterior muscle, passing from lateral to medial borders beneath the prevertebral fascia, lateral to the ascending cervical branch of the inferior thyroid artery •It passes behind the subclavian vein into the mediastinum •It may be joined below the vein by a branch (accessory phrenic nerve) from the nerve to subclavius, which descends in front of the subclavian vein •The phrenic nerve is vital, being the sole motor supply to its own half of the diaphragm and it also has an extensive afferent distribution not only to the diaphragm but to the pericardium, pleura and peritoneum POSTERIOR TRIANGLE CONTENTS: CERVICAL PLEXUS (MUSCULAR BRANCHES) •Severance of phrenic nerve, phrenic nerve block & phrenic nerve crush •A cut phrenic nerve results in paralysis of the corresponding ½ of the diaphragm •A nerve block produces a short period of paralysis of the diaphragm on one side e.g. For lung surgery. Anesthesia is injected around the nerve where it lies on the anterior surface of the anterior scalene muscle •A nerve crush e.g. Compressing the nerve injuriously with forceps, produces a longer period of paralysis, which may extend for weeks following surgical repair of a diaphragmatic hernia •If an accessory phrenic nerve is present, it may also be crushed to produce complete paralysis of the hemi-diaphragm POSTERIOR TRIANGLE CONTENTS: CERVICAL PLEXUS (MUSCULAR BRANCHES) •Deep to the omohyoid muscle: •Transverse cervical and suprascapular vessels •External jugular vein pierces both split layers of the lower part of investing fascia to enter the posterior triangle on its way to the subclavian vein POSTERIOR TRIANGLE VESSELS EXTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN TRANSVERSE CERVICAL VESSELS SUPRASCAPULAR VESSELS POSTERIOR TRIANGLE MUSCLES BORDER MUSCLES: TRAPEZIUS •Superior attachment: •Medial 1/3 of superior nuchal line, external occipital protuberance, nuchal ligament, spinous processes of C7-T12 vertebrae •Inferior attachment: •Lateral 1/3 of clavicle, acromion and spine of scapula •Innervation: •Spinal accessory nerve (motor), C2 and C3 nerves (pain and proprioception) •Main actions: •Elevates, retracts and rotates scapula superiorly •Descending superior fibers •Elevate pectoral girdle, maintain level of shoulders against gravity or resistance •Transverse middle fibers •Retract scapula •Descending inferior fibers •Depress shoulders •Descending and ascending fibers together •Rotate spinous process of scapula superiorly •With shoulders fixed, bilateral contraction extends neck, unilateral contraction produces lateral flexion to same side MUSCLE SUPERIOR ATTACHMENT INFERIOR ATTACHMENT INNERVATION MAIN ACTION(S) SPLENIUS CAPITUS INFERIOR HALF OF NUCHAL LIGAMENT AND SPINOUS PROCESS OF T1-6 LATERAL ASPECT OF MASTOID PROCESS AND LATERAL 1/3 OF SUPERIOR NUCHAL LINE POSTERIOR RAMI OF MIDDLE CERVICAL SPINAL NERVES LATERALLY FLEXES AND ROTATES HEAD AND NECK TO SAME SIDE, ACTING BILATERALLY EXTENDS HEAD AND NECK LEVATOR SCAPULAE POSTERIOR TUBERCLES OF TRANSVERSE PROCESSES C2-6 VERTEBRAE SUPERIOR PART OF MEDIAL BORDER OF SCAPULA DORSAL SCAPULAR NERVE C5 AND CERVICAL SPINAL NERVES C3 AND C4 DOWNWARD ROTATION OF SCAPULA AND TILTS ITS GLENOID CAVITY INFERIORLY BY ROTATING SCAPULA MIDDLE SCALENE POSTERIOR TUBERCLES OF TRANSVERSE PROCESSES OF C5-7 VERTEBRAE SUPERIOR SURFACE OF 1ST RIB, POSTERIOR GROOVE FOR SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY ANTERIOR RAMI OF CERVICAL SPINAL NERVES FLEXES NECK LATERALLY, ELEVATES 1ST RIB DURING FORCED RESPIRATION ANTERIOR SCALENE TRANSVERSE PROCESSES OF C3-C6 VERTEBRAE 1ST RIB CERVICAL SPINAL NERVES C4-6 FLEXES HEAD MUSCLES OF THE FLOOR OF THE POSTERIOR TRIANGLESplenius Capitus Levator Scapulae Middle Scalene Anterior Scalene Glossopharyngeal Nerve (CNIX) • Leaves the cranium through the jugular foramen • At this foramen are superior and inferior (sensory) ganglia, which contain the pseudounipolar cell bodies for the afferent components of the nerve • CNIX follows the stylopharyngeus muscle, which is the only muscle it supplies, and passes between the superior and middle pharyngeal constrictor muscles to reach the oropharynx and tongue • It contributes sensory fibers to the pharyngeal plexus of nerves • CNIX is afferent from the tongue and pharynx and efferent to the stylopharyngeus muscle and parotid gland Glossopharyngeal Nerve (CNIX) • Somatic (Brachial) Motor • Motor fibers pass to one muscle, the stylopharyngeus muscle derived from the 3rd pharyngeal arch • Visceral (Parasympathetic) Motor • Following a circuitous route initially involving the tympanic nerve, presynaptic parasympathetic fibers are provided to the otic ganglion for innervation of the parotid gland • Somatic (General) Sensory • The tympanic nerve • The carotid sinus nerve to the carotid sinus, a baro- receptor sensitive to changes in blood pressure and the carotid body, a chemoreceptor sensitive to blood gas • The pharyngeal, tonsillar and lingual nerves to the mucosa of the oropharynx and isthmus of fauces. In addition to general sensation, tactile stimuli determined to be unusual or unpleasant may evoke the gag reflex or even vomiting • Special Sensory (Taste) • Taste fibers are conveyed from the posterior third of the tongue to the sensory ganglia, the superior and inferior ganglia of CNIX Vagus nerve (CNX) • Leaves the cranium through the jugular foramen between CNIX and CNXI • CNX has a superior ganglion in the jugular foramen that is mainly concerned with the general sensory component of the nerve • Inferior to the foramen is an inferior ganglion concerned with the visceral sensory component of the nerve • In the region of the superior ganglion are connections to CNIX and the superior cervical (sympathetic) ganglion • CNX continues inferiorly in the carotid sheath to the root of the neck supplying branches to the palate, pharynx and larynx Hypoglossal nerve (CNXII) • Leaves the cranium through the hypoglossal canal • Extracranially it is joined by a branch or branches of the cervical plexus of nerves conveying general somatic motor fibers from C1 and C2 spinal nerves and somatic (general) sensory fibers from the spinal ganglion of C2 • These spinal nerves hitch a ride with CNXII to reach the hyoid muscles, with some sensory fibers passing retrograde along CNXII to reach the dura mater of the posterior cranial fossa • CNXII passes inferiorly medial to the angle of the mandible and then curves anteriorly to enter the tongue • It ends in many branches that supply all the extrinsic muscles of the tongue, except the palatoglossus muscle • CNXII branches include: the meningeal branch, the superior root of ansa cervicalis and the terminal lingual branches CAROTID ARTERIAL SYSTEM COMMON CAROTID ARTERY: Origin: •Left side directly from the arch of the aorta •Right side directly from the brachiocephalic trunk •Course: •Proximal to the bifurcation of the artery no branches are given off •Lies within the medial part of the carotid sheath, with the internal jugular vein lateral to it and the vagus nerve placed very deep between the two vessels •The sympathetic trunk is posterior to the artery and outside the sheath •The common carotid artery usually bifurcates at the level of the upper border of the lamina of the thyroid cartilage +/- upper border of C4 but may occur as high as C3 •The terminal portion of the artery is often dilated into the carotid sinus which includes the commencement of the internal carotid artery CAROTID ARTERIAL SYSTEM CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES: •Carotid pulse can be felt by pressing backwards between the trachea and lower larynx medially and the sternocleidomastoid muscle laterally •Applying pressure to the artery against the anterior tubercle of the transverse process of C6 •The surface marking of the common carotid artery is along the vertical line from the sternoclavicular joint to the superior border of the thyroid cartilage •The vessel may be surgically exposed by retracting the lower part of the SCM backwards and incising the carotid sheath. •The middle thyroid vein will be found between ligatures COURSE OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY •At the origin the ECA lies against the side wall of the pharynx, antero-medial to the ICA •It ascends anterior to the ICA deep to the posterior belly of digastric and stylohyoid muscles, above which it pierces the deep lamina of the parotid fascia and enters the parotid gland •It divides into its terminal branches namely the maxillary artery and superficial temporal artery within the substance of the parotid gland •At the origin of the artery the IJV lies lateral, but higher up the vein lies posterior and deep to the artery •The facial vein also crosses the artery with the hypoglossal nerve lying between. •Except at its origin the vessel lies in front of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle BRANCHES OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES: •The surface markings of the external carotid artery is along a line from the bifurcation of the common carotid artery passing up behind the angle of the mandible to a point immediately in front of the tragus of the ear •SURGICAL APPROACH: •The vessel can be exposed in front of the upper part of sternocleidomastoid before entering the parotid gland by ligating the facial vein •Caution should be exercised as the hypoglossal nerve which crosses the external and internal carotids superficially must not be damaged •BRANCHES OF THE ECA: •2 terminal branches (maxillary + superficial temporal artery) •3 anterior branches (superior thyroid artery + lingual + facial arteries) •2 posterior branches (Occipital artery + posterior auricular) •1 medial branch Ascending pharyngeal artery SUPERIOR THYROID ARTERY •Originates at the commencement of the external carotid artery •In its course it runs almost vertically downwards, the superior thyroid vein to the upper pole of the thyroid gland, with the external laryngeal nerve •Before reaching the gland it gives off the following branches: •Infrahyoid •Sternocleidomastoid •Superior laryngeal •Cricothyroid branches •The superior laryngeal artery pierces the thyrohyoid membrane with the internal laryngeal nerve •The cricothyroid artery crosses the superior part of the cricothyroid membrane to anastomose with a contra-lateral artery LINGUAL ARTERY •Arises from the anterior surface of the external carotid artery near the tip of the greater horn of the hyoid bone •In its course it forms a short loop, then passes anteriorly along the superior border of the greater horn deep to the hyoglossus muscle •It is further accompanied by the lingual vein • The loop of the lingual artery is crossed laterally by the hypoglossal nerve and its companion vein which later opens into the facial vein FACIAL ARTERY •Arises from the anterior surface of the external carotid artery, superior to the lingual artery (sometimes by a common linguofacial trunk with the lingual artery) •Runs superiorly along the superior constrictor muscle deep to the digastric and stylohyoid muscles, then deep to the submandibular salivary gland •It grooves along the posterosuperior part of the submandibular gland •As the facial artery runs along the superior constrictor muscle, it gives off the following branches: •Tonsillar branch – supplies the tonsil •Ascending palatine artery – supplies the soft palate •The facial artery in its course then follows an s-bend, curling over the submandibular gland and crosses the inferior border of the mandible and the anterior border of the masseter muscle •Before passing to the face it again gives off another branch: •Submental artery, which accompanies the mylohyoid nerve into the submandibular fossa and sends perforating branches through the mylohyoid muscle to anastomose with a sublingual branch of the lingual artery ASCENDING PHARYNGEAL ARTERY •Arises just above the origin of the external carotid artery, from the deep aspect of the artery •It runs along the side wall of the pharynx in front of the prevertebral fascia, deep to the internal carotid artery •It supplies the pharyngeal wall, the soft palate and sends meningeal branches through the nearby foramina of the skull (foramen lacerum, jugular foramen, hypoglossal canal) POSTERIOR AURICULAR ARTERY •Arises above the level of the digastric muscle, often within the substance of the parotid gland •It runs superficial to the styloid process above the digastric posterior belly and crosses the surface of the mastoid process to supply the scalp •Auricular branches arising from the atery supply the pinna of the ear •Stylomastoid branch enters the stylomastoid foramen and supplies the facial nerve, this branch does in certain instances arise from the occipital artery OCCIPITAL ARTERY •Arises from the posterior surface of the external carotid artery on the same level as the facial artery •It courses posteriorly deep to the inferior border of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle •It grooves along the base of the skull at the occipitomastoid suture, deep to the digastric notch on the mastoid process and then passes through the apex of the posterior triangle to supply the posterior aspect of the scalp •The artery in its course gives off two branches to the sternocleidomastoid muscle: • The superior branch is a guide to the accessory nerve in front of the superior border of the SCM •At its origin the occipital artery crosses lateral to the hypoglossal nerve, which hooks around it from behind, the nerve being held down by the lower branch of the occipital artery to SCM INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY •Arises at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery and continues superiorly within the carotid sheath •The carotid sinus is located at the origin of the ICA •Here the wall is thin and its contained baroreceptors are supplied by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves which mediate blood pressure to the medullary centers The carotid body is a small structure lying behind the bifurcation of the carotid arterial system or between its branches. The cells of the carotid body contain chemoreceptors with respiratory reflexes and they too are innervated by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY •Carotid body tumours form a swelling at the anterior border of SCM at the level of the carotid bifurcation and exhibit transmitted pulsation from the arteries •The internal carotid artery is lateral to the ECA at the origin but soon passes posteriorly to a medial and deeper level •It has no branches in the neck and passes superiorly through the carotid sheath beside the pharynx to the carotid canal in the base of the skull •Superficially near its origin it is crossed by the lingual and facial veins, occipital artery and hypoglossal nerve, the superior root of the ansa cervicalis •At a higher level it is overlapped by SCM and crossed by the posterior belly of digastric and stylohyoid and the posterior auricular artery INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES •Surface marking of the ICA in the neck is along a line from the bifurcation of the common carotid artery to the head of the mandible SURGICAL APPROACH •The internal carotid artery is exposed in the neck by an incision along the anterior border of SCM •The muscle is retracted posteriorly, the facial and lingual veins divided between ligatures and the carotid sheath is incised •The hypoglossal nerve must be safeguarded and this may require division of the lower SCM branch of the ECA to ensure differentiation from the ICA Root of neck: Prevertebral muscles Muscle Origin Insertion Innervation Main action(s) Anterior vertebral muscles Longus colli Anterior tubercle of C1, bodies of C1 to C3, transverse processes of C3 to C6 vertebrae Bodies of C5 to T3, transverse processes of C3 to C5 Anterior rami of C2 to C6 spinal nerves Flexes neck with

• The brachiocephalic trunk • is covered anteriorly by the right sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles, • it is the largest branch of the arch of the aorta • Arises in the midline from the beginning of the arch of the aorta, posterior to the manubrium • It passes superolaterally to the right where it divides into the right common carotid artery and right subclavian arteries posterior to the sternoclavicular joint • Usually has no branches Root of neck: Arteries • Subclavian artery • Supply the upper limbs with smaller branches sent to the neck and brain • Right subclavian artery arises from the brachiocephalic trunk • Left subclavian artery arises directly from the arch of the aorta distal to the origin of the left common carotid artery • Left vagus nerve runs parallel to the first part of the subclavian artery • While there are differences in origin, the course of the arteries begins posterior to the respective sternoclavicular joints as they ascend through the superior thoracic aperture and enter the root of the neck Root of neck: Arteries • Subclavian artery • The arteries arch superolaterally, reaching the apex as they pass posterior to the anterior scalene muscle • As they begin to descend, they disappear posterior to the middle of the clavicles • As they cross the outer margin of the first rib, they become the axillary artery • Three parts of the subclavian artery • First part is medial to the anterior scalene muscle • Second part is posterior to the muscle • Third part is lateral to the muscle Root of neck: Arteries • Subclavian artery • First part •

• Third part • Dorsal scapular artery Root of neck: Vertebral Arteries • Cervical part (vertebral part) ascends in the pyramidal space formed between the scalene and longus muscles • At the apex of this space, the artery passes deeply to course through the foramen transversaria of vertebrae C1 to C6 • Occasionally the vertebral artery may enter the foramen more superior than C6 • Suboccipital part (cranial part) courses in the groove on the posterior arch of the atlas before it enters the cranial cavity through the foramen magnum • Cranial part supplies branches to the medulla and spinal cord, parts of the cerebellum, dura of the posterior cranial fossa • At the inferior border of the pons of the brainstem, the vertebral arteries join to form the basilar artery Root of neck: Internal Thoracic Arteries • Arises from the anteroinferior aspect of the subclavian artery • Passes inferomedially into the thorax • The cervical part of the internal thoracic artery has no branches • The thoracic distribution was covered in the thorax Root of neck: Thyrocervical trunk • Arises from the anterosuperior aspect of the subclavian artery near the medial border of the anterior scalene muscle

suprascapular artery and transverse cervical artery • Terminal branches: inferior thyroid and ascending cervical arteries Inferior thyroid artery Ascending cervical artery Transverse cervical artery Thyrocervical trunk Root of neck: Costocervical trunk • Arises from the posterior aspect of the second part of the subclavian artery • Passes posterosuperiorly and divides into the superior intercostal and deep cervical arteries, which supply the first two intercostal spaces and the posterior deep cervical muscles, respectively Root of neck: Arteries • Third part of subclavian artery • Begins superior to the clavicle opposite the lateral border of the anterior scalene muscle • Hidden in the inferior part of the lateral cervical region, posterosuperior to the subclavian vein • Most superficial and longest part of the subclavian artery • Pulsations can be felt by applying pressure in the omoclavicular triangle • The inferior trunk of the brachial plexus lies directly posterior to it • Branches that occasionally arise, but this is more an aberrant pattern, from this part include: suprascapular artery and dorsal scapular artery (the normal pattern is usually from the thyrocervical trunk via a cervicodorsal trunk) Root of neck: Nerves Vagus nerve (CNX) Recurrent laryngeal nerve (CNX) Root of neck: Nerves Sympathetic trunk Cervical Ganglia • Identify the highlighted
