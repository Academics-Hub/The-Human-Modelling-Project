Introduction The growing demand for patient-friendly therapies has led to the de- velopment of transdermal drug delivery that has several advantages over conventional drug delivery methods. For instance, transdermal de- livery enables sustained and controlled drug release, and promotes pa- tients' compliance and convenience with its non-invasiveness and painlessness [1].

Transdermal delivery often requires a lower dosage of drugs than oral administration. With a short diffusive pathway to reach vasculature, transdermal mode helps the patients to circumvent side effects due to digestion and me- tabolism of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract. Transdermal delivery is painless and non-invasive, the advantage which is prominent against intravenous or intramuscular administration. The non-invasiveness al- lows repeated administrations of the drug over the same region of the body for a long-term treatment, and thus provides patients with com- pliance and convenience. However, transdermal drug delivery is not a ﬂawless drug transport method. The stratum corneum, the outermost barrier of the skin against foreign materials, imposes an obstacle to the transdermal diffusion of drugs [2]. Since only a few small-molecule drugs with high lipophilicity can naturally permeate through the hydrophobic stratum corneum, a vast majority of hydrophilic drugs have been ruled out against transder- mal delivery. Even after the drug successfully penetrates the stratum corneum, it may be degraded prematurely by epidermal enzymes, resulting in decreased bioavailability. Latency in the onset of action as well as a lack of pharmacokinetic control may also undermine the reli- ability of the transdermal delivery. The endeavor for a better transdermal delivery has evolved towards overcoming such limitations, and the innovation has been seen in sever- al generations, namely, focusing on drug formulation, external actua- tion, and minimally invasive microneedles. The ﬁrst generation of transdermal delivery focused on reﬁning the drug formulation to max- imize its diffusion through the skin as manifested by emulsions, nano- carriers, and chemical enhancers. The second generation has sought ex- ternal forces, such as heat and electricity, to energetically fuel the drug to cross the epidermal layers and reach the vasculature. The third gen- eration incorporated microneedles, which puncture the outer skin layer but preserve the dermis, to provide the drug with a physical short- cut bypassing the epidermal barriers. The breakthroughs of previous generations have greatly improved the efﬁciency of transdermal drug delivery. Although the betterment of transdermal delivery so far has focused on maximizing the delivery efﬁciency, transdermal drug delivery is yet to see another breakthrough by adopting a paradigm shift towards personalized therapy [3–5]. Furthermore, transdermal delivery is set to adopt an advanced paradigm of device-assisted personalized therapy where the precise control of the amount and duration of a drug dose in response to the patient's physiological condition is a key to maximizing the therapeutic efﬁcacy (Fig. 1a and b). The controlled and on-demand administration of a drug tailored to the needs of each patient requires extensive innovation. Wearable devices may be a viable and useful strategy because they can collect an assortment of physiological [6– 15], electrophysiological [16–21], and biochemical [22–27] cues, and thereby, facilitate drug delivery via energetic actuations. In this review, we recapitulate the major breakthroughs of four gen- erations of transdermal drug delivery strategies, providing the reader with the detailed advantages and challenges of each generation. In ac- cordance with a growing interest in controlled drug release for person- alized medical treatment, we also emphasize the recent progress on wearable devices that support device-assisted transdermal drug deliv- ery. This review concludes with case presentations to demonstrate the wearable biosensors and advanced transdermal delivery schemes that are seamlessly integrated. Thereby, we hope to present a novel potential protocol and foundation for the next generation of personalized therapy. 2. Advancement of transdermal drug delivery systems Among the anatomical layers and appendageal structures of the skin (Fig. 2a), the epidermis and its outermost stratum corneum are the most challenging barriers to transdermal delivery [28,29]. The brick-and- mortar assembly of keratinocytes and intercellular lipids renders the epidermis impregnable to most foreign materials. Therefore, a cursory observation of transdermal delivery can regard it as a counterintuitive strategy for delivering a drug systematically. However, a detailed analy- sis reveals that transdermal delivery provides a number of advantages over oral intake or hypodermic injections. Compared with oral delivery, transdermal delivery requires a lower dosage and has fewer side effects because transdermal diffusion circumvents the digestion and ﬁrst-pass metabolism of the active drug in the gastrointestinal tract and liver [30]. Moreover, transdermal delivery is less painful, minimally invasive, and convenient to patients so that the compliance with drug adminis- tration increases to a great extent. Because such advantages offset the drawbacks of transdermal delivery, studies continue to develop reliable Device-assisted transdermal drug delivery ab Heat Device-assisted transdermal drug delivery Therapy Diagnosis Microneedle Body temperature Blood pressure Iontophoresis Blood glucose Fig. 1.

Lee et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 127 (2018) 35–45 delivery systems and broaden the library of applicable candidate drugs. Novel designs of transdermal patches to increase the skin penetration of drugs have been widely investigated, and major breakthroughs have been observed as the evolving generations of transdermal delivery systems. The research on the ﬁrst generation of transdermal drug delivery systems focused on tailoring the physicochemical properties of chemi- cal drugs. Drugs for transdermal delivery are either selected or modiﬁed to have a high partition coefﬁcient and a low molecular weight for facile diffusion through the skin barrier (Fig. 2b). The second-generation re- search focused on improving the skin permeability of drugs using chem- ical enhancers and stimulators through external driving forces (Fig. 2c). Chemical enhancers [31,32] and emulsion/nano-carriers [33–36] solu- bilize the drugs and facilitate their easy penetration into the skin. Exter- nal actuation using heat [37], electricity [38], or noncavitational ultrasound [39] also facilitates drug transportation. The third-genera- tion research adopted methods that cause microscopic destruction of epidermis to facilitate the delivery of drugs. Radiofrequency (RF) abla- tion [40], ultrasound [41], and lasers [42,43] disrupt the stratum corneum temporarily and enhance drug penetration through the weak- ened barrier. Microneedles are another approach of microinvasive transdermal delivery with vastly diverse drug candidates [44–47].The microneedles create micrometer-sized porations in epidermis, which serve as an unobstructed pathway for incoming drugs (Fig. 2d). Since the size of the microneedles leaves the dermal and hypodermal layers untouched, the microneedle is considered virtually painless and mini- mally invasive. While breakthroughs in transdermal delivery in previous genera- tions have focused on maximizing the efﬁciency of drug delivery, the re- cent growth in personalized medicine requires a new generation of the drug delivery system aimed at controlled and feedback-induced trans- dermal release of drugs. Wearable devices consisting of sensors and ac- tuators are expected to meet such needs [48–50]. Indeed, novel materials design and device fabrication have spurred the innovation in wearable devices for biomedical application, providing a new opportu- nity in personalized healthcare [51]. By precisely monitoring the key in- dicators of disease treatment and potential side effects of the delivered drugs, decisions can be rapidly made on the appropriate amount of drug to be delivered. The external energy stimulates and controls state-of- the-art transdermal delivery systems. Device-assisted transdermal de- livery, an ensemble of soft bioelectronics and a transdermal drug deliv- ery system, simultaneously controls the release of drugs and monitors the alteration of the physiological states by the drug (Fig. 2e). The cycle of diagnosis, actuated drug release, and follow-up diagnosis con- stitute a feedback loop that provides patients with a precise and person- ally customized medical treatment. 2.1. First generation: diffusion-based transdermal drug delivery Transdermal drug delivery is an attractive drug delivery option be- cause it offers several advantages. First, dermal layers provide the drug a shorter route to the bloodstream than gastrointestinal tract does [1]. Particularly, transdermal shortcut also enhances bioavailability and reduces the dosage because the drug avoids the extensive ﬁrst-pass metabolism and degradation in liver. Second, patients usually comply with transdermal drug administration because a drug patch is painless, non-invasive, and easy to use. A long-lasting patch that provides sustained drug release for up to several days is convenient for patients, and its non-invasiveness allows repeated drug application over the same part of the body. Freedom from pain, compared particularly to needle-based injections, increases the popularity and acceptance of the transdermal delivery. The ﬁrst generation of simple transdermal patches emerged during the early 1970s. Following the ﬁrst approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of scopolamine patch for motion sickness, approximately 19 patches including nicotine, menthol, and es- tradiol are commercially available to date [52]. However, the number of drugs that are suitable for patch formulation is severely limited because of the physiological barrier of the epidermis. The vast majority of the ﬁrst generation transdermal drugs are highly lipophilic with partition coefﬁcients greater than 10 4, small particle sizes, and molecular weights no more than 400 Da [53]. The forerunning system of transdermal deliv- ery depending on the physicochemical properties of drug molecules has been effective for its therapeutic purposes but with a limited variety in applications. Therefore, extensive efforts to render more drug candi- dates transdermally applicable and to further increase their delivery ef- ﬁciency had ensued. 2.2. Second generation: non-invasive transdermal drug delivery with actuation The second-generation transdermal delivery strategies seek to max- imize the permeability of the drug to the skin using chemical enhancers or external energy sources without damaging the structure of the skin.

Lee et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 127 (2018) 35–45 the drug solubility [1]. Presently, more benign chemical enhancers (e.g., fatty acids, urea, and pyrrolidone) compared to skin irritants such as di- methyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), and oxazolidinone are available to use [54]. Emulsion is one of the major strategies in non-invasive transdermal delivery because they solubilize a wide range of both lipophilic and hy- drophilic drugs in a transdermal formulation (Fig. 3a) [55]. The absorp- tion proﬁle of an emulsion is determined by the droplet size, composition, and surface charge. Particularly, reducing the size of vehi- cle particles to micrometer or nanometer level has been a popular strat- egy because smaller droplets can easily permeate the tight junctions of the skin barrier [56,57]. Recently, nanomaterials have been studied as potential systems for the delivery and controlled release of various drugs (e.g., nucleic acid, antibacterial, and cancer drugs) [58–62]. For ex- ample, drug-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) effectively overcome the epi- dermal barrier and deliver an encapsulated cocktail of anti- inﬂammatory siRNAs and capsaicin. In contrast, the delivery of siRNA- capsaicin cocktail in solution form was hindered by the stratum corneum (Fig. 3b) [63].The efﬁciency of drug delivery control can be en- hanced by using nano-sized vehicles responsive to physicochemical stimuli [64]. One example is the temperature-responsive nanogel that signiﬁcantly increases the release of the drug as the temperature ele- vates from room temperature to that of the outer skin (Fig. 3c) [65]. The pH-sensitive release of antibacterial drugs into the skin in response to the acidic microenvironment of a virulent bioﬁlm is another approach for the stimuli-responsive drug release (Fig. 3d) [66]. Stimuli-responsive nano-vehicles are incorporated into patches to yield a synergetic efﬁcacy in transdermal delivery. External stimuli (e.g., light, mechanical force, and magnetic ﬁeld) promote not only a higher rate of drug absorption but also a facile initiation and termination of drug administration [58,67,68]. Visible light can trigger release of the drug from a transdermal patch. For example, drug-loaded hydrogels can respond to the temperature change induced by light irradiation (Fig. 3e, left) [67]. Along with the increase in cumulative delivery, drug transport can be easily triggered on and off by controlling the external stimuli (Fig. 3e, right). Alternatively, mechanical force can control the release of the drug from transdermal patch. The patch is fabricated with a drug-laden elastomer (Fig. 3f, left), which can be conformally attached to the ﬁnger joints [68]. When the joints ﬂex, the patch experiences lat- eral strain and releases the drug (Fig. 3f, right). External devices, particularly in the wearable forms, can be integrat- ed with drug-laden patches. The devices deliver a sufﬁcient level of en- ergy to promote drug diffusion through the skin. Devices that operate with heat and electricity are frequent drug-delivering locomotives. For example, local heat from a wearable heater (Fig. 3g) can enhance the skin permeation of the drug [69]. When the heat is applied, solubility and diffusivity of inorganic and organic drugs increase from the drug- containing layer (Fig. 3h) [70]. The applied heat also increases the circu- lation of body ﬂuid, the permeability of blood vessel walls, and the rate- limiting membrane permeability, which in turn increases the perme- ation of the transdermal drugs. For example, the effect of temperature was evaluated in vitro by estimating the ﬂux of transdermal fentanyl (a potent opioid analgesic) at temperatures of 32 and 37 °C. The ﬂux of the drug approximately doubled over the 5 °C increment in temper- ature. Further studies indicate that a temperature change of 5 °C is nec- essary to cause a measurable enhancement in permeability between cell membranes and transport of the drug. Iontophoresis uses an electrical current to enhance and control the penetration of charged drugs into tissues through the skin barrier (Fig. 3i) [24]. The dose is easily controlled by changing the magnitude and the duration of the stimulating current. Iontophoretic administration of the drug can be applied to pain relief, diagnosis of inﬂammation, Drug Drug ion Current Skin ( + ) ( - ) Iontophoresis device Time (hour) 20040 60 80 70 60 50 40 30 20Drug release (%) 25oC 37oC 20°C 50°C Ag NW/SBS heater IR image Temp.

A weak elec- trical current below 500 μAcm − 2 is applied to the skin area of a few cen- timeter squares to prevent pain, irritation, or skin burns. The electrical ﬁeld increases the rate of drug transport compared to that of passive dif- fusion-based methods (Fig. 3j) [71]. Recently, a cryoelectrophoresis technique was introduced to increase the electrophoretic efﬁcacy by ap- plying a strong current to locally frozen skin to eliminate the risk of skin burns [72]. However, the non-invasive transdermal delivery does not drastically increase the efﬁciency of drug delivery, particularly for high molecular weight (e.g., proteins) and hydrophilic drugs. 2.3. Third generation: minimally invasive transdermal drug delivery As the limitations of non-invasive transdermal delivery have been recognized, an alternative approach of minimally invasive transdermal delivery is rapidly adopted. Minimal invasion of the skin involves destroying the stratum corneum so that epidermal disruption is limited to clinically safe level while a large number of hydrophilic drugs and macromolecules are more effectively delivered into the inner skin [73]. High power energy modalities (e.g., radiofrequency (RF), ultra- sound, and laser) and various types of microneedles are currently used to disrupt or puncture the skin and enhance drug delivery. Howev- er, destruction of the skin should be minimized and carefully controlled to allow its rapid recovery [74]. A comparative study using ibuprofen as a model drug indicates that the biodistribution and the bioavailability of differently formulated microneedles can be signiﬁcantly different, and minimally invasive microneedles have advantages over non-invasive iontophoresis in terms of bioavailability [75]. Disruption of the epidermis by high power energy broadens the range of drugs that can be delivered through the skin [73]. Because a sig- niﬁcantly high level of energy is required to damage the outer layers of skin, it is necessary to carefully control the amplitude and exposure time of the applied energy to prevent unwanted damage to the inner skin layers. RF ablation uses a high-frequency electrical current (100– 500 kHz) for localized heating of the outer skin layer (Fig. 4a) [76]. Sonophoresis uses ultrasound which generates heat and promotes drug delivery into the skin [41,77,78]. Recently, double frequency ultra- sound was used to enhance the skin permeability and shorten the treat- ment time compared to single frequency ultrasound (Fig. 4b) [79].Laser ablation is also commonly used in cosmetics for procedures such as hair removal, skin resurfacing, and acne treatment. The laser targets a high level of energy at a designated location to penetrate the skin (Fig. 4c) [80,81]. Gold nanorods absorb near-infrared light and generate an in- tense heat, which can damage the outer layer of the skin. The pulsed laser only increases the temperature of the skin surface and causes less damage to the inner skin than continuous-wave laser does (Fig. 4d) [82–84]. Although RF ablation, sonophoresis, and laser ablation methods show reasonably high potentials, they need bulky and expensive equip- ment and thus can only be performed at clinics. As an alternative, microneedles have attracted considerable attention because they can transport drugs in a minimally invasive manner via the transdermal route, and are relatively simple and cheap [74,85]. Microneedles are easier to use and less painful to the skin than high-power energy modal- ities. In addition, microneedles enable the controlled and sustained release of drugs depending on the patients' needs. Microneedles are di- vided into several types according to their shape and use including solid, surface-coated, dissolvable, hollow-shaped, and smart microneedle [86]. Solid microneedles are fabricated from hard materials such as sili- con and metals (Fig. 4e) [87–90]. The hardness of the materials enables the solid microneedles to easily create micropores, which are the micro- inlet through which drugs are transferred. The micropores are recov- ered a short period after the creation and, therefore, additional patches or drugs (e.g., diclofenac) can be used to extend the duration of the formed micropores. Microneedles may also incorporate a drug coated onto the surface of the solid needle substrate (Fig. 4f) [91–93]. Since the coating layer de- creases the physical strength and sharpness of needles, the drug load on the needle surface is limited to a small amount. Accordingly, coated microneedles are used for treatments where large amounts of drugs are not required to be delivered (e.g., vaccine delivery and cosmetic pro- cedures) [94,95]. Dissolvable microneedles are formulated from water-soluble and biocompatible polymers. In dissolvable microneedles, drugs are embed- ded in the polymeric matrix and released as the matrix degrades or dis- solves slowly in body ﬂuids (Fig. 4g) [96–103]. The temporal drug release proﬁle can be controlled from several seconds to several months by selecting appropriate polymers. However, there are also challenges associated with this technique. For example, the use of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation or elevated temperature to cure the polymer for microneedles during the fabrication process can denature the drugs loaded in the polymeric precursor.

Lee et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 127 (2018) 35–45 into the polymeric matrix is also limited because a high percentage of drug in the precursor mixture would undermine the mechanical strength of the needles. Hollow microneedles have a hollow core inside the needle through which the drug solution ﬂows (Fig. 4h) [104–107]. The drug solution can be delivered passively by diffusion or actively by pressure-driven ﬂow through the needle hole. A drug reservoir attached to the back of the microneedles releases the drug by the action of a pump. Hollow microneedles have a merit in controlling the amount of injected drug. However, one disadvantage of this approach is that additional equip- ment (e.g., drug reservoir and pump) assisting the microneedles is re- quired for drug delivery [73]. With increasing variety of applicable drug candidates, microneedles represent a major breakthrough in transdermal delivery in terms of ef- ﬁciency and versatility. However, the fabrication process for mass pro- duction is yet to be established. Furthermore, even the microneedles share the same limitation of transdermal patches in which the only way to control the offset of drug release is to detach the patches. A more dynamic control on the release proﬁle (e.g., pulsatile, variable, and feedback-controlled) of the drug could be envisioned with incorpo- ration of other technological elements. 3. Fourth generation: controlled and feedback-induced transdermal drug delivery Personalized therapy is distinguished from conventional medical treatments by its ability to optimize the treatment based on each individual's pathophysiological conditions [49]. Establishment of per- sonalized therapy requires systematic control of the administered dose based on an accurate real-time observation of the patient's physi- ological parameters to determine the progression of disease and efﬁcacy of the drug. In response to an increasing need for personalized treat- ment, the advanced transdermal delivery system empowered by soft bioelectronics has been spotlighted as a strategy for the next generation drug delivery method. Rapid advances in soft and ultrathin devices in wearable forms have facilitated the seamless integration of bioelectronic devices in a skin- mounted patch domain with unprecedented functionalities [108–110]. Speciﬁcally, sensors accurately measure the physiological [6–15], elec- trophysiological [16–21], and biochemical [22–27] signals, actuators transfer energy to the drug-laden patch in a controlled manner, and the sensors subsequently gather information on the therapeutic efﬁcacy of the drug. The synergetic performance of wearable devices and drug- delivering patches according to a complete feedback loop provides a novel platform for personalized therapy. To maximize the performance of device-assisted transdermal drug delivery, it is crucial to safeguard a conformal contact between the de- vice and the skin which stems from the stretchability and ﬂexibility of the device. The softness and deformability of the system minimize the local detachment and microscopic spaces between the device and the skin due to the curvilinear morphology of the skin and bodily move- ments [16]. Conformal integration of a device onto the skin also pro- motes precise measurements of the biological signals with minimal motion-induced noise, enhancing the accuracy of wearable sensors monitoring physiological (e.g., blood pressure, strain, and temperature) [6–15], electrophysiological (e.g., electrocardiogram and electroenceph- alogram) [16–21], and biochemical (e.g., pH, blood glucose, and oxygen levels) [22–27] signals from the skin. Based on the collected informa- tion, a co-integrated actuator controls the drug diffusion rate. This pro- cess is also enhanced by the conformal contact because a stable interface between the patch and the skin ensures homogeneous and ef- ﬁcient energy transfer, and provides a uniform drug release proﬁle throughout the entire patch area [111,112]. 3.1. Transdermal drug delivery based on physiological/electrophysiological monitoring To diagnose the health condition of an individual, an assortment of physical and electrical cues must be collected ﬁrst. The collection of pre- cise health information with high spatiotemporal resolution is impor- tant in controlling drug delivery. Since the surface of the skin is soft, curvilinear and movable, skin-mounted sensors necessitate physical characteristics similar to those of the skin to obtain high-quality infor- mation without motion artifacts or background noises from the skin surface. Flexible and stretchable devices in ultrathin and serpentine structures facilitate a conformal contact with the skin, which is crucial for high ﬁdelity measurement of bodily signals [48–50]. Therefore, soft wearable biosensors that are attached conformally to skin contours en- able the precise real-time monitoring of an individual's physiological biomarker without hindering bodily motions. Accurate diagnosis based on the conformal contact also increases the efﬁcacy of controlled drug release in response to physiological feedback.

[5],Copyright 2016, Wiley-VCH. 40 H. Lee et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 127 (2018) 35–45 Physiological signals such as body temperature [6], and dynamic in- formation including tremors [3,9,10] and cardiac movements [5,7,8,19] are the key information required for diagnosing the health condition of an individual. Collected signals can be used for patient-customized transdermal drug delivery. For example, a multifunctional and wearable patch continuously monitors movement disorders using silicon mem- brane-based strain gauges, and stores the recorded information on the activities and tremors in the memory module (Fig. 5a) [3].Continuously operating sensors collect vital signals and the cumulative information is processed to operate a co-integrated drug delivery unit (Fig. 5b). Ac- cording to the patient's health condition, wearable drug actuators trig- ger drug delivery through the skin. To maximize the amount of loaded drugs, mesoporous silica NPs (MSNs) serve as the drug delivery vehicles in the patch because their large surface area allows greater drug adsorp- tion. The programmable thermal actuators control the drug delivery through the skin by enhancing drug diffusion (Fig. 5c). The generated heat degrades the binding of the MSNs and the loaded drugs, which sub- sequently diffuse transdermally (Fig. 5d). The integrated temperature sensor conducts real-time monitoring to prevent any low-temperature burns. Electrical signal is also an integral part of health monitoring that en- ables relevant information to be collected continuously. The time-re- solved amplitude and wave pattern of electrophysiological signals such as those of an electromyogram, electroencephalogram, and elec- trocardiogram reﬂect the real-time condition of the muscles, brain, and heart, respectively. These signals can be detected from the outer skin noninvasively using wearable electrodes and a co-integrated am- pliﬁer (Fig. 5e) [19]. To investigate the reliable long-term monitoring of signals, studies have focused on the interface between wearable de- vice and biological tissues to establish a robust mechanical coupling for a highly sensitive and accurate biometric detection [5,8].The design motifs based on bio-inspired interfaces provide sufﬁcient adhesion to the skin so that the devices do not require adhesive glues, which are po- tential skin irritants in the long-term. Based on the measured electrical signals, the integrated drug actuators can efﬁciently deliver the loaded drug through the skin (Fig. 5f) [5]. For electrostatically charged drugs, iontophoresis can serve as an efﬁcient delivery method. In a study, MSNs were used as drug delivery vehicles to prevent oxidation, dena- turation, and unstimulated diffusion of drugs. Iontophoretic delivery ac- celerates the deep permeation of the drug into the skin, mediated by the charge repulsion between the electrodes and drugs (Fig. 5g). Iontopho- retic actuation of drug-loaded MSNs enhanced the dermal penetration signiﬁcantly compared to those of the control and thermal diffusion (Fig. 5h). Iontophoresis also has advantages over thermal diffusion by preventing low-temperature burns on the skin and thermal denatur- ation of the loaded drugs. 3.2. Transdermal drug delivery based on biochemical signal monitoring Biochemical analysis of bioﬂuids can provide ample information on an individual's health condition and disease progression [22–27]. For wearable devices, sweat is a frequently used specimen to monitor the physiological and biochemical conditions such as glucose level because it contains voluminous metabolic data (Fig. 6a) [113–116]. In accor- dance with the versatility of sweat analysis in disease diagnosis, wear- able sweat sensors are developed to conveniently measure the analytes of interest. Wearable and disposable chemical sensors are recent examples of colorimetric and electrochemical analyses. Colorimetric analysis is widely used for simple and disposable sensing instruments because the presence of biomarkers is easily conﬁrmed by color changes (Fig. 6b) [117,118].

Lee et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 127 (2018) 35–45 biomarkers such as perspiration rate, total sweat loss, pH, chlorides, and lactates, it is difﬁcult to accurately quantify the color changes to deter- mine the concentration of the biomarkers. Wearable electrochemical sensors have been devised to quantiﬁably detect biomarkers in the sweat. The concentration of target biomarkers is directly measured from the electrical signals of the redox reaction of the markers in a short time. The wearable electrochemical sensors fabricated by screen printing have simple structures and enable the facile measurement of a single biomarker (Fig. 6c) [114]. An array of electrochemical sensors is also available for the simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers (Fig. 6d) [26]. The information acquired from the sweat is wirelessly col- lected and continuously stored in mobile devices for long-term health monitoring. Accurate monitoring of the sweat glucose level is of primary interest because of its direct correlation to the blood glucose level [119]. Further- more, this correlation inspired the development of a skin-based diabe- tes control system that combines sweat glucose detection with microneedle-based drug delivery for minimally invasive blood glucose regulation (Fig. 6e) [115,116]. Conventional blood glucose monitoring for diabetes inﬂicts pain and stress during the blood withdrawal and drug injection steps. Therefore, device-assisted glucose monitoring and feedback therapy could improve the quality of life of patients with diabetes by managing blood glucose level more conveniently. The min- imally invasive glucose monitoring system is initiated by perspiration after the patch is applied (Fig. 6f, left). To measure the sweat glucose level more accurately, data collected from the glucose sensor are corrected by integrated pH, temperature, and humidity sensors. It en- sures that corrections are made for the activity variation of glucose ox- idase, which is the primary detection moiety (Fig. 6f, middle). When hyperglycemia occurs, the microneedles are triggered by the sensor sig- nal to transdermally administer the antidiabetic drug (Fig. 6f, right). In the case of conventional microneedles, it was difﬁcult to control the duration and amount of the drug dose released because the drug dif- fusion is irreversible once the microneedles are inserted into the skin. In addition, data to determine the drug delivery rate are unavailable. Re- cent studies have demonstrated the prospect of controlled transdermal drug release based on real-time health monitoring using a wearable de- vice-assisted thermo-responsive microneedles system [115,116].Phase change materials (PCMs) protect the drug and dissolvable microneedle matrix from bioﬂuids below the critical melting temperature (Fig. 6g). When multi-channel heaters initiate patterned thermal actuation, the PCM coating on the microneedles melts, and thereby, the transdermal drug delivery proceeds by partial or total dissolution of the microneedles (Fig. 6h). The amount of delivered drug can be controlled by the area of the applied heating, which is determined by the integrat- ed wearable biosensors. Temperature sensors near the heater simulta- neously monitor the temperature variation of the heaters to sequentially control the drug release and prevent low-temperature burns. By using additional PCMs combined with drugs and multichannel heaters, the drug delivery system features a precisely controlled trans- dermal release of drugs at up to six different release amounts (Fig. 6i). The effectiveness of the wearable microneedle system was demonstrat- ed in diabetic (db/db) mice by triggering controlled transcutaneous drug release using thermal actuators. Animal experiments with diabetic mice conﬁrmed the efﬁcacy of the microneedles in reducing blood glu- cose levels (Fig. 6j). 3.3. Smart microneedle systems Smart microneedles represent the culminating point of advanced transdermal delivery since they incorporate the aforementioned ele- ments of sensors, actuators, and enhanced drug formulation into a com- plete feedback loop of personalized therapy. Sensors monitor the physiological conditions and trigger the medication, and actuators ma- nipulate the release proﬁle and dose of the administered drug. Without further medical intervention, automated microneedle patches continue to respond to the progression of the disease until symptoms are allevi- ated. Smart microneedles can provide a patient-friendly and feedback- controlled drug delivery, which has not been accomplished with previ- ous microneedle systems. Microneedles that are responsive to external stimuli (e.g., heat, laser, and mechanical strain) provide an on/off trigger for drug administration, which can be easily controlled by patients [44, 68]. An example is the mechanically responsive microneedles whose drug release is modulated by lateral strain (Fig. 7a, left) [68].The microneedles that release the drug payload following lateral pulling were successfully tested in vivo (Fig. 7a, right). Smart NPs that are re- sponsive to biochemical stimuli (e.g., pH change, glucose concentration, and hypoxia) can also be loaded in microneedles (Fig. 7b, left) [46,120, 121]. Microneedles facilitate the entry of NPs into the bloodstream, and the delivered NPs respond to the patient's physiological state and re- lease the drugs accordingly. The concept has been demonstrated by NPs containing glucose oxidase, which release insulin in response to a high blood glucose concentration to modulate its level (Fig. 7b, right) [120].

Release of heparin in the thrombin respon- sive hydrogels is promoted as the concentration of thrombin is in- creased (Fig. 7c, right). For an enhanced glucose-responsive delivery of insulin, dual-responsive (hypoxia and H2O2) vesicles are embedded in the microneedle array (Fig. 7d, left) [123]. This microneedle array is highly sensitive to glucose concentrations and shows a pulsatile release of insulin according to the glucose concentrations (Fig. 7d, right). The next-generation transdermal drug delivery systems are a considerable improvement over wearable devices that have a limited ability to detect or treat disease conditions. Furthermore, the next-generation transder- mal drug delivery represents the integration of multiple functionalities in a single device. In addition, the interactive and complementary co-ap- plication of sensing and therapy to enable patient-tailored transdermal drug delivery will likely be available in the foreseeable future through the next-generation systems. 4. Conclusion The skin, which has long been perceived as unsuitable for drug deliv- ery, currently widens the vista on the possibilities for drug delivery strategies with its physiological signiﬁcance and convenience. Studies to overcome the challenges of the skin barrier against drug permeation and improve the efﬁciency of transdermal drug delivery have shown considerable success as demonstrated by the ﬁrst, second, and third generations of transdermal delivery strategies. From simple patches to intricate microneedles, diverse approaches to improve the efﬁciency of drug delivery are still in progress. Amidst the rising popularity of the transdermal drug delivery, the device-assisted transdermal delivery provides a new paradigm for drug delivery in response to the real-time progression of disease. The diagnosis of the health status of patients using wearable sensors and the drug administration that is ﬁnely and timely controlled by actu- ators are combined with the detection of physiological changes by sen- sors to provide a complete feedback therapy. This strategy is expected to enhance the quality and effectiveness of medical therapy. Since the pre- vious generations of the transdermal drug delivery technology have fo- cused on maximizing the efﬁciency of delivery, this novel technological platform complements the drawbacks of previous transdermal delivery systems and even yields synergetic results when the most advanced transdermal patches and devices are combined altogether. Since the incorporation of wearable sensors and advanced transder- mal patch formulations is still in the early stage, there is a spacious room for future research aimed at improving the wearable devices and rigor- ously optimizing the reliability of the system, as well as their application to assorted disease models. Continued efforts to enhance the delivery of drugs that are considered unsuitable for administration through the skin (e.g., peptides, nucleic acids, and macromolecules) must also be carried out to broaden the library of transdermally applicable drugs. Al- though the patient-customized transdermal drug delivery still requires much development, this approach holds great promise for the conve- nient management of diseases in daily life and a novel paradigm for healthcare in the future.
