The capacity to produce normal movement depends on both the peripheral as well as the central nervous system. The nervous control of movement may be considered as that which controls somatic functions (skeletal muscle movement) which we are consciously aware of, and that which controls visceral functions (visceral muscle movement) which we do not normally consciously perceive. These two nervous system divisions are the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. Normal somatic motor function in an adult is largely dependent on the ability of structures within the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum to initiate or control movement, structures which are influenced by inputs from position sensations derived from the vestibular system and proprioceptors. However, some movement in the somatic nervous system is mediated by reflexes. In contrast, visceral or autonomic motor function largely depends on reflex systems or spontaneous and repetitive firing of electrical tissue (e.g. the heart). Diseases of the nervous system often manifest as abnormalities of somatic and/or autonomic motor control. Diseases of the nervous system may produce abnormalities in the ability to initiate skeletal or visceral muscle movement, may promote increases or decreases in resting muscle tone, or may induce increases or decreases in skeletal muscle or autonomic reflexes. Hence, tests of muscle power (the ability to initiate movement), muscle tone, and somatic or autonomic reflexes are essential components of clinical assessment. In the present practical you will be given the opportunity to observe the normal control of muscle power, tone and reflexes of mainly the somatic nervous system and a few autonomic reflexes. You will be assessing further autonomic reflexes in subsequent practical sessions on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. In the present practical you will also be given the opportunity to assess your knowledge or gain further knowledge of the physiological mechanisms that explain your ability to control movements of the head and neck (mediated through lower motor neurons in cranial nerves) as well as the limbs (mediated through lower motor neurons in the spinal cord) 3 as well as the physiological mechanisms that produce co-ordinated and balanced movement (controlled by the cerebellum, the vestibular system and proprioceptor function). You will also be introduced to the concept of motor memory. Many of the tests of motor function that you will be performing in the present practical session are used clinically to assess motor function. Abnormalities of these motor functions noted in patients with neural disease will be described to you in the clinical “paper” cases provided in the appendix to practical sessions 3 and 4. You should take the opportunity to assess your understanding of the physiological mechanisms that explain abnormalities in motor function, by answering questions related to these clinical “paper” cases.

C-1: Cerebellar and vestibular function. A. Limb motor function The generation of muscle contraction in the limbs and trunk is initiated mainly by upper motor neurons found in the motor cortex that activate lower motor neurons in the contralateral anterior horn of the spinal cord (see Figure). The initiation of muscle contraction by upper motor neurons derived from the motor cortex is required to produce purposeful movements. To assess the ability of patient’s to perform purposeful movement you may observe them undertaking tasks or moving their limbs. 4 Midbrain Pons Medulla Medullary pyramids Spinal cord Cerebral peduncle Medullary pyramid Pyramidal decussation Corticospinal tract Synapse of UMN with anterior horn cell (LMN) Neuromuscular junction Upper motor neuron (UMN) cell bodies in motor cortex, axons of which project to the lower motor neurons Internal capsule Axons of UMNs in motor tracts Pyramidal tract 5 However, if the disability is mild, the inability to initiate purposeful muscle contraction is best detected by assessing skeletal muscle power in each muscle group. In the present practical you will be given the opportunity to evaluate your laboratory partner’s muscle power using this approach. Although in the adult human most muscle contraction is initiated by upper motor neurons found in the motor cortex of the cerebral hemispheres, some muscle contraction may be initiated through simple reflexes which do not require upper motor neurons. The following diagram shows the basic components of the skeletal muscle reflex as illustrated by the patellar (quadriceps) reflex. 2. Stretch of muscle spindle 3. Lower motor neuron activated by sensory afferent 4. Neuromuscular junction activated 1. Patellar hammer strikes patellar tendon 5. Quadriceps muscle contraction produces movement Spinal cord 6 In the present practical you will also be given the opportunity to assess a number of skeletal muscle reflexes as these assessments and their interpretation form an important part of the clinical evaluation. It is important that you do not confuse statements such as “they have good reflexes”, that you may have heard in general conversation when someone is referring to an athlete’s ability to perform feats on the sports field. Skilled motor control on a sports field, which may be referred to as a “reflex”, is in fact, not a reflex. It is a well-practiced movement that is stored in motor memory which when recalled, appears effortless, but still requires the activation of upper motor neurons to produce the effect. An important aspect of the design of the muscle reflex is that it is mediated by increases in tension in the muscle spindle, which as you would remember from practical 3, is an important somatic position receptor. In order that position sensation is always provided, this receptor is always active. Because this receptor not only provides sensory information to the brain, but also synapses on lower motor neurons, skeletal muscle is always being activated to contract even at rest. Constant muscle contraction at rest is called skeletal muscle tone. Muscle tone is also assessed clinically using a simple approach that you will practice in the present practical. Its clinical importance will be highlighted in subsequent discussion. STATION A-1: Muscle power and tone Skeletal muscle power As indicated in the aforementioned discussion, to determine whether a patient has damage to either the upper motor neuron which initiates movement, or the lower motor neuron (or muscle), which mediates contraction, you should assess purposeful movement. With subtle changes in the ability to initiate movement (produced by partial damage to upper or lower motor neurons), it is inadequate just to observe whether patients can perform a movement. You should assess their power to perform a movement. The most effective manner in which to do this is to ask patients to pull or push a limb whilst you resist the movement. The present practical will allow you to perform these assessments for a number of movements that are tested clinically. 7 To assess muscle power, you should perform the following tasks on one of your colleagues at STATION A-1: - Look at the photographs provided, showing you how your partner should hold their limb whilst you resist movement. - Ask your partner to either push or pull whilst you resist the movement and assess their strength (power) in the context of what you would expect someone of their size to produce. Skeletal muscle tone As indicated in the aforementioned discussion, skeletal muscle is partly contracted even at rest, to some extent because of constant firing from muscle spindles producing persistent lower motor neuron activation. When damage to lower motor neurons occurs, it is therefore obvious that muscle tone will decrease. However, when damage to upper motor neurons occurs, changes in the lower motor neurons may produce the opposite effect. These changes to lower motor neurons are because a reduced amount of neurotransmitter is release from upper motor neurons onto lower motor neurons. The lower motor neuron therefore responds to this by becoming more sensitive to activation (through a number of mechanisms). Lower motor neurons will therefore be more sensitive to the constant muscle spindle activation that occurs at rest. Hence, in lesions of upper motor neurons, muscle tone may increase and not decrease. Thus, an important assessment of patients with muscle weakness should include an assessment of their muscle tone. These assessments are conducted by the examiner passively moving limbs around a patient’s joint, whilst patients are fully relaxed. As the limbs move, the examiner assesses the resistance to movement generated, i.e. the tone of the muscle. The present practical provides you with an opportunity to perform these assessments. To assess muscle tone, you should perform the following tasks on one of your colleagues at STATION A-1: - Ask your laboratory partner to relax completely and not to tense their muscles or move their limbs in any way when you are assessing them. 8 - Look at the photographs provided, showing you how you should hold your partner’s limbs whilst you passively move the limbs around joints for your partner. - As you move your partner’s limbs, palpate the muscle that would normally be producing the movement.

You should comment on whether upper or a lower motor neuronal damage has occurred and the reasons for the weakness being on the same side as the damage in patients A and B, but on the opposite side of the damage in patient’s C and D. You should also comment on the distribution of the weakness in case A. 3) Give a physiological explanation for the changes in muscle tone noted in the clinical cases A-D given in the appendix to the present practical session. You should comment on why case A has a reduced muscle tone in contrast to cases C-D where the muscle tone is increased. 9 STATION A-2: Skeletal muscle stretch reflexes As indicated in the aforementioned discussion, although the adult human depends largely on initiating movement through activation of upper motor neurons, some movement can be produced by activation of simple muscle reflexes, the essential components of which have been illustrated in a previous figure. These reflexes occur in response to stretch of a muscle and the transfer of tension into muscle spindles. When damage to lower motor neurons occurs, it is obvious that because the efferent component of the reflex has been eliminated, muscle reflexes will be reduced. However, as with muscle tone, when damage to upper motor neurons occurs, changes in the lower motor neurons may produce the opposite effect on muscle reflexes as well. These changes to lower motor neurons have been described in the aforementioned discussion, but briefly involve sensitization to activation. Lower motor neurons will therefore also be more sensitive to muscle spindle activation during a muscle reflex. Hence, in lesions of upper motor neurons, muscle reflexes may increase and not decrease. Thus, an important assessment of patients with muscle weakness should include an assessment of their muscle reflexes. The present practical provides you with an opportunity to observe and assess a number of skeletal muscle stretch reflexes that form part of a clinical examination. To assess skeletal muscle stretch reflexes, you should perform the following tasks on one of your colleagues at STATION A-2: - Ask your laboratory partner to relax completely and not to tense their muscles or move their limbs in any way when you are assessing them. - Look at the photographs provided showing you how you should hold your partner’s limbs and gently strike the tendons with the rubber end of a patellar hammer to elicit various reflexes. - Observe the movement that results from contraction of the muscle that was stimulated. 10 Questions 1) Indicate whether a superficial skeletal muscle reflex is produced by stimulation of a receptor in tendons or in muscle. Identify the receptor that mediates the effect. 2) Complete the following table Reflex tested Photograph number Spinal level involved Biceps reflex…………………………………………….……………………………… Triceps reflex…………………………………………………...…….………………… Radial reflex……………………………………………………….….………………… Quadriceps reflex……………………………………………….…….………………… Ankle reflex…………………………………………………………..………………… _____________________________________________________________________ 3) Give a physiological explanation for the changes in muscle reflexes noted in the clinical cases A-D given in the appendix to the present practical session. You should comment on why case A has reduced muscle reflexes in contrast to cases C-D where the muscle reflexes are increased. You should also comment on why case A has certain reflexes that are impaired whilst others in the same leg are intact. STATION A-3 The plantar response or reflex Simple skeletal muscle reflexes may be mediated, not only in response to skeletal muscle stretch, but also by activating mechanoreceptors through noxious (potentially harmful) stimuli. Most of our actions to avoid injury employ skeletal muscle contraction that requires upper motor neurons to initiate the movement. However, if mechanoreceptors are activated through noxious stimuli, a simple reflex may be produced that does not require activation of upper motor neurons. One such reflex is the plantar response, where the toes normally plantar-flex in response to stimulation of the outer border of the plantar surface of our feet. Through a mechanism 11 that is not fully understood, although upper motor neurons do not mediate this reflex they obviously contribute to the character of the reflex. Indeed, if upper motor neurons are damaged, the reflex is characterized by dorsi-flexion rather than plantar-flexion. This sign has been named after the founder of the sign and is thus called the Babinski sign. Assessing this reflex is an important part of the clinical examination. To assess the plantar reflex, you should perform the following tasks on one of your colleagues at STATION A-3: - Ask your laboratory partner to take off their shoes and socks and to lie down on the couch provided. - Use the end of the patellar hammer which does not have rubber and lightly stroke it from the back to the front of the outer edge of the plantar surface of the foot. - Observe the movements of the toes. Question 1) Give a physiological explanation for the changes in the plantar responses noted in the clinical cases A-D given in the appendix to the present practical session. B. Cranial nerve motor functions The ability to perform movement in the head and neck is critical to human survival. Without the capacity to eat, smile, frown, show anger or sadness, talk, move the eyes, close the eyes, open the eyes, turn the head, move the tongue or moderate pupil size in response to light, there is little chance of survival. As with all motor functions these functions are controlled by upper motor neurons originating from the motor cortex on either side of the brain, which activate lower motor neurons, which, in the case of the head and neck, originate in cranial nerve nuclei found in the midbrain, pons or medulla. The cranial nerves contain the axons of the lower motor neurons whose cell bodies are found in the cranial nerve nuclei. The cranial nerves emerge from the base of the brain and supply both sides of the head and neck as illustrated in the Figure provided overleaf. As with lower motor neurons found in the spinal cord, which are located in the anterior horns bilaterally, each supplying the ipsilateral side of the body, 12 lower motor neurons supplying the head and neck are located in cranial nerve nuclei, also represented on both sides of the brainstem. The cranial nerves with major motor functions are highlighted in blocks in the Figure provided below. It is probably because of the importance of head and neck function, that generally the upper motor neurons that control the lower motor neurons found in the cranial nerves represented on each side of the brainstem, are derived from motor cortical areas ON BOTH SIDES of the brain (see following Figure). This is in contrast to upper motor neurons that control the lower motor neurons represented on each side of the spinal cord which control limb and trunk movement. These upper motor neurons that control limb and trunk movement are derived from motor cortical areas on ONLY ONE SIDE of the brain (see Figure). 13 Upper motor neurons from motor cortex to spinal cord lower motor neurons (unilateral, contralateral UMN innervation of LMN) Upper motor neurons from motor cortex to cranial nerve lower motor neurons (bilateral UMN innervation of LMN) The relative importance of head and neck movement in human function is also highlighted by the comparative numbers of upper motor neurons controlling head and neck movement as compared to those controlling limb and trunk movement. Indeed, in the motor cortex, there are far more upper motor neurons controlling movement of the head area than there are of upper motor neurons controlling the arms, trunk or legs. Diseases of the brain may affect motor function of the head and neck and these motor abnormalities serve as an important guide to identifying the area of the brain involved. Hence, it is important to be able to assess head and neck motor function. A general principle of severe brain disease is that it involves either one or the other side, as if it involved both sides, survival is usually not possible. Because of the bilateral upper motor neuron supply to head and neck lower motor neurons, unilateral diseases of the upper motor neurons controlling head a neck function would be compensated for by upper motor control from the other side of the brain. Thus, to produce abnormalities of head and neck motor function with unilateral brain disease, the disease normally involves cranial nerve lower motor neurons in the brainstem nuclei, or their nerves. However, the exceptions to this are the VIIth cranial nerve and the XIIth cranial nerve. By engaging in the following tasks and questions these concepts should become clearer to you. 14 STATION B-1: Pupillary reflexes The pupils of the eye can constrict or dilate depending on the degree of light available. This effect is mediated by contraction or relaxation of the muscles of the iris. The purpose of the presence of the iris is to limit bright light entering the eyes, thus preventing light-induced decreases in rhodopsin and changes in pigments in cones occurring in the retinal surface. Too bright a light will result in a striking decrease in rhodopsin and changes in cone pigments and a reduced capacity for dark adaptation when moving into areas of dim light. An inability to quickly adapt to seeing in dim light has obvious negative consequences for survival. Hence, when in bright light, the iris reacts to reduce the pupillary diameter to as small a value as possible without limiting vision. That is, in bright light, pupillary constriction occurs. However, in dim light, there is an obvious advantage to allow as much light through the pupil as possible to enhance vision. Under these circumstances the muscles of the iris change to dilate the pupil. The capacity to produce pupillary constriction in response to light is mediated through a reflex, with both the afferent and the efferent components of the reflex involving cranial nerves. To assess pupillary reflexes, you should perform the following tasks on one of your colleagues at STATION B-1: - Cover the left eye with a hand. - Use the flashlight to shine light into the right eye. - Record the pupillary response in the right eye. - Repeat the procedure with the right eye covered and shining the light into the left eye. Direct pupillary responses: Left light →………….……Right light →……….….….. - Place the hand vertically in line with the nose, so that it separates the left from the right eye. - Use the flashlight to shine light into the right eye. - Record the pupillary response in the left eye. - Repeat the procedure by shining the light into the left eye. - Record the pupillary response in the right eye. Consensual pupillary responses: Left light →…………..…Right light →…….……. 15 Questions 1) Indicate the cranial nerves that mediate the: a) afferent component of the pupillary light reflexes. b) efferent component of the pupillary light reflexes. 2) Describe the brain pathways responsible for the consensual pupillary light reflex. 3) The pupillary light reflex involves the parasympathetic nervous system constricting pupils. Describe the neuronal pathways responsible for the sympathetic control of pupillary dilation, where the sympathetic fibers originate from in ganglia, and the level of the spinal cord that supplies the ganglia. 4) Giving reasons for your answer, indicate the effect of a muscarinic receptor antagonist on pupil diameter. 5) Giving reasons for your answer, predict whether you would note changes in the direct or consensual light reflexes in clinical case C given in the appendix to the present practical session, if a light was shone in the patient’s right eye. STATION B-2: Accommodation reflex The accommodation reflex is designed to allow one to focus on a near point. The factors that are important in visualizing a near point have been discussed in practical 3. Two important changes in the eye that occur when focusing on a near point are alterations to the shape of the lens and pupillary changes that channel light into the centre of the lens. The accommodation reflex is also a reflex mediated by cranial nerves and is tested in neural disease to assist with identifying the cause of the disease. To assess the pupillary response during the accommodation reflex, you should perform the following tasks on a colleague who does not require visual aids at STATION B-2: - Stand ~5 meters away from your laboratory partner. - Hold up a card with a few words and ask your laboratory partner to focus on one word while you slowly walk towards your laboratory partner. - A third person should observe the size of the pupils. - Repeat the procedure with the card < 0.5 meters away from your laboratory partner. 16 - The third person should again observe the size of the pupils. Record the change in pupil size observe when focused on text whilst ~5 meters as opposed to < 0.5 meters away. ………………………………………………………..………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………….. Questions 1) Indicate the cranial nerves that mediate the: a) afferent component of the accommodation reflex. b) efferent component of the accommodation reflex. 2) Indicate whether the accommodation light reflex is a parasympathetic nervous system or a sympathetic nervous system reflex. 3) Giving reasons for your answer indicate the effect of a muscarinic receptor antagonist on the accommodation reflex. 4) Giving reasons for your answer, predict whether you would note changes in the accommodation reflex in clinical cases C or D given in the appendix to the present practical session. STATION B-3: Corneal reflex The corneal surface of the eye is one of the few parts of our anatomy where the mucous membrane is constantly exposed to the environment. Mucosal surfaces do not have the same protective cells or interstitial substances as the skin and hence require other mechanisms to protect these surfaces. The cornea is particularly vulnerable and is constantly susceptible to damage that may be produced by small or large foreign bodies which may settle on this mucosal surface. When foreign bodies do settle on it, they have to be quickly removed to prevent damage to the cornea. Damage to the corneal surface with scar tissue formation would result in a reduced translucency of the cornea and hence a decreased vision. The formation of tears obviously provides lubrication, but the ability to close the eyes when a foreign body touches the corneal surface, in order to move these foreign bodies to the side, is a critical protective 17 mechanism. Closing the eyes in response to a foreign body must be quick, and hence requires a simple reflex. This reflex is called the corneal reflex. To assess the corneal reflex, you should perform the following task on a colleague at STATION B-3: - Take a piece of cotton wool and roll one small piece into a point. - Stand facing your laboratory partner. - Place the end of the small point of the cotton wool on the lateral corneal surface of each eye. - Record the response. Response to cotton wool placed on corneal surface. ………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………… Questions. 1) Indicate the cranial nerve that mediates the: a) afferent component of the corneal reflex. b) efferent component of the corneal reflex. 2) Giving reasons for your answer, predict whether you would note changes in the corneal reflex in clinical cases C or D given in the appendix to the present practical session. STATION B-4: Head and neck motor function As highlighted in the aforementioned discussion, movement of the head and neck, which is under the control of lower motor neurons found in cranial nerve nuclei, is critical to survival for a number of reasons. Unlike the control of limb and trunk movement on one side of the body, which is under upper motor neuron control from one motor cortex (contralateral) only, the control of head and neck movement on one side is under upper motor neuron control from the motor cortices of both sides of the brain. Thus, diseases that involve upper motor neuron damage on one side of the brain (e.g. a disease that affects the motor cortex) will produce impaired motor function in 18 the contralateral limbs and trunk, but not of many aspects of head and neck function. This occurs because with respect to head and neck function, upper motor neuron damage to one motor cortex will be compensated for by the remaining upper motor neurons in the opposite motor cortex. However, there are a few exceptions, which include the control of tongue movement and the movement of the lower half of the face. For these exceptions, the functions on one side of the face are controlled by upper motor neurons derived from only one side (the contralateral side) of the brain. Because of some of the unique features of the control of head and neck movements, it is important to carefully define abnormalities of these movements in diseases of the brain. The presence of these abnormalities provides essential clues as to the area of the brain that has been damaged. To assess head and neck movement on your colleague, you should perform the following tasks on them at STATION B-4: Ask your colleague to: 1) face you whilst keeping their head still, and follow your finger with their eyes. Move your finger up, down and then side-to-side noting their eye movements. 2) repeatedly clench and unclench their teeth whilst you place a finger over their jaw and temporal regions. Note the muscle contractions in these regions. 3) smile at you, show you their teeth and then to blow up their cheeks while you press on them. Note the face movements when they smile or show you their teeth. 4) look up without moving their heads, whilst you note the movements of their forehead. Then close their eyes tightly while you try and prize them open. 5) open the mouth. Place a tongue depressor into the mouth and gently press down on the tongue whilst shining a light into the mouth until you note the uvula. Ask your colleague to say “aaah” while you observe the uvula movement. 6) hold their heads facing forward and resist your attempts to move their heads while you place your hand on one side of the head and try and push the head to turn it to the side. 7) resist your attempts to push their shoulders down whilst they lift up their shoulders. To perform this task, your colleague should sit on a chair and you should stand behind them, place your hands medial to their shoulders and push down. 8) stick out their tongue. 19 Questions 1) Complete the following table _____________________________________________________________________ Test listed above.

You should address issues related to the cranial nerves involved, the reasons for the dysfunction occurring on the side observed, the part of the brainstem involved and the reasons for some, but not other cranial nerve functions being preserved. C. Motor co-ordination and control STATION C-1 Although movement is largely initiated by upper motor neurons found in the motor cortex of the cerebral hemispheres, the ability to perform well-coordinated and skilled movements is driven by a number of other structures and systems in the nervous system. Skilled movements can only occur if motor memories are retrieved from the cerebral hemispheres by the basal ganglia, thus allowing for the quick initiation of complex sequences of movement without having to think of the movement before performing it. Well-coordinated movement can only occur if, through the cerebellum, movement is kept within the bounds of body position changes, as sensed by the 20 vestibular system and somatic position receptors. Without the basal ganglia, and hence the ability to retrieve motor memories, we would have to think about every movement, rather than relying on the quick retrieval of memorized movements. Without the vestibular system, appropriate somatic proprioceptor functions, or the cerebellum, we would not be able to move within the bounds of changes in body position changes. The result would be uncoordinated movements and an impaired ability to balance. Diseases of the nervous system frequently result in limitations of these functions. Hence, it is important that you are able to identify these abnormalities. The present practical will provide you with an opportunity to perform tests that relate to cerebellar and vestibular control and to observe and consider the physiological mechanisms that underlie these functions. To assess cerebellar and vestibular function, you should perform the following on your colleague at STATION C-1: - Ask your colleague to perform the following tasks: - 1) stand with their feet together and eyes open and watch their movement. - 2) walk in a straight line. - 3) with the left hand facing up, place the right hand on the palm of the left hand and as fast as they can, turn the right hand onto the dorsal surface and back to the palm and onto the dorsal surface and back to the palm over and over again as rapidly as possible. - 4) place your index finger approximately an arms distance from your colleague and ask them to touch their nose and then your finger and again touch their nose and then your finger over and over again as rapidly as possible. To observe abnormalities in cerebellar or vestibular function, you should perform the following on your colleague: - Ask your colleague to sit in a swivel chair with the head bent at an angle of 30o - Spin the chair clockwise for 20-30 seconds and stop the chair abruptly: Note the following: - the sensation that your colleague describes. ………………………………………………………………………………………….. 21 - the movement of your colleague’s eyes. ………………………………………………………………………………………….. - Immediately after stopping the chair, ask your colleague to again perform the tasks 1-4 conducted before sitting in the swivel chair. Record the ability to perform these tasks after as compared to before sitting in the swivel chair: ………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………… Questions 1) Indicate the observations noted in your colleague after sitting in the swivel chair that would be consistent with the following abnormalities associated with either vestibular or cerebellar function: a) Vertigo. b) Ataxia c) Nystagmus. d) Dysdiadochokinesis. e) Dysmetria.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
