Ihunwo, PhD School of Anatomical Sciences 1 Objectives • Describe the layers of the meninges and their relationship to the brain and skull bone. • Name and describe the spaces that are associated with the layers of the meninges and indicate which ones are real spaces and which ones are potential spaces. • Describe the general and superficial morphology of the brain (cerebrum). 2 Lecture Outline • Divisions of the Nervous System • Embryonic Origin of major subdivisions of Central Nervous System (CNS) • Functional Organization of CNS • Meninges ➢Dura Mater ➢Arachnoid Mater ➢Pia Mater • General features of the Cerebrum 3 Major Divisions of the Nervous System Nervous System Central Nervous System (CNS) Brain Spinal Cord Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) Sympathetic Enteric Para- sympathetic Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) Cranial Nerves (12) Spinal Nerves (31) 4 The last subdivision will be covered in the course of this Block You have come across some cranial nerves and spinal nerves (brachial plexus) already Figure A21 The ventricular system of the human brain (Part 3) Embryonic part of the CNS and the adult derivatives with cavitiesPrincipal Parts of Central Nervous System CNS Brain: Cerebrum, Diencephalon, Brainstem (midbrain, pons, medulla), & Cerebellum. Spinal Cord Neonate Functional Organization of the CNS • Projection Neurons: ➢ Sensory or motor or secretomotor ▪ Cell body & dendrites located away from where the axon ends. ▪ Long axons connecting different areas, such as a neuron in the cerebral cortex whose axon reaches the spinal cord and vice versa • Nuclear Masses: ➢ Motor: Basal Ganglia (Corpus Striatum) ➢ Sensory: Diencephalon and its subdivisions ➢ At PNS – Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) • Interneurons: ➢ Form a communicating and integrating network between sensory and motor neurons 7 Projection Neuron, Nuclear masses & interneurons via Brainstem: (Midbrain Pons Medulla) Every function of the brain will have these 3 Functional parts Meninges Definition: Membranous coverings of brain & spinal cord Three Coverings • Dura mater (Pachymeninx) (outer most) • Arachnoid mater (middle) • Pia mater (inner most) Leptomeninges refers to Arachnoid mater & pia mater Dura mater (Pachymeninx) Subdivide cranial cavity & limit movement of brain Tough membrane Layers: 1)Outer fibrous (Periosteal) 2) Inner meningeal with Dural venous sinus in between at some sites In folding (Reflections) of Dura Mater • Falx cerebri: Longitudinal fissure; attaches to crista galli of ethmoid bone and tentorium cerebelli • Falx cerebelli: Runs vertically along vermis of cerebellum and attached to internal occipital crest • Tentorium cerebelli: Sheet in transverse cerebral fissure between cerebrum & cerebellum. Free border encircles midbrain • Diaphragma sella: covers sella turcica (hypophysial fossa) with an opening for infundibulum 10 Rai et al 2018 Blood & Nerve supply to the Dura Mater Blood supply: ➢ Ant/post ethmoidal, internal carotid artery, ➢ Middle meningeal, maxillary, ➢ Ascending pharyngeal ➢ Occipital, vertebral Nerve supply: • Meningeal branches from ethmoidal (Ophthalmic), Maxillary, Mandibular & Upper cervical nerves Dura mater is sensitive to pain 11 Clinical Implications of Potential Dural Spaces ❖ Epidural (extradural) space ➢ Skull fractures lacerating middle meningeal arteries produce space occupying epidural (extradural) haematoma between skull and dura mater. ❖ Subdural space ➢ space between dura mater and arachnoid mater ➢ Subdural haematoma following tearing of veins and gradual seepage of blood into space Both require surgical intervention because of associated increased intracranial pressure 12 Arachnoid mater Features • Thin avascular membrane • Attaches to dura by several layers of flattened cells • Conforms to general shape of brain • Does not dip into sulci • Separated from pia by arachnoid trabeculae and subarachnoid space for circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 13 Specializations of Arachnoid • Arachnoid trabeculae ➢ strands of collagenous connective tissue from arachnoid to pia ➢ Maintain patency • Arachnoid villi/granulations ➢ evaginations (outgrowths) of arachnoid projecting through dura into sinuses ➢ with age become large & aggregated (granulations) 14 Subarachnoid Space • Located between arachnoid mater and pia mater • Contains Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood vessels and trabeculae cells • Site for Subarachnoid haemorrhage Pia mater Features • A delicate membrane - 2 to 3 cells thick • Attaches to end feet of arachnoid trabeculae • Invests surfaces of brain and closely follows all sulci/surfaces of brain • Arteries and veins penetrate the pia when they enter/leave brain substance (perivascular space) 16 Spinal Meninges Features • Devoid of fibrous layer of dura which ends at margin of foramen magnum • Not much difference in arachnoid mater • Spinal pia mater forms 21 denticulate ligaments and thickened anteriorly to give a shining appearance in midline, called linea splendens 17 Anatomical Terms of Planes and Relations as used in CNS 18 Cerebrum: General and superficial morphology 19 • Poles: – Frontal, Occipital and temporal • Lobes: – Frontal, Parietal, Occipital, Temporal, Insular – (named after covering bones except the insular) • Borders: – Superomedial, Inferior lateral – Transverse cerebral fissure separates cerebral hemispheres from cerebellum • Surfaces: – Superolateral, medial, Inferior (Orbital & Temporal) • Longitudinal Fissure separates cerebral hemispheres into Right and Left halves http://www.webmd.com/brain/picture-of-the-brain Features on Surface of cerebral hemispheres • Gyri (plural of gyrus) – Elevated ridges – Entire surface • Grooves separate gyri – A sulcus is a shallow groove (plural, sulci) – Deeper grooves are fissures Gyri & Sulci on Superolateral surface of cerebrum • Lateral sulcus (Sylvius): between frontal, Parietal & temporal lobes. • Central sulcus (Rolando): between frontal & occipital pole Landmark separating frontal from parietal lobes • Frontal lobe: Largest: 3 sulci: Precentral sulcus, Superior & inferior frontal sulci • 4 gyri: Precentral gyrus, Superior, middle & inferior gyri Parietal Lobe Sulcus: Postcentral & Intraparietal Gyri: Postcentral, superior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule with supramarginal & angular gyri 21 Gyri & Sulci on Temporal & Occipital lobes • Temporal lobe ➢ Inferior to lateral sulcus. ➢ Sulci: superior & inferior ➢ Gyri: superior, middle & inferior. • Occipital lobe ➢ Posterior to line joining pre- occipital notch to parieto- occipital sulcus (medial surface) ➢ Lateral occipital sulcus (lunate): fairly constant sulcus on superolateral surface ➢ Calcarine sulcus (medial surface) 22 Gyri & Sulci on INSULAR LOBE • Location: – floor of lateral sulcus; seen only when temporal & frontal lobes are separated • Opercular: parts of frontal, parietal & temporal lobes that overlie insula. • Outlined by a circular sulcus divided into 2 regions by a central sulcus • 3-4 short anterior gyri • 1-2 long posterior gyri 23 Gyri & Sulci on Medial Surface • Corpus callosum – most conspicuous structure; white matter • Cingulate sulcus – intervenes between cingulate gyrus & extension of superior frontal gyrus. • Paracentral lobule • Middle frontal gyrus • Precuneus, Cuneus & Lingual gyri • Parieto-occipital sulcus • Calcarine sulcus – Occipital lobe 24 Gyri & Sulci on Inferior Surface • Divided into 2 parts Small Anterior (orbital) part: – olfactory sulcus, gyrus rectus; – H-shaped sulcus with anterior, posterior, lateral & medial orbital gyri Large posterior part: – Collateral sulcus – occipito-temporal sulcus – medial and lateral occipito- temporal gyri – parahippocampal gyrus Uncus: hook-like projection at anterior end of parahippocampal gyrus for olfaction 25 Questions • What are the adult derivatives of the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon • Describe the three structures that constitute the functional organization of the CNS • Describe the features of each layer of the meninges of the brain and the associated spaces • What are the reflections of the dura matter • What is the arterial blood supply and innervation of the dura mater • Describe the named sulci and gyri of the lobes of the superolateral, medial and inferior surfaces of the cerebrum. 26","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
