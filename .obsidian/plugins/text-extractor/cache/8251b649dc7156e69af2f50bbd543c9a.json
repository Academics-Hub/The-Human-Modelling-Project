Pellagra http://mark.asci.ncsu.edu/Nutrition/NutritionSlides/33.jpg Pellagra is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B3 (niacin). Using the terms vitamin B3 or niacin interchangeably is fine (all the vitamins have two names that can be used interchangeably). Nutrition-related Diseases • NO constants! Different individuals, different requirements. • Multiple nutrient deficiencies more likely Useful Nutritional Definitions • DIET: Selection of foods eaten by an individual. • NUTRIENT: Substance absorbed and used to promote cellular activities and thus body functions. e.g. carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals and water. All these nutrients are essential for health. • BALANCED DIET: Appropriate amounts of each nutrient. • ESSENTIAL: Necessary for cellular metabolism but cannot be synthesised by the body. MUST be included in the diet e.g. vitamins, essential amino acids, essential fatty acids. • RDA: Recommended Daily Allowance. Amount per day needed to prevent clinical deficiency. There is a wide range, as well as different countries having different numbers. Thus NUTRITION examines qualitative and quantitative requirements of the diet necessary to maintain good health. NB MALNUTRITION can either be Under (starvation) or Over (obesity) nutrition Vitamins • Are organic compounds essential for normal metabolism and health, which are required in small amounts. • Are found in a wide range of foods as they cannot be synthesised by the body. • Classified into water- and fat-soluble. Nothing in common within each class apart from either water or lipid solubility. • Biosynthetic pathways may be complex so it is more efficient to ingest vitamins than to synthesise enzymes required for making the vitamins. The cost is a dependence on other organisms for making chemicals required for life as opposed to the body making the vitamins. • Deficiency of a single vitamin rare, BUT specific syndromes of individual vitamins exist. Water-soluble Vitamins • Include the B complex vitamins, vitamin C, folate and biotin. • Except for vitamin B12 which is stored in the liver, the rest of the vitamin B complex vitamins are excreted in excess. That is they are not stored in the body (eg glycogen is is the storage form of glucose, and lipid is stored in adipose tissue). Water solubility means that excess vitamins are excreted in urine. • All B complex vitamins act as coenzymes. • Most can be absorbed by simple diffusion if taken in high doses. Vitamin B12 is an exception as cobalamin requires a protein called intrinsic factor for its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.

Vegans & intrinsic factor-deficient people Intestinal parasites e.g. tapeworm Dry & Wet Beriberi Images from Biesalski, Pocket Atlas of Nutrition © 2006 Thieme Vitamin B12 absorption mechanism • Intestinal enteric bacteria synthesise vitamin B12. • Intrinsic Factor (IF) is a protein secreted by gastric parietal cells, which binds to the dietary vitamin B12. • The vitamin B12/IF complex is resistant to pancreatic proteases and is then absorbed into gastrointestinal enterocyte cells. • In enterocytes, vitamin B12 binds to transcobalamin II (TCII) for delivery from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver. • Megaloblastic anaemia (immature red blood cells) occurs if there is decreased vitamin B12 absorption.

Thiamine (vit B1) deficiency →↓PDH activity. causes lack of energy & lactic acidosis = beri-beri N.B. ethanol inhibits absorption of thiamine. Fat-soluble Vitamins • Vitamins A, D, E and K are the fat-soluble vitamins. • Absorption occurs with fat micelles in the gut. Thus A, D, E and K are only absorbed when there is normal fat absorption in presence of bile acids and lipids. • Diffusion occurs across the brush border membrane because these vitamins dissolve in the lipid bilayer membranes. A, D, E and K leave mainly via the lymph vessels or hepatic portal vein in smaller amounts. • Storage of these vitamins occurs in liver (K cant, B12 can). Therefore there is some protection against deficiency because a reservoir is in the liver. • Drugs that kill intestinal flora decreases vitamin K, B12 and biotin synthesis.

Ricketts occurs in vitamin D deficiency. • In children growth of bones abnormal as insufficient Ca2+ Bones softer and more flexible hence bowlegged rickets look. • Ca2+ absorption is decreased in the elderly especially if they are bedridden. • Diminished sunlight exposure occurs in the elderly. In areas of low natural light (e.g. northern Europe) those who are dark skinned, those who wear veils may have vitamin D deficiencies. Certain antiacid drugs may also decrease calcium absorption from the gut. Vitamin D Biosynthesis Image from Human Physiology, The Basis of Medicine Third Edition Gillian Pocock & Christopher D. Richards Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) • Are powerful oxidation agents that damage cellular structures and functional molecules • O2 → O2- (superoxide) → O22- (peroxide) + O- • ROS can be catalysed by iron ions • Antioxidants are reducing agents that react easily with oxidative substances & protect cells e.g. β-carotene and vitamin E Minerals • Inorganic ions needed for normal cellular activity. • Many are cofactors in biological reactions. • Macrominerals. Humans need > 100 mg per day. • Microminerals (trace elements). We need < 100 mg per day (Does NOT mean low importance! • Deficiencies may occur when foods come from one region where the soil in which the food is grown may be deficient in some minerals. Macrominerals • Generally nutrients or electrolytes or are used for signalling. • Na+, K+ & Cl-. Electrolytes in body fluids & action potentials. • Thus required for fluid balance, nerve & muscle function. • Na+& Cl- ubiquitous in food, so deficiency impossible. Food processing increases Na+ content of food. • K+ major intracellular ion – spinach, fruits. Loss in diarrhoea. Macrominerals Mineral Major Dietary Sources Major Functions Effects of Deficiency Calcium Dairy, fish, spinach, herbs, nuts Ionised is an intracellular messenger and is used in electromechanical coupling.

Iron • Next to haemoglobin, the liver is the most important storage site. • Iron absorption limited as iron has a tendency to form insoluble salts with hydroxides, phosphates, bicarbonate and other anions in the gut. • Vitamin C enhances absorption by forming soluble complexes. • Vitamin C is an antioxidant and so Fe3+ is converted to Fe2+. • Fe2+ more soluble; so when iron supplements are prescribed vitamin C should be taken (as orange juice?) • Iron required for electron transport and redox reactions. Anaemias Images from Biesalski, Pocket Atlas of Nutrition © 2006 Thieme Megaloblastic anaemia with hypersegmented granulocytes Normal blood Iron-deficiency anaemia (hypochromic) Microminerals Mineral Major Dietary Sources Major Functions Effects of Deficiency Iodine Bread, iodised salt, seaweed, ocean fish: haddock, cod, sole Thyroid hormone structure & function Thus control of metabolic rate Goitre caused by thyroid gland hyperplasia.
