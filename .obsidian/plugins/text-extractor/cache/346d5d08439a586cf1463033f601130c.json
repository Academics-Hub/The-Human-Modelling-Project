Analysis of urine and plasma provides important information about the function of the kidney and maintaining homeostasis. Damage to the kidneys, resulting in an impaired renal function, is an important cause of chronic disability and ultimately mortality in Africa. As a consequence of damage to the kidneys, many patients require regular dialysis and ultimately renal transplantation in order to survive. What are the potential consequences to the body of renal dysfunction? In renal failure, an imbalance of body fluid regulation may result in fluid overload and consequently pulmonary and peripheral oedema. The electrolyte disturbances that occur in kidney failure, such as hyperkalaemia and hypernatraemia can change the function of excitable tissue or the distribution of fluid volume between the intracellular and extracellular compartment. These electrolyte alterations may cause seizures, paralysis or a generally impaired neuronal or muscular function (see sections on body fluid balance and excitable tissue physiology). Renal disease may result in an impaired ability of the kidneys to excrete H+ and retain HCO3- ions, the consequence being a metabolic acidosis and severe disturbances of the function of all tissues, including the heart, brain and other key organ systems. Damage to the kidneys may elevate blood pressures to extremely high levels resulting in brain oedema or cardiac dysfunction and failure. An impaired hormonal function in kidney disease can result in renal rickets or chronic anaemia and an impaired ability of the kidney to excrete metabolic or other toxins and drugs can quickly result in the toxic effects of these substances on the brain and other tissues. Considering the important role of the kidney in health and disease, it is therefore critical that you understand the normal functions of the kidney in order that you understand the consequences to the body of an abnormal function of the kidney. The objective of the present practical is to provide you with an opportunity to engage in some of the tests that are employed to assess renal function and will also provide demonstrations and “cases” that illustrate the elegant functions of the kidneys and the impact of renal disease 3 on the body. The experiments that you need to perform are placed in white boxes in the text. Each experiment is followed by questions that you need to answer. NB – practical-based questions will form part of your online quiz. Practical stations STATION A: Demonstration of the function of the kidney and analysis of changes in kidney function. A-1: Normal function of the kidney. A-2: Abnormal function of the kidney. STATION B: Blood and urine analysis in health and in kidney disease. B-1: Urine volume, specific gravity and osmolarity. B-2: Creatinine clearance, plasma urea and creatinine concentrations, and urea-to-creatinine ratios. B-3: Urinalysis using dipsticks. STATION A-1 Normal function of the kidney A misconception in many minds is that the kidney acts as a very fine “sieve”, retaining everything that is valuable and filtering everything that is of no value. What should be appreciated is that the kidney is not an organ that selectively filters only those substances that we don’t require through the glomerular membrane, but in fact filters just about everything in the blood except for blood cells and a few substances such as albumin. In this regard, about one quarter of all blood that is pumped to the body reaches the kidneys (25% of cardiac output), of which about one half is plasma and about 20% of the plasma is filtered through the glomeruli into the tubular fluid. This amounts to approximately 125 ml of plasma that is filtered per minute, or 180 000 ml of fluid per day. In other words, about 180 litres of fluid containing everything in the blood except for cells and some proteins is normally filtered through the glomeruli to enter the proximal parts of the tubules on an average day (the filtrate). If the kidneys consisted of only blood vessels and glomeruli, without functional tubules, it would therefore take approximately half an hour for us to lose all of our plasma. This is obviously not 4 a system that could sustain life. How is the kidney designed to prevent us from losing 180 litres of fluid in a day? A principal function of the kidney is to reabsorb most of the filtered fluid back into the blood, via the kidney tubules. Indeed, the kidney tubules reabsorb an astonishingly high proportion of the substances that are filtered and only leave behind for excretion in the urine, those few substances that are no longer required by our bodies. The present practical station is designed to impress upon you the extent to which most substances are filtered at the glomeruli and the incredible capacity of the kidney tubules to reabsorb these filtered substances, which if not reabsorbed, would cause catastrophic losses of many of the essential elements of our bodies. To appreciate the amount of fluid and solutes that are filtered and reabsorbed each day by the kidney, at STATION A-1 you should complete the following task. - Using the data provided at the demonstration, record the quantity of the substances filtered at the glomeruli and excreted in the urine each day in the table below. Calculate the proportion of each substance filtered that is reabsorbed by the kidney tubules. Substance Filtered Excreted in urine Proportion of filtered substance reabsorbed (%) Proportion of filtered substance excreted (%) Water (l/day) Na +(g/day) K + (g/day) Glucose (g/day) Protein (g/day) HCO3- (g/day) Urea (g/day) Creatinine (g/day) 5 Questions 1) From the calculated values for the proportion of each of these substances that is reabsorbed relative to that filtered, determine whether the principal role of the tubules is to reabsorb or secrete each of these substances. Explain your answer in each case. 2) Identify the portion of the tubule that reabsorbs or secretes each of these substances and indicate the physiological mechanisms responsible in each case. 3) Using the data that you have obtained to assist you with your answer, give a reason to explain the use of creatinine clearance rather than urea clearance as an estimate of glomerular filtration rate. STATION A-2 Abnormal function of the kidney The enormous quantity of fluid and solute that is filtered at the glomeruli each day and the astonishing capacity of the tubules to reabsorb the bulk of this water and solute, means that under normal conditions, fluid and electrolyte balance can be finely tuned by simply altering the relationship between filtration and reabsorption. For example, under conditions of modest dehydration, two effects may occur. First, renal blood flow and hence glomerular filtration rate may be reduced. Second, through a number of mechanisms, an increased reabsorption of water and Na + occurs throughout the tubule, effects that are in-part mediated by the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system and antidiuretic hormone, but largely mediated by other forces such as peritubular capillary hydrostatic and oncotic pressures (see notes from lectures). Through these changes, less fluid is filtered, and more is reabsorbed, blood volume increases, and fluid balance is retained. Obviously when modest over-hydration occurs, the opposite effects are noted. However, what is the consequence to the body if damage to the kidneys occurs? Because of the enormous volume of fluid filtered each day, there is very little consequence to the body until the majority of nephrons to the kidney are destroyed and glomerular filtration rate is reduced to ~10 ml/min or less. At this point, the compensatory changes in viable nephrons, which would be to decrease reabsorption of fluid and solutes, may have reached maximum capacity. These compensatory changes may in-part be mediated by decreases in the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system and a reduced release of antidiuretic hormone. However, as indicated above, reabsorption is largely mediated through the effects of peritubular capillary hydrostatic and oncotic pressures and these are unlikely to change to a dramatic degree in 6 individual viable nephrons. Consequently, viable nephrons may not be able to completely compensate for fluid overload by decreasing reabsorption. Thus, eventually, clinically evident fluid overload will occur, the consequences being oedema (peripheral and pulmonary) and an increased blood pressure. At the point that glomerular filtration rate reaches ~10 ml/min or less, a dramatic reduction in the filtration of K+ is also noted and an increased plasma K+ concentration will occur. Further, because the elimination of urea, creatinine and a number of metabolic products depend on glomerular filtration rate, the concentrations of these substances will increase and so called “uraemia” will be the result. With an accumulation of these metabolic products, toxic effects on the brain will accompany these alterations (uraemic encephalopathy). If some remaining viable nephrons still filter fluid, but because selective damage to tubules has occurred in these nephrons, there will be a reduced capacity of the tubules to handle this fluid. The consequences will be that the concentrating capacity of the kidneys decreases (a reduction of the counter-current exchange mechanism and an insensitivity of the renal tubule to antidiuretic hormone may occur) which may cause an increase in plasma Na + concentration. This may produce fluid shifts from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment which in the brain will result in innumerable deleterious effects. Moreover, if renal tubular damage occurs in some viable nephrons with intact glomeruli, the reduced ability of these tubules to reabsorb HCO3 - will result in a metabolic acidosis, with an impaired cellular function being the consequence. The aforementioned changes that occur in renal failure are often difficult for the novice to comprehend. What will assist you in your understanding is to study the excretion of fluids and solutes in a person with renal failure. The present practical station therefore gives you the opportunity to compare the filtration and reabsorption capacity of a person with renal failure, that has occurred as a consequence of damage to the kidneys. To appreciate the changes in the amount of fluid and solutes that are filtered and reabsorbed each day in a patient with renal failure, at STATION A-2 you should complete the following task. - Using the data provided at the demonstration, record the quantity of the substances filtered at the glomeruli and excreted in the urine each day in the patient described at this STATION, whose clinical data is also provided in CASE A in the appendix. Calculate the proportion of each substance filtered that is reabsorbed by the kidney tubules. 7 Questions 1) By comparing the patient’s data provided at STATION A-2 to that obtained from a normal person shown at STATION A-1 to assist you with your answer, give a physiological explanation for the presence of oedema in the patient. 2) By comparing the filtration of the patient’s solutes given at STATION A-2 to the filtration of solutes from a normal person given at STATION A-1 to assist you with your answer, give a physiological explanation for the patient’s plasma a) creatinine concentration. b) urea concentration. c) K + concentration of 6.4 mmol/l (normal range=3.3-5.3) noted after a few days of consuming a normal K+ intake of 3.9-4.0 g per day. 3a) By comparing the proportion of filtered Na+ that is reabsorbed in the patient to the proportion of filtered Na + that is reabsorbed in the normal person whose data is provided at STATION A-1, comment on the function of the tubules in the patient. b) Calculate the fractional Na+ excretion (FeNa) in CASE A in the appendix to this practical session. By comparing the fractional Na + excretion in CASE A to the proportion of filtered Na+ that is excreted in the normal person whose data is provided at STATION A-1, comment on the function of the tubules in CASE A. 4a) From the data provided at STATION A-2, calculate the proportion of filtered HCO3- that is reabsorbed in the patient. b) By comparing the proportion of filtered HCO3- that is reabsorbed in the patient to the proportion of filtered HCO3- that is reabsorbed in the normal person whose data is provided at STATION A-1, explain an arterial blood pH of 7.22 (normal range =7.36- 7.55) in the patient. Substance Filtered Excreted in urine Proportion of filtered substance reabsorbed (%) Proportion of filtered substance excreted (%) Water (l/day) Na + (g/day) Creatinine (g/day) 8 STATION B STATION B-1 Blood and urine osmolarity. Consider the normal renal response to an increased salt intake (i.e. eating salty food) or a reduced water intake (no access to water). After salt is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, it will increase the Na+ concentration and hence the osmolarity of plasma. If water intake decreases, plasma osmolarity will increase. The consequence in either situation will be that antidiuretic hormone is released from the pituitary gland (in response to osmolarity changes), which then acts on the collecting duct of the kidney and increases water, but not solute reabsorption. The result is that a low volume of highly concentrated urine will be excreted. Hence, in response to an increased plasma osmolarity, urine osmolarity will also increase. However, what if renal tubular function is impaired? If damage to renal tubules occurs, the collecting duct will not respond to an increased plasma osmolarity and the consequence will be that plasma osmolarity may be increased, but urine osmolarity may remain either normal or may in fact be reduced. Thus, as renal tubular function decreases, a reduction in the ability of renal tubules to concentrate urine will alter the relationship between plasma solute concentrations (osmolarity) and urine osmolarity. As you have learned in the section on body fluid physiology earlier this year, plasma osmolarity can be estimated from plasma Na+, K +, urea and glucose concentrations, whilst urine osmolarity can either be measured or estimated from urine specific gravity. In the present practical you will be given the opportunity, from plasma osmolarity and urine specific gravity determinations, to assess whether you understand the abnormalities of plasma and urine osmolarity that may occur in patients with renal tubular dysfunction. 9 To appreciate the abnormalities of plasma and urine osmolarity that may occur in patients with renal tubular dysfunction, you should perform the following tasks at STATION B-1. - To determine urine osmolarity, two different methods will be used at this station. First determining urine specific gravity using a hydrometer and second using a refractometer. - Ask one member of your group to empty their urinary bladder into the container provided, taking a mid-stream sample for analysis. To obtain a midstream sample, proceed in urinating into a urinal or toilet bowl until you feel that your bladder is about half full and then stop urinating. Then provide approximately 50 ml of urine for urinalysis by continuing to urinate into a flask or beaker provided. Record the time when the urine sample was obtained (table provided in exercise B2). Pour the urine into the measuring cylinder. - For method 1 (Station B-1a): from the mid-stream urine sample provided for your classmate (student) and the simulated samples from persons 1-3 (person 3 is Case A in the appendix to this practical) at this station, determine the urine specific gravity. - Float the hydrometer supplied in the urine, spinning the hydrometer gently to make sure it is freely floating. - Determine the urine specific gravity from the bottom of the meniscus. - Using the graph provided, estimate the urine osmolarity using the urine specific gravity value that you have obtained. Write down your results in the table below. - For method 2 (Station B-1b): once you have obtained the urine osmolarity from your classmate, using the hydrometer, now use the handheld refractometer to also obtain the urine osmolarity. - Clean and calibrate the refractometer using the instructions at station B-1b. - Place two drops of urine onto the cover plate. - Close the cover plate and direct to the light. - Record the urine specific gravity value visible in the last column. - Compare the values obtained from the different techniques. Student urine osmolarity as per Refractometer measure………………. Read the value at the line 10 - Using the data provided on plasma concentrations at the station for persons 1-3 or in Case A in the appendix for this practical, calculate plasma osmolarity for these people. Student Person 1 Person 2 Person 3 Normal Urine specific gravity (g/ml) 1.005 – 1.030 Urine osmolarity (mmol/l) 50 – 1200 Plasma osmolarity (mOsmol/l) - 275 307 ~295 11 Questions 1) Give a physiological explanation for the plasma and urine osmolarity in person 3 (Case A in the appendix). When calculating plasma osmolarity assume that her plasma glucose concentration is 5.2 mmol/l. STATION B-2 Creatinine clearance, plasma urea and creatinine concentrations, and urea-to-creatinine ratios. As indicated in the aforementioned discussion, renal disease produces deleterious effects on the body when glomerular filtration rate reaches ~10 ml/min or less. Under these circumstances, the concentrations of metabolites in the plasma such as creatinine and urea quickly increase to very high levels. To identify the presence of renal failure, plasma urea and creatinine concentrations are measured. From the measurement of these substances, additional information regarding kidney function can also be determined As creatinine clearance is an estimate of glomerular filtration rate, the measurement of creatinine in the urine and plasma, together with a measurement of urine volume, which allows for the calculation of creatinine clearance, will also provide an estimation of the severity of the renal disease. In addition, a crude estimate of creatinine clearance can be obtained from just a plasma creatinine concentration and body weight. This concept will nevertheless be dealt with in later years of your studies. As you would have deduced from STATION A-1, urea is a substance that is filtered and reabsorbed, and creatinine is a substance that is filtered, and a small proportion is secreted. In renal failure, plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine increase because of a reduced glomerular filtration rate. However, the extent to which these substances increase their concentrations depends very much on the cause of the reduction in glomerular filtration rate. This is because urea and creatinine are handled in a different way by the renal tubules. The reabsorption of urea is mainly in the proximal tubules and is tightly linked to fluid reabsorption. Thus, when proximal tubular fluid reabsorption increases, such as in shock (hypovolaemic, cardiogenic or vasogenic), so does urea reabsorption. Consequently, when glomerular filtration rate decreases because of shock, where a simultaneous increase in proximal tubular fluid reabsorption occurs, plasma urea concentrations will increase not only because of a reduced filtration, but also because of an increased reabsorption. Therefore, in shock, plasma urea concentrations increase more rapidly than plasma creatinine concentrations 12 and an increased ratio of plasma urea-to-creatinine may be used to identify the presence of renal failure caused by shock or a reduced renal perfusion. This is called PRE-RENAL FAILURE. In contrast, if a reduced glomerular filtration rate follows damage to nephrons, including the tubules, the increase in plasma urea is no greater than the increase in plasma creatinine concentrations. Indeed, because creatinine is secreted by the kidney tubules, if renal tubular damage occurs, plasma creatinine concentrations may even increase more than plasma urea concentrations. Consequently, this results in a normal or reduced plasma urea-to-creatinine ratio if the tubular secretion of creatinine is reduced. This is called INTRA-RENAL FAILURE. The following exercise underscores the usefulness of measuring plasma urea and creatinine concentrations. To appreciate the value of measurements of plasma (and urine) urea and creatinine concentrations, you should perform the following tasks at STATION B-2. - In station B-1, one member of your team voided their bladder. Capture the time the bladder was emptied in the table provided. After 30 minutes, ask the person to void their bladder again. Collect ALL the urine voided. Record the time and the volume (on the second occasion) of urine collected in the table below. Determine the urine creatinine concentration. Instructions will be provided at the station. - From the date obtained from your classmate calculate the rate of urine formation. - Using the urine flow rate calculated, determine the amount of urine produced in 24 hours. Time when bladder is first emptied (activity B-1) Time when 2nd urine sample is collected Volume of urine collected @ 30 minutes (2nd sample) Urine creatinine concentration (mmol/l) Rate of urine formation Urine volume (L/24h) - From the urine volumes and urine and plasma creatinine concentrations obtained from your classmate and the additional data provided in cases A-C in the appendix, at STATION B-2, calculate the creatinine clearance and the urea-to-creatinine ratio in these persons. 13 Student Patient 1 (Case A) Patient 2 (Case B) Patient 3 (Case C) Plasma Urea (mmol/l) Creatinine (μmol/l) Urine Volume (l/24h) Creatinine (mmol/l) Creatinine clearance (ml/min) Urea:Creatinine Questions 1) Comparing the data obtained for persons 2-4 to the data obtained from your classmate, give a physiological explanation for a) the creatinine clearance values in persons 2-4 (Cases A-C in the appendix). b) the urea-to-creatinine ratios in persons 2-4 (Cases A-C in the appendix). STATION B-3 Urinalysis using dipsticks. From the aforementioned discussion it should be apparent that renal impairment only produces clinical abnormalities when glomerular filtration rate has decreased to very low levels. At this point, survival is very much dependent on dialysis programmes and eventually renal transplantation. It should be obvious to any discerning health care professional that it is inappropriate to wait for patients to reach this stage in the development of renal disease. In fact, the point should always be to detect patients who are at risk of developing renal impairment or have early renal impairment and institute programmes that prevent the development of such 14 severe renal impairment. How then do we detect early renal impairment or identify patients at risk of renal impairment? Knowledge of the risk factors for the development of renal failure is obviously important. In this regard, two major risk factors for renal failure are hypertension and diabetes mellitus. You have already encountered some physiological concepts regarding these disease entities in previous topics. The diagnosis of hypertension is made from brachial artery blood pressure measurements, something that you have already learned to perform (see Cardiovascular Practical). The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is made using blood tests (fasting blood glucose measurements). However, to screen for diabetes mellitus, simple urine dipstick tests can be performed to detect the presence of glucose in the urine. As indicated in Station A- 1, glucose is filtered at the glomerulus at a concentration where 100% of it is reabsorbed again. However, if blood glucose concentrations increase to high enough values (~10 mmol/l), these values exceed the capacity of the tubules to reabsorb all of the glucose. This is called the tubular threshold for glucose. Some glucose is then excreted, and a simple urine dipstick can detect this glucose. When renal damage occurs, protein may appear in the urine (proteinuria) and this can also be detected using a simple urine dipstick. The appearance of protein in the urine in renal disease is thought to occur mainly because of the abnormal filtration of proteins such as albumin through damaged glomeruli. Filtration of these proteins does not usually occur, as they carry a charge that is repelled by the glomerular membrane, or because of their large size. More recently, proteinuria (protein in the urine) has been attributed to an inability of damaged tubules to reabsorb normally filtered proteins. Irrespective of the mechanism of the proteinuria, the presence of protein (or albumin) in the urine suggests that the patients may have renal damage which should be further investigated. Additional causes of renal damage that may be screened for with a urine dipstick include the presence of infections of the kidney (e.g. a glomerulonephritis or pyelonephritis), infections anywhere along the renal tract such as in the bladder (e.g. in bilharzia or a cystitis), or the presence of renal stones (urolithiasis). In these circumstances, damage to the renal tract will occur and epithelial cells may die and release protein into the urine. In addition to this, damage to the renal tract may cause red blood cells to leak into the urine and in infections of the renal tract, leucocytes will also appear in the urine. Hence, with infections, proteinuria, haematuria and leucocytes in the urine may be detected with a urine dipstick, whereas in urolithiasis, proteinuria and haematuria will be noted on a urine dipstick. 15 The following practical will underscore the importance of a urine dipstick test in screening patients for potential renal pathology or pathology, such as diabetes mellitus, which increases the risk for renal failure. To screen your own urine, and urine collected from individuals with abnormal urine, for potential renal pathology or risk factors for renal pathology at STATION B-3 you should complete the following task: - Ask one of the members of your group to provide a urine sample. Proceed in urinating into a urinal or toilet bowl until you feel that your bladder is about half full and then stop urinating. - Then provide approximately 20-50 ml of urine for urinalysis by continuing to urinate into a flask or beaker provided. - Consult instructions on the container from which the reagent strips are derived. - Dip the reagent strip provided into the ‘mid-stream’ urine sample, tap the strip to remove the excess urine and then read the strip against the colour-coded reference card according to the instructions. - Record the result of your own urinalysis below. Based on the urine dipstick result, complete the table below by marking + or – for each variable. - Repeat the experiment on each of the additional samples provided. - Importantly, the various components of the strip should be read in a fixed order, which is not the order in which they are arranged: i 30 seconds - bilirubin ii. 30 seconds - glucose iii. 40 seconds - ketones iv. 45 seconds - specific gravity v. 60 seconds - blood, nitrites, urobilinogen, protein, pH vi. 120 seconds - leukocytes 16 Student Patient 1 Patient 2 Patient 3 Patient 4 Leukocytes Nitrites Urobilinogen Protein pH Blood SG Ketones Bilirubin Glucose Questions 1) Give physiological explanations for the results of the urinalysis obtained from the dipstick test for patients 1 - 4. 2) Giving a physiological explanation for your answer, if a patient was noted to have a blood glucose concentration of 14 mmol/l, indicate whether glucose would be detected in the urine. 17 APPENDIX CASES PROVIDED FOR EACH PRACTICAL PRACTICAL 7: The Kidney Case A A 12-year-old girl was admitted to hospital.
