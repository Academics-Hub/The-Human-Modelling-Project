However, a quantitative representationof the concomitant effects of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia on glucose clearance, necessary to describe heterogeneous testssuch as euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps and oral tests, is lacking. Data from five studies (123 subjects) using a glucose tracerand including all the above tests in normal and diabetic subjects were collected. A mathematical model was developed in whichglucose utilization was represented as a Michaelis-Menten function of glucose with constant Km and insulin-controlled Vmax,consistently with the basic notions of glucose transport. Individual values for the model parameters were estimated using apopulation approach. Tracer data were accurately fitted in all tests. The estimated Km was 3.88 (2.83–5.32) mmol/l [median(interquartile range)]. Median model-derived glucose clearance at 600 pmol/l insulin was reduced from 246 to 158 ml·min−1·m−2when glucose was raised from 5 to 10 mmol/l. The model reproduced the characteristic lack of increase in glucose clearance whenmoderate hyperinsulinemia was accompanied by hyperglycemia. In all tests, insulin sensitivity was inversely correlated with BMI, asexpected (R2 = 0.234, P = 0.0001). In conclusion, glucose clearance in euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps and oral tests can bedescribed with a unifying model, consistent with the notions of glucose transport and able to reproduce the suppression of glucoseclearance due to hyperglycemia observed in previous studies. The model may be important for the design of reliable glucosehomeostasis simulators.2. The relationship between glucose uptake saturation and glucose kinetics is nonlinear.3. Higher glucose uptake saturation is associated with normal glucose tolerance, while lower saturation is linked to impaired fastingglucose or diabetes.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
