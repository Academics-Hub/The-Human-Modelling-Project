Recommended daily intake of carbohydrate: • Dietary guidelines USDA/NHS - 200-300 g, 45-65% of energy • Less processed starchy foods are recommended – eg.whole grains, legumes and root vegetables, • Eat less refined starches and sugars • Brain - 130 g/day Nutritional aspects of carbohydrate Dietary fibre Dietary fibre is indigestible carbohydrate e.g. cellulose. • Increases intestinal flora = the microbiome. • Adds bulk to faeces, retains water in the GIT, speeds intestinal transit – eases passage of faeces. • May prevent diverticulitis and hemorrhoids. • Slows digestion and absorption – slower blood glucose change in diabetes, lower cholesterol. Dietary sources of fibre: • Vegetables (green), cabbage, broccoli, lettuce, mushrooms, peppers, beans, legumes, nuts, seeds • Whole grains – brown bread, brown rice, samp, etc., bran What are Carbohydrates Biological molecules with the general formula Cm(H2O)n = polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones Three chemical classes of carbohydrates 1. Monosaccharides Vary from 3 (triose) to 9 (nonose) carbons Hexoses (6-carbon sugars) Used as fuel and for synthesis of metabolic intermediates • Glucose (sweets) • Fructose (from fruit) • Galactose (derived from milk) Glucose 1 Monosaccharides - Hexose sugars cont’d most oxidised carbon Fructose Galactose 1 Monosaccharides - Pentoses (5-carbon sugars) Most common are ribose and deoxyribose Components of nucleic acids and ATP, GTP etc. Synthesised in body. Dexoyribose found in DNA Ribose found in RNA 2. Disaccharides Each contain 2 monosaccharide subunits •Sucrose (table sugar) •Maltose (breakdown product of starch and glycogen) •Lactose (milk sugar) 1 = Glycogen 2 = Nucleus 3. Dietary polysaccharides (glucose polymers) • Glucose storage polysaccharides – Glycogen in animals Starch in plants Hepatocytes • Plant structural polysaccharides Cellulose General structure of starch and glycogen 1 6 1 4 α α1-4 glycosidic bonds make chains α1-6 glycosidic bonds create branches Starch can be amylose (α1-4 bonds only) or amylopectin (with α1-6 bonds). Glycogen has more α1-6 bonds than amylopectin. 1-6 (branches) and 1-4 (chains) glycosidic bonds can be enzymatically digested by humans. Glycogen and starch are digestible. General structure of cellulose β1-4 glycosidic bonds 1-4 bonds cannot be digested by humans  Cellulose is indigestible (dietary fibre) Digestion of starch and glycogen Enzyme α–amylase (produced by salivary glands and pancreas) cleaves large starch molecules into a) dextrins and maltoligosaccharides b) trisaccharide maltotriose c) disaccharide maltose d) glucose will then be generated from maltose via the action of disaccharide enzymes, such as maltase. a) c)b) d) Digestion and absorption of mono-/disaccharides and α-limit dextrins. Glucose carrier = Sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT) Digestion and absorption of carbohydrates cont.... Monosaccharides are transported in blood stream via the portal vein circulation Taken up into cells. • Used immediately for energy GLYCOLYSIS or • Stored as glycogen in muscles and liver GLYCOGENESIS or • Converted into fatty acids (liver) and stored (adipose tissue) Absorption of carbohydratesAbnormalities of carbohydrate intake, digestion and absorption. Lactose intolerance Caused by a deficiency of lactase (digests lactose) Consequences: Lactose is not digested Bacteria digest lactose in colon Water drawn into GIT (distension of gut and flatulence) (diarrhoea) Remedy: • Avoid dairy products or use lactose-free dairy products • Yoghurt is tolerated better than unfermented dairy products Excess carbohydrate intake Excess carbohydrate is stored as fat and fat accumulation leads to obesity. Common measurements used to assess adiposity: body mass index (BMI) skin fold thicknesses and waist:hip ratio. Obesity is a risk factor for the development of: Hypertension, stroke, cancer, type-2 diabetes mellitus etc Abnormalities cont’dSummary of carbohydrate digestion and absorption • Carbohydrates may be monosaccharides, disaccharides or polysaccharides. • Digestible polysaccharides, starches and glycogen, consist of glucose joined by α1-4 and α1-6 glycosidic bonds, whereas cellulose contains indigestible β1- 4 glycosidic bonds. • Polysaccharides are digested by amylase in the intestinal lumen. • Enzymes located on the enterocyte cell membranes digest short polysaccharides and disaccharides. • Monosaccharides are transported into the blood by cellular carrier proteins and glucose is co-transported with Na+ ions. • Monosaccharides taken up from the blood may be used for cellular energy production (glycolysis), stored as glycogen or converted to fatty acids. • Lactose intolerance occurs in people who lack the enzyme, lactase, which digests the milk disaccharide, lactose, into glucose and galactose. • Excess carbohydrate intake results in excess storage of fats which results in obesity.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
