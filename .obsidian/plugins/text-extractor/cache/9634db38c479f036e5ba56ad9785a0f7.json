The diaphragm develops from four embryonic components:  Septum transversum  Pleuroperitoneal membranes  Dorsal mesentery of esophagus  Muscular ingrowth from lateral body walls The development of the diaphragmThe development of the diaphragmThe development of the diaphragm The innervation and descent of the diaphragm The development of the diaphragmThe development of the diaphragm Phrenic nerve- approximately 30 cm in the adult Phrenic nerve Note: The following slides contain notes on the development of the diaphragm and mesenteries. The section on mesenteries is not narrated because it is descriptive and should be easy to follow. Septum transversum Septum transversum is forms at the end of the third week as a mass of mesodermal tissue cranial to the pericardial cavity. After the head folds ventrally during the fourth week, septum transversum forms a thick incomplete partition between the pericardial and abdominal cavities.  The septum transversum does not separate the thoracic and abdominal cavities completely.  There are large openings, the pericardioperitoneal canals, along the sides of the esophagus  The septum transversum expands and fuses with the dorsal mesentery of the esophagus and the pleuroperitoneal membranes Pleuroperitoneal membranes  These membranes appear in the lateral walls of the pericardioperitoneal canals as pleuroperitoneals folds.  As the pleuroperitoneal folds enlarge they become pleuroperitoneal membranes.  These membranes fuse with the dorsal mesentery of the esophagus and the septum transversum.  This completes the partition between the thoracic and abdominal cavities and forms the primordial diaphragm. Dorsal Mesentery of the Esophagus  Septum transversum and pleuroperitoneal membranes fuse with the dorsal mesentery of the esophagus.  This mesentery forms the median portion of the diaphragm.  The crura of the diaphragm develops from myoblasts that grow into the dorsal mesentery of the esophagus. Muscular ingrowth from lateral body walls Between weeks 9 and 12, the lungs and pleural cavities enlarge as they extend into the lateral body walls.  During this process, the body-wall tissue is split into two layers:  An external layer that becomes part of the definitive abdominal wall  An internal layer that contributes to peripheral parts of the diaphragm, external to the parts derived from the pleuroperitoneal membranes. • Further extension of the developing pleural cavities into the lateral body walls forms the right and left costodiaphragmatic recesses. • This establishes the characteristic dome- shaped configuration of the diaphragm. Mesenteries  Specific parts of the gut tube and their derivatives are suspended from the dorsal and ventral body wall by mesenteries.  Mesenteries are double layers of peritoneum that enclose an organ and connect it to the body wall.  Such organs are called intraperitoneal, whereas organs that lie against the posterior body wall and are covered by peritoneum on their anterior surface such as kidneys only are called retroperitoneal.  Peritoneal ligaments are double layers of peritoneum (mesenteries) that pass from one organ to another or from an organ to the body wall.  Mesenteries and ligaments provide pathways for vessels, nerves, and lymphatics to and from abdominal viscera  At first, the foregut, midgut, and hindgut are in contact with the mesenchyme of the posterior abdominal wall.  By the ﬁfth week of development connecting mesenchyme has narrowed.  The caudal part of the foregut, the midgut, and a major part of the hindgut are suspended from the abdominal wall by the dorsal mesentery.  This mesentery extends from the lower end of the esophagus to the cloacal region of the hindgut.  In the region of the stomach this mesenchyme forms the dorsal mesogastrium which will become the greater omentum.  In the region of the duodenum the mesenchyme forms the dorsal mesoduodenum  In the region of the colon, it forms the dorsal  mesocolon.  Dorsal mesentery of the jejunal and ileal loops forms the mesentery proper.  Ventral mesentery, which exists only in the region of the terminal part of the esophagus, the stomach, and the upper part of the duodenum is derived from the septum transversum.
