The actual position is given by: a) If r(t) is a unit step input, find the output y(t). b) What is the final steady state value of y(t)? Example 2 The block diagram of a control system is given in the figure below: a) Determine the transfer function T1(s) = Y(s)/R(s) b) Determine the transfer function T2(s) = Y(s)/D(s) 𝐾 𝑏 𝑠 + 1 Y(s)R(s) + - D(s) + - Example 3 Consider the closed loop system shown in the figure below: a) Determine the steady state transfer function T(s) = Y(s)/R(s) b) Define the tracking error to be E(s) = Y(s) – R(s).
