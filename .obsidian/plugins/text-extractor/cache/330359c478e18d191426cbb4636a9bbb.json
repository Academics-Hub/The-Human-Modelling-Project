During active fluid transport, salt is pumped from the cytoplasm into the intercellular space, and water follows the salt. Both salt and water then diffuse into the cell from the lumen. As this process continues, the intercellular space becomes greatly distended (arrows). Fluid moves from the engorged intercellular space (arrows) across the basal lamina into the underlying connective tissue (CT) and then into blood vessels.

Cells that appear identical to enteroen- docrine cells of the intestine are also found in these glands. The wall of the gallbladder lacks a muscularis mucosae and submucosa. External to the lamina propria is a muscularis externa that has numerous collagen and elastic fibers among the bundles of smooth muscle cells. Despite its origin from a foregut- derived tube, the gallbladder does not have a muscularis mucosae or submucosa. The smooth muscle bundles are somewhat randomly oriented, unlike the layered organization of the intestine. Contraction of the smooth muscle reduces the volume of the bladder, forcing its contents out through the cystic duct. External to the muscularis externa is a thick layer of dense connective tissue (see Fig. 18.16). This layer contains large blood vessels, an extensive lymphatic network, and the auto- nomic nerves that innervate the muscularis externa and the blood vessels (cell bodies of parasympathetic neurons are found in the wall of the cystic duct). The connective tissue is also rich in elastic fibers and adipose tissue. The layer of tissue where the gallbladder attaches to the liver surface is referred to as the adventitia. The unattached surface is covered by a serosa or visceral peritoneum consisting of a layer of mesothelium and a thin layer of loose connective tissue. In addition, deep diverticula of the mucosa, called Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, sometimes extend through the muscularis externa (Fig. 18.18 and Plate 67, page 660). They are thought to presage pathologic changes and develop as the result of hyperplasia (excessive growth of cells) and herniation of epithelial cells through the muscu- laris externa. Also, bacteria may accumulate in these sinuses, causing chronic inﬂammation that is a risk factor for the formation of gallstones. Concentration of the bile requires the coupled transport of salt and water. The epithelial cells of the gallbladder actively transport both Na\u0004, Cl\u0005 and HCO3\u0005 from the cytoplasm into the intercellular compartment of the epithelium. ATPase is lo- cated in the lateral plasma membranes of the epithelial cells. This active transport mechanism is essentially identi- cal to that described in Chapter 17 for the enterocytes of the small intestine and the absorptive cells of the colon. The epithelial cells of the gallbladder also express two types of aquaporins water channels (AQP1 and AQP8), integral membrane channel proteins that facilitate rapid passive movement of water (see Chapter 20, Folder 20.XX). The presence of water channels on apical and ba- solateral plasma membranes of the gallbladder epithelial cells suggests that they may be involved in both water ab- sorption and secretion. Active transport of Na\u0002, Cl\u0003, and HCO3\u0003 across the lateral plasma membrane into the intercellular (paracellu- lar) compartment causes the concentration of electrolytes in the intercellular space to increase. The increased elec- trolyte concentration creates an osmotic gradient between the intercellular space and the cytoplasm and between the intercellular space and the lumen. Water moves from the cytoplasm and from the lumen into the intercellular space because of the osmotic gradient (i.e., it moves down its concentration gradient; see Fig. 18.17b). Although the in- tercellular space can distend to a degree often visible with the light microscope, this ability is limited. The movement of electrolytes and water into the space creates hydrostatic pressure that forces a nearly isotonic fluid out of the inter- cellular compartment into the subepithelial connective tis- sue (the lamina propria). The fluid that enters the lamina propria quickly passes into the numerous fenestrated capil- laries and the venules that closely underlie the epithelium. Studies of fluid transport in the gallbladder first demon- strated the essential role of the intercellular compartment in transepithelial transport of an isotonic fluid from the lumen to the vasculature. Therefore, the final modification of bile is mainly the result of the active transport of Na\u0002, Cl\u0003, and HCO3\u0003, and the passive, aquaporin-mediated transport of water across the plasma membrane of epithe- lial cells of the gallbladder. 646 FIGURE 18.18 • Photomicrograph of the Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses in the wall of the gallbladder.

The head is an expanded portion that lies in the C-shaped curve of the duodenum (Fig. 18.19). It is joined to the duodenum by connective tissue. The centrally located body of the pancreas crosses the midline of the human body, and the tail extends toward the hilum of the spleen. The pancreatic duct (of Wirsung) extends through the length of the gland and empties into the duodenum at the hepatopan- creatic ampulla (of Vater), through which the common bile duct from the liver and gallbladder also enters the duodenum. The hepatopancreatic sphincter (of Oddi) surrounds the ampulla and not only regulates the flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum but also prevents reflux of intestinal contents into the pancreatic duct. In some individuals, an ac- cessory pancreatic duct (of Santorini) is present, a vestige of the pancreas’s origin from two embryonic endodermal pri- mordia that evaginate from the foregut. A thin layer of loose connective tissue forms a capsule around the gland. From this capsule, septa extend into the gland, dividing it into ill-defined lobules. Within the lob- ules, a stroma of loose connective tissue surrounds the parenchymal units. Between the lobules, larger amounts of connective tissue surround the larger ducts, blood vessels, and nerves. Moreover, in the connective tissue surrounding the pancreatic duct, there are small mucous glands that empty into the duct. The pancreas is an exocrine and endocrine gland. Unlike the liver, in which the exocrine and secretory (endocrine) functions reside in the same cell, the dual func- tions of the pancreas are relegated to two structurally distinct components. • The exocrine component synthesizes and secretes en- zymes into the duodenum that are essential for digestion in the intestine. • The endocrine component synthesizes and secretes the hormones insulin and glucagon into the blood. These hormones regulate glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism in the body. The exocrine pancreas is found throughout the organ; within the exocrine pancreas, distinct cell masses called islets of Langerhans are dispersed and constitute the endocrine pancreas. Exocrine Pancreas The exocrine pancreas is a serous gland. The exocrine pancreas closely resembles the parotid gland, with which it can be confused. The secretory units are acinar or tubuloacinar in shape and are formed by a simple epithe- lium of pyramidal serous cells (Fig. 18.20a and Plate 68, page 662). The cells have a narrow free (luminal) surface and a broad basal surface. Periacinar connective tissue is minimal. The serous secretory cells of the acinus produce the diges- tive enzyme precursors secreted by the pancreas. Pancreatic acini are unique among glandular acini; the initial duct that leads from the acinus, the intercalated duct, actually begins within the acinus (Fig. 18.20b; Fig. 18.21). The duct cells lo- cated inside the acinus are referred to as centroacinar cells. The acinar cells are characterized by distinct basophilia in the basal cytoplasm and by acidophilic zymogen granules in the apical cytoplasm (see Figs. 18.20a and 18.21). Zymo- gen granules are most numerous in the pancreas of fasting individuals. The squamous centroacinar cells lack both ergastoplasm and secretory granules (see Fig. 18.21); thus, they stain very lightly with eosin. This weak staining helps identify them in routine histologic sections. Zymogen granules contain a variety of digestive enzymes in an inactive form. Pancreatic enzymes can digest most food substances. The inactive enzymes, or proenzymes, contained in pancreatic zymogen granules are listed here along with the specific sub- stances they digest when activated. • Proteolytic endopeptidases (trypsinogen, chy- motrypsin-ogen) and proteolytic exopeptidases (pro- carboxypeptidase, proaminopeptidase) digest proteins by cleaving their internal peptide bonds (endopeptidases) or by cleaving amino acids from the carboxyl or amino end of the peptide. cystic duct common hepatic duct common bile duct main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung) duodenum accessory pancreatic duct (of Santorini) pancreas gallbladder major duodenal papilla minor duodenal papilla hepatopancreatic ampulla (of Vater) FIGURE 18.19 • Diagram of pancreas, duodenum, and asso- ciated excretory ducts. The main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung) traverses the length of the pancreas and enters the duodenum after joining with the common bile duct. An accessory pancreatic duct (of Santorini) is commonly present, as shown, and empties into the duodenum at a separate minor duodenal papilla. The site of entry of the common bile duct and main pancreatic duct into the duodenum is typically marked by a major duodenal papilla visible on the inner surface of the duodenum. 72006_ch18 15/07/10 3:44 PM Page 647 648 blood vessel centroacinar cells intercalated duct acinar cells acinar cells centroacinar cell zymogen granules intercalated duct intralobular collecting duct capillary b blood vessel centroacinar cells intercalated duct acinar cells aa FIGURE 18.20 • Pancreatic acinus and its duct system. a. In this photomicrograph of a thin, H&E–stained plastic section, an intercalated duct can be seen beginning within a pancreatic acinus. The cells forming the duct within the acinus are the centroacinar cells. The eosinophilic zymogen granules are clearly seen in the apical cytoplasm of the parenchymal cells. \u0004860. b. In this schematic diagram, observe the beginning of the intercalated duct. Note the location and shapes of the centroacinar cells within the acinus. They represent the initial lining of the intercalated duct, which drains into an intralobular collecting duct. • Amylolytic enzymes (\u0005-amylase) digest carbohydrates by cleaving the glycosidic linkages of glucose polymers. • Lipases digest lipids by cleaving ester bonds of triglyc- erides, producing free fatty acids. • Nucleolytic enzymes (deoxyribonuclease and ribonucle- ase) digest nucleic acids, producing mononucleotides. The pancreatic digestive enzymes are activated only after they reach the lumen of the small intestine. Initially, the proteolytic activity of enzymes enterokinases in the glyco- calyx of the microvilli of the intestinal absorptive cells con- verts trypsinogen to trypsin, a potent proteolytic enzyme. Trypsin then catalyzes the conversion of the other inactive en- zymes as well as the digestion of proteins in the chyme. The cytoplasmic basophilia of the pancreatic acinar cells when observed with the TEM appears as an extensive array of rER and free ribosomes. The presence of these numerous organelles correlates with the high level of protein synthetic activity of the acinar cells (Fig. 18.22). A well-developed Golgi apparatus is present in the apical cytoplasm and is in- volved in concentration and packaging of the secretory products. Mitochondria are small and, although found throughout the cell, are concentrated among the rER cister- nae. Acinar cells are joined to one another by junctional complexes at their apical poles, thus forming an isolated lumen into which small microvilli extend from the apical sur- faces of the acinar cells and into which the zymogen granules are released by exocytosis. 72006_ch18 15/07/10 3:44 PM Page 648chapter 18Digestive System III: Liver, Gallbladder, and Pancreas\u0003PANCREAS 649 649 Duct System of the Exocrine Pancreas The centroacinar cells (see Figs. 18.20a and 18.21) are the beginning of the duct system of the exocrine pancreas. They have a centrally placed, flattened nucleus and attenuated cytoplasm, which is typical of a squamous cell. Centroacinar cells are intercalated duct cells located in the acinus. Centroacinar cells are continuous with the cells of the short intercalated duct that lies outside the acinus. The structural unit of the acinus and centroacinar cells resembles a small balloon (the acinus) into which a drinking straw (the interca- lated duct) has been pushed. The intercalated ducts are short and drain into intralobular collecting ducts. There are no striated (secretory) ducts in the pancreas. The complex, branching network of intralobular ducts drains into the larger interlobular ducts, which are lined with a low columnar epithelium in which enteroendocrine cells and occasional goblet cells may be found. The inter- lobular ducts, in turn, drain directly into the main pancre- atic duct, which runs the length of the gland parallel to its long axis, giving this portion of the duct system a herringbone-like appearance (see Fig. 18.19). A second large duct, the accessory pancreatic duct, arises in the head of the pancreas. The intercalated ducts add bicarbonate and water to the exocrine secretion. The pancreas secretes about 1 L of fluid per day, about equal to the initial volume of the hepatic bile secretion. Whereas bile is concentrated in the gallbladder, the entire volume of the pancreatic secretion is delivered to the duodenum. Al- though the acini secrete a small volume of protein-rich fluid, the intercalated duct cells secrete a large volume of fluid rich in sodium and bicarbonate. The bicarbonate serves to neutralize the acidity of the chyme that enters the duodenum from the stomach and to establish the optimal pH for the activity of the major pancreatic enzymes. Pancreatic exocrine secretion is under hormonal and neural control. Two hormones secreted by the enteroendocrine cells of the duo- denum, secretin and cholecystokinin (CCK), are the princi- pal regulators of the exocrine pancreas (see Tables 17.1 page 583). The entry of the acidic chyme into the duodenum stimu- lates the release of these hormones into the blood: • Secretin is a polypeptide hormone (27 amino acid residues) that stimulates the duct cells to secrete a large vol- ume of fluid with a high HCO3\u0003 concentration but little or no enzyme content. • CCK is a polypeptide hormone (33 amino acid residues) that causes the acinar cells to secrete their proenzymes. The coordinated action of the two hormones results in the secretion of a large volume of enzyme-rich, alkaline fluid into the duodenum. In addition to hormonal influences, the pancreas also receives autonomic innervation. Sympathetic nerve fibers are involved in regulation of pancreatic blood flow. Parasympathetic fibers stimulate activity of acinar as well as centroacinar cells. Cell bodies of neurons occasionally seen in the pancreas belong to parasympathetic postgan- glionic neurons. Endocrine Pancreas The endocrine pancreas is a diffuse organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood glucose levels. The islets of Langerhans, the endocrine component of the pancreas, are scattered throughout the organ in cell group- ings of varying size (Fig. 18.23). It is estimated that 1 million to 3 million islets constitute about 1% to 2% of the volume of the pancreas but are most numerous in the tail. Individual islets may contain only a few cells or many hundreds of cells (Plate 68, page 662). Their polygonal cells are arranged in short, intercalated duct capillary acinar cells centroacinar cells intercalated duct capillary acinar cells centroacinar cells intercalated duct capillary acinar cells centroacinar cells FIGURE 18.21 • Electron micrograph of the pancreatic aci- nus and intercalated duct.

The definitive endocrine cells of the islets develop between 9 and 12 weeks of gestation. In H&E–stained sections, the islets of Langerhans ap- pear as clusters of pale-staining cells surrounded by more intensely staining pancreatic acini. It is not practical to at- tempt to identify the several cell types found in the islets in routinely prepared specimens (Fig. 18.24). After Zenker- formol fixation and staining by the Mallory-Azan method, however, it is possible to identify three principal cell types designated A (alpha), B (beta), and D (delta) cells (Table 18.2 and Fig. 18.25). With this method, the A cells stain red, the B cells stain brownish orange, and the D cells stain blue. About 5% of the cells appear to be 72006_ch18 15/07/10 3:44 PM Page 650chapter 18Digestive System III: Liver, Gallbladder, and Pancreas\u0003PANCREAS 651 651 unstained after this procedure. TEM allows identification of the principal cell types by the size and density of their secretory granules. Islet cells, other than B cells, are counterparts of the enteroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa. In addition to the three principal islet cells, three minor islet cell types have also been identified by using a combination of the TEM and immunocytochemistry (Table 18.3). Each cell type can be correlated with a specific hormone, and each has a specific location in the islet. B cells constitute about 70% of the total islet cells in hu- mans and are generally located in its central portion. They se- crete insulin (see Table 18.2). B cells contain numerous secretory granules about 300 nm in diameter with a dense polyhedral core and a pale matrix. The polyhedral core is be- lieved to be crystallized insulin. A cells constitute about 15% to 20% of the human islet pop- ulation and are generally located peripherally in the islets. They secrete glucagon (see Table 18.2). A cells contain secretory granules about 250 nm in diameter that are more uniform in size and more densely packed in the cytoplasm than the granules of B cells. The granule is the site of stored glucagon (Fig. 18.26). D cells constitute about 5% to 10% of the total pancre- atic endocrine tissue and are also located peripherally in the islets. D cells secrete somatostatin, which is contained in secretory granules that are larger than those of the A and B cells (300 to 350 nm) and contain material of low to medium electron density (see Fig. 18.26). The minor islet cells constitute about 5% of the islet tissue and may be equivalent to the pale cells seen after Mallory- Azan staining. Their characteristics and functions are summa- rized in Table 18.3. Evidence suggests that some cells may secrete more than one hormone. Immunocytochemical staining has localized several hormones in addition to glucagon in the A-cell cytoplasm. These include gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), CCK, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)- endorphin. Although there is no clear morphologic evidence for the presence of G cells (gastrin cells) in the islets, gas- trin may also be secreted by one or more of the islet cells. Certain pancreatic islet cell tumors secrete large amounts of gastrin, thereby producing excessive acid secretion in the stomach (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). Functions of Pancreatic Hormones All of the hormones secreted by the endocrine pancreas regu- late metabolic functions either systemically, regionally (in the gastrointestinal tract), or locally (in the islet itself ). Insulin, the major hormone secreted by the islet tissue, decreases blood glucose levels. Insulin is the most abundant endocrine secretion. Its princi- pal effects are on the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Insulin has multiple individual actions in each of these tis- sues. In general, insulin stimulates • uptake of glucose from the circulation. Specific cell mem- brane glucose transporters are involved in this process. • storage of glucose by activation of glycogen synthase and subsequent glycogen synthesis. • phosphorylation and use of glucose by promoting its gly- colysis within cells. Absence or inadequate amounts of insulin lead to ele- vated blood glucose levels and the presence of glucose in the urine, a condition known as diabetes mellitus. Reduced expression of insulin and insulin growth factors in the central nervous system (CNS) has recently been linked to Alzheimer’s disease (Folder 18.3). In addition to its effects on glucose metabolism, insulin stimulates glycerol synthesis and inhibits lipase activity in adi- pose cells. Circulating insulin also increases the amount of amino acids taken up by cells (which may involve cotransport with glucose) and inhibits protein catabolism. Glucagon, secreted in amounts second only to insulin, increases blood glucose levels. FIGURE 18.23 • Photomicrograph of the pancreas. This H&E–stained specimen shows a number of pancreatic lobules separated by connective tissue septa that are continuous with the thin surrounding capsule of the gland. The pancreatic lobules consist largely of the exocrine acini and their intralobular duct system. Most of the lobules exhibit small, round, lighter-staining profiles, which are the islets of Langerhans (arrows). Adjacent to the lobules, at the lower left, is a large interlobular duct that serves the exocrine pancreas. \u000425. 72006_ch18 15/07/10 3:44 PM Page 651 652 ababababab A cellsA cellsA cellsA cellsA cells FIGURE 18.24 • Photomicrographs of islets of Langerhans. a. In this routine H&E preparation, it is difficult to identify specific islet cell types without special stains. At best, one can identify small cells (arrows) at the periphery of the islet that are probably A cells. \u0004360. b. This photo micrograph shows an islet of Langerhans stained with a special Grimelius silver stain that reacts with glucagon- secreting cells. The silver-impregnated A cells are arranged around the periphery of the islet. \u0004360. The actions of glucagon are essentially reciprocal to those of insulin. Glucagon stimulates release of glucose into the bloodstream and stimulates gluconeogenesis (synthesis of glucose from metabolites of amino acids) and glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen) in the liver. Glucagon also stimulates proteolysis to promote gluconeogenesis, mobilizes fats from adipose cells, and stimulates hepatic lipase. Somatostatin inhibits insulin and glucagon secretion. Somatostatin is secreted by the D cells of the islets. It is identical to the hormone secreted by the hypothalamus that TABLE Principal Cell Types in Pancreatic Islets18.2 Cell Type % Cytoplasmic Staining with Mallory-Azan Product Granules (TEM) A 15–20 Red Glucagon About 250 nm; dense, eccentric core surrounded by light substance B 60–70 Brownish orange Insulin About 300 nm; many with dense, crystalline (angular) core surrounded by light substance D 5–10 Blue Somatostatin About 325 nm; homogeneous matrix 72006_ch18 15/07/10 3:44 PM Page 652chapter 18Digestive System III: Liver, Gallbladder, and Pancreas\u0003PANCREAS 653 653 TABLE Minor Cell Types in Pancreatic Islets18.3 Cell Type Secretion Location (in Addition to Islet) Actions PP cell (F cell)a Pancreatic polypeptide Stimulates gastric chief cells, inhibits bile secretion and intestinal motility, inhibits pancreatic enzymes and HCO3 \u0003 secretion D 1 cell Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) Also in exocrine acini and duct epitheliumb Similar to those of glucagon (hyperglycemic and glycogenolytic); also affects secretory activity and motility in gut; stimulates pan- creatic exocrine secretion EC cell a Secretin, motilin, substance P Also in exocrine acini and duct epitheliumb Secretin: acts locally to stimulate HCO3\u0003 secretion in pancreatic juice and pancreatic enzyme secretion Motilin: increases gastric and intestinal motility Substance P: has neurotransmitter properties Epsilon cell Ghrelin Epithelium lining the fundus of the stomach c Stimulate appetite aPP, protein polypeptide; EC, enterochromaffin cell. bThis localization further emphasizes the ontogeny of the pancreas from the embryonic gut. cGhrelin is produced in the stomach by P/D1 cells.

Although the precise role of somatostatin in the islets is unclear, it has been shown to in- hibit both insulin and glucagon secretion. The molecular characteristics of the major and some minor islet hormones are summarized in Table 18.4. Regulation of Islet Activity A blood glucose level above the normal 70 mg/100 mL (70 mg/dL) stimulates release of insulin from beta cells, leading to uptake and storage of glucose by liver and mus- cle. The resultant decrease in the blood glucose level stops insulin secretion. Some amino acids also stimulate insulin secretion, either alone or in concert with elevated blood glucose levels. Increased blood fatty acid levels also stimu- late insulin release, as do circulating gastrin, CCK, and se- cretin. CCK and glucagon, released in the islet by the A cells, act as paracrine secretions to stimulate B cell secretion of insulin. Blood glucose levels below 70 mg/100 mL stimulate re- lease of glucagon; blood glucose levels significantly above 70 mg/100 mL inhibit glucagon secretion. Glucagon is also released in response to low levels of fatty acids in the blood. Insulin inhibits release of glucagon by A cells, but because of the cascading circulation in the islet (explained in a following paragraph), this inhibition is effected by a hormonal action of insulin carried in the general circulation. The islets have both sympathetic and parasympa- thetic innervation. About 10% of the islet cells have nerve endings directly on their plasma membrane. Well-developed gap junctions are located between islet cells. Ionic events triggered by synaptic transmitters at the nerve endings are carried from cell to cell across these junctions. Autonomic nerves may have direct effects on hormone secretion by A and B cells. Parasympathetic (cholinergic) stimulation increases secre- tion of both insulin and glucagon; sympathetic (adrenergic) stimulation increases glucagon release but inhibits insulin release. This neural control of insulin and glucagon may 72006_ch18 15/07/10 3:44 PM Page 653 contribute to the availability of circulating glucose in stress reactions. The blood supply to the pancreas provides a cascading perfusion of the islets and acini. Several arterioles enter the periphery of the islets and branch into fenestrated capillaries. In humans, the capillaries first perfuse the A and D cells, peripherally, before the blood reaches the B cells, centrally. Larger vessels that travel in septa that penetrate the central portion of the islet are also accom- panied by A and D cells, so that blood reaching the B cells has always first perfused the A and D cells. Large efferent capillaries leave the islet and branch into the capillary networks that surround the acini of the exocrine pancreas. This cascading flow resembles the portal systems of other endocrine glands (pituitary, adrenal). Secretions of the islet cells have regulatory effects on the acinar cells: • Insulin, the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and CCK stimulate exocrine secretion. • Glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and somatostatin inhibit exocrine secretion. 654 D cell A cell connective tissue Golgi D cell A cell connective tissue Golgi FIGURE 18.26 • Electron micrograph of pancreatic islet cells.

It is known that insulin resis- tance characteristic of diabetes mellitus is linked to neural degeneration, cognitive dysfunction, and dementia. The reduced rate of insulin and IGF production in the brain contributes to the degeneration of brain cells, an early symptom of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Postmortem ex- amination of the brain tissue from individuals diagnosed with AD confirmed that levels of insulin and IGFs were sig- nificantly reduced in the hippocampus (the part of the brain responsible for memory), frontal lobes, and hypothalamus. In contrast, in the cerebellum (which is generally not af- fected by AD), researchers noted normal levels of these hormones. Abnormalities in insulin production in the brain do not present symptoms typical to type 1 or type 2 dia- betes mellitus, but they may indicate that AD could be a manifestation of type 3 diabetes. If these new observations are confirmed in the future, it might be possible to develop a targeted treatment for AD that is not available today. • FOLDER 18.3 Insulin Production and Alzheimer’s Disease Insulin is produced within B cells in the pancreas. It is a small protein consisting of two polypeptide chains joined by disulfide bridges. Its biosynthesis presents a clear ex- ample of the importance of posttranslational processing in the achievement of the final, active structure of a protein. Insulin is originally synthesized as a single 110–amino acid polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of about 12,000 daltons. This polypeptide is called preproinsulin. Preproinsulin contains an amino-terminus signal sequence (24 amino acids in length) that is required for the precursor hormone to enter rER. As the molecule is inserted into the cisternae of the rER, the preproinsulin signal sequence is proteolytically cleaved to form proinsulin. Post translational processing reduces the preproinsulin to a polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 9,000 daltons. Proinsulin is a single polypeptide chain of 81 to 86 amino acids that has the approximate shape of the letter G (Fig. F18.4.1). Two disulfide bonds connect the bar of the G to the top loop. During packaging and storage of proinsulin in the Golgi apparatus, a cathepsin-like enzyme cleaves most of the side of the loop, leaving the bar of the G as an A chain of 21 amino acids cross-linked by the disulfide bridges to the top of the loop, which becomes the B chain of 30 amino acids. The 35–amino acid peptide removed from the loop is called a C peptide (connecting peptide). It is stored in the secretory vesicles and released with the insulin in equimolar amounts. No physiologic function has been identified for the C peptide. Because C peptide has a longer half-life than insulin, higher concentrations of C peptides are detected in the peripheral blood. For these reasons, measurement of cir- culating levels of C peptides provides important clinical information about the secretory activity of B cells. Be- cause C peptide is cleared from the body by the kidney, measurement of its urinary excretion provides a useful in- formation about B cell insulin secretion. C peptide mea- surements are frequently used to assess the residual B cell function in patients treated with insulin, to distinguish between types 1 and 2 diabetes and in the diagnosis and monitoring therapy of insulinoma (tumor of B cells). C peptide may also be used to monitor the progress of pan- creas or islet cell transplantation. • FOLDER 18.4 Functional Considerations: Insulin Synthesis, an Example of Posttranslational Processing FIGURE F18.4.1 • Posttranslational processing of insulin.

The terminal hepatic venules or central veins (CV) are the most distal radicals of the hepatic vein, and like the hepatic vein, they also travel alone. Their distinguishing features are the sinusoids that penetrate the wall of the vein and the paucity of surrounding connective tissue. These characteris- tics are shown to advantage in Plate 66. It is best to examine low-magnification views of the liver to define the boundaries of a lobule. A lobule is best identiﬁed when it is cut in cross sec- tion. The central vein then appears as a circular proﬁle, and the hepatic Liver, human, H&E ×65; inset ×65. At the low magnification shown here, large numbers of hep- atic cells appear to be uniformly disposed throughout the specimen. The hepatocytes are arranged in one-cell-thick plates, but when sectioned, they appear as interconnecting cords one or more cells thick, depending on the plane of sec- tion. The sinusoids appear as light areas between the cords of cells; they are more clearly shown in figure below (asterisks). Also present in this figure is a portal canal. It is a connective tissue sep- tum that carries the branches of the hepatic artery (HA) and portal vein (PV), bile ducts (BD), and lymphatic vessels and nerves. The artery and vein, along with the bile duct, are collectively referred to as a portal triad. The hepatic artery and the portal vein are easy to identify because they are found in relation to one another within the surrounding connective tis- KEY BD, bile duct CT, connective tissue CV, central vein (terminal hepatic venule) HA, hepatic artery HV, hepatic vein L, lymphatic nodule PV, portal vein asterisks (bottom ﬁgure), blood sinusoids dotted line (top ﬁgure), approximates the limits of a lobulePLATE 65 •LIVER I 656 cells appear as cords radiating from the central vein. Such a lobule is outlined by the dashed line in ﬁgure above. The limits of the lobule are deﬁned, in part, by the portal canal. In other directions, the plates of the lobule do not appear to have a limit; that is they have become contiguous with plates of an adjacent lobule. One can estimate the dimensions of the lobule, however, by approximating a circle with the central vein as its center and incorporating those plates that exhibit a radial arrangement up to the point where a portal canal is present. If the lobule has been cross-sectioned, the radial limit is set by the location of one or more of the portal canals as indicated by the bile ducts (BD) in this ﬁgure. sue of the portal canal. The vein is typically thin walled; the artery is smaller in diameter and has a thicker wall. The bile ducts are composed of a simple cuboidal or columnar epithelium, depending on the size of the duct. Multiple profiles of the blood vessels and bile ducts may be evident in the canal because of either branching or their passage out of the plane of section and then back in again. The vessel through which blood leaves the liver is the hepatic vein. It is readily identified because it travels alone (inset) and is surrounded by an appreciable amount of connective tissue (CT). If more than one profile of a vein is present within this connective tissue, but no arteries or bile ducts are present, the second vessel will also be a hepatic vein. Such is the case in the inset, where a profile of a small hepatic vein is seen just above the larger hepatic vein (HV). \u0003 PLATE 65 Liver I The liver is the largest mass of glandular tissue in the body and the largest internal organ. It is unique because it receives its major blood sup- ply from the hepatic portal vein, which carries venous blood from the small intestine, pancreas, and spleen. Thus the liver is directly in the pathway that conveys materials absorbed in the intestine. This gives the liver the first exposure to metabolic substrates and nutrients; it also makes the liver the first organ exposed to noxious and toxic substances absorbed from the intestine. One of the major roles of the liver is to degrade or conjugate toxic substances to render them harmless. It can, however, be seriously damaged by an excess of such substances. Each liver cell has both exocrine and endocrine functions. The exocrine secretion of the liver, called bile, contains conjugated and de- graded waste products that are delivered back to the intestine for disposal. It also contains substances that bind to metabolites in the intes- tine to aid absorption. A series of ducts of increasing diameter and complexity, beginning with bile canaliculi between individual hepatocytes and ending with the common bile duct, deliver bile from the liver and gallbladder to the duodenum. The endocrine secretions of the liver are released directly into the blood that supplies the liver cells; these secretions include albumin, nonimmune \u0005- and \u0007-globulins, prothrombin, and glycoproteins, including fibronectin. Glucose, released from stored glycogen, and triiodothy- ronine (T3), the more active deiodination product of thyroxine, are also released directly into the blood. Functional units of the liver, described as lobules or acini, are made up of irregular interconnecting sheets of hepatocytes separated from one another by the blood sinusoids. 72006_ch18 15/07/10 3:44 PM Page 656 LL CTCT BDBD HAHA CVCVCV BD PV HA PV BDBDBD PV BDBDBD L HV CT CV ** ** ** ** ** ** **PLATE 65 •LIVER I 657 72006_ch18 15/07/10 3:44 PM Page 657 Hepatic sinusoids, liver, rat, glutaraldehyde–osmium ﬁxation, toluidine blue ×900. This figure shows a plastic-embedded liver specimen fixed by the method normally used for electron microscopy. In con- trast to the H&E–stained preparation, it demonstrates to ad- vantage the cytologic detail of the hepatocytes and the sinusoids (S). The hepatocytes are deeply colored with toluidine blue. Note that the cytoplasm exhibits irregular magenta masses (arrows). This is glycogen that has been retained by the glutaraldehyde fixation and stained metachromatically by toluidine blue. Also evident are lipid droplets (L) of varying size that have been preserved and stained black by the osmium used as the secondary fixative. The quantities of lipid and glycogen are variable and, under normal conditions, reflect dietary intake. Examination of the hepatocyte cytoplasm also reveals small, punctate, dark-blue bodies con- trasted against the lighter-blue background of the cell. These are the mito- chondria. Another feature of this specimen is the clear representation of the bile canaliculi (BC) between liver cells. They appear as empty circular pro- files when cross-sectioned and as elongate channels (lower right) when lon- gitudinally sectioned. The sinusoidal lining cells are of two distinct types. The Kupffer cells (KC) are the more prominent cells. They exhibit a large nucleus and a sub- stantial amount of cytoplasm. They protrude into the lumen and may give the appearance of occluding it. However, they do not block the channel. The surface of the Kupffer cell exhibits a very irregular or jagged contour because of the numerous processes that provide the cell with an extensive surface area. The endothelial cell (EN) has a smaller nucleus, attenuated cytoplasm, and a smooth surface contour. A third cell type, the less frequently observed perisinusoidal lipocyte (Ito cell), is not seen in this micrograph. This cell would appear as a light cell containing numerous lipid droplets. The lipid droplets contain stored vitamin A. Central vein, liver, human, H&E ×500; inset ×800. The central vein and surrounding hepatocytes from lower figure of Plate 65 are shown here at higher magnification. The cytoplasm of the hepatocytes in this specimen has a foamy appearance because of extraction of glycogen and lipid during tissue preparation. The boundaries between individual hepa- tocytes are discernable in some locations but not between those cells where the knife has cut across the boundary in an oblique plane. Frequently, when cell boundaries are observed at still higher magnification (inset), a very small circular or oval profile is observed midway along the boundary. These profiles represent the bile canaliculi (BC). The cells that line the sinusoids (S) show little, if any, cytoplasmic de- tail in routine preparations. Perisinusoidal macrophages (Kupffer cells [KC]) are generally recognized by their ovoid nuclei and the projection of the cell into the lumen. The endothelial cell, in contrast, is a squamous cell that has a smaller, attenuated or elongated nucleus. Some nuclei of this de- scription are evident in the micrograph. The termination of two of the sinusoids and their union with the cen- tral vein (CV) is indicated by the curved arrows. Note that the wall of the vein is strengthened by connective tissue, mostly collagen, which appears as homogeneous eosin-stained material (asterisks). Fibroblasts (F) within this connective tissue can be identified and distinguished from the endothelial cell (EN) lining of the vein. \u0003 PLATE 66 Liver II There are three ways of describing the liver parenchyma in terms of a functional unit, “classic” lobules, portal lobules, or acini. The classic lobule is a roughly hexagonal block of tissue that has at its center the terminal hepatic venule (central vein) and at its six corners the portal canals (portal triads) containing in each a branch of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct. The portal lobule is a triangular construct that emphasizes the exocrine secretory function. It has as its axis the bile duct of the portal triad of the classic lobule, and its outer margins are imaginary lines drawn between the central veins closest to that portal triad. The liver acinus provides the best correlation among blood perfusion, metabolic activity, and liver pathology. The acinus is a small diamond- or lozenge-shaped mass of tissue that has as its short axis the fine branches of the portal triad that lie along the border of two classic lobules and as its long axis a line drawn between the two central veins closest to the short axis. The hepatocytes in each acinus are described as arranged in three concentric elliptical zones around the short axis; zone 1 is closest to, and zone 3 is farthest from, the axis.

The mucosa consists of a tall simple columnar absorptive ep- ithelium (Ep) resting on a lamina propria of loose irregular connective tissue (CT). The epithelium has characteristics that distinguish it from the absorptive epithelium of other or- gans, such as the intestines. Only one cell type, tall columnar cells, is present in the epithelial layer (see upper right figure). The nuclei are in the basal portion of the cell. The cells possess a thin apical striated bor- der. However, this is not always evident in routine H&E–stained sections. The cytoplasm stains rather uniformly with eosin. This is related to its ab- sorptive function and is in contrast to the staining of cells that are engaged in the production of protein. Lastly, with respect to its absorptive function, the epithelial cells frequently exhibit distended intercellular spaces at their basal aspect (see upper right figure arrows). This is a feature associated with the transport of fluid across the epithelium and, as noted above, commonly seen in intestinal absorptive cells. Gallbladder, human, H&E ×45. The gallbladder is a hollow, pear-shaped organ that concen- trates and stores the bile. The full thickness of its wall is shown here. It is composed of a mucosa (Muc), muscularis (Mus), and adventitia (Adv) and, on its free surface (not shown), a serosa. The mucosa is considered at higher magni- fication in figure below. The muscularis consists of interlacing bundles of smooth muscle (SM). The adventitia (Adv) consists of irregular dense con- nective tissue through which the larger blood vessels (BV) travel and, more peripherally, of varying amounts of adipose tissue (AT). The mucosa is thrown into numerous folds that are particularly pro- nounced when the muscularis is highly contracted. This is the usual histo- logic appearance of the gallbladder unless, of course, steps are taken to fix and preserve it in a distended state. Occasionally, the section cuts through a recess in a fold, and the recess may then resemble a gland (arrows). The mucosa, however, does not possess glands, except in the neck region, where some mucous glands are present (see lower right figure). \u0003 PLATE 67 Gallbladder The gallbladder concentrates and stores bile for delivery to the duodenum. The bile is concentrated by the active transport of salt from the bile and the passive movement of water in response to the salt transport. The mucosa is characterized by a tall columnar absorptive epithe- lium that closely resembles that of the intestine and the colon in both its morphology and function. The epithelial cells are characterized by nu- merous short apical microvilli, apical junctional complexes, concentrations of mitochondria in the apical and basal cytoplasm, and complex lateral plications. In addition, Na +-K +–activated ATPase is localized on the lateral plasma membrane of the epithelial cell.

The lamina propria underlying the epithelium is usually very cellular. In this specimen, in addition to lymphocytes (L), a relatively common finding, a large number of plasma cells (PC) is also present within the lamina propria. (The high con- centration of plasma cells suggests chronic inflammation.) Another feature of note in the lamina propria is the presence of several out- pouching of the mucosa, called Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses (RAS), other than those seen in the mucosa and noted above. These are readily ap- parent in figure on right and two of these structures, marked by RAS are shown at higher magnification in figure below. Mucosa, gallbladder, human, H&E ×550. The smaller of the two gland-like structures is composed of mucous cells (MC) and represents a section through a mu- cous gland. This specimen was taken from a site near the neck of the gallbladder where mucous glands are often present. Note the characteristic flattened nuclei at the base of the cell and the lightly stained appearance of the cytoplasm, features characteristic of mucin-secreting cells. In contrast, the epithelium of the large gland-like profile that is only partially included in the micrograph has rounded or ovoid nuclei. This epithelial-lined structure is not a true gland but repre- sents an invagination of the mucous membrane that extends into and often through the thickness of the muscularis. These invaginations are known as Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses.PLATE 67 •GALLBLADDER 660 72006_ch18 15/07/10 3:44 PM Page 660 L PCPC AdvAdv BVBV MusMus MucMuc SMSM Muc SM SMSMSM SMSMSM RASRASRAS Mus BV BVBVBV BVBVBV Adv AT PC CTCTCT Ep L CTCT MCMCMC CT RASRASRAS RASRASRAS RASRASRASPLATE 67 •GALLBLADDER 661 72006_ch18 15/07/10 3:44 PM Page 661 Pancreas, human, H&E ×600. Acini of the pancreas consist of serous cells. In sections, the acini present circular and irregular profiles. The lumen of the acinus is small, and only in fortuitous sections through an ac- inus is the lumen included (asterisks). The nucleus is charac- teristically in the base of the acinar cell. There is a region of intense basophilia adjacent to the nucleus. This is the ergastoplasm (Er), and it reflects the presence of rER that is active in the synthesis of pancre- atic enzymes. Some acini reveal a centrally positioned cell with cytoplasm that shows no special staining characteristics in H&E–stained paraffin sec- tions. These are centroacinar cells (CC). They are the beginning of the in- tercalated ducts. This figure demonstrates particularly well the morphology and rela- tionships of the intercalated ducts. Note, first, the cross-sectioned intralob- ular duct (InD) consisting of cuboidal epithelium. (There are no striated ducts in the pancreas.) Leading to the intralobular duct is an intercalated duct (ID), which is seen in cross section at the furthest distance from the intralobular duct and then, in longitudinal section, in the center of the il- lustration as it travels toward the intralobular duct. The lumen is evident where the intercalated duct is seen in cross section but is not evident where it is seen in longitudinal section. This is because the plane of section cuts chiefly through the cells rather than the lumen. As a consequence, this fig- ure provides a good view of the nuclei of the duct cells. They are elongate, with their long axis oriented in the direction of the duct. In addition, they display a staining pattern similar to that of centroacinar cells and different from that of nuclei of the parenchymal cells. Once the cells of the intercalated duct have been identified in one part of the section, their staining characteristics and location can be used to identify the intercalated ducts in other parts of the lobule, several of which are marked (ID). Pancreas, human, H&E ×160; inset ×360. The pancreas is surrounded by a delicate capsule of moderately dense connective tissue. Septa from the capsule divide the pan- creas into lobules, one of which is shown here, bounded by connective tissue (CT). Larger blood vessels (BV ) travel in the connective tissue septa; nerves also travel in the septa, but they are seen infrequently. Within the lobule are the numerous acini of the ex- ocrine component, an intralobular duct (InD), intercalated ducts (not read- ily evident at this low magnification), and islets of Langerhans (IL). Also within the lobule are the small blood vessels and the connective tissue serv- ing as a stroma for the parenchymal elements of the gland. This figure shows an islet of Langerhans (IL) among the far more nu- merous acini. (Islets are most numerous in the tail of the pancreas and least numerous in the head). Cells within the islets are arranged as irregular cords. In routine preparations, it is not possible to identify the various cell types within the islets. Note, however, that B cells are the most numerous; these produce insulin. The next most numerous are A cells; these produce glucagon. The inset also shows numerous capillaries (arrows). The labels A and B are not intended to identify specific cells but rather to show those parts of the islets where A and B cells are found in greatest number. \u0003 PLATE 68 Pancreas The pancreas is an elongated extramural digestive gland with a head nestled in the C-shaped bend of the duodenum, a body that crosses the midline of the abdomen, and a tail extending across the back of the abdomen. It is a mixed gland containing both an exocrine component and an endocrine component that have distinctive characteristics. The exocrine component is a compound tubuloacinar gland with a branching network of ducts that convey the exocrine secretions to the duodenum. These secretions consist primarily of inactive forms of potent prote- olytic enzymes, as well as amylase, lipase, nucleases, and electrolytes, particularly HCO3\u0003. The endocrine component is isolated as highly vascularized islets of epithelioid tissue (islets of Langerhans). The islet cells secrete a va- riety of polypeptide and protein hormones, most notably insulin and glucagon, which regulate glucose metabolism throughout the other tis- sues of the body. Other hormones secreted by islet cells include somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin, motilin, and substance P. All of these substances, with the exception of insulin, are also secreted by the population of enteroendocrine cells in the intestine, the organ from which the pancreas is derived during embryonic development. While insulin and glucagon act primarily in en- docrine regulation of distant cells, the other hormones (and glucagon) have significant roles in the paracrine regulation of the insulin-secreting B cells of the pancreatic islet.

The conducting portion of the respiratory system consists of those air passages that lead to the sites of respiration within the lung where gas exchange takes place. The conducting pas- sages include those located outside as well as within the lungs. The passages external to the lungs consist of the following: • Nasal cavities that represent two large air-filled spaces in the uppermost part of the respiratory system (and, during forced breathing, the oral cavity residing inferior to the nasal cavities). • Nasopharynx that lies behind the nasal cavities and above the level of the soft palate and communicate inferiorly with oropharynx that is posterior to the oral cavity. • Larynx that is a hollow tubular organ containing cartilagi- nous framework responsible for producing sounds. • Trachea that is a flexible air tube that extend from the lar- ynx to the thorax. It serves as a conduit for air and in the mediastinum it birurcates into paired main bronchi. • Paired main (primary) bronchi that enter root of the right or left lung.

Within the lung, the air passages branch into increasingly smaller tubes until the very smallest air spaces, called alveoli, are reached (Fig. 19.1). Three principal functions are performed by this system: air conduction, air ﬁltration, and gas exchange (respira- tion). The latter occurs in the alveoli. In addition, air passing through the larynx is used to produce speech, and air passing over the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavities carries stimuli for the sense of smell. The respiratory system also par- ticipates to a lesser degree in endocrine functions (hormone production and secretion), as well as regulation of immune responses to inhaled antigens. The lungs develop in the embryo as a ventral evagination of the foregut; thus, the epithelium of the respiratory system is of endodermal origin. This initial respiratory diverticu- lum grows into the thoracic mesenchyme. The bronchial car- tilages, smooth muscle, and the other connective tissue elements are derived from the thoracic mesenchyme. 664 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 664chapter 19Respiratory System\u0003NASAL CAVITIES 665 665 structural basis for gas exchange within the lung parenchyma. The essential features of the lung blood sup- ply are described on page 687. Air passing through the respiratory passages must be con- ditioned before reaching the terminal respiratory units. Conditioning of the air occurs in the conducting portion of the respiratory system and includes warming, moistening, and removal of particulate materials. Mucous and serous secretions play a major role in the conditioning process. These secretions moisten the air and also trap particles that have managed to slip past the special short thick hairs, called vibrissae, in the nasal cavities. Mucus, augmented by these serous secretions, also prevents the dehydration of the underly- ing epithelium by the moving air. Mucus covers almost the en- tire luminal surface of the conducting passages and is continuously produced by goblet cells and mucus-secreting glands in the walls of the passages. The mucus and other secre- tions are moved toward the pharynx by means of coordinated sweeping movements of cilia and are then normally swallowed. \u0002 NASAL CAVITIES The nasal cavities are paired chambers separated by a bony and cartilaginous septum. They are elongated spaces with a wide base that rests on the hard and soft palate and a narrow apex that points toward the anterior cranial fossa. The skeletal framework of the nasal cavities is formed by bones and carti- lages; most are located centrally in the skull except for the small anterior region that is enclosed within the external nose. Each cavity or chamber communicates anteriorly with the external environment through the anterior nares (nos- trils), posteriorly with the nasopharynx through the choanae, and laterally with the paranasal sinuses and nasolacrimal duct, which drains tears from the eye into the nasal cavity (Fig. 19.2). The chambers are divided into three regions: • Nasal vestibule, which is a dilated space of the nasal cav- ity just inside nostrils and lined by skin • Respiratory region, which is the largest part (inferior two-thirds) of the nasal cavities and lined by respiratory mucosa • Olfactory region, which is located at the apex (upper one- third) of each nasal cavity and lined by specialized olfac- tory mucosa Vestibule of the Nasal Cavity The nasal vestibule forms a part of the external nose and communicates anteriorly with the external environment. It is lined with stratified squamous epithelium, a continuation of the skin of the face, and contains a variable number of vibris- sae that entrap large particulate matter before it is carried in the air stream to the rest of the cavity. Sebaceous glands are also present, and their secretions assist in the entrapment of partic- ulate matter. Posteriorly, where the vestibule ends, the stratified squamous epithelium becomes thinner and undergoes a tran- sition to the pseudostratified epithelium that characterizes the respiratory region. At this site, sebaceous glands are absent. Within the lungs, the main bronchi undergo extensive branching to give rise ultimately to the distributing bronchi- oles. The bronchioles represent the terminal part of the con- ducting passages. Collectively, the internal bronchi and the bronchioles constitute the bronchial tree. The respiratory portion is that part of the respiratory tract in which gas exchange occurs. Sequentially, it includes these: • Respiratory bronchioles that are involve in both air con- duction and gas exchange. • Alveolar ducts that are elongated airways formed from the confluence openings to alveoli. • Alveolar sacs that respresnt spaces surrounded by clusters of alveoli. • Alveoli that are the primary sites of gas exchange. Blood vessels enter the lung with the bronchi. The ar- teries branch into smaller vessels as they follow the bronchial tree into the substance of the lung. Capillaries come into intimate contact with the terminal respiratory units, the alveoli. This intimate relationship between the alveolar air spaces and the pulmonary capillaries is the nasal cavity nasopharynx oropharynx larynx trachea bronchioles diaphragm lung bronchi respiratory bronchioles alveolar ducts alveoli alveolar sacs FIGURE 19.1 • Diagram of respiratory passages. The nasal cavities, nasopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles constitute the conducting portion of the respiratory system. The respiratory portion of the system, where gas exchange occurs, is composed of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. (Based on Boileau G. A Method of Anatomy. Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins, 1980.) 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 665 Respiratory Region of the Nasal Cavity The respiratory region constitutes most of the volume of the nasal cavities. It is lined by the respiratory mucosa that con- tains a ciliated, pseudostratified columnar epithelium on its sur- face. The underlying lamina propria is firmly attached to the periosteum and perichondrium of the adjacent bone or cartilage. The medial wall of the respiratory region, the nasal sep- tum, is smooth, but the lateral walls are thrown into folds by the presence of three shelf-like, bony projections called con- chae or turbinates. The conchae divide each nasal cavity into separate air chambers and play a dual role. They increase sur- face area and cause turbulence in airflow to allow more effi- cient conditioning of inspired air. The ciliated, pseudostratiﬁed columnar epithelium of the respiratory mucosa is composed of five cell types: • Ciliated cells, tall columnar cells with cilia that project into the mucus covering the surface of the epithelium • Goblet cells that synthesize and secrete mucus • Brush cells, a general name for those cells in the respira- tory tract that bear short, blunt microvilli • Small granule cells (Kulchitsky cells) that resemble basal cells but contain secretory granules. These are en- teroendocrine cells of the APUD system • Basal cells, stem cells from which the other cell types arise The epithelium of the respiratory region of the nasal cavity is essentially the same as the epithelium lining most of the parts that follow in the conducting system. Because the respiratory epithelium of the trachea is studied and examined in preference to that of the nasal cavity, the above cell types are discussed in the section on the trachea (page 672). The mucosa of the respiratory region warms, moistens, and filters inspired air. The lamina propria of the respiratory mucosa has a rich, vascular network that includes a complex set of capillary loops. The arrangement of the vessels allows the inhaled air to be warmed by blood flowing through the part of the loop closest to the surface. The capillaries that reside near the sur- face are arranged in rows; the blood flows perpendicular to the airflow, much as one would find in a mechanical heat- exchange system. These same vessels may become engorged and leaky during allergic reactions or viral infections such as the common cold. The lamina propria then becomes dis- tended with ﬂuid, resulting in marked swelling of the mu- cous membrane with consequent restriction of the air passage, making breathing difﬁcult. The lamina propria also contains mucous glands, many exhibiting serous demilunes. Their secretions supplement that of the goblet cells in the res- piratory epithelium. 666 trachea cricoid cartilage thyroid cartilage larynx epiglottis hyoid bone oral cavity soft palate hard palate vestibule nasal mucosa conchae olfactory mucosa choanae orifice of auditory tube nasopharynx oropharynx ventricular fold vocal fold esophagus laryngopharynx FIGURE 19.2 • Diagram of the relationship of the pharynx to the respiratory and digestive systems. The pharynx is divided into three parts: nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx. It is located posterior to the nasal and oral cavities and extends inferiorly past the larynx. The pharynx serves both respiratory and digestive systems. This midsagittal section also transects the cartilages forming the skeleton of the larynx (i.e., epiglottis, thyroid cartilage, and cricoid cartilage). Note the ventricular and vocal folds in the middle of the larynx, approximately at the level of the thyroid cartilage. This part of the larynx represents the narrowest portion of the respiratory system and is responsible for producing sound by audible vibration of the vocal folds. 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 666chapter 19Respiratory System\u0003NASAL CAVITIES 667 667 By increasing surface area, the conchae (turbinates) in- crease the efficiency with which the inspired air is warmed. The turbinates also increase the efficiency of filtration of in- spired air through the process of turbulent precipitation. The air stream is broken into eddies by the turbinates. Partic- ulate matter suspended in the air stream is thrown out of the stream and adheres to the mucus-covered wall of the nasal cavity. Particles trapped in this layer of mucus are transported to the pharynx by means of coordinated sweeping move- ments of cilia and are then swallowed. Olfactory Region of the Nasal Cavity The olfactory region is located on part of the dome of each nasal cavity and, to a variable extent, the contiguous lateral and medial nasal walls. It is lined with a specialized olfactory mu- cosa. In living tissue, this mucosa is distinguished by its slight yellowish brown color caused by pigment in the olfactory ep- ithelium and the associated olfactory glands. In humans, the total surface area of the olfactory mucosa is only about 10 cm 2; in animals with an acute sense of smell, the total surface area of the olfactory mucosa is considerably more extensive. For in- stance, certain dogs species have more than 150 cm 2. The lamina propria of the olfactory mucosa is directly con- tiguous with the periosteum of the underlying bone (Plate 69, page 688). This connective tissue contains numerous blood and lymphatic vessels, unmyelinated olfactory nerves, myeli- nated nerves, and olfactory glands. The olfactory epithelium, like the epithelium of the respira- tory region, is also pseudostratified, but it contains very differ- ent cell types. Also, it lacks goblet cells (Fig. 19.3 and Plate 69, page 688). The olfactory epithelium is composed of the following cell types: • Olfactory receptor cells are bipolar neurons that span the thickness of the epithelium and enter the central nerve system. bbbbb duct ductolfactory epitheliumduct ductolfactory epitheliumduct ductolfactory epitheliumduct ductolfactory epitheliumduct ductolfactory epithelium olfactory glands olfactory glands olfactory glands olfactory glands olfactory glands olfactory nerves olfactory nerves olfactory nerves olfactory nerves olfactory nerves cilia supporting cell axon basal cell olfactory (Bowman’s) gland basal lamina junctional complex olfactory vesicle microvilli a olfactory cell FIGURE 19.3 • Olfactory mucosa of the nasal cavity. a. This diagram shows the three major cell types located within the olfactory epithelium: the olfactory cell, supporting (sustentacular) cell, and basal cell. The olfactory cell is the receptor cell; it has an apical expansion, the olfactory vesicle, from which long, nonmotile cilia extend. At its basal surface it extends an axon into the connective tissue that joins with axons of other olfactory cells to form an olfactory nerve. The basal cells are small and cuboidal. They are restricted to the basal part of the epithelium. The supporting cells, in contrast, are columnar and extend the full thickness of the epithelium; their nuclei are located in the upper portion of the cell. Note the olfactory (Bowman’s) gland and its duct that empties on the surface of the mucosa. b. Photomicrograph of the olfactory mucosa. The olfactory epithelium exhibits nuclei through much of its thickness, but the individual cell types to which they belong are not discernible. The underlying connective tissue is largely occupied by numerous olfactory (Bowman’s) glands, olfactory nerves, and blood vessels. Note that the ducts of the olfactory glands extend from the secretory portion of the gland to the epithelial surface. \u0002240. 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 667 • Supporting or sustentacular cells are columnar cells that are similar to neuroglia cells and provide mechanical and metabolic support to the olfactory receptor cells. They synthesize and secrete odorant-binding proteins. • Basal cells are stem cells from which new olfactory receptor cells and supporting cells differentiate. • Brush cells are the same cell type that occurs in the respi- ratory epithelium. Olfactory receptor cells are bipolar neurons that possess an apical projection bearing cilia. The apical domain of each olfactory receptor cell has a sin- gle dendritic process that projects above the epithelial sur- face as a knoblike structure called the olfactory vesicle. A number of long, thin cilia (10 to 23) with typical basal bod- ies arise from the olfactory vesicle and extend radially in a plane parallel to the epithelial surface (see Fig. 19.3). The cilia are usually up to 200 \u0003m long and may overlap with cilia of adjacent olfactory receptor cells. The cilia are regarded as nonmotile, although some research suggests that they may have limited motility. The basal domain of the cell gives rise to an unmyelinated axonal process that leaves the epithelial com- partment. Collections of axons from olfactory receptor cells do not come together as a single nerve, but instead they are grouped into bundles that pass through a thin cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, course through the dura and arachnoid matters, and finally are surrounded by pia matter, entering the olfactory bulb of the brain. The collections of axons from olfactory receptor cells form the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I). The olfactory axons are very fragile, and can be harmed during traumatic head injury. They can be permanently severed, resulting in anosmia (loss of the sense of smell). Autoradiographic studies show that olfactory receptor cells have a lifespan of about 1 month. If injured, they are quickly replaced. Olfactory receptor cells (and some neurons of the enteric division of the autonomic nervous system) appear to be the only neurons in the nervous system that are readily replaced during postnatal life. Entire olfactory transduction pathways occurs within the cilia of the olfactory receptor cells. All the molecules that are involved in olfactory transduc- tion are located within long cilia that arise from the olfac- tory bulb. The chemical signals (the odorants) are detected and selectively bind to the odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) that are concentrated in the olfactory mucus (Fig 19.4). The OBPs are small (10 to 30 kilodalton), water-sol- uble proteins that are synthesized and secreted by support- ing cells. First, incoming odorant molecules are solubilized in the olfactory mucus, and then OBPs act as molecular car- riers that transport odorants and deliver them to the olfac- tory receptors (ORs) located in the plasma membrane of the cilia. Olfactory receptors are specific for the olfactory re- ceptor cells and belong to the family of G protein–coupled receptors (known as Golf ). When stimulated by odorant molecules, Golf ORs activate enzyme adenylyl cyclase and initiate the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) cascade of evens (see Fig 19.4). These include binding of cAMP to specific Na\u0004 and Ca2\u0004 channel proteins and in- flux of Na\u0004 and Ca2\u0004, which is responsible for plasma membrane depolarization that generates action potential. To accurately detect several thousands of known odor molecules by only 350 known different ORs in humans re- quires a special coding system for different impulses. This is achieved by a population coding scheme, in which each OR protein binds to different odorants with different sensi- tivity. Thus, the olfactory system must decode olfactory im- pulses not from only one cell, but from the entire population of cells within the olfactory epithelium. Supporting cells provide mechanical and metabolic sup- port for the olfactory receptor cells. Supporting cells are the most numerous cells in the olfactory epithelium. The nuclei of these tall columnar or sustentacular cells occupy a more apical position in the epithelium than do those of the other cell types, thus aiding in their identification in the light microscope (see Fig. 19.3 and Plate 69, page 688). They have numerous microvilli on their apical surface, and abundant mitochondria. Numerous profiles of smooth endo- plasmic reticulum (sER) and, to a more limited extent, rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) are observed in the cytoplasm. They also possess lipofuscin granules. Adhering junctions are present between these cells and the olfactory receptor cells, but gap and tight junctions are absent. The supporting cells function in a manner comparable to that of neuroglial cells, providing both metabolic support (secretion of OBP molecules) and physical support to the olfactory receptor cells. Brush cells are columnar cells specialized for transduction of general sensation. The olfactory epithelium also contains cells present in much smaller numbers, called brush cells. As noted, these cells are present in the epithelium of other parts of the conducting air passages. With the electron microscope (EM), brush cells exhibit large, blunt microvilli at their apical surface, a feature that gives them their name. The basal surface of a brush cell is in synaptic contact with nerve fibers that penetrate the basal lamina. The nerve fibers are terminal branches of the trigem- inal nerve (cranial nerve V) that function in general sensa- tion rather than olfaction. Brush cells appear to be involved in transduction of general sensory stimulation of the mucosa. In addition, presence of a microvillous border, vesicles near the apical cell membrane, and a well-defined Golgi apparatus suggest that brush cells might be involved in an absorptive as well as a secretory functions. Basal cells are progenitors of the other mature cell types. Basal cells are small, rounded cells located close to the basal lamina. Their nuclei are frequently invaginated and lie at a level below those of the olfactory receptor cell nuclei. The cytoplasm contains few organelles, a feature consistent with their role as a reserve or stem cell. A feature consistent with their differentiation into supporting cells is the observation of 668 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 668chapter 19Respiratory System\u0003NASAL CAVITIES 669 669 processes in some basal cells that partially ensheathe the first portion of the olfactory receptor cell axon. They thus main- tain a relationship to the olfactory receptor cell even in their undifferentiated state. Olfactory glands are a characteristic feature of the olfactory mucosa. The olfactory glands (Bowman’s glands), a characteris- tic feature of the mucosa, are branched tubuloalveolar serous glands that deliver their proteinaceous secretions via ducts onto the olfactory surface (see Fig. 19.3 and Plate 69, page 688). Lipofuscin granules are prevalent in the gland cells, and in combination with the lipofuscin granules in the sup- porting cells of the olfactory epithelium, they give the mu- cosa its natural yellow-brown coloration. Short ducts com- posed of cuboidal cells lead from the glands and pass through the basal lamina into the olfactory epithelium, where they continue to the epithelial surface to discharge their contents. The serous secretion of the olfactory glands serves as a trap and solvent for odoriferous substances. Constant flow from the glands rids the mucosa of remnants of detected odorifer- ous substances so that new scents can be continuously de- tected as they arise. The identifying feature of the olfactory region of the nasal mucosa in a histologic preparation is the presence odorants bind to odorant-binding proteins ion channels olfactory bulb ethmoid bone dura mater arachnoid pia mater olfactory epithelium olfactory receptor cells air air weak signal mucus strong signal very weak signal adenyl cyclase odorant molecules odorant-binding proteins from supporting cell olfactory receptor Golf OR cAMP cAMP cAMPG protein Ca 2+ Na+ + + + + + AMP FIGURE 19.4 • Diagram of olfactory transduction pathway. This diagram shows interactions of the odorant molecules with proteins associated with olfactory receptor cell. Incoming in inhaled air odorant molecules are solubilized in the olfactory mucus and bind to olfactory binding proteins, which deliver them to the olfactory receptors. Note that different odorant molecules bind with different affinity to the olfactory receptors. Strong signal (see green G protein–coupled olfactory receptor) is produced by high affinity binding where odorant molecule (green) matches perfectly the binging site on the receptor. Other olfactory receptors (yellow and pink) show less affinity binding, thus producing weaker signals. Stimulated by odorant molecules olfactory receptors activate enzyme adenylyl cyclase and initiate the cAMP cascade of evens leading to opening of specific Na \u0004 and Ca 2\u0004channels. Influx of Na\u0004 and Ca 2\u0004 is responsible for cell depolarization. Generated action potential travels on axons of olfactory receptor cells from nasal cavity passing through the ethmoid bone and surrounding brain coverings to the olfactory bulb of the brain. 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 669 of the olfactory nerves in combination with olfactory glands in the lamina propria. The nerves are particularly conspicuous because of the relatively large diameter of the individual unmyelinated fibers that they contain (see Figs. 19.3 and 19.4). Paranasal Sinuses Paranasal sinuses are air-filled spaces in the bones of the walls of the nasal cavity. The paranasal sinuses are extensions of the respiratory re- gion of the nasal cavity and are lined by respiratory epithe- lium. The sinuses are named for the bone in which they are found (i.e., the ethmoid, frontal, sphenoid, and maxillary bones). The sinuses communicate with the nasal cavities via narrow openings onto the respiratory mucosa. The mucosal surface of the sinuses is a thin, ciliated, pseudostratified columnar epithelium with numerous goblet cells. Mucus pro- duced in the sinuses is swept into the nasal cavities by coordi- nated ciliary movements. The sinuses are often subject to acute infection after viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Severe infections may require physical drainage. \u0002 PHARYNX The pharynx connects the nasal and oral cavities to the lar- ynx and esophagus. It serves as a passageway for air and food and acts as a resonating chamber for speech. The pharynx is located posterior to the nasal and oral cavities and is divided regionally into the nasopharynx and oropharynx, respec- tively (see Fig. 19.2). The auditory (Eustachian) tubes con- nect the nasopharynx to each middle ear. Diffuse lymphatic tissue and lymphatic nodules are present in the wall of the na- sopharynx. The concentration of lymphatic nodules at the junction between the superior and posterior walls of the phar- ynx is called the pharyngeal tonsil. \u0002 LARYNX The passageway for air between the oropharynx and trachea is the larynx (see Fig. 19.2). This complex tubular region of the respiratory system is formed by irregularly shaped plates of hyaline and elastic cartilage (the epiglottis and the vocal pro- cesses of the arytenoid cartilages). In addition to serving as a conduit for air, the larynx serves as the organ for producing sounds. Vocal folds control the flow of air through the larynx and vibrate to produce sound. The vocal folds, also referred to as vocal cords, are two folds of mucosa that project into the lumen of the larynx (Fig. 19.5 and Plate 70, page 690). They are oriented in an anteroposte- rior direction and define the lateral boundaries of the opening of the larynx, the rima glottidis. A supporting ligament and skeletal muscle, the vocalis muscle, is contained within each vocal fold. Ligaments and the intrinsic laryngeal muscles join the adjacent cartilaginous plates and are responsible for generating tension in the vocal folds and for opening and closing the glottis. The extrinsic laryngeal muscles insert on cartilages of the larynx but originate in extralaryngeal structures. These muscles move the larynx during degluti- tion (swallowing). Expelled air from lungs passing through a narrow space of rima glottidis causes the vocal folds to vibrate. The vibrations are altered by modulating the tension on the vocal folds and by changing the degree of glottal opening. This alteration of the vibrations produces sounds of different pitch. Sounds created in the larynx during the process of phonation are modified in upper parts of the respiratory system (nasophar- ynx, nasal cavities, and paranasal sinuses) and the oral cavity (oropharynx, soft and hard palate, tongue, teeth, lips, etc.) to produce the individual speech sounds (different vowels and consonants). The ventricular folds located above the vocal folds are the “false vocal cords.” Above the vocal folds is an elongated recess in the larynx called the ventricle. Immediately above the ventricle is an- other pair of mucosal folds, the ventricular folds, or false vocal cords (see Fig. 19.5 and Plate 70, page 690). These folds do not have the intrinsic muscular investment of the true vocal cords and therefore, do not modulate in phonation. They and the ventricle, however, are important in creating sound resonance. Inﬂammation and swelling of the larynx caused by viruses (such as in common cold virus) and other microbial agents is called acute laryngitis. Symptoms of acute laryngitis may include hoarseness or, in more severe cases, the total loss of voice, coughing, and difﬁculty with swallowing and breathing. Chronic laryngitis is usually caused by prolonged exposure of irritating agents such as tobacco smoke, dust, and/or polluted air. Stratified squamous and ciliated pseudostratified colum- nar epithelium line the larynx. The luminal surface of the vocal cords is covered with stratiﬁed squamous epithelium, as is most of the epiglottis (Plate 70, page 690). The epithelium serves to protect the mucosa from abrasion caused by the rapidly moving air stream. The rest of the larynx is lined with the ciliated, pseudostratified columnar epithelium that charac- terizes the respiratory tract (see Fig. 19.5 and Plate 70, page 690). The connective tissue of the larynx contains mixed mucoserous glands that secrete through ducts onto the la- ryngeal surface. \u0002 TRACHEA The trachea is a short, flexible, air tube about 2.5 cm in di- ameter and about 10 cm long. It serves as a conduit for air; additionally, its wall assists in conditioning inspired air. The trachea extends from the larynx to about the middle of the thorax, where it divides into the two main (primary) bronchi. The lumen of the trachea stays open because of the arrangement of the series of cartilaginous rings. 670 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 670chapter 19Respiratory System\u0003TRACHEA 671 671 a b ca b ca b ca b ca b c mucous glands ventricular fold ventricular fold vocal fold vocal fold vocalis muscle vocalis muscle mucous glands ventricular fold ventricular fold vocal fold vocal fold vocalis muscle vocalis muscle mucous glands ventricular fold ventricular fold vocal fold vocal fold vocalis muscle vocalis muscle mucous glands ventricular fold ventricular fold vocal fold vocal fold vocalis muscle vocalis muscle mucous glands ventricular fold ventricular fold vocal fold vocal fold ventricles vocalis muscle vocalis muscle infraglottic cavity dense connective tissue dense connective tissue dense connective tissue dense connective tissue dense connective tissue vocal ligament vocal ligament vocal ligament vocal ligament vocal ligament stratified squamous epithelium stratified squamous epithelium stratified squamous epithelium stratified squamous epithelium stratified squamous epithelium stratified squamous epithelium stratified squamous epithelium stratified squamous epithelium stratified squamous epithelium stratified squamous epithelium vestibule of the larynx vestibule of the larynx vestibule of the larynx vestibule of the larynx vestibule of the larynx FIGURE 19.5 • Photomicrograph of a frontal section of the larynx. a. This photomicrograph shows three parts of the larynx: the vestibule above the ventricular folds, the ventricles between the vestibular folds and superior to the vocal folds, and the infraglottic cavity that extends from the vocal folds to the cricoid cartilage. Note that mucous glands are prominent in the ventricular folds and are covered by the typical pseudostratified ciliated epithelium. The vocal fold is composed of the epithelium, vocal ligament, and underlying vocalis muscle. Numerous lymph nodules are also present within the mucosa of the larynx (arrows). \u000210. b. High magnification of the area of the ventricular fold indicated by the upper rectangle in a shows on the left the pseudostratified ciliated epithelium that lines most of the larynx. Many nonsmoking adults and virtually all smokers exhibit patches of stratified squamous epithelium, as seen on the right of the micrograph. \u0002240. c. High magnification of the area of the vocal fold indicated by the lower rectangle in a reveals normal stratified squamous epithelium at this site. Just beneath the epithelium is the connective tissue known as Reinke’s space. This clinically important site lacks lymphatic vessels and is poorly vascularized. The vocal ligament, inscribed by the dashed line, is seen at the bottom of the micrograph. \u0002240. The wall of the trachea consists of four definable layers: • Mucosa, composed of a ciliated, pseudostratified epithe- lium and an elastic, fiber-rich lamina propria • Submucosa, composed of a slightly denser connective tissue than the lamina propria • Cartilaginous layer, composed of C-shaped hyaline car- tilages • Adventitia, composed of connective tissue that binds the trachea to adjacent structures A unique feature of the trachea is the presence of a series of C-shaped hyaline cartilages that are stacked one on top of each other to form a supporting structure (Fig. 19.6). These cartilages, which might be described as a skeletal framework, prevent collapse of the tracheal lumen, particularly during 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 671 expiration. Fibroelastic tissue and smooth muscle, the tra- chealis muscle, bridge the gap between the free ends of the C-shaped cartilages at the posterior border of the trachea, adjacent to the esophagus. Tracheal Epithelium Tracheal epithelium is similar to respiratory epithelium in other parts of the conducting airway. Ciliated columnar cells, mucous (goblet) cells, and basal cells are the principal cell types in the tracheal epithelium (Figs. 19.7 and 19.8). Brush cells are also present, but in small numbers, as are small granule cells. • Ciliated cells, the most numerous of the tracheal cell types, extend through the full thickness of the epithelium. Cilia appear in histologic sections as short, hair-like pro- files projecting from the apical surface (Plate 71, page 692). Each cell has approximately 250 cilia. Immediately below the cilia is a dark line formed by the aggregated cil- iary basal bodies (Fig. 19.9). The cilia provide a coordi- nated sweeping motion of the mucous coat from the farthest reaches of the air passages toward the pharynx. In effect, the ciliated cells function as a “mucociliary esca- lator” that serves as an important protective mechanism for removing small inhaled particles from the lungs. • Mucous cells are similar in appearance to intestinal gob- let cells and are thus often referred to by the same name. They are interspersed among the ciliated cells and also extend through the full thickness of the epithelium (see Fig. 19.9). They are readily seen in the light microscope after they have accumulated mucinogen granules in their cytoplasm. Although the mucinogen is typically washed out in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) preparations, the identity of the cell is made apparent by the remaining clear area in the cytoplasm and the lack of cilia at the apical sur- face. In contrast to ciliated cells, the number of mucous cells increases during chronic irritation of the air passages. • Brush cells have the same general features as those de- scribed for the respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity (Fig. 19.10). They are columnar cells that bear blunt mi- crovilli. The basal surface of the cells is in synaptic contact with an afferent nerve ending (epitheliodendritic synapse). Thus, the brush cell is regarded as a receptor cell. • Small granule cells (Kulchitsky cells) are respiratory representatives of the general class of enteroendocrine cells of the gut and gut derivatives (see Fig. 19.10). Their presence is explained by the development of the respiratory tract and lungs from an evagination of the primitive foregut. Small granule cells usually occur singly in the tra- chea and are sparsely dispersed among the other cell types. They are difficult to distinguish from basal cells in the light microscope without special techniques such as silver stain- ing, which reacts with the granules. The nucleus is located near the basement membrane; the cytoplasm is somewhat more extensive than that of the smaller basal cells. With the transmission electron microscope (TEM), a thin, tapering cytoplasmic process is sometimes observed extending to the lumen. Also, with the TEM, the cytoplasm exhibits numer- ous, membrane-bounded, dense-core granules. In one type of small granule cell, the secretion is a catecholamine. A second cell type produces polypeptide hormones such as serotonin, calcitonin, and gastrin-releasing peptide 672 In human respiratory mucosa, ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium may change to stratified squamous ep- ithelium. This change from columnar to squamous epithelium epithelium is referred as columnar-to-squamous metapla- sia or simply the squamous metaplasia. Epithelial alter- ations of this kind are reversible and are characterized by change from one type of fully differentiated adult cell to a dif- ferent type of adult cell. A given mature cell does not change to another type of mature cell; rather, basal cell proliferation gives rise to the new differentiated cell type. These cellular changes are considered to be controlled and adaptive. Squamous metaplasia is a normal occurrence on the rounded, more exposed portions of the turbinates, on the vocal folds, and in certain other regions. Changes in the character of the respiratory epithelium may, however, occur in other ciliated epithelial sites when the pattern of airflow is altered or when forceful airflow oc- curs, as in chronic coughing. Typically, in chronic bronchi- tis and bronchiectasis, the respiratory epithelium changes in certain regions to a stratified squamous form. The al- tered epithelium is more resistant to physical stress and in- sult, but it is less effective functionally. In smokers, a similar epithelial change occurs. Initially, the cilia on ciliated cells lose their synchronous beating pattern as a result of nox- ious elements in smoke. As a result, removal of mucus is impaired. To compensate, the individual begins to cough, thereby facilitating the expulsion of accumulated mucus in the airway, particularly in the trachea. With time, the num- ber of ciliated cells decreases because of chronic cough- ing. This reduction in ciliated cells further impairs the normal epithelium and results in its replacement with strat- ified squamous epithelium at affected sites in the airway. If factors (i.e., tobacco smoking) that predispose to squa- mous metaplasia are not eliminated, the metaplastic ep- ithelium may undergo malignant transformation. Therefore, one of the two most common forms of cancer in the respi- ratory tract, the squamous cell carcinoma, has its origin from the squamous metaplastic cells. • FOLDER 19.1 Clinical Correlation: Squamous Metaplasia in the Respiratory Tract 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 672chapter 19Respiratory System\u0003TRACHEA 673 673 (bombesin). Some small granule cells appear to be inner- vated. The function of these cells is not well understood. Some are present in groups in association with nerve fibers, forming neuroepithelial bodies, which are thought to func- tion in reflexes regulating the airway or vascular caliber. • Basal cells serve as a reserve cell population that main- tains individual cell replacement in the epithelium. Basal cells tend to be prominent because their nuclei form a row in close proximity to the basal lamina. Although nuclei of other cells reside at this same general level within the ep- ithelium, they are relatively sparse. Thus, most of the nu- clei near the basement membrane belong to basal cells. Basement Membrane and Lamina Propria A thick “basement membrane” is characteristic of tracheal epithelium. Located beneath the tracheal epithelium is a distinctive layer typically referred to as a basement membrane (see Fig. 19.9). It usually appears as a glassy or homogeneous light-staining layer approximately 25 to 40 \u0003m thick. Elec- tron microscopy reveals that it consists of densely packed col- lagenous fibers that lie immediately under the epithelial basal lamina. Structurally, it can be regarded as an unusually thick and dense reticular lamina and, as such, is part of the lamina propria. In smokers, particularly those who experience chronic coughing, this layer may be considerably thicker, a re- sponse to mucosal irritation. The lamina propria, excluding that part just designated as basement membrane, appears as a typical loose connective tissue. It is very cellular, containing numerous lymphocytes, many of which infiltrate the epithelium. Plasma cells, mast cells, eosinophils, and fibroblasts are the other cell types read- ily observed in this layer. Lymphatic tissue, in both diffuse and nodular forms, is consistently present in the lamina pro- pria and submucosa of the tracheal wall. It is also present in other parts of the respiratory system involved primarily with air conduction. This lymphatic tissue is the developmental and functional equivalent of the bronchus-associated lymphatic tissue (BALT). ab esophagus trachea cartilage bone tissue cartilage bone tissue marrow bone tissue cartilage cartilage mucosa submucosa ab esophagus trachea cartilage bone tissue cartilage bone tissue marrow bone tissue cartilage cartilage mucosa submucosa ab esophagus trachea cartilage bone tissue cartilage bone tissue marrow bone tissue cartilage cartilage mucosa submucosa ab esophagus trachea cartilage bone tissue cartilage bone tissue marrow bone tissue cartilage cartilage mucosa submucosa ab esophagus trachea cartilage bone tissue cartilage bone tissue marrow bone tissue cartilage cartilage mucosa submucosa fibroelastic membrane FIGURE 19.6 • Photomicrograph of a section of the trachea and esophagus. a.

(Courtesy of Dr. Johannes A. G. Rhodin.) The boundary between mucosa and submucosa is defined by an elastic membrane. Interspersed among the collagenous fibers are numerous elastic fibers. Where the lamina propria ends, the elastic material is more extensive, and in specimens stained for these fibers, a dis- tinct band of elastic material is seen. This band or elastic membrane marks the boundary between the lamina propria and submucosa. In H&E preparations, however, the boundary is not obvious. The submucosa is unlike that of most other organs, in which this connective tissue typically has a dense character. In the trachea, the submucosa is a relatively loose connective tis- sue similar in appearance to the lamina propria, which makes it difficult to determine where it begins. Diffuse lymphatic tis- sue and lymphatic nodules characteristically extend into this layer from the lamina propria. The submucosa contains the larger distributing vessels and lymphatics of the tracheal wall. Submucosal glands composed of mucus-secreting acini with serous demilunes are also present in the submucosa. Their ducts consist of a simple cuboidal epithelium and ex- tend through the lamina propria to deliver their product, largely glycoproteins, on the epithelial surface. The glands are 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 674chapter 19Respiratory System\u0003TRACHEA 675 675 G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G FIGURE 19.8 • Scanning electron micrograph of the luminal surface of a bronchus.

Three major cell types are evident in the tracheal epithelium (Ep): ciliated columnar cells; mucus-secreting goblet cells (G) interspersed between the ciliated cells; and basal cells, which are close to the basement membrane (BM ). The ciliated columnar cells extend from the basement membrane to the surface. At their free surface they contain numerous cilia that, together, give the surface a brushlike appearance. At the base of the cilia is a dense eosinophilic line. This is owing to the linear aggregation of structures referred to as basal bodies, located at the proximal end of each cilium.

Some penetrate the muscle layer at this site and, therefore, also lie in the adventitia. The submucosal layer ends where its connective tissue fibers blend with the perichondrium of the cartilage layer. The tracheal cartilages and trachealis muscle separate submucosa from adventitia. The tracheal cartilages, which number about 16 to 20 in hu- mans, represent the next layer of the tracheal wall. As noted, the cartilages are C shaped. They sometimes anastomose with adjacent cartilages, but their arrangement provides flexibility to the tracheal pipe and also maintains patency of the lumen. With age, the hyaline cartilage may be partially replaced by bone tis- sue (see Fig. 19.6), causing it to lose much of its flexibility. The adventitia, the outer layer, lies peripheral to the carti- lage rings and trachealis muscle. It binds the trachea to adjacent 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 675 676 glycogen blunt microvilli mitochondria surface-active agent Golgi apparatus lysosome basement membrane brush cell Clara cell ciliated cell junctional complex nerve terminal rER small granule cell FIGURE 19.10 • Diagram of a brush cell and small granule cell. a.

A nerve terminal is shown within the epithelium adjacent to the cell. structures in the neck and mediastinum and contains the largest blood vessels and nerves that supply the tracheal wall, as well as the larger lymphatics that drain the wall. \u0002 BRONCHI The trachea divides into two branches forming the main (primary) bronchi. Anatomically, these divisions are more frequently described as simply the right and left main bronchi, terms that are more useful because of the physical difference between the two. The right bronchus is wider and significantly shorter than the left. On entering the hilum of the lung, each main bronchus divides into the lobar bronchi (secondary bronchi). The left lung is divided into two lobes; the right lung is divided into three lobes. Thus, the right bronchus divides into three lobar bronchial branches, and the left into two lobar bronchial branches, with each branch supplying one lobe. The left lung is fur- ther divided into 8 bronchopulmonary segments and the right lung into 10 such segments. Thus, in the right lung the lobar bronchi give rise to 10 segmental bronchi (tertiary bronchi); the lobar bronchi of the left lung give rise to 8 segmental bronchi. A segmental bronchus and the lung parenchyma that it supplies constitute a bronchopulmonary segment. The signif- icance of the bronchopulmonary segment in the human lung becomes apparent when considering the need for surgical resection, which may be required in certain disease states. The segments, each with their own blood supply and con- nective tissue septa, are convenient subunits that facilitate surgical resection. Initially, the bronchi have the same general histologic structure as the trachea. At the point where the bronchi enter the lungs to become intrapulmonary bronchi, the structure of the bronchial wall changes. The cartilage rings are replaced by cartilage plates of irregular shape. The plates are distributed in a linear array around the entire circumference of the wall, giv- ing the bronchi a circular or cylindrical shape in contrast to the ovoid shape with a flattened posterior wall of the trachea. As the bronchi decrease in size because of branching, the car- tilage plates become smaller and less numerous. The plates ultimately disappear at the point where the airway reaches a diameter of about 1 mm, whereupon the branch is designated a bronchiole. Bronchi can be identified by their cartilage plates and a circular layer of smooth muscle. The second change observed in the wall of the intrapulmonary bronchus is the addition of smooth muscle to form a com- plete circumferential layer. The smooth muscle becomes an in- creasingly conspicuous layer as the amount of cartilage diminishes. Initially, the smooth muscle is arranged in interlac- ing bundles forming a continuous layer. In the smaller bronchi, the smooth muscle may appear discontinuous. 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 676chapter 19Respiratory System\u0003BRONCHIOLES 677 677 Because the smooth muscle forms a separate layer, namely, a muscularis, the wall of the bronchus can be regarded as hav- ing five layers: • Mucosa, composed of a pseudostratified epithelium with the same cellular composition as the trachea. The height of the cells decreases as the bronchi decrease in diameter. In H&E specimens the “basement membrane” is conspicuous in the primary bronchi but quickly diminishes in thickness and disappears as a discrete structure in the secondary bronchi. The lamina propria is similar to that of the trachea but is reduced in amount in proportion to the diameter of the bronchi. • Muscularis, a continuous layer of smooth muscle in the larger bronchi. It is more attenuated and loosely organized in smaller bronchi, where it may appear discontinuous be- cause of its spiral course. Contraction of the muscle regu- lates the appropriate diameter of the airway. • Submucosa remains as a relatively loose connective tissue. Glands are present as well as adipose tissue in the larger bronchi. • Cartilage layer consists of discontinuous cartilage plates that become smaller as the bronchial diameter diminishes. • Adventitia is moderately dense connective tissue that is con- tinuous with that of adjacent structures, such as pulmonary artery and lung parenchyma. \u0002 BRONCHIOLES The bronchopulmonary segments are further subdi- vided into pulmonary lobules; each lobule is supplied by a bronchiole. Delicate connective tissue septa that partially separate adjacent lobules may be represented on the surface of the lung as faintly outlined polygonal areas. Pulmonary acini are smaller units of structure that make up the lobules. Each acinus consists of a terminal bronchiole and the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli that it aerates (Fig. 19.11). The smallest functional unit of pulmonary structure is thus the respiratory bronchiolar unit. It consists of a single respiratory bronchiole and the alveoli that it supplies. Bronchiolar Structure Bronchioles are air-conducting ducts that measure 1 mm or less in diameter. The larger bronchioles represent branches of the segmental bronchi. These ducts branch repeatedly, giving rise to the smaller terminal bronchioles that also branch. The terminal bronchioles finally give rise to the respiratory bronchioles. Cartilage plates and glands are not present in bronchioles. The larger-diameter bronchioles initially have a ciliated, pseudostratified columnar epithelium that gradually trans- forms into a simple ciliated columnar epithelium as the duct narrows. Goblet cells are still present in the largest bronchi- oles but are not present in the terminal bronchioles that follow. An exception is in smokers and others exposed to ir- ritants in the air. There are no subepithelial glands in bronchioles. Cartilage plates, characteristic of bronchi, are absent in bronchioles. Instead, small elements of cartilage may be present, particularly at branching points. A rela- tively thick layer of smooth muscle is present in the wall of all bronchioles. Small bronchioles have a simple cuboidal epithelium. The smallest conducting bronchioles, the terminal bronchioles, are lined with a simple cuboidal epithelium in which Clara cells are interspersed among the ciliated cells (Fig. 19.12). Clara cells increase in number as the ciliated cells decrease along the length of the bronchiole. Occasional brush cells and small granule cells are also present. A small amount of con- nective tissue underlies the epithelium, and a circumferential layer of smooth muscle underlies the connective tissue in the conducting portions. Clara cells are nonciliated cells that have a characteristic rounded or dome-shaped apical surface projection. They display TEM characteristics of protein-secreting cells TB RB RB AD AS FIGURE 19.11 • Photomicrograph showing the respiratory portion of the bronchial tree. In this photomicrograph a terminal bronchiole (TB) is shown longitudinally sectioned as it branches into two respiratory bronchioles (RB). The terminal bronchiole is the most distal part of the conducting portion of the respiratory system and is not engaged in gas exchange. The respiratory bronchiole engages in gas exchange and is the beginning of the respiratory portion of the bronchial tree. Respiratory bronchioles give rise to alveolar ducts (AD), which are elongate airways that have almost no walls, only alveoli surrounding the duct space. Alveolar sacs (AS) are spaces at the termination of the alveolar ducts that, likewise, are surrounded by alveoli. \u0002120. 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 677 678 (Fig. 19.13). They have a well-developed basal rER, a lateral or supranuclear Golgi apparatus, secretory granules that stain for protein, and numerous cisternae of sER in the api- cal cytoplasm. Clara cells secrete a surface-active agent, a lipoprotein that prevents luminal adhesion should the wall of the airway collapse on itself, particularly during expira- tion. In addition, Clara cells produce a 16-kilodalton pro- tein known as Clara cell secretory protein (CC16), which is an abundant component of the airway secretion. Chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pul- monary disease (COPD) and asthma are associated with changes in the abundance of CC16 in airway ﬂuid and serum. CC16 is used as a measurable pulmonary marker in bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid and serum. Secretion of CC16 into the bronchial tree decreases during lung injury (be- cause of damage to the Clara cells), whereas serum levels of CC16 may increase because of leakage across the air–blood barrier. Bronchiolar Function Respiratory bronchioles are the first part of the bronchial tree that allows gas exchange. Respiratory bronchioles constitute a transitional zone in the respiratory system; they are involved in both air conduc- tion and gas exchange. They have a narrow diameter and are lined by cuboidal epithelium. The epithelium of the initial segments of the respiratory bronchioles contains both ciliated cells and Clara cells (see Fig. 19.12). Distally, Clara cells pre- dominate. Occasional brush cells and dense-core granule cells are also present along the length of the respiratory bronchiole. Scattered, thin-walled outpocketings, alveoli, extend from the lumen of the respiratory bronchioles (see Fig. 19.11). Alveoli are the sites at which air leaves and enters the bron - chiole to allow gas exchange. \u0002 ALVEOLI Alveoli are the site of gas exchange. The surface area available for gas exchange is increased by the lung alveoli. Alveoli are the terminal air spaces of the respi- ratory system and are the actual sites of gas exchange be- tween the air and the blood. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of capillaries that brings blood into close proxim- ity to inhaled air inside the alveolus. About 150 to 250 mil- lion alveoli are found in each adult lung; their combined internal surface area is approximately 75 m2, roughly the size of a tennis court. Each alveolus is a thin-walled polyhedral FIGURE 19.12 • Scanning electron micrograph of a terminal bronchiole.

Rings of smooth muscle are present in the knoblike interalveolar septa (see the next paragraph). • Alveolar sacs are spaces surrounded by clusters of alveoli. The surrounding alveoli open into these spaces. Alveolar sacs usually occur at the termination of an alveo- lar duct but may occur anywhere along its length. Alveoli are surrounded and separated from one another by an exceed- ingly thin connective tissue layer that contains blood capillar- ies. The tissue between adjacent alveolar air spaces is called the alveolar septum or septal wall (Fig. 19.15). Alveolar epithelium is composed of type I and II alveolar cells and occasional brush cells. The alveolar surface forms a vulnerable biologic interface that is subject to many destabilizing surface forces and to con- tinuous exposure to inhaled particles, pathogens, and toxins. The alveolar epithelium is composed of several specialized cells and their products, some of which play defensive and protective roles: • Type I alveolar cells, also known as type I pneumocytes, comprise only 40% of the entire alveolar lining cells. They are extremely thin squamous cells; they line most (95%) of the surface of the alveoli (see Fig. 19.15). These cells are joined to one another and to the other cells of the alveolar epithelium by occluding junctions (Fig. 19.16). The junc- tions form an effective barrier between the air space and the components of the septal wall. Type I alveolar cells are not capable of cell division. • Type II alveolar cells, also called type II pneumocytes or septal cells, are secretory cells. These cuboidal cells are in- terspersed among the type I cells but tend to congregate at septal junctions. Type II cells account for 60% of the alveo- lar lining cells, but because of their different shape they cover only about 5% of the alveolar air surface. Like Clara cells, type II cells tend to bulge into the air space (see Fig. 19.16). Their apical cytoplasm is filled with granules that are resolved with the TEM (Fig. 19.17) as stacks of parallel membrane lamellae, the lamellar bodies. They are rich in a mixture of phospholipids, neutral lipids, and proteins, that is secreted by exocytosis to form an alveolar lining, surface-active agent called surfactant. In addition to secre- tion of surfactant, type II alveolar cells are progenitor cells for type I alveolar cells. After lung injury, they proliferate and restore both types of alveolar cells within the alveolus. Hyperplasia of type II alveolar cells is an important marker of alveolar injury and repair of alveoli. • Brush cells are also present in the alveolar wall, but they are few in number. They may serve as receptors that mon- itor air quality in the lung. Surfactant decreases the alveolar surface tension and actively participates in the clearance of foreign materials. The surfactant layer produced by type II alveolar cells reduces the surface tension at the air–epithelium interface. The most critical agent for air space stability is a specific phospholipid called dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), which accounts for almost all surface tension–reducing properties of surfactant. Surfactant synthesis in the fetus occurs after the 35th week of gestation and is modulated by a variety of hormones, including cortisol, insulin, prolactin, and thyroxine. Without adequate secretion of surfactant, the alveoli would collapse on each successive exhalation. Such collapse occurs in premature infants whose lungs have not developed sufﬁciently to pro- duce surfactant, causing neonatal respiratory distress syn- drome (RDS). Prophylactic administration of exogenous surfactant at birth to extremely premature infants and admin- istration to symptomatic newborns reduces the risk of RDS. In addition, administration of cortisol to mothers with threat- ened premature delivery decreases neonatal mortality. Surfactant proteins help organize the surfactant layer and modulate alveolar immune responses. In addition to phospholipids, hydrophobic proteins are nec- essary for the structure and function of surfactant. These pro- teins are listed here: • Surfactant protein A (SP-A), the most abundant surfac- tant protein. SP-A is responsible for surfactant homeostasis (regulating synthesis and secretion of surfactant by type II alveolar cells). It also modulates immune responses to viruses, bacteria, and fungi. FIGURE 19.14 • Photomicrograph showing an alveolar sac with adjacent alveoli. This photomicrograph shows the terminal components of the respiratory system, namely, the alveolar sac (AS) and the surrounding alveoli (A). The alveoli are surrounded and separated from one another by a thin connective tissue layer, the interalveolar septa, containing blood capillaries. On the right is the lung surface, which is covered by visceral pleura containing simple squamous epithelium and an underlying layer of connective tissue. \u0002360. A A A A AS 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 679 680 • Surfactant protein B (SP-B), an important protein for the transformation of the lamellar body into the thin surface film of surfactant. SP-B is a critical surfactant-organizing protein responsible for adsorption and spreading of surfac- tant onto the surface of the alveolar epithelium. • Surfactant protein C (SP-C), which represents only 1% of the total mass of surfactant protein. Along with SP-B, SP-C aids in orientation of DPPC within the surfactant and maintenance of the thin film layer within the alveoli. • Surfactant protein D (SP-D), a primary protein involved in host defense. It binds to various microorganisms (e.g., Gram-negative bacteria) and to lymphocytes. SP-D partic- ipates in a local inﬂammatory response to acute lung in- jury and with SP-A modulates an allergic response to various inhaled antigens. The alveolar septum is the site of the air–blood barrier. The air–blood barrier refers to the cells and cell products across which gases must diffuse between the alveolar and capillary compartments. The thinnest air–blood barrier con- sists of a thin layer of surfactant, a type I epithelial cell and its basal lamina, and a capillary endothelial cell and its basal lamina. Often, these two basal laminae are fused (Fig. 19.18). Connective tissue cells and fibers that may be present between the two basal laminae widen the air–blood barrier. These two arrangements produce a thin portion and a thick portion of the barrier (Fig. 19.19). It is thought that most gas exchange occurs across the thin portion of the bar- rier. The thick portion is thought to be a site in which tissue fluid can accumulate and even cross into the alveolus. Lym- phatic vessels in the connective tissue of the terminal bron- chioles drain fluid that accumulates in the thick portion of the septum. Alveolar macrophages remove inhaled particulate matter from the air spaces and red blood cells from the septum.

In air spaces, they scavenge the surface to remove inhaled particulate matter (e.g., dust and pollen), thus giving them one of their alternative names, dust cells. Alveolar macrophages are derived from blood monocytes and belong to the mononuclear phagocytotic sys- tem (see page 185). They phagocytize red blood cells that may enter the alveoli in heart failure (see Fig. 19.20). Some engorged macrophages pass up the bronchial tree in the mucus and are disposed of by swallowing or expectoration when they reach the pharynx. Other macrophages return to or remain in the septal connective tissue, where, filled with accumulated phagocytized material, they may remain for much of an individual’s life. Thus, at autopsy, the lungs of urban dwellers and smokers usually show many alveolar and septal macrophages ﬁlled with carbon particles, an- thracotic pigment, and birefringent needle-like particles of silica. Alveolar macrophages also phagocytose infectious organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can be recognized in the cells in appropriately stained speci- mens. These bacilli are not digested by macrophages, how- ever, other infections or conditions that damage alveolar macrophages can cause release of the bacteria and recurrent tuberculosis. Collateral air circulation through alveolar pores allows air to pass between alveoli. Scanning electron microscopic studies of alveolar structure show openings in the interalveolar septa that allow circula- tion of air from one alveolus to another. These alveolar pores (of Kohn) can be of great significance in some patho- logic conditions in which obstructive lung disease blocks the normal pathway of air to the alveoli. The alveoli distal to the blockage may continue to be aerated, via the pores, from an adjacent lobule or acinus. A basic summary of information related to the respiratory system is included in Figure 19.21. 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 681 682 bbbbb lamellar bodies fatty acids glucose choline amino acids surfactant discharged into lumen of alveolus type II alveolar cell type I alveolar cell a FIGURE 19.17 • Diagram of a type II alveolar cell and electron micrograph of lamellar bodies. a.

It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in a gene called the cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conduc- tance regulator (CFTR) located on chromosome 7. The product of this gene the Cl \u0002 channel protein is involved in final alteration of mucus and digestive secretions, sweat, and tears. All mutations of CFTR gene results in abnormal epithelial transport of Cl\u0005 that affects the viscosity of the secretion of the exocrine glands. Almost all exocrine glands secrete abnormally viscid mucus that obstructs the glands and their excretory ducts. The course of the disease is largely determined by the degree of pulmonary involvement. At birth, the lungs are normal. However, the defective Cl\u0005 channel protein in the bronchial epithelium causes decreased Cl\u0005 secretion and increased Na\u0004 and water reabsorption from the lumen (Fig. F19.2.1). As a result, the “mucociliary escala- tor” malfunctions, with consequent accumulation of an unusually thick, viscous mucous secretion. The pulmonary lesion is probably initiated by obstruction of the bronchi- oles. Bronchiolar obstruction blocks the airways and leads to thickening of the bronchiole walls and to other degenerative changes in the alveoli. Because fluids re- main trapped in the lungs, individuals with cystic fibrosis have frequent respiratory tract infections. The cloning of the CFTR gene could lead to the use of gene therapy in the near future. • FOLDER 19.2 Clinical Correlation: Cystic Fibrosis dehydrated viscous mucus defective Cl\u0002 channel normal mucus GOBLET CELL NORMAL ABSORPTIVE CELL ABSORPTIVE CELL IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+Cl\u0002 Cl\u0002 Cl\u0002 Cl\u0002 H2O H2O H2O H2Ochloride channel ATPase ATPase FIGURE F19.2.1 • Schematic diagram of pathology in cystic ﬁbrosis. In cystic fibrosis, secretion of Cl \u0005 anions into the lumen of the bronchial tree is markedly decreased because of a defective or nonexistent chloride channel protein. Na\u0004 resorption from the lumen of the bronchial tree is then increased, causing movement of water into the cell. As a result, the mucous layer within the bronchial tree becomes dehydrated and viscous. This thick mucus is difficult to move by the mucociliary escalator mechanism, and it clogs the lumen of the bronchial tree, obstructing airflow. 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 685 686 Emphysema is a condition of the lung characterized by permanent enlargement of the air spaces distal to the ter- minal bronchiole. This enlargement is caused by chronic obstruction of airflow, most often because of narrowing of the bronchioles, and is accompanied by destruction of the alveolar wall (Fig. F19.3.1). Thus, significant area for gas exchange is lost in this disease. Emphysema is relatively common; it is seen in about half of all autopsies and is eas- ily recognized. Pathologists identify several types of em- physema. The severity of the disease is clinically more important, however, than recognition of the specific type. Emphysema is often caused by chronic inhalations of foreign particulate material such as coal dust, textile fibers, and construction dust. The most common cause, however, is cigarette smoking. The destruction of the alveolar wall may be associated with excess lysis of elastin and other structural proteins in the alveolar septa. Elastase and other proteases are derived from lung neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes. A specific genetic disease, \u00031-antitrypsin deﬁciency, causes a particularly severe form of emphy- sema in both heterozygous and homozygous individuals and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is usually fatal in homozygotes if untreated, but its sever- ity can be reduced by supplying the enzyme inhibitor ex- ogenously. FIGURE F19.3.1 • Photomicrographs of emphysema and pneumonia. a. This photomicrograph from the lung of an individual with emphysema shows the partial destruction of interalveolar septa, resulting in permanent enlargement of the air spaces. Note that the changes in the lung parenchyma are accompanied by thickening of the wall of the pulmonary vessels (arrows) and the presence of numerous cells within the air spaces.

This photomicrograph is from the lung of an individual in the early stages of acute pneumonia (inflammation of the lung). Note that the air spaces are filled with exudate containing white blood cells (mainly neutrophils), red blood cells, and fibrin. The capillaries in the alveolar septum are enlarged and congested with red blood cells. Pathologists recognize this stage as the red hepatization stage of the pneumonia. At this stage, the affected portion of the lung on gross examination appears red (because of enlarged capillaries), firm (because of the lack of air spaces), and heavy (because of the presence of exudate within the alveoli); the term hepatization stems from the tissue’s resemblance to the liver. \u0002240.

The pulmonary circulation supplies the capillaries of the alveolar septum and is derived from the pulmonary artery that leaves the right ventricle of the heart. The branches of the pulmonary artery travel with those of the bronchi and bron- chioles and carry blood down to the capillary level at the alve- oli. This blood is oxygenated and collected by pulmonary venous capillaries that join to form venules. They ultimately form the four pulmonary veins that return blood to the left atrium of the heart. The pulmonary venous system is located at a distance from the respiratory passages at the periphery of the bronchopulmonary segments. The bronchial circulation, via bronchial arteries that branch from the aorta, supplies all of the lung tissue other than the alveoli (i.e., the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles and the connective tissue of the lung other than that of the alveolar septum). The finest branches of the bronchial arterial tree also open into the pulmonary capillaries. Therefore, the bronchial and pulmonary circulations anastomose at about the level of the junction between the conducting and respira- tory passages. Bronchial veins drain only the connective tissue of the hilar region of the lungs. Most of the blood reaching the lungs via the bronchial arteries leaves the lungs via the pulmonary veins. \u0002 LYMPHATIC VESSELS A dual lymphatic drainage of the lungs parallels the dual blood supply. One set of lymphatic vessels drains the parenchyma of the lung and follows the air passages to the hilum. Lymph nodes are found along the route of the larger lymphatic vessels. A second set of lymphatic vessels drains the surface of the lung and travels in the connective tissue of the visceral pleura, a serous membrane consisting of a surface mesothelium and the underlying connective tissue. \u0002 NERVES Most of the nerves that serve the lung are not visible at the level of the light microscope. They are components of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system and mediate reflexes that modify the dimen- sions of the air passages (and blood vessels) by contraction of the smooth muscle in their walls. 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 687 Olfactory mucosa, nasal cavity, human, Azan ×75. This low-magnification orientation micrograph shows part of the wall of the nasal cavity. The olfactory mucosa (OM ) and adjacent ethmoid bone (EB ) are indicated. The olfactory mu- cosa is directly attached to the bone tissue; no submucosa is present. In this specimen, however, the mucosa is separated from the bone tissue because of shrinkage, a frequently encountered artifact. Olfactory mucosa, nasal cavity, human, Azan ×375. At this higher magnification, it is possible to distinguish in a general way the three principal cell types of the olfactory ep- ithelium on the basis of nuclear location and appearance, as well as by certain cytoplasmic characteristics. For example, the nuclei of the supporting cells (SC ) are relatively dense and are located closest to the epithelial surface. They are arranged in an almost discrete single layer. The supporting cell has a cylindrical shape and extends from the basement membrane through the full thickness of the epithelium. Immediately beneath this layer are the cell bodies of the olfactory recep- tor cells (OC ). They lie at different levels within the thickness of the ep- ithelium. Careful examination of the nuclei of these bipolar neuronal cells reveals that they contain more euchromatin than the nuclei of the support- ing cells and often exhibit several nucleoli. In this preparation, the nucleoli appear as small round red bodies. In some cases, particularly when there is shrinkage, the thin tapering dendritic process that extends to the olfactory surface may be observed. Similarly, an axonal process may sometimes be KEY A, artery AP, axonal process BC, basal cells BG, Bowman’s glands C, capillary EB, ethmoid bone ES, ethmoid sinus N, olfactory nerves OC, olfactory cells OEp, olfactory epithelium OM, olfactory mucosa REp, respiratory epithelium SC, supporting cell nuclei ScC, Schwann cell nuclei V, vein arrows, lumina of Bowman’s glands arrowhead, duct of a Bowman’s gland entering epitheliumPLATE 69 •OLFACTORY MUCOSA 688 observed extending basally. The basal cells (BC ), the least numerous of the principal cell types, are characterized by their small round nuclei and scant cytoplasm. They are irregularly spaced and lie in proximity to the basement membrane. Note that the olfactory mucosa in contrast to respi- ratory mucosa lacks goblet cells. The lamina propria contains numerous blood vessels (capillaries [C ], veins [V ]), lymphatics, olfactory nerves (N ), and olfactory (Bowman’s) glands (BG ). The Bowman’s glands are branched tubuloalveolar struc- tures. They exhibit a very small lumen (arrows). The duct elements extend from the secretory portion of the gland beginning in close proximity to the overlying epithelium (arrowhead) and pass directly through the epithelium to deliver their secretions at the surface. The ducts are very short, making it difficult to identify them. The very thin axonal processes (AP ) of the ol- factory cells are sometimes evident within the lamina propria prior to being ensheathed by Schwann cells to form the prominent olfactory nerves. The nuclei present within the olfactory nerves represent Schwann cell nuclei (ScC ). The olfactory epithelium (OEp) is pseudostratified, like respiratory epithe- lium; however, it is typically thicker. Note the respiratory epithelium (REp) included in the lower right of the micrograph. The feature that is most useful in identifying olfactory mucosa is the presence of numerous large, unmyelinated nerves (N ) and extensive olfactory (Bowman’s) glands (BG) in the connective tissue of the mucosa. Note that the adjacent respiratory mucosa lacks the nerves and exhibits a relative paucity of glands. \u0003 PLATE 69 Olfactory Mucosa Olfactory mucosa is located in the roof and part of the walls of the nasal cavity. Its pseudostratified epithelium is thicker than that of nonsen- sory epithelium, and it serves as the receptor for smell. Olfactory epithelium consists of olfactory cells, supporting (sustentacular) cells, basal cells, and brush cells. Olfactory cells are bipolar neurons. The apex of the cell is expanded into the olfactory vesicle from which nonmotile cilia, the actual recep- tors, extend into surface secretions. The base of the cell tapers into an axonal process that enters the lamina propria and joins axons from other receptor cells to form the olfactory nerve. Large, cuboidal Schwann cells are a prominent feature of these axons, giving the nerve an un- usual appearance. Supporting cells are columnar cells with apical microvilli. They attach to the receptor cells through adhering junctions and provide me- chanical and metabolic support to the olfactory cells. Basal cells are stem cells from which olfactory and supporting cells differentiate. Brush cells are the same cell type that occurs in nonsensory respiratory epithelium. The lamina propria is directly contiguous with periosteum. It contains numerous blood and lymphatic vessels, unmyelinated and myelinated nerves, and olfactory (Bowman’s) glands. These are tubuloalveolar serous glands whose watery secretion serves as a trap and solvent for odorant substances and continuously washes the olfactory surface. 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:46 PM Page 688PLATE 69 •OLFACTORY MUCOSA 689 VV ScCScC V BCBC OCOC SCSC REpREp OMOM BGBG OEpOEp EBEB NN EB NN EBEBEB EBEBEB OEp BG BGBGBG BGBGBG BGBGBG OM NN NN NN NN NN NN A REp ES SC SCSCSC OC C C BC BCBCBC C AP V V V ScC 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:47 PM Page 689 Larynx, monkey, H&E ×15.

In frontal sec- tions, the vocal folds (VF ) are cross-sectioned, giving the ap- pearance seen here. The two vocal folds and the space between them constitute the glottis.

Epithelium of the infraglottic cavity of the larynx just below the portion shown in top figure changes again, giving way, below, to the ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithe- lium (PSE) shown here. Note the cylinders of cytoplasm that clearly indicate the columnar nature of the surface cells. In the upper part of the figure, the epithelium is stratified columnar; in the lower part of the figure, it is pseudostratified columnar. This distinction is difficult to make from the examination of a single sample such as that shown here, and other information is needed to make the assessment. The additional in- formation is the presence of cilia on the pseudostratified columnar epithe- lium; this epithelium is typically ciliated. Although not evident in the photomicrographs, note that stratified columnar epithelium has a very lim- ited distribution, usually occurring between stratified squamous epithelium and some other epithelial types (e.g., pseudostratified columnar here or sim- ple columnar at the anorectal junction, Plate 64). The lamina propria is a loose cellular connective tissue, and it also shows some glands (Gl ).PLATE 70 •LARYNX 690 the contact between surfaces is considerable.

Small glands (Gl) are in the lamina propria of the laryngeal mucosa. ridge called the ventricular fold (VnF ) or, sometimes, the false vocal fold. Below and lateral to the vocal folds are the vocalis muscles (VM ). Within the vocal fold is a considerable amount of elastic material, although it is usu- ally not evident in routine H&E preparations. This elastic material is part of the vocal ligament. It lies in an anteroposterior direction within the sub- stance of the vocal fold and plays an important role in phonation. \u0003 PLATE 70 Larynx The larynx is the passageway for air between the oropharynx and the trachea that functions in the production of sound. It consists of a carti- laginous framework to which both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles are attached and a mucosal surface that varies in character from pseudos- tratified to stratified squamous in regions subject to abrasion by the air stream. The muscles move certain cartilages with respect to others, thus increasing or decreasing the opening of the rima glottis and increasing or decreasing the tension on the vocal folds (cords). In this way, vibrations of different wavelengths are generated in the passing air, and sound is produced. 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:47 PM Page 690 PSEPSEGIGI SCESCE SSESSE 1 VMVM VnF V VF 1 VM VMVMVM 2 SSE GI SCE GI SCESCESCE SSESSESSE GIGIGI GIGIGI PSEPLATE 70 •LARYNX 691 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:47 PM Page 691 Trachea, human, H&E ×250; inset ×500.

However, the basement membrane (Bm) is clear, as are the cellular lamina propria (LP ) and the submucosa (SM ) of the tra- chea. Again, seromucous glands (Gl ) are evident beneath the submucosa. The ends of the bundles of the trachealis muscle (TM ) are located toward the posterior midline from the glands. A small lymphatic nodule (LN ) is lo- cated adjacent to the end of one of the bundles. A significant amount of adi- pose tissue (Ad ) is found in the connective tissue between the trachealis muscle and the wall of the esophagus (not shown in this figure). Trachea, human, H&E ×90. This low-magnification micrograph of the posterior wall of the human trachea shows the pseudostratified ciliated colum- nar epithelium (EP ) subtended by a well-developed base- ment membrane (Bm). The basement membrane, which consists of tightly packed, fine collagen fibers, is actually an unusually thick and dense reticular layer and is, thus, part of the lamina pro- pria. It is particularly distinct in the human trachea and may thicken with chronic irritation, as in smokers. Numerous goblet cells (GC ) are evident as clear ovoid spaces in the respiratory epithelium. A thin lamina propria (LP ) and a dense thick submucosa (SM ) underlie the respiratory epithe- lium. Seromucous glands (Gl ) are seen on both sides of the trachealis muscle (TM), a band of smooth muscle that fills the gap between the pos- terior ends of the C-shaped tracheal cartilages (not shown) and serves to sep- arate the trachea from the esophagus. Adipose tissue (Ad ) is also present in the submucosa between the esophagus and trachea. \u0003 PLATE 71 Trachea The trachea is a short tube about 2.5 cm in diameter and about 10 cm long. It extends from the larynx to about the middle of the thorax, where it divides into the two main bronchi (primary bronchi). Its major function is to serve as a conduit for air. The lumen of the trachea is held open by a series of C-shaped hyaline cartilages that are stacked on one another to form a supporting structure. Fibroelastic tissue and smooth muscle (the trachealis muscle) bridge the gap between the free ends of the cartilages at the posterior border of the trachea, adja- cent to the esophagus. Typical respiratory (ciliated pseudostratified columnar) epithelium lines the trachea and primary bronchi. On entering the lungs, the primary bronchi branch immediately to give rise to the lobar bronchi (secondary bronchi) that supply the two lobes of the left lung and the three lobes of the right lung. Within the lung, the C-shaped cartilages are replaced by an investment of (some- times overlapping) cartilaginous plates that completely surround the bronchi. and the density of the basement membrane (Bm) are more easily seen here than in the lower-magnification views in the other figures. A venule (V ) containing red cell ghosts is seen in the middle of the submucosa, and some inflammatory cells (IC ), probably lymphocytes, are seen adjacent to the vein as well as distributed lightly through the submucosa and more densely in the lamina propria. Portions of the seromucous glands (Gl ) are just visible at the bottom edge of the figure. 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:47 PM Page 692 VV ICIC TCTC AdAd LNLN N CBBBB EPEP SMSM LPLP TMTM AdAd GlGl BmBm GCGC EP GC Gl Bm LP SM TM Ad GlGlGl GCGCGC BmBmBm EP LPLPLP BmBmBm SMSMSM GlGlGl TMTMTM GCGCGC BmBmBm GlGlGl EP BB C N LN Ad TC BBBBBB EPEPEP NN IC V ICICIC GlGlGl CCPLATE 71 •TRACHEA 693 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:47 PM Page 693 Bronchiole, lungs, human, H&E ×75. A typical bronchiole is shown here. Characteristically, blood vessels (BV ) are adjacent to the bronchiole. The main features of the bronchiolar wall that are evident in the figure are bun- dles of smooth muscle (SM ) and the lining epithelium (shown at higher magnification in Plate 73).

In this figure, a short length of a bronchiole (B ) is shown lon- gitudinally sectioned as it branches into two respiratory bronchioles (RB ). The last portion of a bronchiole that leads into respiratory bronchioles is called a terminal bronchiole. It is not engaged in exchange of air with the blood; the respiratory bronchiole does engage in air exchange. Arrows mark the place where the terminal bron- chiole ends. Not uncommonly, as shown here, cartilage (C ) is found in the bronchiolar wall where branching occurs. Blood vessels (BV ) and a nodule of lymphocytes (L) are adjacent to the bronchiole. The respiratory bronchiole has a wall composed of two components: One consists of recesses that have a wall similar to that of the alveoli and are thus capable of gas exchange; the other has a wall formed by small cuboidal cells that appear to rest on a small bundle of eosinophilic material. This is smooth muscle surrounded by a thin investment of connective tissue. Both of these components are shown at higher magnification in Plate 73. mal and, at this low magnification, not conspicuous. Nevertheless, it is pre- sent and separates the muscle into bundles (i.e., the muscle layer is not a sin- gle continuous layer). The connective tissue contains collagenous and some elastic fibers. Glands are not present in the wall of the bronchiole. Sur- rounding the bronchiole, comprising most of the lung substance, are the air spaces or alveoli of the lung. \u0003 PLATE 72 Bronchioles and End Respiratory Passages The primary bronchus that enters each lung divides into smaller secondary and tertiary bronchi. As the bronchi become smaller, some compo- nents of the wall are lost or reduced in amount. Ultimately, the respiratory passage has distinctly different features than those of a bronchus, and it is called a bronchiole. The features that characterize the bronchiole are the absence of cartilage, loss of submucosal glands, and grad- ual disappearance of goblet cells. The epithelium changes from pseudostratified columnar to simple ciliated columnar, and some columnar cells even lack cilia. Smooth muscle occupies a relatively larger portion of the bronchiolar wall than of the bronchial wall. The smallest diameter conducting bronchioles, the terminal bronchioles, are lined with simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium in which Clara cells, cells that secrete a surface-active agent that prevents luminal adhesion of bronchiolar walls during expiration, are found among the cili- ated cells. Respiratory bronchioles are the first part of the bronchial tree that allows gas exchange to occur. Respiratory bronchioles consti- tute a transition zone in which both air conduction and gas exchange occur. Scattered, thin-walled evaginations of the lumen of the respiratory bronchiole are called alveoli; these are the structures in which gas exchange between the air passages and the blood capillaries occurs. The outer surface of lung tissue is the serosa (S); it consists of a lining of mesothelial cells resting on a small amount of connective tissue. This is the layer that gross anatomists refer to as the visceral pleura. 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:47 PM Page 694 L C BVBVBV SM SM BVBVBV AD AS AS AS C LB RB RB S C BPLATE 72 •BRONCHIOLES AND END RESPIRATORY PASSAGES 695 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:47 PM Page 695 Respiratory bronchiole, lungs, human, H&E ×550.

The central component of the alveolar wall is the capillary (C) and, in certain locations, associated connective tissue. On each side, where it faces the alveolus (A), a flat squamous cell is in- terposed between the capillary and the air spaces. This is a pneumocyte type I cell. In some places, the type I cell is sep- arated from the capillary endothelial cell by a single basal lamina shared by the two cells. This is the thin portion of the alveolar-capillary complex, readily seen in the upper part of the figure (arrows). Gas exchange occurs through the thin portion of the alveolar-capillary complex. Elsewhere, connective tissue is interposed between the pneumocyte type I cell and the endothelial cell of the capillary; each of these epithelial cells retains its own basal lamina. A second cell type, the pneumocyte type II cell or septal cell (SC), also lines the alveolar air space. This cell typically displays a rounded (rather than flattened) shape, and the nucleus is surrounded by a noticeable amount of cytoplasm, some of which may appear clear. The septal cell pro- duces a surface-active agent different from that of the Clara cell, which also acts in permitting the lung to expand.PLATE 73 •BRONCHIOLES AND ALVEOLUS 696 thin regions. The thick regions are similar to the wall of the bronchiole except that cuboidal Clara cells instead of columnar epithelium form the surface. Thus, as seen here, Clara cells (CC) are the surface-lining cells of the thick regions, and smooth muscle bundles (SM) are under the Clara cells, with a small amount of intervening connective tissue. The thin re- gions have a wall similar to the alveolar wall; this is considered below. fore it becomes a respiratory bronchiole, the epithelium may include cuboidal or low columnar nonciliated cells. These nonciliated cells are Clara cells (CC, beyond the diamond). Clara cells produce a surface-active agent that is instrumental in expansion of the lungs. The smooth muscle (SM) in the bronchiolar wall is organized in bundles; other cells under the epithe- lium and around the smooth muscle belong to the connective tissue. \u0003 PLATE 73 Terminal Bronchiole, Respiratory Bronchiole, and Alveolus Respiratory bronchioles continue to divide to form alveolar ducts, passages lined solely with rows of alveoli that have rings of smooth muscle in knob-like interalveolar septa. The alveolar ducts terminate in alveolar sacs, enlarged spaces surrounded by clusters of alveoli that open into the spaces. The alveoli are lined with type I alveolar cells, extremely thin squamous cells that cover about 95% of the alveolar surface, and with type II alveolar cells, cuboidal cells that secrete surfactant, a surface-active agent that reduces surface tension at the air-epithelium surface. The tissue between adjacent alveoli is called the alveolar septum. This consists of the alveolar epithelial cells and their basal lamina, the basal lamina of the underlying capillary endothelium and the endothelial cells, themselves, and any other connective tissue elements that may lie between the two basal laminae. The alveolar septum is the site of the air-blood barrier. Structurally, it shows essentially the same features as those seen in upper right figure except that there are fewer Clara cells and the smooth muscle is somewhat thinner. 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:47 PM Page 696 SMSM PsEpPsEpPsEp SM CC CC SMSMSM SMSMSM SMSMSM V V A A A A A A A A A A C C SCPLATE 73 •BRONCHIOLES AND ALVEOLUS 697 72006_ch19 15/07/10 3:47 PM Page 697 chapter 20 electrolytes, and metabolites, and they remove certain waste products of metabolism from the body.

They conserve water, essential 698 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 698 699 Despite its name, vitamin D is actually an inactive precursor that undergoes a series of transformations to become the fully active hormone that regulates plasma calcium levels. In the human body vitamin D is derived from two sources: • Skin, in which vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is rapidly produced by the action of ultraviolet light on the precur- sor 7-dehydrocholesterol. The skin is the major source of vitamin D3, especially in regions where food is not supple- mented with vitamin D. Typically, 30 minutes to 2 hours of sunlight exposure per day can provide enough vitamin D to fulfill daily body requirements for this vitamin. • Diet, from which vitamin D3 is absorbed by the small intestine in association with chylomicrons. In the blood vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D–binding protein and transported to the liver. The first transforma- tion occurs in the liver and involves hydroxylation of vitamin D3 to form 25-OH vitamin D3. This compound is released into the bloodstream and undergoes a second hydroxyla- tion in the proximal tubules of the kidney to produce the highly active 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 (calcitriol). The pro- cess is regulated indirectly by an increase in plasma Ca2\u0002 concentration, which triggers secretion of PTH, or directly by a decrease in circulating phosphates, which in turn stim- ulates activity of 1 \u0003-hydroxylase responsible for conver- sion of 25-OH vitamin D3 into active 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3. Active 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 stimulates intestinal absorption of Ca 2\u0002 and phosphate and mobilization of Ca2\u0002 from bones. It is therefore necessary for normal development and growth of bones and teeth. The related compound vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) undergoes the same conversion steps as vitamin D3 and produces the same biologic effects. Patients with end-stage chronic kidney diseases have inadequate conversion of vitamin D into active metabolites resulting in vitamin D3 deficiency. In adults, vitamin D3 defi- ciency is manifested by impaired bone mineralization and reduced bone density. Therefore, patients with chronic kidney diseases, especially those on prolonged renal hemodialysis are often supplemented with vitamin D3 and calcium to avoid severe disturbance of calcium homeostasis because of sec- ondary hyperparathyroidism, a condition prevalent in these patients. Vitamin D3 deficiency in childhood results in rickets, a disease that causes abnormal bone ossification. • FOLDER 20.1 Functional Considerations: Kidney and Vitamin D and specific secretion by the cells of the kidney. The final urine is conveyed by the ureters to the urinary bladder, where it is stored until discharged via the urethra. The final urine contains water and electrolytes as well as waste products, such as urea, uric acid, and creatinine, and breakdown products of various substances. The kidney also functions as an endocrine organ. Endocrine activities of the kidneys include • Synthesis and secretion of the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (EPO), which acts on the bone marrow and regulates red blood cell formation in response to de- creased blood oxygen concentration. EPO is synthesized by endothelial cells of the peritubular capillaries in the renal cortex and acts on specific receptors expressed on the surface of erythrocyte progenitor (Er-P) cells in the bone marrow. The recombinant form of erythropoietin (RhEPO) is used for the treatment of anemia in patients with end-stage renal disease. It is also used to treat anemia resulting from bone marrow suppression that develops in AIDS patients undergoing treatment with antiretroviral drugs, such as azidothymidine (AZT). • Synthesis and secretion of the acid protease renin, an enzyme involved in control of blood pressure and blood volume. Renin is produced by juxtaglomerular cells and cleaves circu- lating angiotensinogen to release angiotensin I (see page 713). • Hydroxylation of 25-OH vitamin D3, a steroid precursor produced in the liver, to hormonally active 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3. This step is regulated primarily by parathyroid hormone (PTH), which stimulates activity of the enzyme 1\u0003-hydroxylase and increases the production of the active hormone (see Folder 20.1). \u0002 GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE KIDNEY The kidneys are large, reddish, bean-shaped organs located on either side of the spinal column in the retroperitoneal space of the posterior abdominal cavity. They extend from the 12th thoracic to the 3rd lumbar vertebrae, with the right kid- ney positioned slightly lower. Each kidney measures approxi- mately 10 cm long \u0004 6.5 cm wide (from concave to convex border) \u0004 3 cm thick. On the upper pole of each kidney, embedded within the renal fascia and a thick protective layer of perirenal adipose tissue, lies an adrenal gland. The medial border of the kidney is concave and contains a deep vertical fissure, called the hilum, through which the renal vessels and nerves pass and the expanded, funnel-shaped origin of the ureter, called the renal pelvis, exits. A section through the kidney shows the relationship of these structures as they lie just within the hilum of the kidney in a space called the renal sinus (Fig. 20.1). Although not shown in the illustra- tion, the space between and around these structures is filled largely with loose connective tissue and adipose tissue. Capsule The kidney surface is covered by a connective tissue capsule. The capsule consists of two distinct layers: an outer layer of fibroblasts and collagen fibers, and an inner layer with a cellular component of myofibroblasts (Fig. 20.2). The contractility ofchapter 20Urinary System\u0003GENERAL STRUCTURE OFTHEKIDNEY 699 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 699 the myofibroblasts may aid in resisting volume and pressure variations that can accompany variations in kidney function. Its specific role, however, is unknown. The capsule passes inward at the hilum, where it forms the connective tissue covering of the sinus and becomes continuous with the connective tissue form- ing the walls of the calyces and renal pelvis (see Fig. 20.1). Cortex and Medulla Examination with the naked eye of the cut face of a fresh, hemisected kidney reveals that its substance can be divided into two distinct regions: • Cortex, the outer reddish brown part • Medulla, the much lighter-colored inner part The color seen in the cut surface of the unfixed kidney reflects the distribution of blood in the organ. Approximately 90% to 95% of the blood passing through the kidney is in the cortex; 5% to 10% is in the medulla. The cortex is characterized by renal corpuscles and their associated tubules. The cortex consists of renal corpuscles along with the con- voluted tubules and straight tubules of the nephron, the collecting tubules, collecting ducts, and an extensive vascu- lar supply. The nephron is the basic functional unit of the kidney and is described in a following section. The renal cor- puscles are spherical structures, barely visible with the naked eye. They constitute the beginning segment of the nephron and contain a unique capillary network called a glomerulus. Examination of a section cut through the cortex at an angle perpendicular to the surface of the kidney reveals a series of vertical striations that appear to emanate from the medulla (see Fig 20.1). These striations are the medullary rays (of Ferrein). Their name reflects their appearance, as the striations seem to radiate from the medulla. Approximately 400 to 500 medullary rays project into the cortex from the medulla. Each medullary ray is an aggregation of straight tubules and collecting ducts. Each medullary ray contains straight tubules of the nephrons and collecting ducts. The regions between medullary rays contain the renal corpuscles, the convoluted tubules of the nephrons, and the collecting tubules. These areas are referred to as cortical labyrinths. Each nephron and its collecting tubule (which connects to a collecting duct in the medullary ray) form the uriniferous tubule. The medulla is characterized by straight tubules, collect- ing ducts, and a special capillary network, the vasa recta. The straight tubules of the nephrons and the collecting ducts continue from the cortex into the medulla. They are accompanied by a capillary network, the vasa recta, that runs in parallel with the various tubules.

This photomicrograph of a Mallory-Azan–stained section shows the capsule (cap) and part of the underlying cortex. The outer layer of the capsule (OLC) is composed of dense connective tissue. The fibroblasts in this part of the capsule are relatively few in number; their nuclei appear as narrow, elongate, red-staining profiles against a blue background representing the stained collagen fibers. The inner layer of the capsule (ILC) consists of large numbers of myofibroblasts whose nuclei appear as round or elongate, red- staining profiles, depending on their orientation within the section. Note that the collagen fibers in this layer are relatively sparse and that the myofibroblast nuclei are more abundant than those of the fibroblasts in the outer layer of the capsule. \u0004180. 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 700chapter 20Urinary System\u0003GENERAL STRUCTURE OFTHEKIDNEY 701 701 represent the vascular part of the countercurrent ex- change system that regulates the concentration of the urine. The tubules in the medulla, because of their arrange- ment and differences in length, collectively form a number of conical structures called pyramids. Usually 8 to 12 but as many as 18 pyramids may be present in the human kid- ney. The bases of the pyramids face the cortex, and the apices face the renal sinus. Each pyramid is divided into an outer medulla (adjacent to the cortex) and an inner medulla. The outer medulla is further subdivided into an inner stripe and an outer stripe. The zonation and stripes are readily recognized in a sagittal section through the pyra- mid of a fresh specimen. They reflect the location of distinct parts of the nephron at specific levels within the pyramid (Fig. 20.3). The renal columns represent cortical tissue contained within the medulla. The caps of cortical tissue that lie over the pyramids are suffi- ciently extensive that they extend peripherally around the lat- eral portion of the pyramid, forming the renal columns (of Bertin). Although renal columns contain the same compo- nents as the rest of the cortical tissue, they are regarded as part of the medulla. In effect, the amount of cortical tissue is so extensive that it “spills” over the side of the pyramid much as a large scoop of ice cream extends beyond and overlaps the sides of an ice cream cone. The apical portion of each pyramid, which is known as the papilla, projects into a minor calyx, a cup-shaped structure that represents an extension of the renal pelvis. The tip of the papilla, also known as the area cribrosa, is perforated by the openings of the collecting ducts (Fig. 20.4). The minor calyces are branches of the two or three major calyces that in turn are major divisions of the renal pelvis (see Fig. 20.1). Kidney Lobes and Lobules The number of lobes in a kidney equals the number of medullary pyramids. Each medullary pyramid and the associated cortical tissue at its base and sides (one half of each adjacent renal column) con- stitutes a lobe of the kidney. The lobar organization of the kid- ney is conspicuous in the developing fetal kidney (Fig. 20.5). Each lobe is reflected as a convexity on the outer surface of the organ, but they usually disappear after birth. The surface con- vexities typical of the fetal kidney may persist, however, until the teenage years and, in some cases, into adulthood. Each human kidney contains 8 to 18 lobes. Kidneys of some animals possess only one pyramid; these kidneys are classified as unilo- bar, in contrast to the multilobar kidney of the human. A lobule consists of a collecting duct and all the nephrons that it drains. The lobes of the kidney are further subdivided into lobules consisting of a central medullary ray and surrounding corti- cal material (Fig. 20.6 and Plate 75, page 730). Although the center or axis of a lobule is readily identifiable, the boundaries between adjacent lobules are not obviously de- marcated from one another by connective tissue septa. The concept of the lobule has an important physiologic basis; the medullary ray containing the collecting duct for a group of nephrons that drain into that duct constitutes the renal se- cretory unit. It is the equivalent of a glandular secretory unit or lobule. 22 11 8899 77 9*9* 88 11 1010 33 33 4466 66 1111 1212 55 44 outer stripe inner stripe cortex outer medulla inner medulla papilla capsule 1 1 3 3 4 5 6 6 7 8 8 9 9* 10 11 4 12 2 FIGURE 20.3 • Diagram of two types of nephrons in the kidney and their associated collecting duct systems.

The Nephron The nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. The nephron is the fundamental structural and functional unit of the kidney (see Fig. 20.3). Each human kidney contains approximately 2 million nephrons. Nephrons are responsible for the production of urine and correspond to the secretory part of other glands. The collecting ducts are responsible for the final concentration of the urine and are analogous to the ducts of exocrine glands that modify the concentration of the secretory product. Unlike the typical exocrine gland in which the secretory and duct portions arise from a single epithelial outgrowth, nephrons and their col- lecting tubules arise from separate primordia and only later become connected. General Organization of the Nephron The nephron consists of the renal corpuscle and a tubule system. As stated previously, the renal corpuscle represents the beginning of the nephron. It consists of the glomerulus, a tuft of capillaries composed of 10 to 20 capillary loops, sur- rounded by a double-layered epithelial cup, the renal or Bowman’s capsule. Bowman’s capsule is the initial portion of the nephron, where blood flowing through the glomerular capillaries undergoes filtration to produce the glomerular ultrafiltrate. The glomerular capillaries are supplied by an afferent arteriole and are drained by an efferent arteriole that then branches, forming a new cap- illary network to supply the kidney tubules. The site where the afferent and efferent arterioles penetrate and exit from the parietal layer of Bowman’s capsule is called the vascu- lar pole. Opposite this site is the urinary pole of the renal corpuscle, where the proximal convoluted tubule begins (see Fig. 20.7). Continuing from Bowman’s capsule, the remaining parts of the nephron (the tubular parts) are as follows: • Proximal thick segment, consisting of the proximal con- voluted tubule (pars convoluta) and the proximal straight tubule (pars recta) • Thin segment, which constitutes the thin part of the loop of Henle • Distal thick segment, consisting of the distal straight tubule (pars recta) and the distal convoluted tubule (pars convoluta) The distal convoluted tubule connects to the collecting tubule, often through a connecting tubule, thus forming the uriniferous tubule (i.e., the nephron plus collecting tubule; see Fig. 20.3). 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 702chapter 20Urinary System\u0003GENERAL STRUCTURE OFTHEKIDNEY 703 703 Tubes of the Nephron The tubular segments of the nephron are named according to the course that they take (convoluted or straight), loca- tion (proximal or distal), and wall thickness (thick or thin). Beginning from Bowman’s capsule, the sequential parts of the nephron consist of the following tubules: • Proximal convoluted tubule originates from the urinary pole of Bowman’s capsule. It follows a very tortuous or convoluted course and then enters the medullary ray to continue as the proximal straight tubule. • Proximal straight tubule, commonly referred to as the thick descending limb of the loop of Henle, descends into the medulla. • Thin descending limb is the continuation of the proxi- mal straight tubule within the medulla. It makes a hairpin turn and returns toward the cortex. • Thin ascending limb is the continuation of the thin de- scending limb after its hairpin turn. • Distal straight tubule, which is also referred to as the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, is the continuation of the thin ascending limb. The distal straight tubule ascends through the medulla and enters the cortex in the medullary ray to reach the vicinity of its renal corpuscle of origin. The distal straight tubule then leaves the medullary ray and makes contact with the vascular pole of its parent renal corpuscle. At this point, the epithelial cells of the tubule adjacent to the afferent arteriole of the glomerulus are modified to form the macula densa. The distal tubule then leaves the region of the corpuscle and becomes the distal convoluted tubule. • Distal convoluted tubule is less tortuous than the proxi- mal convoluted tubule; thus, in a section showing the cor- tical labyrinth, there are fewer distal tubule profiles than proximal tubule profiles. At its termination, the distal con- voluted tubule empties into a collecting duct that lies in the medullary ray via either an arched collecting tubule or a shorter tubule simply called the connecting tubule. The loop of Henle forms the entire U-shaped portion of a nephron. The proximal straight tubule, the thin descending limb with its hairpin turn, the thin ascending limb, and the distal straight tubule are collectively called the loop of Henle. In some nephrons, the thin descending and ascending segments are extremely short; therefore, the hairpin turn may be made by the distal straight tubule. Types of Nephrons Several types of nephrons are identified, based on the location of their renal corpuscles in the cortex (see Fig. 20.3): • Subcapsular nephrons or cortical nephrons have their renal corpuscles located in the outer part of the cortex. They have short loops of Henle, extending only into the outer medulla. They are typical of the nephrons described previously, wherein the hairpin turn occurs in the distal straight tubule. • Juxtamedullary nephrons make up about one eighth of the total nephron count. Their renal corpuscles occur in proximity to the base of a medullary pyramid. They have long loops of Henle and long ascending thin segments that extend well into the inner region of the pyramid. These structural features are essential to the urine-concentrating mechanism, which is described in a further section. • Intermediate nephrons or midcortical nephrons have their renal corpuscles in the midregion of the cortex. Their loops of Henle are of intermediate length. Collecting Tubules and Ducts The collecting tubules begin in the cortical labyrinth, as ei- ther connecting tubules or arched collecting tubules, and proceed to the medullary ray, where they join the collect- ing ducts. The collecting ducts within the cortex are referred to as cortical collecting ducts. When cortical collecting ducts reach the medulla, they are referred to as medullary collecting ducts. These ducts travel to the apex of the pyramid, where they merge into larger collecting ducts (up to 200 \u0005m), the papillary ducts (ducts of Bellini) that open into the minor calyx (see Fig. 20.4). The area on the papilla that contains the openings of these collecting ducts is called the area cribrosa. kidney lobekidney lobekidney lobe medullamedullacortexcortex medullacortex minorminor calyxcalyx minor calyx FIGURE 20.5 • Photomicrograph of fetal kidney.

The diagram in the upper left is a hemisection of the adult human kidney included for orientation. The diagram on the right represents an enlarged portion emphasizing the relationship of two nephrons and their collecting tubules and ducts ( yellow) to the cortex and medulla. The upper nephron, a midcortical nephron, extends only a short distance into the medulla and possesses a short thin segment in the loop of Henle. The lower nephron, a juxtamedullary nephron, has a long loop of Henle that extends deep into the medulla. Both nephrons drain into the collecting tubules in the medullary ray. The photomicrograph shows a section of the cortex. It is organized into a series of medullary rays containing straight tubules and collecting tubules and between them the cortical labyrinths containing the renal corpuscles and their associated proximal and distal convoluted tubules. A kidney lobule consists of a medullary ray at its center and half of the adjacent cortical labyrinth on either side. \u000460. In summary, the gross appearance of the kidney parenchyma reflects the structure of the nephron. The renal corpuscle and the proximal and the distal convoluted tubules are all located in and make up the substance of the cortical labyrinths. The por- tions of the straight proximal and straight distal tubules and the descending thin and ascending thin limbs of the loop of Henle in the cortex are located in and make up the major portion of the medullary rays. The thin descending and thin ascending limbs of the loop of Henle are always located in the medulla. Thus, the arrangement of the nephrons (and the collecting tubules and ducts) accounts for the characteristic appearance of the cut surface of the kidney, as can be seen in Figure 20.6. 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 704chapter 20Urinary System\u0003GENERAL STRUCTURE OFTHEKIDNEY 705 705 Filtration Apparatus of the Kidney The renal corpuscle contains the filtration apparatus of the kidney, which consists of the glomerular endothelium, underlying glomerular basement membrane, and the vis- ceral layer of Bowman’s capsule. The renal corpuscle is spherical and has an average diameter of 200 \u0005m. It consists of the glomerular capillary tuft and the surrounding visceral and parietal epithelial layers of Bowman’s capsule (Fig. 20.8). The filtration apparatus, also called glomerular ﬁltration barrier, enclosed by the parietal layer of Bowman’s capsule, consists of three different components: • Endothelium of the glomerular capillaries, which pos- sesses numerous fenestrations (Fig. 20.9). These fenestra- tions are larger (70 to 90 nm in diameter), more numerous, and more irregular in outline than fenestrations in other cap- illaries. Moreover, the diaphragm that spans the fenestrations in other capillaries is absent in the glomerular capillaries. Endothelial cells of glomerular capillaries possess a large number of aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) water channels that allow the fast movement of water through the epithelium. Secre- tory products of endothelial cells, such as nitric oxide (NO) or prostaglandins (PGE2), play an important role in the pathogenesis of several thrombotic glomerular diseases. • Glomerular basement membrane (GBM), a thick (300 to 370 nm) basal lamina that is the joint product of the endothelium and the podocytes, the cells of the visceral layer of Bowman’s capsule. Because of its thickness, it is prominent in histologic sections stained with the periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) procedure (see Fig. 1.2, page 6). The GMB is composed of a network consisting of type IV collagen (mainly \u00033, \u00034, and \u00035 chains), laminin, nidogen, entactin, together with proteo- glycans such as agrin and perlecan, as well as multiad- hvesive glycoproteins (see page 138). GBM can also be visualized employing immunofluorescence techniques using antibodies directed to a specific \u0003 chain of type IV collagen (Fig 20.10).

This schematic diagram shows the organization of the renal corpuscle and the structures associated with it at the vascular and urinary poles.

In Alport’s syndrome, the GBM be- comes irregularly thickened with laminated lamina densa and fails to serve as an effective ﬁltration barrier. • Visceral layer of Bowman’s capsule, which contains spe- cialized cells called podocytes or visceral epithelial cells. These cells extend processes around the glomerular capillar- ies (Fig. 20.11 and Plate 76, page 732). The podocytes arise during embryonic development from one of the blind ends of the developing nephron through invagination of the end of the tubule to form a double-layered epithelial cup. The inner cell layer (i.e., the visceral cell layer) lies in apposition to a capillary network, the glomerulus, which forms at this site. The outer layer of these cells, the parietal layer, forms the squamous cells of Bowman’s capsule. The cup eventually closes to form the spherical structure containing the glomerulus. As they differentiate, the podocytes extend pro- cesses around the capillaries and develop numerous secondary processes called pedicels or foot processes. The foot processes interdigitate with foot processes of neigh- boring podocytes, a feature that can be clearly seen with the scanning electron microscope (SEM; Fig. 20.12). The elon- gated spaces between the interdigitating foot processes, called ﬁltration slits, are about 40 nm wide and covered by an ultrathin ﬁltration slit diaphragm that spans the filtration slit slightly above the GBM (Fig. 20.13, inset). Nephrin is an important structural protein of the filtra- tion slit diaphragm. Recent studies of the ﬁltration slit diaphragm revealed its complex protein structure as a zipper-like sheet configuration with a central density.

(Courtesy of Dr. L. Barisoni.) a key structural and functional component of the slit di- aphragm. Nephrin molecules emerging from opposite foot processes interact in the center of the slit (homophilic inter- actions), forming a central density with pores on both sides (Fig. 20.14). This intercellular protein sheet also contains other adhesion molecules, such as Neph-1, Neph-2, P-cad- herin, FAT1, and FAT 2. The filtration slit diaphragm is firmly anchored to numerous actin filaments within the foot processes of podocytes. Regulation and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton of podocytes has emerged as a critical pro- cess for regulating size, patency, and selectivity of the filtra- tion slits. Mutations in the nephrin gene (NPHS1) are associated with congenital nephrotic syndrome, a disease characterized by massive proteinuria and edema. Endothelial surface layer of glomerular capillaries and subpodocyte space also make an important contribution to overall glomerular function. The filtration apparatus is a very complex semipermeable barrier, with properties that allow for high filtration rate of water, nonrestricted passage of small and middle-sized molecules, and almost total exclusion of serum albumins and other larger proteins. The filtration apparatus may thus be de- scribed as a barrier having two discontinuous cellular layers, the endothelium of glomerular capillaries and visceral layer of Bowman’s capsule applied to either side of a continuous extracellular layer of the glomerular basement membrane. These three layers have traditionally been considered as the glomerular filtration barrier. However, recently two additional physiologically important layers, the endothelial surface layer of glomerular capillaries and subpodocyte space are included as part of the filtration apparatus. • Endothelial surface layer of the glomerular capillaries consists of a thick carbohydrate–rich meshwork (200–400 nm) attached to the luminal surface of glomerular endothelial cells. It contains glycocalyx, which refers to plasma membrane-bound negatively charged proteoglycans (such as perlecan, syndecan, and versican) associated with glycosaminoglycan side-chains (such as heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate) and peripheral membrane proteins. Plasma proteins (e.g., albumins) adsorbed from the blood coat the luminal sur- face of glycocalyx. • Subpodocyte space represents a narrow space between the foot processes with their filtration slit diaphragms on one side and a cell body of the podocyte on the other side (see Fig. 20.13). Recent three-dimensional reconstruction of these spaces revealed their interconnected but struc- turally restrictive character. They cover approximately 60% of the entire surface area of the glomerular filtration barrier and may function in regulating glomerular fluid flux across the filtration apparatus. The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) acts as a physical barrier and an ion-selective filter. As discussed earlier, the GBM contains type IV and XVIII collagens, sialoglycoproteins, and other noncollagenous gly- coproteins (e.g., laminin, fibronectin, entactin), as well as proteoglycans (e.g., perlecan, agrin) and glycosaminoglycans, particularly heparan sulfate (Fig. 20.15). These components are localized in particular portions of the GBM: • The lamina rara externa, adjacent to the podocyte pro- cesses. It is particularly rich in polyanions, such as heparan sulfate, that specifically impede the passage of negatively charged molecules. • The lamina rara interna, adjacent to the capillary endothelium. Its molecular features are similar to those of the lamina rara externa. • The lamina densa, the overlapping portion of the two basal laminae, sandwiched between the laminae rarae. It contains type IV collagen, which is organized into a net- work that acts as a physical filter. Type XVIII collagen, per- lecan, and agrin are responsible for the bulk of anionic charges found in glomerular basement membrane. The laminin and other proteins present in the laminae rara interna and externa are involved in the attachment of the endothelial cells and podocytes to the GBM. The GBM restricts the movement of particles, usually pro- teins, larger than approximately 70,000 daltons or 3.6 nm radius (e.g., albumin or hemoglobin). Although albumin is not a usual constituent, it may sometimes be found in urine, indicating that the size of albumin is close to the effective pore size of the filtration barrier. The polyanionic glycosaminogly- cans of the laminae rarae have strong negative charges and re- strict the movement of anionic particles and molecules across the GBM, even those smaller than 70,000 daltons. Despite the ability of the filtration barrier to restrict protein, several grams of protein do pass through the barrier each day.

Albuminuria (presence of signiﬁcant amounts of albumin in the urine) or hematuria (presence of signiﬁ- cant amounts of red blood cells in the urine) indicate physi- cal or functional damage to the GBM. In such cases (e.g., diabetic nephropathy), the number of anionic sites, espe- cially in the lamina rara externa, is signiﬁcantly reduced. The filtration slit diaphragm acts as a size-selective filter. The narrow slit pores formed by the foot processes of podocytes and the filtration slit diaphragms act as physical barriers to restrict the movement of solutes and solvents across the filtration barrier. The discovery of specific proteins that form the slit diaphragm has led to new insights into the function of the filtration apparatus in the kidney. Most of the proteins found in the diaphragm are crucial for normal devel- opment and function of the kidney. The slit diaphragm archi- tecture accounts for a true size-selective filter properties, which determine the molecular sieving characteristics of the glomerulus. Several mechanisms prevent clogging of the fil- tration slit diaphragms. These include, the negative charges of glycosaminoglycans in the GBM, negative charges of the podocyte cell membrane, and the phagocytic function of mesangial cells in the renal corpuscle. 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 708chapter 20Urinary System\u0003GENERAL STRUCTURE OFTHEKIDNEY 709 709 a b a b a b a b a b 1˚ 1˚ 1˚ 2˚ 2˚ 2˚ podocyte 1˚ 1˚ 1˚ 2˚ 2˚ 2˚ podocyte 1˚ 1˚ 1˚ 2˚ 2˚ 2˚ podocyte 1˚ 1˚ 1˚ 2˚ 2˚ 2˚ podocyte 1˚ 1˚ 1˚ 2˚ 2˚ 2˚ podocyte FIGURE 20.12 • Scanning electron micrograph of a glomerulus. a.

The molecular structure and composition of each component of the glomerular filtration barrier has important conse- quences for adjacent components of the barrier. For instance, molecular changes in the GBM not only modify the contribu- tion of this layer but also modify the rate at which solutes and solvents pass through the endothelium of glomerular capillar- ies on one side and the visceral layer of the Bowman’s capsule on the other. In addition, it is important to understand that glomerular filtration barrier is not a passive but an active struc- ture that can remodel itself and modify its own permeability. Simple squamous epithelium constitutes the parietal layer of Bowman’s capsule. The parietal layer of Bowman’s capsule contains pari- etal epithelial cells and forms a simple squamous epithe- lium. At the urinary pole of the renal corpuscle, the parietal layer is continuous with the cuboidal epithelium of the proximal convoluted tubule (see Figs. 20.7 and 20.11). Pro- liferation of parietal epithelial cells is a typical diagnostic feature in certain types of glomerulonephritis (inﬂamma- tion of the glomerulus). For an example of such a disease, see Folder 20.2. The space between the visceral and parietal layers of Bowman’s capsule is called the urinary space or Bowman’s space (see Fig. 20.11). It is the receptacle for the glomerular ultrafiltrate (primary urine) produced by the filtration apparatus of the renal corpuscle. At the urinary pole of the renal corpuscle, the urinary space is continuous with the lumen of the proximal convoluted tubule. Mesangium The renal corpuscle contains an additional group of cells called mesangial cells. These cells and their extracellular matrix constitute the mesangium. It is most obvious at the vascular stalk of the glomerulus and at the interstices of adjoining glomerular capillaries. Mesangial cells are posi- tioned much the same as pericytes, in that they are enclosed by the GBM (Fig. 20.16). The mesangial cells are not con- fined entirely to the renal corpuscle; some are located out- side the corpuscle along the vascular pole, where they are also designated as lacis cells and form part of what is called the juxtaglomerular apparatus (see Fig. 20.7). Important functions of the mesangial cells follow: • Phagocytosis and endocytosis. Mesangial cells remove trapped residues and aggregated proteins from the GBM and filtration slit diaphragm, thus keeping the glomerular filter free of debris. They also endocytose and process a variety of plasma proteins including immune complexes. Maintaining the structure and function of glomerular bar- rier is the primary function of the mesangial cells. • Structural support.

Mesangial cells synthesize and secrete a variety of molecules such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), PGE2, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which play a cen- tral role in response to glomerular injury. • Modulation of glomerular distension. Mesangial cells have contractile properties. In the past, it was suggested that contraction of mesangial cells could increase the intra- glomerular blood volume and filtration pressure. Recent studies revealed that mesangial contribution to glomerular filtration rate is minimal, and the mesangial cells may function in regulating glomerular distension in response to increased blood pressure. • Clinically, it has been observed that mesangial cells proliferate in certain kidney diseases, in which abnor- mal amounts of protein and protein complexes are trapped in the GBM. Proliferation of mesangial cells is a prominent feature in the immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (Berger disease), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, and diabetic nephropathy. Embryologically, mesangial, and juxtaglomerular cells (discussed in a following paragraph) are derived from smooth muscle cell precursors. Although mesangial cells are clearly phagocytotic, they are unusual in the sense that they are not derived from the usual precursor cells of the mononuclear phagocytotic system, the blood-borne monocytes. Juxtaglomerular Apparatus The juxtaglomerular apparatus includes the macula densa, the juxtaglomerular cells, and the extraglomerular mesangial cells.

Filtration slit diaphragm is a complex zipper-like sheet structure formed by a transmembrane protein nephrin. The extracellular domains of nephrins emerge from the opposite foot processes of neighboring podocytes and interdigitate in the center of the slit forming a central density with pores on both sides. The intracellular domains of nephrins interact with actin cytoskeleton within the cytoplasm of foot processes. The sheet of nephrin molecules is reinforced near its attachment to the foot processes by Neph1 and Neph2 proteins that interact with each other and with nephrin. The other adhesion molecules such as P-cadherin, FAT1, and FAT2 are also found in this region. Note that foot processes of podocytes are separated by the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) from fenestrated endothelial cells lining glomerular capillaries.

FIGURE 20.15 • Immunoﬂuorescent-stained glomerulus. This triple-exposure micrograph of a normal adult rat glomerulus is immunostained with two different antibodies. One antibody recognizes specific extracellular components, namely, basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (BM-HSPG, rhodamine label). The other antibody recognizes basement membrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (BM-CSPG, fluorescein label). Because it is a triple-exposure micrograph, a yellow color occurs where the two fluorescent labels exactly codistribute. The blue fluorescence is nuclear counterstaining with Hoechst nuclear stain. The micrograph shows that compartmentalization occurs with respect to glomerular proteoglycan populations.

McCarthy.) 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 711 712 As discussed earlier in the section on the basal lamina assembly (see Chapter 5, page 139), the major building block of any basement membrane, including glomerular basement membrane (GBM), is the type IV collagen molecule. Its core structure is composed of three \u0003-chain monomers, each representing one or more of six types of \u0003-chains known for type IV collagen (see Table 6.2; page 165). Each molecule has three domains: an amino- terminus 7S domain, a middle collagenous helical domain, and a carboxy-terminus noncallagenous NC1 domain. Molecular architecture of type IV collagen is a key to understanding pathophysiology of glomerular kidney diseases. For instance, an autoimmune response to the noncollagenous NC1 domain of the \u00033-chain of type IV collagen [\u00033(IV)] in the GBM is responsible for the devel- opment of anti-GBM antibody-induced glomeru- lonephritis. This condition is characterized by a linear deposition of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in the GBM. In some individuals, anti-GBM antibodies may cross-react with alveolar basement membrane in the lungs, producing Goodpasture syndrome. The clinical feature of Goodpasture syndrome is rap - idly progressive glomerulonephritis (inflammation in the glomeruli) and pulmonary hemorrhage due to disruption of the air–blood barrier. In response to deposition of IgG in the glomerulus, the complement system is activated and circulating leukocytes elaborate a variety of proteases, leading to disruption of the GBM and deposition of fibrin. Fibrin, in turn, stimulates the proliferation of parietal cells lining Bowman’s capsule and cause influx of monocytes from the circulation. The product of these reactions is often seen within the glomerulus as a crescent, a characteristic microscopic feature of glomerulonephritis (Fig. F20.2.1). Most patients affected by Goodpasture syndrome have a severe crescentic glomerulonephritis with transiently ele- vated levels of circulating anti-GBM antibodies. Formation of anti-GBM antibodies is most likely triggered by viruses, cancers, pharmacologic agents, and chemical compounds found in a variety of paints, solvents, and dyes. Individuals with Goodpasture syndrome present with both respiratory and urinary symptoms. These include short- ness of breath, cough, and bloody sputum, as well as hema- turia (blood in urine), proteinuria (proteins in the urine), and other symptoms of progressing kidney failure. The main therapeutic goal in treating Goodpasture syn- drome is to remove the circulating pathogenic antibodies from the blood. This is achieved by plasmapheresis, in which blood plasma is removed from the circulation and replaced by fluid, protein, or donated plasma. In addition, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs and corticos- teroids is beneficial to keep the immune system from pro- ducing pathogenic autoantibodies. glomerular capillaries glomerular capillaries glomerular capillaries crescent crescentcrescent urinary space urinary space basal lamina basal lamina aa b FIGURE F20.2.1 • Photomicrograph of a glomerulus in Goodpasture syndrome. a.

The mesangial cell and its surrounding matrix are enclosed by the basal lamina of the glomerular capillaries. Note that the mesangial cells are in the same compartment as the endothelium and that they can be intimately associated with the basal lamina as well as with the endothelial cells. (Modified from Sakai T, Kriz W. The structural relationship between mesangial cells and basement membrane of the renal glomerulus. Anat Embryol 1987; 176:373–386.) vascular pole of the renal corpuscle is the terminal portion of the distal straight tubule of the nephron. At this site, the wall of the tubule contains cells that are referred to collectively as the macula densa. When viewed in the light microscope, the cells of the macula densa are distinctive, in that they are narrower and usually taller than other distal tubule cells (see Fig. 20.7). The nuclei of these cells appear crowded, even to the extent that they appear partially superimposed over one another, thus the name “macula densa.” In this same region, the smooth muscle cells of the adjacent afferent arteriole (and, sometimes, the efferent arteriole) are modified. They contain secretory granules, and their nuclei are spherical, as opposed to the typical elongate smooth muscle cell nucleus. These juxtaglomerular cells (see Fig. 20.7) require spe - cial stains to reveal the secretory vesicles in the light microscope. The juxtaglomerular apparatus regulates blood pressure by activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. In certain physiologic (low sodium intake) or pathologic condi- tions (decrease in volume of circulating blood because of hemorrhage or reduction in renal perfusion owing to compres- sion of the renal arteries), juxtaglomerular cells are responsible for activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). This system plays an important role in maintaining sodium homeostasis and renal hemodynamics. The granules of the juxtaglomerular cells contain an aspartyl protease, called renin, which is synthesized, stored, and released into the blood- stream from the modified smooth muscle cells. In the blood, renin catalyzes the hydrolysis of a circulating \u00032-globulin, an- giotensinogen, to produce the decapeptide angiotensin I. Then, • Angiotensin I is converted to the active octapeptide angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) present on the endothelial cells of lung capillaries. • Angiotensin II stimulates the synthesis and release of the hormone aldosterone from the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland (see page 766). • Aldosterone, in turn, acts on collecting ducts to increase reabsorption of sodium and concomitant reabsorption of water, thereby raising blood volume and pressure. 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 713 • Angiotensin II is also a potent vasoconstrictor that has a regulatory role in the control of renal and systemic vascu- lar resistance. The juxtaglomerular apparatus functions not only as an endocrine organ that secretes renin but also as a sensor of blood volume and tubular fluid composition. The cells of the macula densa monitor the Na \u0002 concentration in the tubular fluid and regulate both the glomerular filtration rate and the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular cells. The decreased Na \u0002 con- centration in the distal convoluted tubule is believed to be a stimulus for unique ion-transporting molecules expressed on the apical membrane of macula densa cells. These molecules include Na \u0002/2Cl \u0007/K \u0002 cotransporters, Na \u0002/H \u0002 exchangers, and pH- and calcium-regulated K \u0002 channels. Activation of membrane transport pathways changes the intracellular ion concentration within the macula densa cells and initiates signal- ing mechanisms by releasing various mediators such as ATP, adenosine, nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandins (PGE2). These molecules act in a paracrine manner and signal both the underlying juxtaglomerular cells of the afferent arteriole to se- crete renin and the vascular smooth muscle cells to contract. An increase in blood volume sufficient to cause stretching of the juxtaglomerular cells in the afferent arteriole may be the stimu- lus that closes the feedback loop and stops secretion of renin. \u0002 KIDNEY TUBULE FUNCTION As the glomerular ultraﬁltrate passes through the uriniferous and collecting tubules of the kidney, it undergoes changes that involve both active and passive absorption, as well as secretion. • Certain substances within the ultrafiltrate are reabsorbed, some partially (e.g., water, sodium, and bicarbonate) and some completely (e.g., glucose). • Other substances (e.g., creatinine and organic acids and bases) are added to the ultrafiltrate (i.e., the primary urine) by secretory activity of the tubule cells. Thus, the volume of the ultrafiltrate is reduced substantially, and the urine is made hyperosmotic. The long loop of Henle and the collecting tubules that pass parallel to similarly arranged blood vessels, the vasa recta, serve as the basis for the countercur- rent multiplier mechanism that is instrumental in concentrating the urine, thereby making it hyperosmotic. 714 Urinalysis is an important part of the examination of patients with suspected renal disease. It typically includes several measurement of physical, biochemical, and microscopic urine characteristics such as pH, specific gravity (indirect measurement of ion concentration), bilirubin, concentration of intermediate compounds derived from the fatty acid metabolism known as ketone bodies, hemoglobin, and con- centration of the proteins. Important part of this analysis in- cludes the determination of the amount of protein excreted in the urine. The excretion of excessive amounts of protein (i.e., proteinuria [albuminuria]) is an important diagnostic sign of renal disease. Normally, less than 150 mg of protein is excreted in the urine each day. Although excessive excretion of protein almost always indicates renal disease, extreme exercise, such as jogging, or severe dehydration may pro- duce increased proteinuria in individuals without renal dis- ease. Microscopic examination of the urine may reveal presence of red and white blood cells, mineral crystals, and pathogenic agents such as bacteria or fungi. Often these elements are enclosed within the cylindrical structures called urinary casts. The matrix of urinary cast is formed by an 85- kilodalton protein, uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall protein) that precipitate in the lumen of distal convoluted tubes and collecting ducts during a disease process. For years, cardiologists and nephrologists believed that chronic essential hypertension, the most common form of hypertension, was somehow related to an abnor- mality in the RAAS. However, 24-hour urine renin levels in such patients were usually normal. Not until a factor in the venom of a South American snake was shown to be a potent inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lung did investigators have both a clue to the cause of chronic essential hypertension and a new series of drugs with which to treat this common disease. The “lesion” in chronic essential hypertension is now be- lieved to be excessive production of angiotensin II in the lung. Development of the so-called ACE inhibitors—captopril, enalapril, and related derivatives of the original snake venom factor—has revolutionized the treatment of chronic essential hypertension. These antihypertensive drugs do not cause the often-dangerous side effects of the diuretics and \b-blockers that were previously the most commonly used drugs for control of this condition. • FOLDER 20.4 Clinical Correlation: Renin–Angiotensin– Aldosterone System (RAAS) and Hypertension • FOLDER 20.3 Clinical Correlation: Examination of the Urine—Urinalysis 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 714chapter 20Urinary System\u0003KIDNEY TUBULE FUNCTION 715 715 Proximal Convoluted Tubule The proximal convoluted tubule is the initial and major site of reabsorption. The proximal convoluted tubule receives the ultrafiltrate from the urinary space of Bowman’s capsule. The cuboidal cells of the proximal convoluted tubule have the elaborate sur- face specializations associated with cells engaged in absorption and fluid transport. They exhibit the following features: • A brush border, composed of relatively long, closely packed, and straight microvilli (Fig. 20.17) • A junctional complex, consisting of a narrow, tight junc- tion that seals off the intercellular space from the lumen of the tubule and a zonula adherens that maintains the adhe- sion between neighboring cells • Plicae or folds located on the lateral surfaces of the cells, which are large flattened processes, alternating with similar processes of adjacent cells (see Fig. 20.16) • Extensive interdigitation of basal processes of adja- cent cells (Figs. 20.18 and 20.19) • Basal striations, consisting of elongate mitochondria concentrated in the basal processes and oriented vertically to the basal surface (see Fig. 20.18) In well-fixed histologic preparations, the basal striations and the apical brush border help to distinguish the cells of the proximal convoluted tubule from those of the other tubules. At the very base of the proximal convoluted tubule cell, in the interdigitating processes, bundles of 6-nm microfilaments are present (see arrows, Figs. 20.18 and 20.19). These actin filaments may play a role in regulating the movement of fluid from the basolateral extracellular space across the tubule basal lamina toward the adjacent peritubular capillary. Of the 180 L/day of ultrafiltrate entering the nephrons, approximately 120 L/day, or 65% of the ultrafiltrate, is reab- sorbed by the proximal convoluted tubule.

Here the interdigitating parts of the adjoining cell have been removed to show the basolateral interdigitations. Some of the interdigitating processes extend the full height of the cell. The processes are long in the basal region and create an elaborate extracellular compartment adjacent to the basal lamina. Apically, the microvilli (M) constitute the brush border. In some locations, the microvilli have been omitted, thereby revealing the convoluted character of the apical cell boundary (CB). (Based on Bulger RE. The shape of rat kidney tubular cells.

They are responsible for the reabsorption of Na \u0002, which is the major driving force for reabsorption of water in the proximal convoluted tubule. As in the intestinal and gall- bladder epithelia, this process is driven by active transport of Na \u0002 into the lateral intercellular space. Active transport of Na \u0002 is followed by passive diffusion of Cl \u0007 to maintain elec- trochemical neutrality. The accumulation of NaCl in the lat- eral intercellular spaces creates an osmotic gradient that draws water from the lumen into the intercellular compart- ment. This compartment distends as the amount of fluid in it increases; the lateral folds separate to allow this distension. • AQP-1, a small (\u000230 kilodaltons) transmembrane protein that functions as a molecular water channel in the cell membrane of proximal convoluted tubules. Movement of water through these membrane channels does not require the high energy of Na \u0002/K \u0002-ATPase pumps. Immunocyto- chemical methods can be used to demonstrate the presence of these proteins. • The hydrostatic pressure that builds up in the distended intercellular compartment, presumably aided by contrac- tile activity of the actin filaments in the base of the tubule cells, drives an essentially isosmotic fluid across the tubule basement membrane into the renal connective tissue. Here, the fluid is reabsorbed into the vessels of the per- itubular capillary network. The proximal convoluted tubule also reabsorbs amino acids, sugars, and polypeptides. As in the intestine, the microvilli of proximal convoluted tubule cells are covered with a well-developed glycocalyx that contains several ATPases, peptidases, and high concentrations of disaccharidases. In addition to amino acids and monosac- charides, the ultrafiltrate also contains small peptides and dis- accharides. The latter adsorb on the glycocalyx for further digestion before internalization of the resulting amino acids and monosaccharides (including glucose). Also, as in the gut, amino acid and glucose resorption in the proximal convo- luted tubule depends on active Na\u0002 transport. Proteins and large peptides are endocytosed in the proxi- mal convoluted tubule. Deep tubular invaginations are present between the microvilli of the proximal convoluted tubule cells. Proteins in the ultra- filtrate, on reaching the tubule lumen, bind to the glycocalyx that covers the plasma membrane of the invaginations. Then endocytotic vesicles containing the bound protein bud from the invaginations and fuse in the apical cytoplasm to form large protein-containing early endosomes (see Fig. 20.18). These early endosomes are destined to become lysosomes, and the endocytosed proteins are degraded by acid hydro- lases. The amino acids produced in the lysosomal degradation are recycled into the circulation via the intercellular compart- ment and the interstitial connective tissue. Also, the pH of the ultrafiltrate is modified in the proxi- mal convoluted tubule by the reabsorption of bicarbonate and by the specific secretion into the lumen of exogenous or- ganic acids and organic bases derived from the peritubular capillary circulation. Proximal Straight Tubule The cells of the proximal straight tubule (i.e., the thick de- scending limb of the loop of Henle) are not as specialized for absorption as are those of the proximal convoluted tubule. 716 EnFEnF BLBL EnEn EnF BL En FIGURE 20.19 • Electron micrograph of a proximal convoluted tubule cell. This section is almost tangential and slightly oblique to the base of a proximal convoluted tubule cell and the subjacent basal lamina and capillary.

Characteristically, the endothelium possesses numerous fenestrations (EnF), and in this plane of section, the fenestrations are seen en face, displaying circular profiles. The plane of section also makes the basal lamina (BL) appear as a broad band of homogenous material. To the right of the basal lamina are the interdigitating basal processes of the proximal tubule cells. The long, straight processes contain longitudinally oriented actin filaments (arrows).

To date, 13 proteins have been characterized and cloned. The molecular size of AQPs ranges from 26 to 34 kilodaltons. Each protein consists of six transmembrane domains arranged to form a distinct pore. The sites where AQPs are expressed implicate their role in water transport, such as renal tubules (water reabsorption), brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption), pancreatic acinar cells (secretion of pancreatic fluids), lacrimal apparatus (secretion and resorption of tears), and eye (aqueous humor secretion and reabsorption). Most AQPs are selec- tive for the passage of water (AQP-1, AQP-2, AQP-4, AQP-5, AQP-6, and AQP-8), whereas others, such as AQP-3, AQP-7, and AQP-9, called aquaglyceroporins, also transport glycerol and other larger molecules in addition to water. Prominent members of the AQP family include • AQP-1, expressed in kidney (proximal convoluted tubules) and other cell types such as hepatocytes and red blood cells. AQP-1 is also expressed in the lymph nodes, endothelial cells lining lymphatic sinuses, and on the vascular endothelium of high endothelial venules as well as in the endothelial cells of intestinal lacteals. • AQP-2, present in the terminal portion of the distal con- voluted tubules and in the epithelium of collecting tubules and ducts. AQP-2 is under the regulation of an- tidiuretic hormone (ADH) and is thus known as an ADH- regulated water channel. Mutation of the AQP-2 gene has been linked to congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. • AQP-3 and AQP-4 have also been detected in the ba- solateral cell surface of the light cells of kidney collect- ing ducts as well in the gastrointestinal epithelium (AQP-3), pancreatic acinar cells (AQP-12), and the brain and spinal cord (AQP-4). Current research into the function and structure of the AQP proteins may lead to the development of water chan- nel blockers that could be used to treat hypertension, con- gestive heart failure, and brain swelling and to regulate intracranial or intraocular pressure. • FOLDER 20.5 Functional Considerations: Structure and Function of Aquaporin Water Channels They are shorter, with a less well-developed brush border and with fewer and less complex lateral and basolateral processes. The mitochondria are smaller than those of the cells of the convoluted segment and are randomly distributed in the cy- toplasm. There are fewer apical invaginations and endocy- totic vesicles, as well as fewer lysosomes. Thin Segment of Loop of Henle As noted above, the length of the thin segment varies with the location of the nephron in the cortex. Juxtamedullary nephrons have the longest limbs; cortical nephrons have the shortest. Fur- thermore, various cell types are present in the thin segment. In the light microscope, it is possible to detect at least two kinds of thin segment tubules, one with a more squamous epithelium than the other. Electron microscopic examination of the thin segments of various nephrons reveals further differences, namely, the existence of four types of epithelial cells (Fig. 20.20): • Type I epithelium is found in the thin descending and as- cending limbs of the loop of Henle of short-looped nephrons. It consists of a thin, simple epithelium. The cells have almost no interdigitations with neighboring cells and few organelles. • Type II epithelium, found in the thin descending limb of long-looped nephrons in the cortical labyrinth, consists of taller epithelium. These cells possess abundant organelles and have many small, blunt microvilli. The extent of lat- eral interdigitation with neighboring cells varies by species. • Type III epithelium, found in the thin descending limb in the inner medulla, consists of a thinner epithelium. The cells have a simpler structure and fewer microvilli than type II epithelial cells. Lateral interdigitations are absent. • Type IV epithelium, found at the bend of long-looped nephrons and through the entire thin ascending limb, con- sists of a low, flattened epithelium without microvilli. The cells possess few organelles. The specific functional roles of the four cell types in the thin segment are not yet clear, although this segment is part of the countercurrent exchange system that functions in concentrat- ing urine. Morphologic differences, such as microvilli, mito- chondria, and degree of cellular interdigitation, probably reflect specific active or passive roles in this process. The thin descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle differ in structural and functional properties. Studies of ultrafiltrate that enters the thin descending limb and leaves the thin ascending limb of the loop of Henle reveal dramatic changes in ultrafiltrate osmolality. The ultrafiltrate that enters the thin descending limb is isosmotic, whereas the ultrafiltrate leaving the thin ascending limb is hyposmotic to plasma. This change is achieved by reabsorbing more salts than water. The two limbs of the loop of Henle have different permeabilities and thus different functions: • The thin descending limb of the loop of Henle is highly per- meable to water and much less permeable to solutes like NaCl and urea. Because the interstitial fluid in the medulla is hyper- osmotic, water diffuses out of this nephron segment. In addi- tion, a small amount of NaCl and urea enters the nephron at this site. The cells of this limb do not actively transport ions; thus the increased tubular fluid osmolality that occurs in this nephron segment is caused in large part by the passive move- ment of water into the peritubular connective tissue.chapter 20Urinary System\u0003KIDNEY TUBULE FUNCTION 717 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 717 • The thin ascending limb of the loop of Henle does not ac- tively transport ions, but it is highly permeable to NaCl and thus allows passive diffusion of NaCl into the interstitium. Cl \u0007 diffuses into the interstitium following its concentration gradient through Cl \u0007 conducting channels. Although the energy from ATP is required to open these channels, the movement of Cl \u0007 is not an example of active transport and does not require Cl \u0007-stimulated ATPase activity. Counter ions, in this case Na \u0002 (the majority) and K \u0002, follow passively to maintain electrochemical neutrality. The hyper- osmolarity of the interstitium is directly related to the trans- port activity of the cells in this limb of the loop of Henle. Further, the thin ascending limb is largely impermeable to water, so that at this site, as the salt concentration increases in the interstitium, the interstitium becomes hyperosmotic and the fluid in the lumen of the nephron becomes hyposmotic. In addition, epithelial cells lining the thick ascending limb produce an 85-kilodalton protein called uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall protein) that influences NaCl reabsorp- tion and urinary concentration ability. Uromodulin also modulates cell adhesion and signal transduction by inter- acting with various cytokines, as well as it inhibits the aggregation of calcium oxalate crystals (preventing kidney stones formation) and provides a defense against urinary tract infection. In individuals with inﬂammatory kidney diseases, a precipitated uromodulin is detected in urine in the form of urinary casts (see Folder 20.3). Distal Straight Tubule The distal straight tubule is a part of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The distal straight tubule (thick ascending limb), as previ- ously noted, is a part of the ascending limb of the loop of Hen- leand includes both medullary and cortical portions, with the latter located in the medullary rays. The distal straight tubule, like the ascending thin limb, transports ions from the tubular lumen to the interstitium. The apical cell membrane in this segment has electroneutral transporters (synporters) that allow Cl \u0007, Na \u0002, and K \u0002 to enter the cell from the lumen. Na \u0002 is ac- tively transported across the extensive basolateral plications by the Na \u0002/K \u0002-ATPase pumps; Cl \u0007 and K \u0002 diffuse out from the intracellular space by the Cl \u0007 and K \u0002 channels. Some K \u0002 ions leak back into the tubular fluid through K \u0002 channels, causing the tubular lumen to be positively charged with respect to the interstitium. This positive gradient provides the driving force for the reabsorption of many other ions such as Ca 2\u0002 and Mg 2\u0002. Note that this significant movement of ions occurs without the movement of water through the wall of the distal straight tubule, resulting in separation of water from its solutes. In routine histologic preparations, the large cuboidal cells of the distal straight tubule stain lightly with eosin, and the lateral margins of the cells are indistinct (Plate 77, page 734). The nucleus is located in the apical portion of the cell and sometimes, especially in the straight segment, causes the cell to bulge into the lumen. As noted above, these cells have extensive basolateral plications, and there are numerous mitochondria associated with these basal folds (Fig. 20.21). They also have considerably fewer and less well-developed microvilli than proximal straight tubule cells (compare Figs. 20.18 and 20.19). Distal Convoluted Tubule The distal convoluted tubule exchanges Na \u0002 for K \u0002 under aldosterone regulation. The distal convoluted tubule, located in the cortical labyrinth, is only about one third as long (\u00025 mm) as the prox- imal convoluted tubule. This short tubule is responsible for • reabsorption of Na \u0002and secretion of K \u0002 into the ultrafil- trate to conserve Na \u0002. 718 long-looped nephron short-looped nephron cortex medulla I II III IV Type I Type II Type III Type IV FIGURE 20.20 • Schematic diagram of loop of Henle thin- limb epithelial cells.

Aldosterone, secreted by the adrenal gland and released under stimulation by angiotensin II, increases the reabsorp- tion of Na\u0002 and secretion of K\u0002. These effects increase blood volume and blood pressure in response to increased blood Na\u0002 concentration. Collecting Tubules and Collecting Ducts The collecting tubules as well as the cortical collecting ducts and medullary collecting ducts are composed of simple epithelium. The collecting tubules and cortical col- lecting ducts have flattened cells, somewhat squamous to cuboidal in shape. The medullary collecting ducts have cuboidal cells, with a transition to columnar cells as the ducts increase in size. The collecting tubules and ducts are readily distinguished from proximal and distal tubules by virtue of the cell boundaries that can be seen in the light microscope (Plate 77, page 734). Two distinct types of cells are present in the collecting tubules and collecting ducts: • Light cells, also called collecting duct cells or CD cells, are the principal cells of the system. They are pale-staining cells with true basal infoldings rather than processes that interdigitate with those of adjacent cells. They possess a single primary cilium and relatively few short microvilli (Fig. 20.22). They contain small, spherical mitochondria. These cells possess an abundance of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)–regulated water channels, aquaporin-2 (AQP-2), which are responsible for water permeability of the collect- ing ducts. In addition, aquaporins AQP-3 and AQP-4 are present within the basolateral membrane of these cells. • Dark cells, also called intercalated (IC) cells, occur in considerably smaller numbers. They have many mitochon- dria, and their cytoplasm appears denser. Microplicae, cy- toplasmic folds, are present on their apical surface, as well as microvilli. The microplicae are readily observed with the SEM but may be mistaken for microvilli with the TEM (see Fig. 20.22). They do not show basal infoldings but have basally located interdigitations with neighboring cells. Numerous vesicles are present in the apical cyto- plasm. The intercalated cells are involved in the secretion of H \u0002 (\u0003-intercalated cells) or bicarbonate (\b-intercalated cells), depending on the whether the kidneys need to MvMv MM GG Mv M MM MM MM MM IPIP IPIPBLBL M M M M G IP IPBL * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * FIGURE 20.21 • Electron micrograph of a distal convoluted tubule cell.

The \u0003-intercalated cell actively secretes H \u0002 into the collecting duct lumen via ATP-depen- dent pumps and releases HCO3\u0007 via Cl \u0007/HCO3\u0007 ex- changers located in their basolateral cell membrane. The \b-intercalated cells have opposite polarity and secrete bicarbonate ions into the lumen of the collecting duct. Because of the nature of the diet and thus the need to excrete acid, the epithelium of collecting ducts contains more \u0003- than \b-intercalated cells. The cells of the collecting ducts gradually become taller as the ducts pass from the outer to the inner medulla and be- come columnar in the region of the renal papilla. The num- ber of dark cells gradually decreases until there are none in the ducts as they approach the papilla. \u0002 INTERSTITIAL CELLS The connective tissue of the kidney parenchyma, called interstitial tissue, surrounds the nephrons, ducts, and blood and lymphatic vessels. This tissue increases consider- ably in amount from the cortex (where it constitutes approximately 7% of the volume) to the inner region of the medulla and papilla (where it may constitute more than 20% of the volume). In the cortex, two types of interstitial cells are recognized: cells that resemble ﬁbroblasts, found between the base- ment membrane of the tubules and the adjacent peritubular capillaries, and occasional macrophages. In their intimate re- lationship with the base of the tubular epithelial cells, the fi- broblasts resemble the subepithelial fibroblasts of the intestine. These cells synthesize and secrete the collagen and gly- cosaminoglycans of the extracellular matrix of the interstitium. In the medulla, the principal interstitial cells resemble myoﬁbroblasts. They are oriented to the long axes of the tubular structures and may have a role in compressing these structures. The cells contain prominent bundles of actin fila- ments, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), a well- developed Golgi complex, and lysosomes. Prominent lipid droplets in the cytoplasm appear to increase and decrease in relation to the diuretic state. Most fibroblasts originate within the interstitial tissue through a mechanism called epithelial–mesenchymal transition. The conversion of tubular epithelial cells into a mesenchymal phenotype is initiated by an alteration in the balance of local cytokine concentrations. During per- sistent injury and chronic inflammation of the kidney parenchyma, fibroblasts increase their numbers and, by secreting excess extracellular matrix, destroy normal interstitial architecture of the kidney. Research studies suggest that in renal ﬁbrosis, more than one third of all disease-related ﬁbroblasts originate from tubular epithelial cells at the site of injury. Proliferation of ﬁbroblasts in re- sponse to local mitogens usually leads to irreversible renal failure characterized by tubulointerstitial nephritis. Re- cent therapeutic interventions in renal ﬁbrosis are directed toward inhibiting ﬁbroblast formation by shifting local cytokine balance in favor of reversal mesenchymal– epithelial transition. \u0002 HISTOPHYSIOLOGY OF THE KIDNEY The countercurrent multiplier system creates hyperos- motic urine. The term countercurrent indicates a flow of fluid in adjacent structures in opposite directions. The ability to excrete hyper- osmotic urine depends on the countercurrent multiplier system that involves three structures: • Loop of Henle, which acts as a countercurrent multiplier. The ultrafiltrate moves within the descending limb of the thin segment of the loop toward the renal papilla and moves back toward the corticomedullary junction within the ascending limb of the thin segment. The osmotic gradients of the medulla are established along the axis of the loop of Henle. • Vasa recta, form loops parallel to the loop of Henle. They act as countercurrent exchangers of water and solutes be- tween the descending part (arteriolae rectae) and ascending part (venulae rectae) of the vasa recta. The vasa recta help to maintain the osmotic gradient of the medulla. • Collecting duct in the medulla acts as an osmotic equili- brating device. Modified ultrafiltrate in the collecting ducts can be further equilibrated with the hyperosmotic medullary interstitium. The level of equilibration depends on activation of ADH-dependent water channels (AQP-2). A standing gradient of ion concentration produces hyper- osmotic urine by a countercurrent multiplier effect. The loop of Henle creates and maintains a gradient of ion concentration in the medullary interstitium that increases from the corticomedullary junction to the renal papilla. As noted above, the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle is freely permeable to water, whereas the ascending limb of the loop of Henle is impermeable to water. Further, the thin ascending limb cells add Na \u0002 and Cl \u0007 to the interstitium. Because water cannot leave the thin ascending limb, the in- terstitium becomes hyperosmotic relative to the luminal con- tents. Although some of the Cl \u0007 and Na \u0002 of the interstitium diffuses back into the nephron at the thin descending limb, the ions are transported out again in the thin ascending limb and distal straight tubule (thick ascending limb). This produces the countercurrent multiplier effect. Thus, the concentration of NaCl in the interstitium gradually increases down the length of the loop of Henle and, consequently, through the thickness of the medulla from the corticomedullary junction to the papilla. Vasa recta containing descending arterioles and ascending venules act as countercurrent exchangers. For an understanding of the countercurrent exchange mechanism, it is necessary to resume the description of the renal circulation at the point at which the efferent arteriole leaves the renal corpuscle. The efferent arterioles of the renal corpuscles of most of the cortex branch to form the capillary network that sur- rounds the tubular portions of the nephron in the cortex, the peritubular capillary network. The efferent arterioles of the juxtamedullary renal corpuscles form several unbranched arterioles that descend into the medullary pyramid. These arteriolae rectae make a hairpin turn deep in the medullary 720 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 720 721 Water permeability of the epithelium of the collecting ducts is regulated by antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin), a hormone produced in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. ADH increases the permeability of the collecting duct to water, thereby producing more-concentrated urine. At the molecu- lar level, ADH acts on ADH-regulated water channels, aqua- porin 2 (AQP-2), located in the epithelium of the terminal portion of the distal convoluted tubule and in the epithelium of the collecting tubules and ducts. However, the action of ADH is more significant in the collecting tubules and collect- ing ducts. ADH binds to receptors on the cells of these tubules and triggers the following actions: • Translocation of the AQP-2–containing intracyto- plasmic vesicles into the apical cell surface—a short- term effect. This results in an increased number of available AQP-2 channels at the cell surface, thus increas- ing water permeability of the epithelium. • Synthesis of AQPs-2 and their insertion into the apical cell membrane—a long-term effect An increase in plasma osmolality or a decrease in blood volume stimulates release of ADH, as does nicotine. In the absence of ADH, copious, dilute urine is produced. This condition is called central diabetes insipidus (CDI). Recent studies indicate that mutation of two genes encoding AQP-2 and ADH receptors is responsible for a form of CDI called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In this disease, the kidney does not respond to ADH because of defective AQP-2 and ADH receptor proteins synthesized by the col- lecting tubule and duct epithelial cells. Excess water con- sumption can also inhibit ADH release, thereby promoting the production of a large volume of hyposmotic urine. Increased secretion of ADH can produce an extremely hyperosmotic urine, thereby conserving water in the body. Inadequate consumption of water or loss of water because of sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea stimulates release of ADH. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the epithelium of the distal and collecting tubules and pro- motes the production of a small volume of hyperosmotic urine. • FOLDER 20.6 Functional Considerations: Hormonal Regulation of Collecting Duct Function pyramid and ascend as the venulae rectae. Together, the de- scending arterioles and the ascending venules are called the vasa recta. The arteriolae rectae form capillary plexuses lined by fenestrated endothelium that supply the tubular structures at the various levels of the medullary pyramid. Interaction between collecting ducts, loops of Henle, and vasa recta is required for concentrating urine by the coun- tercurrent exchange mechanism. Because the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle has a high level of transport activity and because it is impermeable to water, the modified ultrafiltrate that ultimately reaches the distal con- voluted tubule is hyposmotic. When ADH is present, the distal convoluted tubules, the collecting tubules, and the collecting ducts are highly permeable to water. Therefore, within the cor- tex, in which the interstitium is isosmotic with blood, the mod- ified ultrafiltrate within the distal convoluted tubule equilibrates and becomes isosmotic, partly by loss of water to the interstitium and partly by addition of ions other than Na \u0002 and Cl \u0007 to the ul- trafiltrate. In the medulla, increasing amounts of water leave the ultrafiltrate as the collecting ducts pass through the increasingly hyperosmotic interstitium on their course to the papillae. As noted previously, the vasa rectae also form loops in the medulla that parallel the loop of Henle. This arrangement en- sures that the vessels provide circulation to the medulla without disturbing the osmotic gradient established by transport of Cl \u0007 in the epithelium of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The vasa recta form a countercurrent exchange system in the following manner: Both the arterial and venous sides of the loop are thin-walled vessels that form plexuses of fenes- trated capillaries at all levels in the medulla. As the arterial vessels descend through the medulla, the blood loses water to the interstitium and gains salt from the interstitium so that at the tip of the loop, deep in the medulla, the blood is essen- tially in equilibrium with the hyperosmotic interstitial fluid. As the venous vessels ascend toward the corticomedullary junction, the process is reversed (i.e., the hyperosmotic blood loses salt to the interstitium and gains water from the intersti- tium). This passive countercurrent exchange of water and salt be- tween the blood and the interstitium occurs without expenditure of energy by the endothelial cells. The energy that drives this sys- tem is the same energy that drives the multiplier system, namely, the movement of Na \u0002 and Cl \u0007 out of the cells of the water- impermeable ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The counter- current exchange system and other movements of molecules in different parts of the nephron are shown in Figure 20.23. \u0002 BLOOD SUPPLY Some aspects of the blood supply of the kidney have been described in relation to specific functions (i.e., glomerular fil- tration, control of blood pressure, and countercurrent ex- change). It remains, however, to provide an overall description of the blood supply of the kidney. Each kidney receives a large branch from the abdominal aorta, called the renal artery. The renal artery branches within the renal sinus and sends interlobar arteries into the substance of the kidney (Fig. 20.24). These arteries travel be- tween the pyramids as far as the cortex and then turn to fol- low an arched course along the base of the pyramid between the medulla and the cortex. Thus, these interlobar arteries are designated arcuate arteries.chapter 20Urinary System\u0003BLOOD SUPPLY 721 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 721 Interlobular arteries branch from the arcuate arteries and ascend through the cortex toward the capsule. Although the boundaries between lobules are not distinct, the interlobular arteries, when included in a section cut perpendicular to the ves- sel, are located midway between adjacent medullary rays, travel- ing in the cortical labyrinth. As they traverse the cortex toward the capsule, the interlobular arteries give off branches, the affer- ent arterioles, one to each glomerulus. A single afferent arteri- ole may spring directly from the interlobular artery, or a common stem from the interlobular artery may branch to form several afferent arterioles. Some interlobular arteries terminate near the periphery of the cortex, whereas others enter the kidney capsule to provide its arterial supply. Afferent arterioles give rise to the capillaries that form the glomerulus. The glomerular capillaries reunite to form an ef- ferent arteriole that, in turn, gives rise to a second network of capillaries, the peritubular capillaries. The arrangement of these capillaries differs according to whether they originate from cortical or juxtamedullary glomeruli. • Efferent arterioles from cortical glomeruli lead into a peritubular capillary network that surrounds the local uriniferous tubules (G1 and G2, Fig. 20.24). • Efferent arterioles from juxtamedullary glomeruli de- scend into the medulla alongside the loop of Henle; they break up into smaller vessels that continue toward the apex of the pyramid but make hairpin turns at various levels to 722 Na+ H2O H2O H2O H2O H2O H2O H2O H2O H2O Cl- Cl- K+ K+ K+ H+ H+ H+glomerulus glucose amino acids polypeptides distal convoluted tubule collecting tubule proximal convoluted tubule loop of Henleurea thin descending limb collecting ductMEDULLACORTEX urea distal straight tubule H2O Na+ organic acids Ca2+ Mg2+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Cl- thin ascending limb proximal straight tubule Active transport Active exchange Active cotransport Passive diffusion ADH-dependent H2O movement Aquaporin-dependent H2O movement (AQP)2 2 2 3 3 H+ bicarbonate anion bicarbonate anion Na+ Na+ K+ 1 1 K+K+ Cl- FIGURE 20.23 • Diagram showing movement of substances into and out of the nephron and collecting system.

The renal artery gives rise to interlobar arteries that branch into arcuate arteries at the border between the medulla and cortex. Interlobular arteries (IL) branch from the arcuate arteries and travel toward the renal capsule, giving off afferent arterioles to the glomeruli (G). Glomeruli in the outer part of the cortex (G1, G2) send efferent arterioles to the peritubular capillaries (PC) that surround the tubules in the cortex; glomeruli near the medulla (G3), the juxtamedullary glomeruli, send efferent arterioles almost entirely into the medullary plexus (MP) of capillaries via the arteriolae rectae spuriae (ARS). Blood returns from the capillaries via veins that enter the arcuate veins. Stellate veins (SV ) near the capsule drain both the capsular (CC) and the peritubular capillaries. return as straight vessels toward the base of the pyramid (see G3, Fig. 20.24). Thus, the efferent arterioles from the jux- tamedullary glomeruli give rise to vasa recta involved in the countercurrent exchange system and their peritubular capillary network. These vessels are described in the expla- nation of the countercurrent exchange system (page 721). Generally, venous flow in the kidney follows a reverse course to arterial flow, with the veins running in parallel with the corresponding arteries (see Fig. 20.24). Thus, • Peritubular cortical capillaries drain into interlobular veins, which in turn drain into arcuate veins, interlobar veins, and the renal vein. • The medullary vascular network drains into arcuate veins and so forth. • Peritubular capillaries near the kidney surface and capil- laries of the capsule drain into stellate veins (so called for their pattern of distribution when viewed from the kidney surface), which drain into interlobular veins , and so forth. \u0002 LYMPHATIC VESSELS The kidneys contain two major networks of lymphatic vessels. These networks are not usually visible in routine histologic sec- tions but can be demonstrated by experimental methods. One network is located in the outer regions of the cortex and drains into larger lymphatic vessels in the capsule. The other network is located more deeply in the substance of the kidney and drains into large lymphatic vessels in the renal sinus. There are numerous anastomoses between the two lymphatic networks. \u0002 NERVE SUPPLY The fibers that form the renal plexus are derived mostly from the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous sys- tem. They cause contraction of vascular smooth muscle and consequent vasoconstriction. • Constriction of the afferent arterioles to the glomeruli reduces the filtration rate and decreases the production of urine. • Constriction of the efferent arterioles from the glomeruli increases the filtration rate and increases the production of urine. • Loss of sympathetic innervation leads to increased urinary output. It is evident, however, that the extrinsic nerve supply is not necessary for normal renal function. Although the nerve fibers to the kidney are cut during renal transplantation, transplanted kidneys subsequently function normally. \u0002 URETER, URINARY BLADDER, AND URETHRA All excretory passages, except the urethra, have the same general organization. On leaving the collecting ducts at the area cribrosa, the urine enters a series of structures that do not modify it but are specialized to store and pass the urine to the exterior of the body. The urine flows sequentially to a minor calyx, a major calyx, and the renal pelvis, and leaves each kidney through the ureter to the urinary bladder, where it is stored. The urine is finally voided through the urethra. All of these excretory passages, except the urethra, have the same general structures, namely, a mucosa (lined by transi- tional epithelium), muscularis, and adventitia (or, in some re- gions, a serosa). Transitional epithelium lines the calyces, ureters, bladder, and the initial segment of the urethra. Transitional epithelium (urothelium) lines the excretory passages leading from the kidney. This stratified epithelium is essentially impermeable to salts and water. The epithelium begins in the minor calyces as two cell layers and increases to an apparent four to five layers in the ureter (Fig. 20.25) and as many as six or more layers in the empty bladder. However, 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 723 when the bladder is distended, as few as three layers are seen. This change reflects the ability of the cells to accommodate to distension. The cells in the distended bladder, particularly the large surface cells and those in the layers below, flatten and unfold to accommodate the increasing surface area. As the in- dividual cells unfold and flatten, the resulting appearance is the “true” three layers. In routine histologic sections obtained from the empty bladder, the surface epithelial cells are usually cuboidal and bulge into the lumen. They are frequently described as “dome shaped” or “umbrella” cells because of the curvature of the apical surface (see Fig. 20.25). When examined with the TEM, the plasma membrane exhibits an un- usual feature (e.g., modified areas of the plasma membrane called plaques) are seen (Fig. 20.26). These plaques appear to be more rigid and thicker (up to 12 nm) than the rest of the apical plasma membrane. Actin filaments are observed stretching from the inner surface of the plaques into the cytoplasm. In the undistended urinary bladder, the plaques give the luminal surface of cells an ir- regular scalloped contour (Fig. 20.27). Each cell appears to fold inward on itself. Because of this folding, the plaques appear as a series of fusiform vesicles. Their lumina, however, are in continuity with the cell’s exterior. As the bladder distends, the fusiform vesicles unfold and become part of the surface as the cell stretches and flattens (Fig. 20.28). Smooth muscle of the urinary passages is arranged in bundles. A dense collagenous lamina propria underlies the urothelium throughout the excretory passages. Neither a muscularis mucosae nor a submucosal layer is present in their walls. In the tubular portions (ureters and urethra), usually two layers of smooth muscle lie beneath the lamina propria: • Longitudinal layer, the inner layer that is arranged in a loose spiral pattern • Circular layer, the outer layer that is arranged in a tight spiral pattern Note that this arrangement of the smooth muscle is opposite that of the muscularis externa of the intestinal tract. The smooth muscle of the urinary passages is mixed with connec- tive tissue, so that it forms parallel bundles rather than pure 724 EpEp BVBV Ep BV FIGURE 20.25 • Photomicrograph of transitional epithelium (urothelium).

Peristaltic contractions of the smooth mus- cle move the urine from the minor calyces through the ureter to the bladder. Ureters Each ureter conducts urine from the renal pelvis to the uri- nary bladder and is approximately 24 to 34 cm long. The distal part of the ureter enters the urinary bladder and fol- lows an oblique path through the wall of the bladder. Tran- sitional epithelium (urothelium) lines the luminal surface of the wall of the ureter. The remainder of the wall is com- posed of smooth muscle and connective tissue. The smooth muscle is arranged in three layers: an inner longitudinal layer, a middle circular layer, and an outer longitudinal layer (Plate 78, page 736). However, the outer longitudinal layer is present only at the distal end of the ureter. Usually, the ureter is embedded in the retroperitoneal adipose tissue. The adipose tissue, vessels, and nerves form the adventitia of the ureter. As the bladder distends with urine, the openings of the ureters are compressed, reducing the possibility of reflux of urine into the ureters. Contraction of the smooth muscle of the bladder wall also compresses the openings of the ureters into the bladder. This action helps prevent the spread of in- fection from the bladder and urethra, frequent sites of chronic infection (particularly in females), to the kidney. In the terminal portion of the ureters, a thick outer layer of longitudinal muscle is present in addition to the two listed above, particularly in the portion of the ureter that passes through the bladder wall. Most descriptions of the bladder musculature indicate that this longitudinal layer continues into the wall of the bladder to form a principal component of its wall. The smooth muscle of the bladder, however, is not as clearly separated into distinctive layers. aa bb a b FVFV FVFV FVFV FV FV FV FIGURE 20.27 • Transmission electron micrograph of the apical portion of a transitional epithelial cell. a.

The fusiform vesicles are formed by the infolding of the plaques in the cells of the relaxed urinary bladder. \u000460,000. interplaque region interplaque region invaginated plaque plaque plaque filaments FIGURE 20.28 • Diagrams of the luminal surface of transitional epithelial cells. The upper drawing depicts part of a surface cell in a distended bladder; the lower drawing depicts the same cell as it would appear in a relaxed bladder. The plasma membrane is thickened in regions to form plaques. The interplaque regions consist of membrane that is not thickened. In the relaxed bladder, the plaques are invaginated into the cell, and although they retain their continuity with the surface, the invaginated plaques typically appear as isolated fusiform vesicles in electron micrographs. Filaments attached to the undersurface of the plaques may prevent undue stretching in the distended bladder. (Modified from Staehelin LA, Chlapowski FJ, Bonneville MA.

It contains three openings, two for the ureters (ureteric oriﬁces) and one for the urethra (internal urethral oriﬁce). The triangular region defined by these three openings, the trigone, is relatively smooth and constant in thickness, whereas the rest of the bladder wall is thick and folded when the bladder is empty and thin and smooth when the bladder is distended. These differ- ences reflect the embryologic origins of the trigone and the rest of the bladder wall: the trigone is derived from the em- bryonic mesonephric ducts, and the major portion of the wall originates from the cloaca. The smooth muscle of the bladder wall forms the detrusor muscle. Toward the opening of the urethra, the muscle fibers form the involuntary internal urethral sphincter, a ringlike arrangement of muscle around the opening of the urethra. The smooth muscle bundles of the detrusor muscle are less regularly arranged than that of the tubular portions of the excretory passages, and thus the muscle and collagen bundles are randomly mixed (Plate 79, page 738). Contraction of the detrusor muscle of the blad- der compresses the entire organ and forces the urine into the urethra. The bladder is innervated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system: • Sympathetic ﬁbers form a plexus in the adventitia of the bladder wall. These fibers probably innervate blood vessels in the wall. • Parasympathetic ﬁbers originate from S2 to S4 seg- ments of the spinal cord and travel with pelvic splanchnic nerves into the bladder. They end in terminal ganglia in the muscle bundles and the adventitia and are the efferent fibers of the micturition reﬂex. • Sensory ﬁbers from the bladder to the sacral portion of the spinal cord are the afferent fibers of the micturition reflex. Urethra The urethra is the fibromuscular tube that conveys urine from the urinary bladder to the exterior through the external urethral oriﬁce. The size, structure, and functions of the urethra differ in males and females. In the male, the urethra serves as the terminal duct for both the urinary and genital systems. It is about 20 cm long and has three distinct segments: • Prostatic urethra extends for 3 to 4 cm from the neck of the bladder through the prostate gland (see page 785). It is lined with transitional epithelium (urothelium). The ejac- ulatory ducts of the genital system enter the posterior wall of this segment, and many small prostatic ducts also empty into this segment. • Membranous urethra extends for about 1 cm from the apex of the prostate gland to the bulb of the penis. It passes through the deep perineal pouch of the pelvic floor as it enters the perineum. Skeletal muscle of the deep perineal pouch surrounding the membranous ure- thra forms the external (voluntary) sphincter of the urethra. Transitional epithelium ends in the membranous urethra. This segment is lined with a stratified or pseudos- tratified columnar epithelium that resembles the epithe- lium of the genital duct system more than it resembles the epithelium of the more proximal portions of the urinary duct system. • Penile (spongy) urethra extends for about 15 cm through the length of the penis and opens on the body sur- face at the glans penis. The penile urethra is surrounded by the corpus spongiosum as it passes through the length of the penis. It is lined with pseudostratified colum- nar epithelium except at its distal end, where it is lined with stratified squamous epithelium continuous with that of the skin of the penis. Ducts of the bulbourethral glands (Cowper’s glands) and of the mucus-secreting urethral glands (glands of Littré) empty into the penile urethra. In the female, the urethra is short, measuring 3 to 5 cm in length from the bladder to the vestibule of the vagina, where it normally terminates just posterior to the clitoris. The mucosa is traditionally described as having longitudinal folds. As in the male urethra, the lining is initially transitional ep- ithelium, a continuation of the bladder epithelium, but changes to stratified squamous epithelium before its termina- tion. Some investigators have reported the presence of strati- fied columnar and pseudostratified columnar epithelium in the midportion of the female urethra. Numerous small urethral glands, particularly in the prox- imal part of the urethra, open into the urethral lumen. Other glands, the paraurethral glands, which are homol- ogous to the prostate gland in the male, secrete into the common paraurethral ducts. These ducts open on each side of the external urethral orifice. They produce an alka- line secretion. The lamina propria is a highly vascularized layer of connective tissue that resembles the corpus spongio- sum in the male. Where the urethra penetrates the urogeni- tal diaphragm (membranous part of the urethra), the striated muscle of this structure forms the external (volun- tary) urethral sphincter. 726 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 72672006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 727 This page intentionally left blank. PLATE 74 •KIDNEY I 728 \u0003 PLATE 74 KIDNEY I The urinary system consists of the paired kidneys, the paired ureters, which lead from the kidneys to the urinary bladder, and the urethra, which leads from the bladder to the exterior of the body. The kidneys conserve body fluid and electrolytes and remove metabolic wastes such as urea, uric acid, creatinine, and breakdown products of various substances. They produce urine, initially an ultrafiltrate of blood that is modi- fied by selective resorption and specific secretion by kidney tubule cells. The kidneys also function as endocrine organs, producing erythropoi- etin, a growth factor that regulates red blood cell formation, and renin, a hormone involved in blood pressure and blood volume control. They also hydroxylate vitamin D, a steroid prohormone, to produce its active form. Each kidney is a flattened, bean-shaped structure approximately 10 cm long, 6.5 cm wide (from convex to concave border), and 3 cm thick. The concave medial border of each kidney contains a hilum, an indented region through which blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels enter and leave the kidney. The funnel-shaped origin of the ureter, the renal pelvis, also leaves the kidney at the hilum. A cut, hemi- sected fresh kidney reveals two distinct regions: a cortex, the reddish-brown outer region, and a medulla, a much lighter inner part continu- ous with the renal pelvis. The cortex is characterized by renal corpuscles and their tubules, including the convoluted and straight tubules of the nephron, the collecting tubules, and an extensive vascular supply.

A histologic section including the cortex and part of the medulla is shown here. Located at the boundary between the two (partly marked by the dashed line) are numerous profiles of arcuate arteries (AA) and arcuate veins (AV ). The most distinc- tive feature of the renal cortex, regardless of the plane of section, is the presence of the renal corpuscles (RC). These are spherical structures composed of a glomerulus (glomerular vascular tuft) surrounded by the visceral and parietal epithelium of Bowman’s capsule. Also seen in the cortex are groups of tubules that are more or less straight and disposed in a radial direc- tion from the base of the medulla (arrows); these are the medullary rays. In contrast, the medulla presents profiles of tubular structures that are arranged as gentle curves in the outer part of the medulla, turning slightly to become straight in the inner part of the medulla. The disposition of the tubules (and blood vessels) gives the cut face of the pyramid a slightly striated appearance that is also evident in the gross specimen (see figure above). Kidney, human, fresh specimen ×3. A frontal section through the cortex and medulla of an unem- balmed kidney obtained from autopsy is shown here. The vis- ible hilar region consists of minor calyces (grey/white) surrounded by yellow in appearance adipose tissue. The outer part of the kidney has a reddish-brown appearance; this is the cortex. It is easily distinguished from the inner portion, the medulla, which is further divided into an outer portion (OM), identified here by the pres- ence of straight blood vessels, the vasa recta (VR), and an inner portion (IM), which has a lighter and more homogenous appearance. The medulla consists of renal pyramids, which have their base facing the cortex and their apex in the form of a papilla (P) is directed towards the hilum. The pyra- mids are separated, sometimes only partially as in this figure, by cortical material that is designated the renal columns (RC). The majority of the outer part of the pyramid on the left, has not been included in the plane of the section. The papillae are free tips of the pyramids that project into the first of a series of large urine collecting spaces referred to as the minor ca- lyces (MC); the inner surface of the calyx is white. The minor calyces drain into major calyces, and in turn, these open into the renal pelvis, which funnels urine into the ureter. An interesting feature in this specimen is that the blood has been retained in many of the vessels, thereby allowing for visualization of several renal ves- sels in their geographic location. Among the vessels that can be identified in the cut face of the kidney shown here are the interlobular vessels (IV) within the cortex; the arcuate veins (AV) and the arcuate arteries (AA) at the base of the pyramids; the interlobar arteries (ILA) and veins (ILV) between renal pyramids and, in the medulla, the vessels going to and from the capillary net- work of the pyramid. The latter vessels, both arterioles and venules, are rela- tively straight and are designated collectively as the vasa recta (VR). (Specimen courtesy of Dr. Eric A. Pfeifer, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 728PLATE 74 •KIDNEY I 729 AVAV AAAAAVAV AAAA RCRC MedullaMedulla CortexCortexCortex Medulla RC AA AV AA AV IV cortex OM ILV P MC VR AV ILA IV AA IM RCol RCol IV cortex OM ILV P MC VR AV ILA IV AA IM RCol RCol 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 729PLATE 75 •KIDNEY II 730 Cortex, kidney, human, H&E ×60. The renal cortex can be divided into regions referred to as the cortical labyrinth (CL) and the medullary rays (MR). The cortical labyrinth contains the renal corpuscles (RC ), which appear as relatively large spherical structures. Surrounding each renal corpuscle are the proximal and distal convoluted tubules. They are also part of the cortical labyrinth. The convoluted tubules, particularly the proximal, because of their tortuosity, present a variety of profiles, most of which are oval or circular; others, more elongate, are in the shape of a letter J, a C, or even an S. The medullary rays are composed of groups of straight tubules oriented in the same direction and appear to radi- ate from the base of the pyramid. When the medullary rays are cut longitu- dinally, as they are in this figure, the tubules present elongated profiles. The medullary rays contain proximal straight tubules (thick segments; descend- ing limb of Henle’s loop), distal straight tubules (thick segments; ascending limbs of Henle’s loop), and collecting tubules. \u0003 PLATE 75 KIDNEY II The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney. There are about 2 million nephrons in each human kidney. They are responsible for the production of urine and correspond to the secretory part of other glands. The collecting tubules, responsible for the final concentration of the urine, are analogous to the ducts of exocrine glands. The nephron is made up of the renal corpuscle and the renal tubule. The renal corpuscle consists of the glomerulus, a tuft of 10 to 20 capillary loops, surrounded by a double-layered epithelial cup, the renal or Bowman’s capsule. The glomeru- lar capillaries are supplied at the vascular pole of Bowman’s capsule by an afferent arteriole and drained by an efferent arteriole that leaves Bow- man’s capsule at the vascular pole and then branches to form a new capillary network to supply the kidney tubules. The opposite pole of Bowman’s capsule, the urinary pole, is where the filtrate leaves the renal capsule. The tubular parts of the nephron are the proximal thick segment (consisting of the proximal convoluted tubule and the proximal straight tubule), the thin segment, which constitutes the thin limb of the loop of Henle, and the distal thick segment, consisting of the distal straight tubule and the distal convoluted tubule. The loop of Henle is the U-shaped portion of the nephron consisting of the thick straight portions of the proximal and distal tubules and the thin segment between them. The distal convoluted tubule joins the collecting tubule. The nephron and the collecting tubule constitute the uriniferous tubule. KEY CL, cortical labyrinth MR, medullary ray RC, renal corpuscle dashed line, approximate boundary of the medullary ray Cortex, kidney, human, H&E ×120. This figure presents another profile of the renal cortex, at a somewhat higher magnification, cut in a plane at a right angle to the section in figure above. The peripheral part of the mi- crograph shows the cortical labyrinth in which the tubules display chiefly round and oval profiles but also some that are more elongate and curved. The appearance is the same as the cortical labyrinth areas of figure above. A renal corpuscle (RC ) is also present in the cortical labyrinth. In contrast, the profiles presented by the tubules of the medullary ray in this figure are quite different from those seen in figure above. All of the tubules bounded by the dashed line belong to the medullary ray (MR), and all are cut in cross section. A general survey of the tubules within the medullary ray reveals that sev- eral distinct types can be recognized on the basis of the size of the tubule, shape of the lumen, and size of the tubule cells. These features as well as those of the cortical labyrinth are considered in Plate 76. 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 730PLATE 75 •KIDNEY II 731 RCRC MRMR CLCL MRMR RCRCRC MR MRMRMR MRMRMR CL MR RC 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 731PLATE 76 •KIDNEY III 732 Proximal and distal convoluted tubules, kidney, human, H&E ×240. In this figure, an area of cortical labyrinth, there are six distal convoluted tubule (DC) profiles. The proximal convoluted tubules (unlabeled) have a slightly larger outside diameter than the distal tubules have. The proximal tubules have a brush border, whereas the distal tubules have a cleaner, sharper luminal surface. The lumen of the proximal tubules is often star shaped; this is not the case with distal tubules. Typically, fewer nuclei appear in a cross section of a proximal tubule than in an equivalent segment of a distal tubule. Most of the above points can also be utilized in distinguishing the straight portions of the proximal and distal thick segments in the medullary rays, as shown in figure on right. \u0003 PLATE 76 KIDNEY III Proximal and distal convoluted tubules display features that aid in their identification in H&E-stained paraffin sections. Proximal convoluted tubules generally have a larger diameter than distal tubules have; cross sections of the lumen often appear stellate. A brush border (apical microvilli) is often visible on the proximal tubule cells. Also, the proximal convoluted tubule is more than twice as long as the distal convo- luted tubule; thus, the majority of tubular profiles in the cortical labyrinth will be of proximal tubules. Mesangial cells and their extracellular matrix constitute the mesangium of the renal corpuscle. They underlie the endothelium of the cap- illaries of the glomerular tuft and extend to the vascular pole, where they become part of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. The terminal portion of the distal thick segment of the nephron lies close to the afferent arteriole. Tubule epithelial cells closest to the arteriole are thinner, taller, and more closely packed than other tubule cells and constitute the macula densa. Arterial smooth muscle cells opposite the macula densa are modified into juxtaglomerular cells that secrete renin in response to decreased blood NaCl concentration.

In this figure, all of the tubular profiles within the medullary ray are rounded except for a proximal convoluted tubule (PC) in- cluded in the lower right corner of the figure (it belongs to the adjacent cortical labyrinth). Second, the number of proximal straight (P) and distal straight (D) tubular profiles are about equal in the medullary ray, as is shown by the labeling of each tubule in this figure. Note that, in contrast to the distal straight tubules, the proximal straight tubules display a brush border and have a larger outside diameter, with many displaying a star-shaped lumen. The medullary ray also contains collecting tubules (CT ). They are considered in Plate 77. Renal corpuscles, kidney, human, H&E ×360. The renal corpuscle appears as a spherical structure whose periphery is composed of a thin capsule that encloses a narrow clear-appearing space, the urinary space (asterisks), and a cap- illary tuft or glomerulus that appears as a large cellular mass. The capsule of the renal corpuscle, known as the renal or Bowman’s capsule, actually has two parts: a parietal layer, which is marked (BC ), and a visceral layer. The parietal layer consists of simple squamous epithelial cells. The visceral layer consists of cells, called podocytes (Pod ), that lie on the outer surface of the glomerular capillary. Except where they clearly line the urinary space, as the labeled cells do in fig- ure on left, podocytes may be difficult to distinguish from the capillary en- dothelial cells. To complicate matters, the mesangial cells are also a component of the glomerulus. In general, nuclei of podocytes are larger and stain less intensely than do the endothelial and mesangial cell nuclei. A distal (DC) and two proximal (PC) convoluted tubules are marked in figure on left. The cells of the distal tubule are more crowded on one side. These crowded cells constitute the macula densa (MD) that lies adjacent to the afferent arteriole. In figure on right, both the vascular pole and the urinary pole of the renal corpuscle are evident. The vascular pole is characterized by the pres- ence of arterioles (A), one of which is entering or leaving (double-headed arrow) the corpuscle. The afferent arteriole possesses modified smooth mus- cle cells with granules, the juxtaglomerular cells (not evident in this figure). At the urinary pole, the parietal layer of Bowman’s capsule is continuous with the beginning of the proximal convoluted tubule (PC ). Here, the uri- nary space of the renal corpuscle continues into the lumen of the proximal tubule, and the lining cells change from simple squamous to simple cuboidal or low columnar with a brush border. 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 732PLATE 76 •KIDNEY III 733 DCDC A PodPod MDMD BCBC PCPC P D DCDCDC DCDCDC DCDCDCDCDCDC DCDCDC DCDCDC D DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DDDD DD DD DD DD DD CT CT PC P PP PP PP PP PP PP PP PP PP PP PP PP PP PC PCPCPC BC BCBCBC DC MD Pod A A BC DC * * * * * * PC PC 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 733PLATE 77 •KIDNEY IV 734 Medulla, kidney, human, H&E ×240. A section through the outer portion of the medulla is shown in this figure. This region contains proximal and distal thick segments, thin segments, and collecting tubules. All of the tubules are parallel, and all are cut in cross section; thus, they present circular profiles. The proximal straight tubules (P) display typical star-shaped lumina and a brush border (or the fragmented apical cell surface from which the brush border has been partially broken). These tubules have outside diameters that are generally larger than those of the distal straight tubules (D). As mentioned previously and as shown here, the distal straight tubules display a larger number of nuclei than do comparable segments of proximal straight tubule cells. Note, also, that the lumen of the distal tubule is more rounded and the apical surface of the cells is sharper. The collecting tubules (CT ) have outer diameters that are about the same as those of the proximal tubules and larger than those of dis- tal tubules. The cells forming the collecting tubules are cuboidal and smaller than those of proximal tubules; thus, they also display a relatively larger number of nuclei than do comparable segments of proximal tubule cells. Count them! Finally, boundaries between the cells that constitute the col- lecting tubules are usually evident (asterisks); this serves as one of the most dependable features for the identification of collecting tubules. The thin segments (T ) have the thinnest walls of all renal tubules seen in the medulla. They are formed by a low cuboidal or simple squa- mous epithelium, as seen here, and the lumina are relatively large. Occa- sionally, a section includes the region of transition from a thick to a thin segment and can be recognized even in a cross section through the tubule. One such junction is evident in this figure (the tubule with two arrows in the lumen). On one side, the tubule cell (left-pointing arrow) is characteristic of the proximal segment; it possesses a distinctive brush border. The other side of the tubule (right-pointing arrow) is composed of low cuboidal cells that resemble the cells forming the thin segments. In addition to the renal and collecting tubules, there are many other small tubular structures in this figure. Thin-walled and lined by endothelium, they are small blood vessels. \u0003 PLATE 77 KIDNEY IV Renal corpuscles are restricted to the cortical labyrinth. The medulla contains the thick straight segments of proximal and distal tubules, along with their thin segments, the collecting tubules and ducts, and the blood vessels that run in parallel with them. These structures function as the countercurrent multiplier and countercurrent exchange systems that, ultimately, produce hypertonic urine. The final urine drains from the papillary ducts (of Bellini) into calyces that then empty into the renal pelvis.

This figure shows a renal pyramid at low magnification. The pyramid is a conical structure composed principally of medullary straight tubules, ducts, and the straight blood ves- sels (vasa recta). The dashed line at the left of the micrograph is placed at the junction between cortex and medulla; thus, it marks the base of the pyramid. Note the arcuate vessels (AV ) that lie at the boundary of cortex and medulla. They define the boundary line. The few renal corpuscles (RC), upper left, belong to the renal column of the medulla. They are referred to as juxtamedullary corpuscles. The pyramid is somewhat distorted in this specimen, as evidenced by re- gions of longitudinally sectioned tubules, lower left, and cross-sectioned and obliquely sectioned tubules in other regions. In effect, part of the pyramid was bent, thus the change in the plane of section of the tubules. The apical portion of the pyramid (arrowhead), known as the renal papilla, is lodged in a cup- or funnel-like structure referred to as the calyx. It collects the urine that leaves the tip of the papilla from the papillary ducts (of Bellini). (The actual tip of the papilla is not seen within the plane of sec- tion, nor are the openings of the ducts at this low magnification.) The sur- face of the papilla that faces the lumen of the minor calyx is simple columnar or cuboidal epithelium (SCEp). (In places, this epithelium has separated from the surface of the papilla and appears as a thin strand of tis- sue.) The calyx is lined by transitional epithelium (TEp). Although not evi- dent at the low magnification shown here, the boundary between the columnar epithelium covering the papilla and the transitional epithelium covering the inner surface of the calyx is marked by the diamonds. 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 734PLATE 77 •KIDNEY IV 735 PyramidPyramid AVAV RCRC SCEpSCEp TEpTEp P P P P P P P P T T D D D D D D D D D D CT CT * * * ** T TEp SCEp RC SCEpSCEpSCEp TEpTEpTEp AV AVAVAV PyramidYVYV 72006_ch20 15/07/10 3:49 PM Page 735PLATE 78 •URETER 736 Ureter, monkey, H&E ×160. The wall of the ureter from the rectangular area in the orienta- tion micrograph is examined at higher magnification in this figure. One can immediately recognize the thick epithelial lin- ing, which appears distinct and sharply delineated from the re- mainder of the wall. This is the transitional epithelium (urothelium), (Ep). The remainder of the wall is made up of connective tis- sue (CT ) and smooth muscle. The latter can be recognized as the darker- staining layer. The section also shows some adipose tissue (AT ), a component of the adventitia. The transitional epithelium and its supporting connective tissue constitute the mucosa (Muc). A distinct submucosa is not present, although the term is sometimes applied to the connective tissue that is closest to the muscle. The muscularis (Mus) is arranged as an inner longitudinal layer (SM(l)), a middle circular layer (SMc), and an outer longitudinal layer (SM(l)). However, the outer longitudinal layer is present only at the lower end of the ureter. In a cross section through the ureter, the inner and outer smooth muscle layers are cut in cross section, whereas the middle circular layer of the muscle cells is cut longitudinally. This is as they appear in this figure. \u0003 PLATE 78 URETER The ureters are paired tubular structures that convey urine from the kid- neys to the urinary bladder. They are lined with transitional epithelium (urothelium), an impervious layer that lines the urinary excretory passa - ges from the renal calyces through the urethra. The ability of this epithe- lium to become thinner and flatter allows all of these passages to accommodate to distension by the urine. The epithelium rests on a dense collagenous lamina propria, which in turn, rests on an inner longitudinal and an outer circular layer of smooth muscle. Regular peristaltic contractions of this muscle contribute to the flow of urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder. ORIENTATION MICROGRAPH: As shown in this low-power orienta- tion micrograph, the wall of the ureter consists of a mucosa (Muc), a muscularis (Mus), and an adventitia (Adv). Note that the ureters are lo- cated behind the peritoneum of the abdominal cavity in their course to the bladder. Thus, a serosa (Ser) may be found covering a portion of the circumference of the tube. Also, because of contraction of the smooth muscle of the muscularis, the luminal surface is characteristically folded, thus creating a star-shaped lumen.

This figure shows the inner longitudinal smooth muscle layer (SM(l)) at higher magnification. Note that the nuclei appear as round profiles, indicating that the muscle cells have been cross- sectioned. This figure also shows the transitional epithelium (Ep) to advantage. The surface cells of the transitional epithe- lium (urothelium) are characteristically the largest, and some are binucleate (arrow). The basal cells are the smallest, and typically, the nuclei appear crowded because of the minimal cytoplasm of each cell. The intermediate cells appear to consist of several layers and are composed of cells larger in size than the basal cells but smaller than the surface cells.

This micrograph shows most of the entire thickness of the uri- nary bladder. An unusual feature is the presence of one of the ureters (U ) as it is passing through the bladder wall to empty its contents into the bladder lumen. The transitional epithelium (Ep) lining the bladder is seen on the right. Beneath the epithe- lium is a relatively thick layer of connective tissue (CT ) containing blood vessels (BV ) of various sizes. Note that the connective tissue stains more eosinophilic than the smooth muscle of the underlying muscularis (M). The epithelium and connective tissue constitute the mucosa of the bladder. The muscularis consists of smooth muscle arranged in three indistinct layers. It should be noted that as the ureter passes through the bladder wall, it carries with it a layer of longitudinally oriented smooth muscle (SM(L)). Medium- size arteries (A) and veins (V ) are occasionally seen in the muscularis. \u0003 PLATE 79 URINARY BLADDER The urinary bladder receives the urine from the two ureters and stores it until neural stimulation causes it to contract and expel the urine via the urethra. It, too, is lined with transitional epithelium (urothelium). Beneath the epithelium and its underlying con- nective tissue, the wall of the urinary bladder contains smooth muscle that is usually described as being arranged as an inner longitudinal layer, a middle circular layer, and an outer longitudinal layer. As in most distensible hollow viscera that empty their con- tents through a narrow aperture, the smooth muscle in the wall of the urinary bladder is less regularly arranged than the description indicates, allowing contraction to re- duce the volume relatively evenly throughout the bladder. ORIENTATION MICROGRAPH: This orientation micrograph of the urinary blad- der reveals the full thickness of the bladder wall. The luminal surface epithelium is at the top of the micrograph. One of the ureters can be seen as it passes through the bladder wall to empty its contents into the bladder lumen. Most of the tissue to the sides and below the ureteral profile is smooth muscle. Transitional epithelium, urinary bladder, human, H&E ×250. This higher magnification of the left rectangle of figure above shows the transitional epithelium (Ep) and the underlying connective tissue (CT ) that represent the mucosa of the ureter. Adjacent to the mucosa are bundles of longitudinally sectioned smooth muscle (SM(L)) that belong to the ureter. A small lymphatic vessel (Lym) is present in the connective tissue adjacent to the smooth muscle. Note the lymphocytes, identified by their small round densely stained nuclei, within the lumen of the vessel. Transitional epithelium, urinary bladder, human, H&E ×250. This higher magnification of the right rectangle of figure above shows the bladder transitional epithelium (Ep) and the un- derlying connective tissue (CT ) of the bladder wall. The tran- sitional epithelium is often characterized by the presence of surface cells that exhibit a “dome” shape. In addition, many of these cells are binucleate (arrows). The thickness of transitional epithelium is variable. When the bladder is fully distended, as few as three cell layers are seen.

The endocrine system produces a slower and more prolonged response than the nervous system. Both systems may act simultaneously on the same target cells and tissues, and some nerve cells secrete hormones. Hormones and Their Receptors In general, a hormone is described as a biologic substance acting on specific target cells. In the classic definition, a hormone is a secretory product of endocrine cells and organs that passes into the circulatory system (bloodstream) for transport to target cells. For years this endocrine control of target tissues became a central part of endocrinology. Recent research shows that a variety of hormones and hormonally active substances are not always Endocrine Organs OVERVIEW OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM / 740 Hormones and Their Receptors / 740 Regulation of Hormone Secretion and Feedback Mechanism / 742 PITUITARY GLAND (HYPOPHYSIS) / 742 Gross Structure and Development / 743 Blood Supply / 743 Nerve Supply / 745 Structure and Function of the Pituitary Gland / 745 Anterior Lobe of the Pituitary Gland (Adenohypophysis) / 745 Posterior Lobe of the Pituitary Gland (Neurohypophysis) / 748 HYPOTHALAMUS / 751 PINEAL GLAND / 752 THYROID GLAND / 755 PARATHYROID GLANDS / 760 ADRENAL GLANDS / 762 Blood Supply / 762 Cells of the Adrenal Medulla / 764 Zonation of the Adrenal Cortex / 766 Zona Glomerulosa / 766 Zona Fasciculata / 767 Zona Reticularis / 768 Fetal Adrenal Gland / 768 Folder 21.1 Functional Considerations: Regulation of Pituitary Gland Secretion / 743 Folder 21.2 Clinical Correlation: Principles of Endocrine Diseases / 750 Folder 21.3 Clinical Correlation: Pathologies Associated with ADH Secretion / 753 Folder 21.4 Clinical Correlation: Abnormal Thyroid Function / 758 Folder 21.5 Clinical Correlation: Chromaffin Cells and Pheochromocytoma / 766 Folder 21.6 Functional Considerations: Biosynthesis of Adrenal Hormones / 769 \u0002 OVERVIEW OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM The endocrine system produces various secretions called hormones [Gr. hormaein, to set in motion] that serve as effec- tors to regulate the activities of various cells, tissues, and organs in the body. Its functions are essential in maintaining home- ostasis and coordinating body growth and development and are similar to that of the nervous system: Both communicate information to peripheral cells and organs. Communication in the nervous system is through transmission of neural impulses along nerve cell processes and the discharge of neurotransmit- ter. Communication in the endocrine system is through hormones, which are carried to their destination via connec- tive tissue spaces and the vascular system. These two systems 740 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:05 PM Page 740chapter 21Endocrine Organs\u0003OVERVIEW OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 741 741 discharged into the bloodstream but are released into connec- tive tissue spaces. They may act on adjacent cells or diffuse to nearby target cells that express specific receptors for that par- ticular hormone. This type of hormonal action is referred to as paracrine control. In addition, some cells express recep- tors for hormones that they secrete. This type of hormonal action is referred to as autocrine control. These hormones regulate the cell’s own activity. Figure 21.1 summarizes various hormonal control mechanisms. Hormones include three classes of compounds. Cells of the endocrine system release more than 100 hormones and hormonally active substances that are chemically divided into three classes of compounds: • Steroids, cholesterol-derived compounds, are synthesized and secreted by cells of the ovaries, testes, and adrenal cortex. These hormones (gonadal and adrenocortical steroids) are released into the bloodstream and trans- ported to target cells with the help of plasma proteins or specialized carrier proteins such as androgen-binding protein. Hormone-binding carrier proteins protect the hormone from degradation during transport to the target tissue. When needed, the hormone is released from the carrier protein to become active. • Small peptides, polypeptides,and proteins are syn- thesized and secreted by cells of the hypothalamus, pitu- itary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, pancreas, and scattered enteroendocrine cells of the gastrointesti- nal tract and respiratory system. This group of hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon, growth hormone [GH], adreno - corticotropic hormone [ACTH], follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], antidi- uretic hormone [ADH], oxytocin, interleukins, and various growth factors), when released into the cir- culation, dissolve readily in the blood and generally do not require special transport proteins. However, most if not all polypeptides and proteins have specific carrier proteins (e.g., insulin growth factor–binding protein (IGFBP). • Amino acids and arachidonic acid analogs, and their derivatives, including the catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine–phenylalanine/tyrosine derivatives) and prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and leukotrienes (arachi- donic acid derivatives). They are synthesized and secreted by many neurons as well as a variety of cells including cells of the adrenal medulla. Also included in this group of compounds are thyroid hormones, the iodinated deriva- tives of the amino acid tyrosine that are synthesized and secreted by the thyroid gland. When released into the cir- culation, catecholamines dissolve readily in the blood, in contrast to thyroid hormones that bind to the prealbumin fraction of serum proteins (transthyretin) and a special- ized thyroxin-binding protein. Hormones interact with specific hormone receptors to alter biologic activity of the target cells. The first step in hormone action on a target cell is its binding to a speciﬁc hormone receptor. However, recent studies suggest that some hormones are involved in non–receptor-mediated re- sponses. Hormones interact with their receptors exposed on the surface of the target cell or within its cytoplasm or nucleus. In general, two groups of hormone receptors have been identified: • Cell surface receptors interact with peptide hormones or catecholamines that are unable to penetrate the cell membrane. Activation of these receptors as a result of hor- mone binding rapidly generates large quantities of small intracellular molecules called second messengers. These molecules amplify the signal initiated by hormone–receptor interaction and are produced by activation of membrane- associated G proteins. Examples of such systems include the adenylate cyclase/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) system (for most protein hormones and cate- cholamines), the guanylyl cyclase/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) system (an antagonistic sys- tem for action of cAMP in some protein hormones), the tyrosine kinase system (for insulin and epidermal growth factor [EGF]), the phosphatidylinositol system (for certain hormones such as oxytocin, gonadotropin- releasing hormone [GnRH], angiotensin II, and neuro- transmitters such as epinephrine), and activation of ion channels (as with most neurotransmitters). The majority of second messenger molecules exert a stimulatory func- tion on cell metabolism. Examples of second messenger molecules include cAMP, 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), in- ositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), and Ca 2\u0002. An inhibitory response is mainly achieved by cGMP, which interferes with the production of cAMP. The second-messenger molecules produced in the cascade reactions of these sys- tems alter the cell’s metabolism and produce hormone- specific responses (Fig. 21.2). • Intracellular receptors, which are localized within the cell (mainly within the nucleus), are used by steroids and thy- roid hormones that can easily penetrate both plasma and nuclear membranes. Their receptors consist of large multi- protein complexes of chaperones containing three binding domains: a hormone-binding region, a DNA-binding ab c FIGURE 21.1 • Hormonal control mechanisms. This schematic diagram shows three basic types of control mechanisms. a. In endocrine control, the hormone is discharged from a cell into the bloodstream and is transported to the effector cells. b. In paracrine control, the hormone is secreted from one cell and acts on adjacent cells that express specific receptors. c. In autocrine control, the hormone responds to the receptors located on the cell that produces it. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:05 PM Page 741 region, and an amino-terminal region. Binding of the hor- mone to these receptors causes allosteric transformation of the receptor into a form that binds to chromosomal DNA and activates RNA polymerase activity. This in turn increases transcription of mRNA, resulting in the production of new proteins that regulate cell metabolism. Therefore, hormones acting on intracellular receptors inﬂuence gene expression di- rectly, without the help of a second messenger (see Fig. 21.2). Regulation of Hormone Secretion and Feedback Mechanism Regulation of hormonal function is controlled by feed- back mechanisms. Hormonal production is often controlled through feedback mechanisms from the target organ. In general, feedback occurs when the response to a stimulus (action of a hormone) has an effect on the original stimulus (hormone-secreting cell). The nature of this response determines the type of feedback. Two types of feedback are recognized; a negative feedback occurs when the response diminishes the original stimulus. It is much more common than a positive feedback, which occurs when the response enhances the original stimulus. To better understand the function of feedback mechanisms, one can point to an air-conditioning system, which also uses a simple negative feedback system. When the compressor pro- duces enough cold air to lower the temperature below the set point of the thermostat, the thermostat is triggered and shuts off the compressor. In this negative feedback system, the lower temperature is then fed back to the compressor and diminishes its response (it shuts off its production of cold air). When the temperature rises back above the set point, the negative feed- back is abolished and the compressor comes back on (for more information on negative feedback, see Folder 21.1, Functional Considerations: Regulation of Pituitary Gland Secretion). Activities of hormones are constantly monitored on many levels beginning with molecular biosynthetic processes to the final end points of hormonal action. Several examples of feedback mechanisms are discussed in the sections on the pituitary, hypothalamus, and thyroid gland. Hormone-secreting cells are present in many organs to regulate their activity. This chapter primarily describes the discrete endocrine glands that release their hormones for delivery to the blood- stream for transport to target cells and organs. In other chap- ters, the endocrine function of adipose tissue as well as individual cells within the gonads, liver, pancreas, kidney, and gastrointestinal system is discussed. The cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine (DNES) system (see page 581) constitute a collection of endocrine cells in the body. In addition to their endocrine function, cells of DNES system exercise autocrine and paracrine control of the activity of their own and adjacent epithelial cells by diffusion of peptide secretions through the extracellular spaces. \u0002 PITUITARY GLAND (HYPOPHYSIS) The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus, the portion of the brain to which the pituitary gland is attached, are morpho- logically and functionally linked in the endocrine and neu- roendocrine control of other endocrine glands. Because they play central roles in a number of regulatory feedback systems, they are often called the “master organs” of the endocrine sys- tem. In the past, the control of pituitary hormone secretion by the hypothalamus was classically regarded as the major function of the neuroendocrine system. However, the field of neuroendocrinology today has expanded to encompass mul- tiple reciprocal interactions between the central nervous sys- tem (CNS), autonomic nervous system (ANS), endocrine system, and immune system in the regulation of homeosta- sis and behavioral responses to environmental stimuli. For example, the neuroendocrine axes in maintaining energy homeostasis were discussed in Chapter 9 (Adipose Tissue). 742 CELL SURFACE RECEPTORS protein receptor protein hormone INTRACELLULAR RECEPTORS carrier protein mRNA physiologic effects new proteins steroid hormone second messenger steroid receptorphysiologic effects a b FIGURE 21.2 • General mechanisms of hormone action. a. This schematic diagram shows the basis for protein hormone action involving cell surface receptors. Hormone molecules bind to the receptor and initiate synthesis of second-messenger molecules. These molecules, in turn, activate a cascade of reactions that produce hormone-specific responses in the stimulated cell. b. This diagram shows the mechanism of action of steroid hormones, which use intracellular receptors. Binding of the hormone to this receptor causes allosteric transformation of the receptor into a form that binds to DNA. This binding leads to mRNA transcription and production of new proteins that produce hormone-specific responses in the stimulated cell. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:05 PM Page 742chapter 21Endocrine Organs\u0003PITUITARY GLAND (HYPOPHYSIS) 743 743 The release of hormones from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland is carefully regulated by three tiers of control mechanisms that include the following: • Tier I: hypothalamic secretion of hypothalamic- regulating hormones. The pituitary gland is under signif- icant control by the hypothalamus, which regulates release of hypothalamic-regulating hormones into the hypophyseal portal veins. The hypothalamic-regulating hormones are produced by the cells of the hypothalamus in response to circulating levels of systemic hormones and impulses from the CNS. These hormones act directly on the highly spe- cific G protein–linked receptors on the plasma mem- branes of cells residing in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Activation of receptors elicits positive or negative signals that affect gene transcription and lead to stimula- tion or inhibition of pituitary hormone secretion. Most of the tropic hormones produced by the anterior lobe of the pitu- itary gland are regulated by polypeptide-releasing hor- mones, with the notable exception of dopamine. Prolactin (PRL) production is primarily regulated by the inhibitory ef- fect of dopamine (i.e., PRL secretion is tonically inhibited by the release of dopamine from the hypothalamus). • Tier II: Paracrine and autocrine secretions of the pituitary cells. Release of hormones from the pituitary gland is also regulated by soluble growth factors and cy- tokines produced by the cells residing in the pituitary gland. • Tier III: Feedback effect of circulating hormones. The level of hormones in the systemic circulation regu- lates the secretion of cells in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. This is primary achieved by negative feedback regulation of hormones secreted by the pitu- itary gland by target hormones. For instance, secretion of TSH is inhibited by thyroid hormones produced in the thyroid gland under TSH influence. To better understand the mechanism of negative regula- tion, consider a simple negative feedback system that controls the synthesis and discharge of T3 and T4 thyroid hormones (see Fig. 21.6). The secretion of thyroid hor- mones is controlled by the release of TSH from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland into the bloodstream. If blood lev- els of T3 and T4 are high, TRH is not produced or released. If blood levels of T3 and T4 are low, the hypothalamus dis- charges TRH into the hypothalamohypophyseal portal sys- tem. Release of TRH stimulates specific cells within the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland to produce TSH, which in turn stimulates the thyroid to produce and release more thyroid hormones. As the thyroid hormone levels rise, the negative feedback system stops the hypothalamus from discharging TRH. Using the same mechanism of negative feedback regulation, thyroid hormones also act on the thy- rotropes in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland to inhibit their secretion of TSH. • FOLDER 21.1 Functional Considerations: Regulation of Pituitary Gland Secretion Gross Structure and Development The pituitary gland is composed of glandular epithelial tissue and neural (secretory) tissue. The pituitary gland [Lat. pituta, phlegm—reflecting its nasopharyngeal origin] is a pea-sized, compound endocrine gland that weighs 0.5 g in males and 1.5 g in multiparous women (i.e., a woman who has given birth two or more times). It is centrally located at the base of the brain, where it lies in a saddle-shaped depression of the sphenoid bone called the sella turcica. A short stalk, the infundibulum, and a vascular network connect the pituitary gland to the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland has two functional components (Fig. 21.3): • Anterior lobe (adenohypophysis), the glandular epithe- lial tissue • Posterior lobe (neurohypophysis), the neural secretory tissue These two portions are of different embryologic origin. The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland is derived from an evagi- nation of the ectoderm of the oropharynx toward the brain (Rathke’s pouch). The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland is derived from a downgrowth (the future infundibulum) of neuroectoderm of the ﬂoor of the third ventricle (the diencephalon) of the developing brain (Fig. 21.4). The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland consists of three derivatives of Rathke’s pouch: • Pars distalis, which comprises the bulk of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland and arises from the thickened anterior wall of the pouch • Pars intermedia, a thin remnant of the posterior wall of the pouch that abuts the pars distalis • Pars tuberalis, which develops from the thickened lateral walls of the pouch and forms a collar or sheath around the infundibulum The embryonic infundibulum gives rise to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland consists of the following: • Pars nervosa, which contains neurosecretory axons and their endings. • Infundibulum, which is continuous with the median eminence and contains the neurosecretory axons forming the hypothalamohypophyseal tracts Blood Supply Knowledge of the unusual blood supply of the pituitary gland is important to understanding its functions. The 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:05 PM Page 743 pituitary blood supply is derived from two sets of vessels (Fig. 21.5): • Superior hypophyseal arteries supply the pars tuber- alis, median eminence, and infundibulum. These vessels arise from the internal carotid arteries and posterior com- municating artery of the circle of Willis. • Inferior hypophyseal arteries primarily supply the pars nervosa. These vessels arise solely from the internal carotid arteries. An important functional observation is that most of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland has no direct arterial supply. The hypothalamohypophyseal portal system provides the crucial link between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. The arteries that supply the pars tuberalis, median eminence, and infundibulum give rise to fenestrated capillaries (the pri- mary capillary plexus). These capillaries drain into portal veins, called the hypophyseal portal veins, which run along the pars tuberalis and give rise to a second fenestrated sinusoidal capillary network (the secondary capillary plexus). This system of vessels carries the neuroendocrine secretions of hypothalamic nerves from their sites of release in the 744 developing sphenoid bone anterior lobe posterior lobe pituitary gland neuroectoderm Rathke’s pouch neuroectoderm oropharynx ectoderm oropharynx ectoderm a b c FIGURE 21.4 • Development of the pituitary gland.

Most of the blood from the pituitary gland drains into the cavernous sinus at the base of the diencephalon and then into the systemic circulation. Some evidence suggests, however, that blood can flow via short portal veins from the pars distalis to the pars nervosa and that blood from the pars nervosa may flow toward the hypothalamus. These short pathways provide a route by which the hormones of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland could provide feedback directly to the brain without making the full circuit of the systemic circulation. Nerve Supply The nerves that enter the infundibulum and pars nervosa from the hypothalamic nuclei are components of the poste- rior lobe of the pituitary gland (see the section that follows on the posterior lobe). The nerves that enter the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland are postsynaptic fibers of the autonomic nervous system and have vasomotor function. Structure and Function of the Pituitary Gland Anterior Lobe of the Pituitary Gland (Adenohypophysis) The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland regulates other endocrine glands and some nonendocrine tissues. Most of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland has the typ- ical organization of endocrine tissue. The cells are organized in clumps and cords separated by fenestrated sinusoidal capillar- ies of relatively large diameter. These cells respond to signals from the hypothalamus and synthesize and secrete a num- ber of pituitary hormones. Four hormones of the anterior lobe—adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid- stimulating (thyrotropic) hormone (TSH, thyrotropin), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hor- mone (LH)—are called tropic hormones because they regu- late the activity of cells in other endocrine glands throughout the body (Fig. 21.6). The two remaining hormones of the an- terior lobe, growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL), are not considered tropic because they act directly on target organs that are not endocrine. The general character and effects of the pituitary hormones of the anterior lobe are summarized in Table 21.1. Pars Distalis. The cells within the pars distalis vary in size, shape, and staining properties. The cells are arranged in cords and nests with interweaving capillaries. Early descriptions of the cells within the pars distalis were based solely on the stain- ing properties of secretory vesicles within the cells. Using mixtures of acidic and basic dyes (Fig. 21.7), histologists identified three types of cells according to their staining reac- tion, namely, basophils (10%), acidophils (40%),and chromophobes (50%). However, this classification contains no information regarding the hormonal secretory activity or functional role of these cells. internal carotid a. superior hypophyseal a. hypophyseal portal veins hypophyseal veins capillaries of the hypophyseal portal system in the pars distalis inferior hypophyseal artery hypophyseal veins capillaries of the median eminence and infundibulum FIGURE 21.5 • Diagram of the blood supply to the pituitary gland.

Production of thyroid hormones is regulated through a negative feedback system. The thyroid hormone can feed back on the system and inhibit further release of thyroid hormones.

Five functional cell types are identified in the pars distalis on the basis of immunocytochemical reactions. All known hormones of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland are small proteins or glycoproteins. This important fact has led to definitive identification of specific cell types by immunocy- tochemistry (Table 21.2). These studies have classified cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland into five cell types: • Somatotropes (GH cells) are most commonly found within the pars distalis and constitute approximately 50% of the parenchymal cells in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. These medium-sized, oval cells exhibit round, cen- trally located nuclei and produce growth hormone (GH; somatotropin). The presence of eosinophilic vesicles in their cytoplasm classifies them as acidophils. Three hor- mones regulate the release of GH from somatotropes. Two of these hormones are opposing hypothalamic-releasing hor- mones: growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH), which stimulates GH release from the somatotropes, and so- matostatin, which inhibits GH release from the soma- totropes. Recently, a third hormone, a 28-amino acid peptide ghrelin, was isolated from the stomach. It is a potent stimu- lator of GH secretion and appears to coordinate food intake with GH secretion. Hormonally active tumors that originate from somatotropes are associated with hypersecretion of GH and cause gigantism in children and acromegaly in adults. • Lactotropes (PRL cells, mammotropes) constitute 15% to 20% of the parenchymal cells in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. These are large, polygonal cells with oval nuclei. They produce prolactin (PRL). In their stor- age phase, lactotropes exhibit numerous acidophilic vesi- cles (the histologic feature of an acidophil). When the content of these vesicles is released, the cytoplasm of the lactotrope does not stain (the histologic feature of a chro- mophobe). Secretion of PRL is under inhibitory control by dopamine, the catecholamine produced by the hypotha- lamus. However, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and vasoactive inhibitory peptide (VIP) are known to stimulate synthesis and secretion of PRL. During preg- nancy and lactation, these cells undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia, causing the pituitary gland to increase in size. These processes account for the larger size of the pituitary gland in multiparous women. • Corticotropes (ACTH cells) also constitute 15% to 20% of the parenchymal cells in the anterior lobe of the pitu- itary gland. These polygonal, medium-sized cells with round and eccentric nuclei produce a precursor molecule of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), known as proopiomelanocortin (POMC). Corticotropes stain as basophils and also exhibit a strong positive reaction with periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reagent, because of the carbohy- drate moieties associated with POMC. POMC is further cleaved by proteolytic enzymes within the corticotrope into several fragments, namely ACTH, \u0004-lipotrophic hormone (\u0004-LPH), melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), \u0004-endorphin, and enkephalin. ACTH release is regulated 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:05 PM Page 746chapter 21Endocrine Organs\u0003PITUITARY GLAND (HYPOPHYSIS) 747 747 BasBas BasBas ChCh AcAc ChCh Bas Bas Ch Ac Ch FIGURE 21.7 • Pars distalis.

These small, oval cells with round and eccentric nuclei produce both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). They are scat- tered throughout the pars distalis and stain intensely with both basic stains (thus classifying them as the basophil cell type) and PAS reagent. Many gonadotropes are capable of producing both FSH and LH. However, immunocyto- chemical studies indicate that some gonadotropes may produce only one hormone or the other. The release of FSH and LH is regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) produced by the hypothalamus. Both FSH and LH play an important role in male and female reproduction, which is discussed in Chapters 22 and 23. • Thyrotropes (TSH cells) constitute about 5% of the parenchymal cells in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. These large, polygonal cells with round and eccen- tric nuclei produce thyrotropic hormone called thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH), which acts on the follicular cells of the thyroid gland to stimulate production of thy- roglobulin and thyroid hormones. Thyreotropes exhibit cytoplasmic basophilia (basophils) and stain positively with PAS reagent. Release of TSH is under the hypothala- mic control of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which also stimulates secretion of PRL. Distinctive characteristics of the five cell types of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland are readily seen with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These characteristics are sum- marized in Table 21.3. In addition to the five types of hormone-producing cells, anterior lobe of the pituitary gland contains folliculo- stellate cells. Folliculo-stellate cells present in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland are characterized by a starlike appearance with their cytoplasmic processes encircling hormone-producing cells. They have the ability to make cell clusters or small follicles, and they do not produce hormones. Folliculo- stellate cells are interconnected by gap junctions containing connexin-43 protein. Based on immunocytochemical and electrophysiological studies, it is hypothesized that the net- work of folliculo-stellate cells interconnected by gap junc- tions transmits signals from the pars tuberalis to pars distalis. These signals may regulate hormone release throughout the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Thus, the folliculo-stellate network may appear to function in addition to the hypophy- seal portal vein system. Recent in vitro findings of gap junc- tions interconnecting not only folliculo-stellate cells but also hormone-producing cells support this proposed signaling mechanism in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Pars Intermedia. The pars intermedia surrounds a series of small cystic cavities that represent the residual lumen of Rathke’s pouch. The parenchymal cells of the pars intermedia surround colloid-filled follicles. The cells lining these follicles appear to be derived either from folliculo-stellate cells or var- ious hormone-secreting cells. TEM reveals that these cells form apical junctional complexes and have vesicles larger than those found in the pars distalis. The nature of this follic- ular colloid is yet to be determined; however, often cell debris is found within it. The pars intermedia contains basophils and chromophobes (Fig. 21.8). Frequently, the basophils and cystic cavities extend into the pars nervosa. The function of the pars intermedia cells in humans remains unclear. From studies of other species, however, it is known that basophils have scattered vesicles in their cytoplasm that contain either \u0003- or \u0003-endorphin (a morphine- related compound). In frogs, the basophils produce MSH, which stimulates pigment production in melanocytes and pigment dispersion in melanophores. In humans, MSH is not a distinct, functional hormone but is a byproduct of \u0004- LPH posttranslational processing. Because MSH is found in the human pars intermedia in small amounts, the basophils of the pars intermedia are assumed to be corticotropes. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:05 PM Page 747 Pars Tuberalis. The pars tuberalis is an extension of the anterior lobe along the stalklike infundibulum. It is a highly vascular region containing veins of the hypothalamohy- pophyseal system. The parenchymal cells are arranged in small clusters or cords in association with the blood vessels. Nests of squamous cells and small follicles lined with cuboidal cells are scattered in this region. These cells often show immunoreactivity for ACTH, FSH, and LH. Posterior Lobe of the Pituitary Gland (Neurohypophysis) The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland is an extension of the central nervous system (CNS) that stores and releases secretory products from the hypothalamus. The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, also known as the neurohypophysis, consists of the pars nervosa and the infundibulum that connects it to the hypothalamus. 748 TABLE Electron Microscopic Characteristics of Cells Found in the Anterior Lobe of the Pituitary Gland21.3 Cell Type Size/Shape Nucleus/Location Secretory Vesicle Size/ Characteristics Other Cytoplasmic Characteristics Somatotrope Medium/oval Round/central, with prominent nucleoli Dense: 350 nm, closely packed None Lactotrope Large/polygonal Oval/central Inactive: 200 nm, sparse Active: dense, pleomorphic, 600 nm, sparse Lysosomes increase after lactation Corticotrope Medium/polygonal Round/eccentric 100–300 nm Lipid droplets, large lysosomes, perinu- clear bundles of intermediate filaments Gonadotrope Small/oval Round/eccentric Dense: 200–250 nm Prominent Golgi apparatus, distended rER cisternae Thyrotrope Large/polygonal Round/eccentric Dense: \u0005150 nm Prominent Golgi apparatus with numerous vesicles TABLE Staining Characteristics of Cells Found in the Anterior Lobe of the Pituitary Gland21.2 Cell Type Percentage of Total Cells General Staining Specific Staining Product Somatotrope (GH cell) 50 Acidophil Orange G (PAS \u0006) Growth hormone (GH) Lactotrope (PRL cell) 15–20 Acidophil Orange G (PAS \u0006) Herlant’s erythrosin Brooke’s carmosine Prolactin (PRL) Corticotrope (ACTH cell) 15–20 Basophil Lead hematoxylin (PAS \u0007) Proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which is cleaved in human into adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and \u0004-lipotrophic hormone (\u0004-LPH) Gonadotrope (FSH and LH cells) 10 Basophil Aldehyde-fuchsin Aldehyde-thionine (PAS \u0007) Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) Thyrotrope (TSH cell) \u00025 Basophil Aldehyde-fuchsin Aldehyde-thionine (PAS \u0007) Thyrotropic hormone (TSH) 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 748chapter 21Endocrine Organs\u0003PITUITARY GLAND (HYPOPHYSIS) 749 749 The pars nervosa, the neural lobe of the pituitary, contains the nonmyelinated axons and their nerve endings of approxi- mately 100,000 neurosecretory neurons whose cell bodies lie in the supraoptic nuclei and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. The axons form the hypothalamohy- pophyseal tract and are unique in two respects. First, they do not terminate on other neurons or target cells but end in close proximity to the fenestrated capillary network of the pars nervosa. Second, they contain secretory vesicles in all parts of the cells, i.e., the cell body, axon, and axon terminal. Because of their intense secretory activity, the neurons have well-developed Nissl bodies and in this respect resemble ven- tral horn and ganglion cells. The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland is not an endocrine gland. Rather, it is a storage site for neurosecretions of the neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothala- mus. The nonmyelinated axons convey neurosecretory products to the pars nervosa. Other neurons from the hypothalamic nu- clei (described below) also release their secretory products into the fenestrated capillary network of the infundibulum, the first capillary bed of the hypothalamohypophyseal portal system. Electron microscopy reveals three morphologically dis- tinct neurosecretory vesicles in the nerve endings of the pars nervosa. Three sizes of membrane-bounded vesicles are present in the pars nervosa: • Neurosecretory vesicles with diameters ranging between 10 and 30 nm accumulate in the axon terminals. They also form accumulations that dilate portions of the axon near the ter- minals (Fig. 21.9). These dilations, called Herring bodies, are visible in the light microscope (Plate 81, page 774). In the electron microscope, Herring bodies in addition to abundant neurosecretory vesicles, contain mitochondria, few micro- tubules and profiles of SER (Fig. 21.10). • Nerve terminals also contain 30-nm vesicles that contain acetylcholine. These vesicles may play a specific role in the release of neurosecretory vesicles. • Larger 50- to 80-nm vesicles that resemble the dense core vesicles of the adrenal medulla and adrenergic nerve endings are present in the same terminal as the other membrane- bound vesicles. The membrane-bound neurosecretory vesi- cles that aggregate to form Herring bodies contain either oxytocin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH; also called vasopressin; Table 21.4). Each hormone is a small peptide of nine amino acid residues. The two hormones differ in only two of these residues. Each vesicle also contains ATP and a neurophysin, a protein that binds to the hormone by noncovalent bonds. Oxytocin and ADH are synthesized as part of a large molecule that includes the hormone and its specific neurophysin. The large molecule is proteolytically cleaved into the hormone and neurophysin as it travels from the nerve cell body to the axon terminal. Immunocytochem- ical staining demonstrates that oxytocin and ADH are secreted by different cells in the hypothalamic nuclei. ADH facilitates resorption of water from the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney by altering the perme- ability of the cells to water. ADH’s original name, vasopressin, was derived from the obser- vation that large nonphysiologic doses increase blood pressure by promoting the contraction of smooth muscle in small arter- ies and arterioles. However, the physiologic levels of ADH have only minimal effects on blood pressure. ADH is the main hormone involved in regulation of water homeostasis and osmolarity of body ﬂuids. The primary physiologic effect of ADH on the kidney is the insertion of water channels (aqua- porins) into cells of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts, which increases the permeability for water. Insertion of aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) into the apical domain and aquaporin-3 (AQP-3) into the basolateral domain of these cells is responsi- ble for rapid resorption of water across the tubule epithelium. ADH acts through its speciﬁc V2 receptor on the basolateral domain of cells lining the distal convoluted tubules and col- lecting ducts; mutation of this receptor is responsible for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (Folder 21.3). Plasma osmolality and blood volume are monitored by specialized receptors of the cardiovascular system (e.g., carotid bodies and juxtaglomerular apparatus).

This photomicrograph of a toluidine blue–stained specimen shows the pars intermedia located between the pars distalis (on the left) and pars nervosa (on the right).

However, a characteristic feature of the pars intermedia is the presence of different-sized follicles filled with colloid (CF ) and small groups of cells consisting of chromo - phobes and basophils. \u0002120. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 749 750 Abnormalities in the signaling mechanisms that coordinate and control the function of multiple organs and biological processes are the bases of many endocrine diseases. Classical biochemistry, physiology, and advances in cell and molecular biology and genetics combined with clinical observations are able to explain the mechanisms of hor- monal action and endocrine diseases. Endocrine diseases can be classified into four major categories: • Hormone overproduction. The most common cause of hormone overproduction is an increase in the total num- ber of cells producing a specific hormone. An example of this mechanism is hyperthyroidism (Graves’ disease; see Folder 21.4). Briefly, the presence of abnormal antibodies that mimic the action of TSH stimulates a dramatic in- crease in the number of thyroid cells. In some instances, increased hormone secretion is related to genetic abnor- mality that affects regulation of hormone synthesis and re- lease. In addition, mutation in tumor suppressor genes and protooncogenes may lead to proliferation of mutant cells that produce the specific hormone. This commonly occurs in cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. • Hormone underproduction. Underproduction of hor- mones may result from destruction of an endocrine organ by a disease process (e.g., tuberculosis of the adrenal glands) or autoimmunity (e.g., Hashimoto’s disease in which abnormal antibodies target and destroy thyroid hormone–producing cells). Also, genetic abnormalities that lead to abnormal development of endocrine glands (e.g., hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), abnormal hormone synthesis (e.g., deletion of the GH gene), or abnormal reg- ulation of hormone secretion (e.g., hypoparathyroidism associated with mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor expressed on parathyroid cells) can cause decreased serum levels or lack of active hormones. Iatrogenic injury to endocrine glands such as occurs when the parathyroid gland is removed during thyroidectomy (thyroid gland removal) may also be responsible. • Altered tissue responses to hormones. This cate- gory of endocrine disease is often cause by a variety of genetic mutation in hormone receptors (e.g., TSH, LH, and PTH). In diabetic patients, the resistance to insulin in muscles and the liver is mainly caused by signals origi- nating from adipose tissue (see Chapter 9). • Tumors of endocrine glands. Most of the tumors of endocrine gland are hormonally active and are responsi- ble for hormone overproduction. However, some tumors of endocrine glands do not produce hormones, but com- press neighboring organs or cause destructions of other organs due to metastasis. An example of such a tumor is thyroid cancer that can metastasize throughout the body without presenting signs of thyroid hormone overpro- duction (hyperthyroidism). Hormones are used to treat endocrine diseases. A com- mon use is as hormone replacement therapies when a specific endocrine gland is not developed or ceases to produce the required hormone. Hormones and their syn- thetic analogs can be used to suppress the effects of other hormones. In general, thyroid and steroid hormones can be administered orally, whereas protein hormones (e.g., insulin, GH) need to be injected. Recent technological innovations including computerized mini-pumps and depot intramuscular injections have made therapy more manage- able for patients. • FOLDER 21.2 Clinical Correlation: Principles of Endocrine Diseases in osmolality or a decrease in blood volume stimulates ADH release. Additionally, the cell bodies of the hypothala- mic secretory neurons may also serve as osmoreceptors, ini- tiating ADH release. Pain, trauma, emotional stress, and drugs such as nicotine also stimulate release of ADH. Oxytocin promotes contraction of smooth muscle of the uterus and myoepithelial cells of the breast. Oxytocin is a more potent promoter of smooth muscle con- traction than is ADH. Its primary effect includes promotion of contraction of • uterine smooth muscle during orgasm, menstruation, and parturition. As parturition approaches, uterine smooth muscle cells demonstrate about a 200-fold increase in the responsiveness to oxytocin. This is accompanied by in- creased formation of gap junctions between smooth muscle cells and increased density of oxytocin receptors. • myoepithelial cells of the secretory alveoli and alveolar ducts of the mammary gland. Oxytocin secretion is triggered by neural stimuli that reach the hypothalamus. These stimuli initiate a neurohumoral reflex that resembles a simple senso- rimotor reflex. In the uterus, the neurohumoral reﬂex is initiated by distension of the vagina and cervix. In the breast, the reﬂex is initiated by breastfeeding (suckling). Contraction of the myoepithelial cells that surround the base of the alveolar secretory cells and cells of the larger ducts cause milk to be released and pass through the ducts that open onto the nipple (i.e., milk ejection; see page 867). Synthetic analogs of oxytocin are often used in intra- venous infusion pumps to initiate and strengthen uterine contractions during active labor and delivery. Nasal prepara- tions of oxytocin are also used to promote lactation in breastfeeding women. The pituicyte is the only cell specific to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. In addition to the numerous axons and terminals of the hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons, the posterior lobe 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 750chapter 21Endocrine Organs\u0003HYPOTHALAMUS 751 751 FIGURE 21.9 • Electron micrograph of Herring bodies of rat posterior lobe. Dilated portions of axons near their terminals called Herring bodies (HB) contain numerous neurosecretory vesicles filled with either oxytocin or ADH. They are surrounded by the specialized glial cells called pituicytes (P). Note that Herring bodies reside in a close proximity to blood vessels (BV), mainly fenestrated capillaries, lined by endothelial cells (En). \u00026,000. (Courtesy of Dr. Holger Jastrow). of the pituitary gland contains fibroblasts, mast cells, and specialized glial cells called pituicytes associated with the fenestrated capillaries. These cells are irregular in shape, with many branches, and resemble astroglial cells. Their nuclei are round or oval, and pigment vesicles are present in the cytoplasm. Like astroglia, they possess specific interme- diate filaments assembled from glial fibrillary acidic proteins (GFAP). Pituicytes often have processes that termi- nate in the perivascular space. Because of their many pro- cesses and relationships to the blood, the pituicyte serves a supporting role similar to that of astrocytes in the rest of the CNS (see page 367). \u0002 HYPOTHALAMUS The hypothalamus regulates pituitary gland activity. The hypothalamus is located in the middle of the base of the brain, and it encapsulates the ventral portion of the third ventricle. It coordinates most endocrine functions of the body and serves as one of the major controlling centers of the autonomic nervous system. Some of the functions that it regulates include blood pressure, body temperature, fluid and electrolyte balance, body weight, and appetite. The hypothalamus produces numerous neurosecretory products. In addition to oxytocin and ADH, hypothalamic neurons secrete polypeptides that promote and inhibit the secretion and release of hormones from the anterior lobe of the pitu- itary gland (Table 21.5). These hypothalamic polypeptides also accumulate in nerve endings near the median eminence and infundibulum and are released into the capillary bed of the hypothalamohypophyseal portal system for transport to the pars distalis of the pituitary gland. A feedback system regulates endocrine function at two levels: hormone production in the pituitary gland and hypothalamic releasing hormone production in the hypothalamus. The circulating level of a specific secretory product of a tar- get organ, a hormone or its metabolite, may act directly on the cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus to regulate the secretion of hypothalamic releasing hormones (see Fig. 21.6). The two levels of feedback PPP PPP HBHBHB HBHBHB EnEnEn EnEnEnBVBVBV 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 751 allow exquisite sensitivity in the control of secretory func- tion. The hormone itself normally regulates the secretory activity of the cells in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland that regulate its secretion. In addition, information from most physiologic and psychologic stimuli that reach the brain also reaches the hypothalamus. The hypothalamohypophyseal feedback loop provides a regulatory path whereby general information from the CNS contributes to the regulation of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland and, consequently, to the regula- tion of the entire endocrine system. The secretion of hypotha- lamic regulatory peptides is the primary mechanism by which changes in emotional state are translated into changes in the physiologic homeostatic state. \u0002 PINEAL GLAND The pineal gland (pineal body, epiphysis cerebri) is an en- docrine or neuroendocrine gland that regulates daily body rhythm. It develops from neuroectoderm of the posterior por- tion of the roof of the diencephalon and remains attached to the brain by a short stalk. In humans, it is located at the posterior wall of the third ventricle near the center of the brain. The pineal gland is a flattened, pine cone–shaped structure, hence its name (Fig. 21.11). It measures 5 to 8 mm high and 3 to 5 mm in diameter and weighs between 100 and 200 mg. The pineal gland contains two types of parenchymal cells: pinealocytes and interstitial (glial) cells. Pinealocytes are the chief cells of the pineal gland. They are arranged in clumps or cords within lobules formed by con- nective tissue septa that extend into the gland from the pia mater that covers its surface. These cells have a large, deeply infolded nucleus with one or more prominent nucleoli and contain lipid droplets within their cytoplasm. When exam- ined with the TEM, pinealocytes show typical cytoplasmic 752 endotheliumendothelium neurosecretoryneurosecretory granulesgranules endothelium neurosecretory granules FIGURE 21.10 • Electron micrograph of rat posterior lobe.

Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the supraoptic nucleus contains equal amounts of both hormones, whereas the paraventricular nucleus contains more oxytocin than ADH, but less than the amount found in the supraoptic nucleus. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 752chapter 21Endocrine Organs\u0003PINEAL GLAND 753 753 The absence or reduced production of ADH leads to a condition known as diabetes insipidus, which is char- acterized by polyuria (production of large volumes of di- luted urine—up to 20 L per day) with hypotonic and tasteless (insipid) urine. Individuals with this condition have extreme thirst, which allows them to counteract the loss of water by drinking large amounts of fluids. This dis- ease commonly results from head injuries, tumors, or other lesions that can damage the hypothalamus or pos- terior lobe of the pituitary gland. This form of the disease is classified as hypothalamic diabetes insipidus in contrast to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, in which secretion of the ADH is normal or elevated, but there is a lack of renal response to circulating levels of ADH. Nephrogenic diabetes is usually a congenital disorder re- lated to the mutation of the aquaporins-2 (AQP-2) water channels gene or different ADH V2 receptor mutations in kidney tubules. Hypothalamic diabetes insipidus is usu- ally treated by administration of synthetic analogs of ADH (desmopressin), whereas the treatment of the nephro- genic type of this disease is aimed at reducing the volume of urine output. Abnormally high levels of ADH are found in the syn- drome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secre- tion (SIADH), which is characterized by hyponatremia (low serum levels of sodium), decreased serum osmolality asso- ciated with excessive urine sodium excretion, and elevated urine osmolality. In SIADH, the elevated level of ADH in- creases the absorption of water, thereby leading to produc- tion of concentrated urine, inability to excrete water, and hyponatremia that results from excess water rather than sodium deficiency. The increase in ADH secretion may be related to CNS disorders (tumors, injuries, infections, or cerebrovascular accidents); pulmonary diseases (pneumo- nia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung abscess, or tuberculosis); tumors that secrete ADH (small-cell carci- noma of the lung, tumors of the pancreas, thymoma, or lym- phomas); and certain drugs (anti-inflammatories, nicotine, diuretics, and many others). Treatment of SIADH depends on the underlying etiology and includes fluid restrictions as well as pharmacological treatment. An ADH V2–receptor antagonist (Conivaptan) is now available to improve hy- ponatremia and to increase the free water diuresis without loss of other ions in the urine of patients with SIADH. • FOLDER 21.3 Clinical Correlation: Pathologies Associated with ADH Secretion TABLE Hypothalamic Regulating Hormones21.5 Hormone Composition Source Major Functions Growth hormone– releasing hormone (GHRH) Two forms in human: polypeptides containing 40 and 44 amino acids Cell bodies of neurons located in the arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus Stimulates secretion and gene expression of GH by somatotropes Somatostatin Two forms in human: polypeptides containing 14 and 28 amino acids Cell bodies of neurons located in the periventricular, paraven- tricular, and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus Inhibits secretion of GH by somatotropes, inhibits insulin secretion by B cells of pancreatic islets Dopamine Catecholamine (amino acid derivative) Cell bodies of neurons located in the arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus Inhibits secretion of PRL by lactotropes Corticotropin- releasing hormone (CRH) Polypeptide containing 41 amino acids Cell bodies of neurons located in the arcuate, periventricular, and medial paraventricular nuclei of hypothalamus Stimulates secretion of ACTH by corticotropes; stimulates gene expression for POMC in corticotropes Gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) Polypeptide containing 10 amino acids Cell bodies of neurons located in the arcuate, ventromedial, dorsal, and paraventricular nuclei of hypothalamus Stimulates secretion of LH and FSH by gonadotropes Thyrotropin- releasing hormone (TRH) Polypeptide containing 3 amino acids Cell bodies of neurons located by the ventromedial, dorsal, and paraventricular nuclei of hypothalamus Stimulates secretion and gene expression of TSH by thyrotropes; stimulates synthesis and secretion of PRL 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 753 exocytosed. The concretions are recognizable in childhood and increase in number with age. Because they are opaque to X-rays and located in the midline of the brain, they serve as convenient markers in radiographic and computed tomography (CT) studies. The human pineal gland relates light intensity and dura- tion to endocrine activity. The pineal gland is a photosensitive organ and an important timekeeper and regulator of the day/night cycle (circadian rhythm). It obtains information about light and dark cycles from the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract, which connects in the suprachiasmatic nucleus with sympathetic neural tracts traveling into the pineal gland. During the day, 754 pineal recess * * FIGURE 21.12 • Photomicrograph of human pineal gland.

In addition to the two cell types, the human pineal gland is characterized by the presence of calcified concretions, called corpora arenacea or brain sand (Fig. 21.12). These concretions appear to be derived from precipitation of calcium phosphates and carbonates on carrier proteins that are released into the cytoplasm when the pineal secretions are 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 754chapter 21Endocrine Organs\u0003THYROID GLAND 755 755 TABLE Hormones of the Pineal Gland21.6 Hormone Composition Source Major Functions Melatonin Indolamine (N-acetyl-5- methoxytryptamine) Pinealocytes Regulates daily body rhythms and day/night cycle (circadian rhythms); inhibits secretion of GnRH and regulates steroidogenic activity of the gonads particularly as related to the menstrual cycle; in animals, influences seasonal sexual activity light impulses inhibit the production of the major pineal gland hormone, melatonin. Therefore, pineal activity, as measured by changes in the plasma level of melatonin, in- creases during darkness and decreases during light. In hu- mans, these circadian changes of melatonin secretion play an important role in regulating daily body rhythms. Melatonin is released in the dark and regulates reproduc- tive function in mammals by inhibiting the steroidogenic activity of the gonads (Table 21.6). Production of gonadal steroids is decreased by the inhibitory action of melatonin on neurosecretory neurons located in the hypothalamus (arcuate nucleus) that produce GnRH. Inhibition of GnRH causes a decrease in the release of FSH and LH from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. In addition to melatonin, extracts of pineal glands from many animals contain numerous neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine,and histamine, and hy- pothalamic-regulating hormones, such as somatostatin and TRH. Clinically, tumors that destroy the pineal gland are associated with precocious (early-onset) puberty. Animal studies demonstrate that information relating to the length of daylight reaches the pineal gland from photore- ceptors in the retina. The pineal gland thus influences sea- sonal sexual activity. Recent studies in humans suggest that the pineal gland has a role in adjusting to sudden changes in day length, such as those experienced by travelers who suf- fer from jet lag. In addition, the pineal gland may play a role in altering emotional responses to the reduced length of day during winter in temperate and subarctic zones known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD). \u0002 THYROID GLAND The thyroid gland is located in the anterior neck region adjacent to the larynx and trachea. The thyroid gland is a bilobate endocrine gland located in the anterior neck region and consists of two large lateral lobes connected by an isthmus, a thin band of thyroid tissue. The two lobes, each approximately 5 cm in length, 2.5 cm in width, and 20 to 30 g in weight, lie on either side of the larynx and upper trachea. The isthmus crosses anterior to the upper part of the trachea. A pyramidal lobe often extends upward from the isthmus. A thin connective tissue capsule surrounds the gland. It sends trabeculae into the parenchyma that partially outline irregular lobes and lobules. Thyroid follicles constitute the functional units of the gland. The thyroid gland develops from the endodermal lining of the floor of the primitive pharynx. The thyroid gland begins to develop during the fourth week of gestation from a primordium originating as an endodermal thickening of the floor of the primitive pharynx. The pri- mordium grows caudally and forms a ductlike invagination known as the thyroglossal duct. The thyroglossal duct descends through the tissue of the neck to its final destination in front of the trachea, where it divides into two lobes. Dur- ing this downward migration, the thyroglossal duct under- goes atrophy, leaving an embryologic remnant, the pyramidal lobe of the thyroid, which is present in about 40% of the population. About the ninth week of gestation, endodermal cells differentiate into plates of follicular cells that become arranged into follicles. By week 14, well-developed follicles lined by the follicular cells contain colloid in their lumen. During week 7, epithelial cells lining the invagination of the fourth branchial pouches (sometimes called the fifth branchial pouches), known as the ultimobranchial bodies, start their migration toward the developing thyroid gland and become incorporated into the lateral lobes. After fusing with the thyroid, ultimobranchial body cells disperse among the follicles, giving rise to parafollicular cells that become incorporated into the follicular epithelium. The thyroid follicle is the structural and functional unit of the thyroid gland. A thyroid follicle is a roughly spherical cystlike compartment with a wall formed by a simple cuboidal or low columnar epithelium, the follicular epithelium. Hundreds of thousands of follicles that vary in diameter from about 0.2 to 1.0 mm constitute nearly the entire mass of the human thyroid gland. The follicles contain a gel-like mass called colloid (Fig. 21.13). The apical surfaces of the follicular cells are in contact with the colloid, and the basal surfaces rest on a typical basal lamina. Follicular epithelium contains two types of cells: follicu- lar and parafollicular cells. The parenchyma of the thyroid gland is composed of epithe- lium containing two types of cells: • Follicular cells (principal cells) are responsible for pro- duction of the thyroid hormones T4 and T3. These cells vary in shape and size according to the functional state of the gland. In routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) prepa- rations, follicular cells exhibit a slightly basophilic basal cy- toplasm with spherical nuclei containing one or more 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 755 An extensive network of fenestrated capillaries derived from the superior and inferior thyroid arteries surrounds the follicles. Blind-ended lymphatic capillaries are present in the interfollicular connective tissue and may also provide a second route for conveying the hormones from the gland. Thyroid gland function is essential to normal growth and development. The thyroid gland produces three hormones, each of which is essential to normal metabolism and homeostasis (Table 21.7): • Thyroxine (tetraiodothyronine, T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are synthesized and secreted by the follicular cells. Both hormones regulate cell and tissue basal metabolism and heat production and influence body growth and devel- opment. Secretion of these hormones is regulated by TSH released from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. • Calcitonin (thyrocalcitonin) is synthesized by the parafol- licular cells (C cells) and is a physiologic antagonist to parathyroid hormone (PTH). Calcitonin has an important role in regulating serum calcium levels in lower animals; however, its physiological role in humans remains elusive. Calcitonin lowers blood calcium levels by suppressing the 756 FIGURE 21.14 • Electron micrograph of follicular cells in rat thyroid gland.

Lipid droplets and PAS-positive droplets can be identified with appropriate staining. At the ultrastructural level, the follicle cells reveal organelles commonly associated with both secretory and absorptive cells (Fig. 21.14), includ- ing typical junctional complexes at the apical end of the cell and short microvilli on the apical cell surface. Numerous profiles of rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (rER) are present in the basal region.

Abundant endocytotic vesicles, identified as colloidal resorption droplets, and lysosomes are also present in the apical cytoplasm. • Parafollicular cells (C cells) are located in the periphery of the follicular epithelium and lie within the follicle basal lamina. These cells have no exposure to the follicle lumen. They secrete calcitonin, a hormone that regulates calcium metabolism. In routine H&E preparations, C cells are pale staining and occur as solitary cells or small clusters of cells. Human parafollicular cells are difficult to identify with light microscopy. At the electron microscope level, the parafollicular cells reveal numerous small secretory vesicles, which range in diameter from 60 to 550 nm, and a promi- nent Golgi apparatus (Fig. 21.15).

Secretion of calcitonin is regulated directly by blood calcium levels. High levels of calcium stimulate secretion; low levels inhibit it. Secretion of calcitonin is unaffected by the hy- pothalamus and pituitary gland. Calcitonin is secreted by several endocrine tumors (e.g., a medullary carcinoma of the thyroid); therefore, it is used as a tumor marker to mon- itor progress of recovery after surgical resection of the tumor. Although calcitonin is used to treat patients with several disorders associated with excess bone resorption (e.g., osteoporosis and Paget’s disease), no clinical disease has been associated with its deﬁciency or even its absence after total thyroidectomy. The principal component of colloid is thyroglobulin, an inactive storage form of thyroid hormones. The principal component of colloid is a large (660 kilodal- ton) iodinated glycoprotein called thyroglobulin containing about 120 tyrosine residues. Colloid also contains several enzymes and other glycoproteins. It stains with both basic and acidic dyes and is strongly PAS positive. Thyroglobulin is not a hormone. It is an inactive storage form of the thyroid hormones. Active thyroid hormones are liberated from thy- roglobulin and released into the fenestrated blood capillaries that surround the follicles only after further cellular process- ing. The thyroid is unique among endocrine glands because it stores large amounts of its secretory product extracellularly. Synthesis of thyroid hormone involves several steps. The synthesis of the two major thyroid hormones, thyrox- ine (T4) and T3 takes place in the thyroid follicle in a series of discrete steps (Fig. 21.16): 1. Synthesis of thyroglobulin. The precursor of thy- roglobulin is synthesized in the rER of the follicular epithelial cells. Thyroglobulin is posttranslationally gly- cosylated in the rER and the Golgi apparatus before it is packaged into vesicles and secreted by exocytosis into the lumen of the follicle. 2. Resorption, diffusion, and oxidation of iodide. Fol- licular epithelial cells actively transport iodide from the 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 757 758 The most common symptom of thyroid disease is a goiter, the enlargement of the thyroid gland. It may indicate either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism can be caused by insufficient dietary iodine (iodine-deﬁciency goiter, endemic goiter) or by one of several inherited autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis). Autoimmune thyroiditis is characterized by the presence of abnormal autoimmunoglobulins directed against thyroglobu- lin (TgAb), thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb), and the TSH recep- tor (TSHAb). The results are thyroid cell apoptosis and follicular destruction. The low levels of circulating thyroid hormone stimulate release of excessive amounts of TSH, which cause hypertrophy of the thyroid through synthesis of more thyroglobulin. Adult hypothyroidism, formerly called myxedema (due to the puffy appearance of the skin) is char- acterized by mental and physical sluggishness. The edema that occurs in the severe stages of hypothyroidism is caused by the accumulation of large amounts of hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix of the connective tissue of the dermis. In hyperthyroidism (toxic goiter or Graves’ dis- ease), excessive amounts of thyroid hormones are re- leased into the circulation. Individuals with Graves’ disease have detectable levels of autoantibodies. These abnormal immunoglobulins (IgG) bind to the TSH receptors on the follicular cells and stimulate adenylate cyclase activity. As a result, increased levels of cAMP in follicular cells lead to continuous stimulation of the cells and increased thyroid hormone secretion. Because of negative feedback, the lev- els of TSH in the circulation are usually normal. However, under such stimulation the thyroid gland undergoes hyper- trophy, and the thyroid hormone is secreted at abnormally high rates, causing increased metabolism. Most of the clin- ical futures are associated with increased metabolic rate and increased sympathetic nerve activities. These include weight loss, excessive sweating, tachycardia, and nervous- ness. Noticeable features include protrusion of the eyeballs and retraction of the eyelids, resulting from increased sym- pathetic activity and increased deposition of extracellular matrix in the adipose tissue located behind the eyeball (Fig. F21.4.1a). The thyroid gland is enlarged. Microscopic features include the presence of columnar follicular cells lin- ing the thyroid follicles. Because of the high utilization of col- loid, the follicle tends to be depleted in the areas of contact with the apical surface of follicular cells (Fig. F21.4.1b). The treatment for Graves’ disease is either surgical to remove the thyroid gland or radiotherapy by ingestion of radioactive iodine ( 131I), which destroys most active follicular cells. • FOLDER 21.4 Clinical Correlation: Abnormal Thyroid Function aaa bbb FIGURE F21.4.1 • Hyperthyroidism. a.

This diagram depicts two follicular cells: one in the process of thyroglobulin synthesis (on the left with red pathways) and the other in the process of thyroglobulin resorption (on the right with blue pathways). The numbers, which are described more fully in the text, indicate the sequential steps that occur: 1, synthesis and secretion of thyroglobulin; 2, uptake and concentration of iodide from the blood by sodum/iodide symporters (NIS), release of iodide into the colloid via iodide/chloride (pendrin) transporters, and oxidation of iodide to iodine by thyroid peroxidase; 3, iodination of thyroglobulin in the colloid; 4, formation of T3 and T4 hormones in the colloid by oxidative coupling reactions; 5L, resorption of colloid via lysosomal pathway (major pathway); 5TE, resorption of colloid via megalin receptor-mediated transepithelial pathway; and 6, release of T4 and T3 from the cell into the circulation. blood into their cytoplasm using ATPase-dependent sodium/iodide symporters (NIS). The NIS is the 87-kilodalton transmembrane protein that mediates ac- tive iodide uptake in the basolateral membrane of the follicular epithelial cells. These cells are capable of estab- lishing an intracellular concentration of iodide that is 30 to 40 times greater than that of the serum. Iodide ions then diffuse rapidly toward the apical cell membrane. From here iodide ions are transported to the lumen of the follicle by the 86 kilodalton iodide/chloride 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 759 transporter called pendrin located in the apical cell membrane. Iodide is then immediately oxidized to io- dine, the active form of iodide. This process occurs in the colloid and is catalyzed by membrane-bound thy- roid peroxidase (TPO). 3. Iodination of thyroglobulin. One or two iodine atoms are then added to the specific tyrosine residues of thy- roglobulin. This process occurs in the colloid at the mi- crovillar surface of the follicular cells and is also catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase (TPO). Addition of one iodine atom to a single tyrosine residue forms monoiodotyro- sine (MIT). Addition of a second iodine atom to the MIT residue forms a diiodotyrosine (DIT) residue. 4. Formation of T3 and T4 by oxidative coupling reac- tions. The thyroid hormones are formed by oxidative coupling reactions of two iodinated tyrosine residues in close proximity. For example, when neighboring DIT and MIT residues undergo a coupling reaction, T3 is formed; when two DIT residues react with each other, T4 is formed. After iodination, T4 and T3 as well as the DIT and MIT residues that are still linked to a thyroglobulin molecule are stored as the colloid within the lumen of the follicle. 5. Resorption of colloid. In response to TSH, follicular cells take up thyroglobulin from the colloid by a process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. After endo- cytosis, thyroglobulin follows at least two different in- tracellular pathways. • In the lysosomal pathway, thyreoglobulin is in- ternalized and transported within endocytotic vesi- cles to early endosomes. They eventually mature into lysosomes or fuse with existing lysosomes. Re- sorption of thyroglobulin at this stage can be con- firmed by the presence of large endocytic vesicles called colloidal resorption droplets in the apical region of the follicular cells. Thyroglobulin is then degraded by lysosomal proteases into constituent amino acids and carbohydrates, leaving free T4, T3, DIT, and MIT molecules (see 5L labeled pathway in Fig 21.16). Under physiological condition, this is a major pathway of colloid resorption. • In the transepithelial pathway, thyroglobulin is transported intact from the apical to the basolateral surface of follicular cells. To enter this pathway thy- roglobulin binds to its receptor megalin, a 330-kilo- dalton member of the LDL endocytic receptor family. Megalin is a transmembrane protein ex- pressed at the apical surface of follicular epithelial cells directly facing colloid. Thyreoglobulin internal- ized by megalin avoids the lysosomal pathway and endocytic vesicles are delivered to the basolateral membrane of follicular cells (see 5TE labeled path- way in Fig 21.16). In pathologic conditions of high TSH or TSH-like stimulation, megalin expression is increased and large amounts of thyroglobulin fol- low the transepithelial pathway. This pathway may reduce the extent of T4 and T3 release by diverting thyroglobulin away from the lysosomal pathway. 760 Patients with Graves’ and other thyroid diseases have detectable amounts of circulating thyroglobu- lin that contains portion of megalin receptor. If the levels of TSH remain high, the amount of col- loid in the follicle is reduced because it is synthesized, secreted, iodinated, and resorbed too rapidly to accu- mulate. 6. Release of T4 and T3 into the circulation and recy- cling processes. Majority of T4 and T3 are liberated from thyroglobulin in the lysosomal pathway in a T4 to T3 ratio of 20:1. They cross the basal membrane and enter the blood and lymphatic capillaries. Most of the released hormones are immediately bound to either a specific plasma protein (54 kilodalton), thyroxin- binding protein (70%), or a nonspecific prealbumin fraction of serum protein (25%), leaving only small amounts (~5%) of free circulating hormones that are metabolically active. Very small amounts of T4 to T3 are released bound to thyroglobulin. Only the follicu- lar cells are capable of producing T4, whereas most T3, which is five times more active than T4, is produced through conversion from T4 by organs such as the kid- ney, liver, and heart. The free circulating hormones also function in the feedback system that regulates the secretory activity of the thyroid. Once uncoupled from thyroglobulin, DIT and MIT molecules are further deiodinated within the cytoplasm of the follicular cells to release the amino acid tyrosine and iodide, which are then available for recycling. Thyroid hormones play an essential role in normal fetal development. In humans, thyroid hormones are essential to normal growth and development. In normal pregnancy, both T3 and T4 cross the placental barrier and are critical in the early stages of brain development. In addition, the fetal thyroid gland begins to function during the 14th week of gestation and also con- tributes additional thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormone deﬁ- ciency during fetal development results in irreversible damage to the central nervous system (CNS), causing reduced num- bers of neurons, defective myelination, and mental retarda- tion. If maternal thyroid deﬁciency is present before the development of the fetal thyroid gland, the mental retarda- tion is severe. Recent studies reveal that thyroid hormones also stimulate gene expression for GH in the somatotropes. Therefore, in addition to neural abnormalities, a generalized stunted body growth is typical. The combination of these two abnormalities is called congenital hypothyroidism. \u0002 PARATHYROID GLANDS The parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands closely associated with the thyroid. They are ovoid, a few millimeters in diameter, and arranged in two pairs, constituting the superior and inferior parathyroid glands. They are usually located in the connective tissue on the posterior surface of the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland. However, the number 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 760chapter 21Endocrine Organs\u0003PARATHYROID GLANDS 761 761 principalprincipalprincipal principalprincipalprincipal oxyphiloxyphiloxyphil ACAC ACAC AC AC BVBV BVBV BV BV CapCapCap FIGURE 21.17 • Photomicrograph of human parathyroid gland. This H&E–stained specimen shows the gland with part of its connective tissue capsule (Cap). The blood vessels (BV ) are located in the connective tissue septum between lobes of the gland. The principal cells are arranged in two masses (top and bottom) and are separated by a large cluster of oxyphil cells (center). The oxyphil cells are the larger cell type with prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm. They may occur in small groups or in larger masses, as seen here. The principal cells are more numerous. They are smaller, having less cytoplasm, and consequently exhibit closer proximity of their nuclei. Adipose cells (AC) are present in variable, although limited, numbers. \u0002175. and location may vary. In 2% to 10% of individuals, additional glands are associated with the thymus. Structurally, each parathyroid gland is surrounded by a thin connective tissue capsule that separates it from the thyroid. Septa extend from the capsule into the gland to divide it into poorly defined lobules and to separate the densely packed cords of cells. The connective tissue is more evident in the adult, with the de- velopment of fat cells that increase with age and ultimately con- stitute as much as 60% to 70% of the glandular mass. The glands receive their blood supply from the inferior thyroid arteries or from anastomoses between the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. Typical of endocrine glands, rich networks of fenestrated blood capillaries and lymphatic capil- laries surround the parenchyma of the parathyroids. Parathyroid glands develop from the endodermal cells derived from the third and fourth branchial pouches. Embryologically, the inferior parathyroid glands (and the thymus) are derived from the third branchial pouch; the su- perior glands, from the fourth branchial pouch. Normally, the inferior parathyroids separate from the thymus and come to lie below the superior parathyroids. Failure of these struc- tures to separate results in the atypical association of the parathyroids with the thymus in the adult. The principal (chief ) cells differentiate during embryonic development and are functionally active in regulating fetal calcium metabolism. The oxyphil cells differentiate later at puberty. Principal cells and oxyphil cells constitute the epithelial cells of the parathyroid gland. • Principal (chief) cells, the more numerous of the parenchymal cells of the parathyroid (Fig. 21.17), are re- sponsible for regulating the synthesis, storage, and secre- tion of large amounts of PTH. They are small, polygonal cells, with a diameter of 7 to 10 \bm and a centrally lo- cated nucleus. The pale-staining, slightly acidophilic cyto- plasm contains lipofuscin-containing vesicles, large accumulations of glycogen, and lipid droplets. Small, dense, membrane-limited vesicles seen with the TEM or after using special stains with the light microscope are thought to be the storage form of PTH. Principal cells can replicate when they are chronically stimulated by changes in blood calcium levels. • Oxyphil cells constitute a minor portion of the parenchy- mal cells and are not known to have a secretory role. They are found singly or in clusters; the cells are more rounded, con- siderably larger than the principal cells, and have a distinctly acidophilic cytoplasm (see Fig. 21.17). Mitochondria, often with bizarre shapes and sizes, almost fill the cytoplasm and are responsible for the strong acidophilia of these cells. No secretory vesicles and little if any rER are present. Cytoplas- mic inclusion bodies consist of occasional lysosomes, lipid droplets, and glycogen distributed among the mitochondria. Parathyroid hormone regulates calcium and phosphate levels in the blood. The parathyroids function in the regulation of calcium and phosphate levels. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is essential for life. Therefore, care must be taken during thyroidectomy to leave some functioning parathyroid tissue. If the glands are totally removed, death will ensue because muscles, including the laryngeal and other respiratory muscles, go into tetanic contraction as the blood calcium level falls. PTH is an 84–amino acid linear peptide (Table 21.8). It binds to a specific PTH receptor on target cells that interacts with G protein to activate a second-messenger system. PTH release causes the level of calcium in the blood to increase. Si- multaneously, it reduces the concentration of serum phos- phate. Secretion of PTH is regulated by the serum calcium level through a simple feedback system. When parathyroid calcium-sensing receptors on principal cells detect low serum 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 761 calcium levels, they stimulate secretion of PTH; high levels of serum calcium inhibit its secretion. PTH functions at several sites: • Action on bone tissue. For years, the bone resorption has been considered the major effect of PTH action on bone. However, the actions of PTH on bone are more complicated. PTH acts directly and indirectly on several cell types. Receptors for PTH are found on osteoprogeni- tor cells, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and bone lining cells. Sur- prisingly, the bone-resorbing osteoclasts do not have PTH receptors; thus, they are indirectly activated by the RANK- RANKL signaling mechanism of osteoblasts (page 228). The binding of PTH to its receptors on osteoblasts in- creases local RANK production and decreases osteoprote- gerin (OPG) secretion. These changes then stimulate osteoclast differentiation, which leads to increased bone re- sorption and release of calcium and phosphates into the ex- tracellular fluid. PTH also has an anabolic effect on bone that leads to increased bone mass; therefore, it is utilized in the treatment of osteoporosis (see Folder 8.2 in Chapter 8 on page 233). • Kidney excretion of calcium is decreased by PTH stim- ulation of tubular reabsorption, thus conserving calcium. • Urinary phosphate excretion is increased by PTH secre- tion, thus lowering phosphate concentration in the blood and extracellular fluids. • Kidney conversion of 25-OH vitamin D3 to hormonally active 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 is regulated primarily by PTH, which stimulates activity of 1\u0003-hydroxylase and increases the production of active hormone. • Intestinal absorption of calcium is increased under the influence of PTH. Vitamin D3, however, has a greater effect than PTH on intestinal absorption of calcium. PTH and calcitonin have reciprocal effects in the regula- tion of blood calcium levels. Although PTH increases blood calcium levels, the peak increase after its release is not reached for several hours. PTH appears to have a rather slow, long-term homeostatic action. Calcitonin, however, rapidly lowers blood calcium levels and has its peak effect in about 1 hour; therefore, it has a rapid, acute homeostatic action. \u0002 ADRENAL GLANDS The adrenal (suprarenal) glands secrete both steroid hor- mones and catecholamines. They have a flattened triangular shape and are embedded in the perirenal fat at the superior poles of the kidneys. The adrenal glands are covered with a thick connective tissue capsule from which trabeculae extend into the parenchyma, carrying blood vessels and nerves. The secretory parenchymal tissue is organized into two distinct regions (Fig. 21.18): • The cortex is the steroid-secreting portion. It lies beneath the capsule and constitutes nearly 90% of the gland by weight. • The medulla is the catecholamine-secreting portion. It lies deep to the cortex and forms the center of the gland. Parenchymal cells of the cortex and medulla are of differ- ent embryologic origin. Embryologically, the cortical cells originate from mesodermal mesenchyme, whereas the medulla originates from neural crest cells that migrate into the developing gland (Fig. 21.19). Although embryologically distinct, the two por- tions of the adrenal gland are functionally related (see below). The parenchymal cells of the adrenal cortex are con- trolled in part by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland and function in regulating metabolism and maintaining normal electrolyte balance (Table 21.9). Blood Supply The adrenal glands are supplied with blood by the superior, middle, and inferior suprarenal arteries. These vessels branch before entering the capsule, to produce many small arteries that penetrate the capsule. In the capsule, the arteries branch to give rise to three principal patterns of blood distri- bution (Figs. 21.20 and 21.21). The vessels form a system that consists of • capsular capillaries that supply the capsule. • fenestrated cortical sinusoidal capillaries that supply the cortex and then drain into the fenestrated medullary capillary sinusoids. • medullary arterioles that traverse the cortex, traveling within the trabeculae, and bring arterial blood to the medullary capillary sinusoids. 762 TABLE Parathyroid Hormone21.8 Hormone Composition Source Major Functions Parathyroid hormone (PTH) Polypeptide containing 84 amino acids Principal (chief cells)a Increases blood calcium level in three ways: (1) promotes calcium release from bone (acting on osteoblasts via RANK-RANKL signaling system, it increases the relative number of osteoclasts); (2) acts on the kidney to stimulate calcium reabsorption by the distal tubule while inhibiting phos- phate reabsorption in the proximal tubule; and (3) increases formation of hormonally active 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3) in the kidney, which promotes tubular reabsorption of calcium. aSome evidence suggests that oxyphil cells, which first appear in the parathyroid gland at about 4 to 7 years of age and increase in number after puberty, may also produce PTH. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 762chapter 21Endocrine Organs\u0003ADRENAL GLANDS 763 763 adrenaladrenal veinvein cortexcortex cortexcortex medullamedulla medullamedulla adrenal vein cortex cortex medulla centralcentral adrenomedullaryadrenomedullary veinvein central adrenomedullary vein medulla FIGURE 21.18 • Photomicrograph of the adrenal gland. This low-power micrograph of an H&E–stained specimen shows the full thickness of the adrenal gland with the cortex seen on both surfaces and a central region containing the medulla. Within the medulla are profiles of the central vein. Note that the deeper portion of the cortex stains darker than the outer portion, a reflection of the washed-out lipid in the zona glomerulosa and outer region of the zona fasciculata. This section also includes a cross section of the adrenal vein, which is characterized by the longitudinally arranged bundles of smooth muscle in its wall. \u000220. The medulla thus has a dual blood supply: arterial blood from the medullary arterioles and “venous” blood from the cor- tical sinusoidal capillaries that have already supplied the cortex. The venules that arise from the cortical and medullary sinusoids drain into the small adrenomedullary collecting veins that join to form the large central adrenomedullary vein, which then drains directly into the inferior vena cava on the right side and into the left renal vein on the left side. In humans, the cen- tral adrenomedullary vein and its tributaries are unusual in that they have a tunica media containing conspicuous, longitudi- nally oriented bundles of smooth muscle cells. Synchronous contraction of longitudinal smooth muscle bundles along the central adrenomedullary vein and its tributaries cause the volume of the adrenal gland to decrease. This volume decrease enhances the efflux of hormones from the adrenal medulla into the circu- lation, an action comparable to squeezing a wet sponge. Lymphatic vessels are present in the capsule and the connective tissue around the larger blood vessels in the gland. sympathetic ganglion (from neural crest) cortical primordium of fetal cortex (from intermediate mesoderm) chromaffin cells of future medulla fetal cortex cells gut aorta gut permanent cortex zona glomerulosa zona fasciculata fetal cortex medulla aorta urogenital ridge dorsal mesentery a b c d FIGURE 21.19 • Development of the adrenal gland. a.

The permanent cortex replaces the fetal cortex, which at this age has completely disappeared. Note the fully developed zonation of the permanent cortex. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 763 Lymphatic vessels have also been demonstrated in the parenchyma of the adrenal medulla. Recent physiologic stud- ies indicate an important role of the lymph vessels in distribut- ing high-molecular-weight secretory products of chromaffin cells, such as chromogranin A, into the circulation. Cells of the Adrenal Medulla Chromaffin cells located in the adrenal medulla are inner- vated by presynaptic sympathetic neurons. The central portion of the adrenal gland, the medulla, is composed of a parenchyma of large, pale-staining epithelioid cells called chromafﬁn cells (medullary cells), connective tissue, numerous sinusoidal blood capillaries, and nerves. The chromaffin cells are, in effect, modified neurons (Folder 21.5). Numerous myelinated, presynaptic sympathetic nerve fibers pass directly to the chromaffin cells of the medulla (see Chapter 12, page 378). When nerve impulses carried by the sympathetic fibers reach the catecholamine-secreting chro- maffin cells, they release their secretory products. Therefore, chromaffin cells are considered the equivalent of postsynaptic neurons. However, they lack axonal processes. Experimental studies reveal that when chromaffin cells are grown in culture, they extend axon-like processes. However, axonal growth can be inhibited by glucocorticoids— hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex. Thus, the hormones of the adrenal cortex exert control over the morphology of the chromaffin cells and prevent them from forming neural processes. Chromaffin cells therefore more closely resemble typical endocrine cells, in that their secretory product enters the bloodstream via the fenestrated capillaries. Ganglion cells are also present in the medulla. Their axons extend peripherally to the parenchyma of the adrenal cortex to modulate its secretory activity and innervate blood vessels, and extend outside the gland to the splanchnic nerves innervating abdominal organs. 764 TABLE Hormones of the Adrenal Glands21.9 Hormone Composition Source Major Functions Adrenal cortex Mineralocorticoids (95% of mineralocorticoid activity in aldosterone) Steriod hormones (cholesterol derivatives) Parenchymal cells of the zona glomerulosa Aid in controlling electrolyte homeostasis (act on distal tubule of kidney to increase sodium reabsorption and decrease potassium reabsorp- tion); function in maintaining the osmotic balance in the urine and in preventing serum acidosis Glucocorticoids (cortico - sterone, and cortisol; 95% of glucocorticoid activity in cortisol) Steriod hormones (cholesterol derivatives) Parenchymal cells of the zona fasciculata (and to a lesser extent of the zona reticularis) Promote normal metabolism, particularly carbohy- drate metabolism (increase rate of amino acid transport to live, promote removal of protein from skeletal muscle and its transport to liver, reduce rate of glucose metabolism by cells and stimulate glycogen synthesis by liver, stimulate mobilization of fats from storage deposits for energy use); provide resistance to stress; suppress inflammatory response and some allergic reactions Gonadocorticoids (dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] is a major sex steroid produced in both men and women) Steriod hormones (cholesterol derivatives) Parenchymal cells of the zona reticularis (and to a lesser extent of the zona fasciculata) Induce weak masculinizing effect; at normal serum levels usually their function is insignificant Adrenal medulla Norepinephrine and epinephrine (in human, 80% epinephrine) Catecholamines (amino acid derivatives) Chromaffin cells Sympathomimetic (produce effects similar to those induced by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system)a; increase heart rate, increase blood pressure, reduce blood flow to viscera and skin; stimulate conversion of glycogen to glucose; increase sweating; induce dilation of bronchioles; increase rate of respiration; decrease digestion; decrease enzyme production by digestive system glands; decrease urine production aThe catecholamines influence the activity of glandular epithelium, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle located in the walls of blood vessels and viscera. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 764chapter 21Endocrine Organs\u0003ADRENAL GLANDS 765 765 Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla have a secretory function. Chromafﬁn cells are organized in ovoid clusters and short in- terconnecting cords. The blood capillaries are arranged in inti- mate relation to the parenchyma. They originate either from the cortical capillaries or, as branches, from the cortical arterioles. Ultrastructurally, the chromaffin cells are characterized by numerous secretory vesicles with diameters of 100 to 300 nm, profiles of rER, and a well-developed Golgi apparatus. The secretory material in the vesicles can be stained specifically to demonstrate histochemically that the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine secreted by the chromaffin cells are produced by different cell types (Fig. 21.22). The TEM also reveals two populations of chromaffin cells distin- guished by the nature of their membrane-bounded vesicles: • One population of cells contains only large dense core vesicles. These cells secrete norepinephrine. • The other population of cells contains vesicles that are smaller, more homogeneous, and less dense. These cells secrete epinephrine. Exocytosis of the secretory vesicles is triggered by release of acetylcholine from presynaptic sympathetic axons that synapse with each chromaffin cell. Epinephrine and norepinephrine account for less than 20% of the contents of the medullary secretory vesicles. The vesicles also contain large amounts of soluble 48-kilodalton proteins, called chromogranins, that appear to impart the density to the vesicle contents. These proteins, along with ATP and Ca 2\u0007, may help to bind the low-molecular-weight catecholamines and are released with the hormones during exocytosis. The catecholamines, synthesized in the cytosol, are transported into the vesicles through the action of a mag- nesium-activated ATPase in the membrane of the vesicle. Drugs such as reserpine, which cause depletion of cate- cholamines from the vesicles, may act by inhibiting this trans- port mechanism. Glucocorticoids secreted in the cortex induce the conver- sion of norepinephrine to epinephrine in chromaffin cells. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex reach the medulla directly through the continuity of the cortical and medullary sinusoidal capillaries. They induce the enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of norepinephrine to produce epinephrine. The nature of the blood flow correlates with regional differences in distribution of norepinephrine- and epinephrine-containing chromaffin cells.

The chromaffin reaction is thought to involve oxidation and polymerization of the catecholamines contained within the secretory vesicles of these cells. Classically, chromaffin cells have been defined as being derived from neuroecto- derm, innervated by presynaptic sympathetic nerve fibers, and capable of synthesizing and secreting catecholamines. A rare tumor derived from chromaffin cells called pheochromocytoma produces excessive amounts of catecholamines. Because chromaffin cells are also found outside of the adrenal medulla in paravertebral and prever- tebral sympathetic ganglia and other locations, tumors may arise from outside the adrenal gland. These extraadrenal pheochromocytomas are called paragangliomas be- cause scattered groups of chromaffin cells located among or near the components of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are called paraganglia. Episodic symptoms may occur, related to the pharmacological effects of excessive catecholamine secretion. Therefore, pheochromocytomas may precipitate life-threatening hypertension, cardiac ar- rhythmias, anxiety, and fear of impending death. Most pheochromocytomas contain predominantly chromaffin cells that secrete norepinephrine in comparison with the normal adrenal medulla that comprises about 85% epinephrine-secreting cells. Stimulation of \u0003-adrenergic re- ceptors results in elevated blood pressure, increased car- diac contractility, glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and intestinal relaxation. Stimulation of \u0004-adrenergic receptors results in an increase in heart rate and contractility. Surgi- cal resection of the tumor is the treatment of choice. Care- ful monitoring with \u0003- and \u0004-blockers is required during surgery to prevent hypertensive crises. To summarize, pheochromocytomas are often described according to the “rule of 10’s”: • 10% are extraadrenal (paragangliomas) and of those, 10% reside outside the abdomen. • 10% occurs in children. • 10% are multiple or bilateral. • 10% are not associated with hypertension. • 10% are malignant. • 10% are familial. • 10% recur after surgical removal. • 10% are found incidentally during unrelated imaging studies. • FOLDER 21.5 Clinical Correlation: Chromafﬁn Cells and Pheochromocytoma • Zona reticularis, the inner zone that constitutes only 5% to 7% of the cortical volume but is thicker than the glomerulosa because of its more central location Zona Glomerulosa The cells of the zona glomerulosa are arranged in closely packed ovoid clusters and curved columns that are continu- ous with the cellular cords in the zona fasciculata. Cells of the zona glomerulosa are relatively small and columnar or pyra- midal. Their spherical nuclei appear closely packed and stain densely. In humans, some areas of the cortex may lack a rec- ognizable zona glomerulosa. A rich network of fenestrated si- nusoidal capillaries surrounds each cell cluster. The cells have abundant smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (sER), multiple Golgi complexes, large mitochondria with shelf-like cristae, free ribosomes, and some rER. Lipid droplets are sparse. The zona glomerulosa secretes aldosterone, which func- tions in the control of blood pressure. The cells of the zona glomerulosa secrete mineralocorticoids, compounds that function in the regulation of sodium and potassium homeostasis and water balance. The principal secretion, aldosterone, acts on the distal tubules of the nephron in the kidney, the gastric mucosa, and the salivary and sweat glands to stimulate resorption of sodium at these sites, as well as to stimulate excretion of potassium by the kidney. supplied with blood that has passed through the cortical sinusoids and thus contains secreted glucocorticoids. In some species, the norepinephrine-containing cells are more nu- merous in those regions of the medulla supplied by capillar- ies derived from the cortical arterioles. The catecholamines, in concert with the glucocorticoids, prepare the body for the “fight-or-flight” response. The sudden release of catecholamines establishes condi- tions for maximum use of energy and thus maximum phys- ical effort. Both epinephrine and norepinephrine stimulate glycogenolysis (release glucose into the bloodstream) and mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. The release of catecholamines also causes an increase in blood pressure, dilation of the coronary blood vessels, vasodilation of vessels supplying skeletal muscle, vasoconstriction of vessels convey- ing blood to the skin and gut, an increase in heart rate and output, and an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. Zonation of the Adrenal Cortex The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones on the basis of the arrangement of its cells (Fig. 21.23): • Zona glomerulosa, the narrow outer zone that consti- tutes up to 15% of the cortical volume • Zona fasciculata, the thick middle zone that constitutes nearly 80% of the cortical volume 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 766chapter 21Endocrine Organs\u0003ADRENAL GLANDS 767 767 NENE EE EE NE E E FIGURE 21.22 • Electron micrograph of medullary cells. Two types of medullary cells are present. The norepinephrine- secreting cells (NE) are identified by their vesicles, which contain a very dense core. The epinephrine-secreting cells (E) possess vesicles with less intensely staining granules. \u000215,000. The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system provides feed- back control of the zona glomerulosa. The zona glomerulosa is under feedback control of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. The juxta- glomerular cells in the kidney release renin in response to a decrease in blood pressure or a low blood sodium level. Circulating renin catalyzes the conversion of circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which in turn is con- verted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lung to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II then stimulates the cells of the zona glomerulosa to secrete aldosterone. As the blood pressure, sodium concentration, and blood volume increase in response to aldosterone, the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular cells is inhibited. Drugs that inhibit ACE in the lung are effective in the treatment of chronic essential hypertension. Zona Fasciculata The cells of the zona fasciculata are large and polyhedral. They are arranged in long straight cords, one or two cells thick, that are separated by sinusoidal capillaries. The cells of the zona fasciculata have a lightly staining spherical nucleus. Binucleate cells are common in this zone. TEM studies reveal characteris- tics typical of steroid-secreting cells, i.e., a highly developed sER (more so than cells of the zona glomerulosa) and mito- chondria with tubular cristae. They also have a well-developed Golgi apparatus and numerous profiles of rER that may give a slight basophilia to some parts of the cytoplasm (Fig. 21.24). In general, however, the cytoplasm is acidophilic and contains numerous lipid droplets, although it usually appears vacuolated in routine histologic sections because of the extraction of lipid during dehydration. The lipid droplets contain neutral fats, fatty acids, cholesterol, and phospholipids that are precursors for the steroid hormones secreted by these cells. The principal secretion of the zona fasciculata is glucocor- ticoids that regulate glucose and fatty acid metabolism. The zona fasciculata secretes glucocorticoids, so called be- cause of their role in regulating gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis) and glycogenesis (glycogen polymerization). One of the glucocorticoids secreted by the zona fasciculata, cortisol acts on many different cells and tissues to increase the metabolic availability of glucose and fatty acids, both of which are immediate sources of energy. Within this broad function, glucocorticoids may have different, even opposite effects in different tissues: • In the liver, glucocorticoids stimulate conversion of amino acids to glucose, stimulate the polymerization of glucose to glycogen, and promote the uptake of amino acids and fatty acids. • In adipose tissue, glucocorticoids stimulate the break- down of lipids to glycerol and free fatty acids. • In other tissues, they reduce the rate of glucose use and promote the oxidation of fatty acids. • In cells such as fibroblasts, they inhibit protein synthesis and even promote protein catabolism to provide amino acids for conversion to glucose in the liver. Glucocorticoids also depress the immune and inﬂamma- tory responses and, as a result of the latter, inhibit wound healing. Hydrocortisone, a synthetic form of cortisol is used in treatment of allergies and inﬂammation. It depresses the inﬂammatory response by suppressing interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-2 production by lymphocytes and macrophages. Glucocorticoids also stimulate destruction of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and inhibit mitosis by transformed lym- phoblasts. Cells of the zona fasciculata also secrete small amounts of gonadocorticoids, principally androgens. ACTH regulates secretion of the zona fasciculata. The secretion and production of glucocorticoids and sex steroids by the zona fasciculata is under feedback control of the CRH–ACTH system. ACTH is necessary for cell growth and maintenance and also stimulates steroid synthesis and increases blood flow through the adrenal gland. Exogenous ACTH maintains the structure and function of the zona fas- ciculata after hypophysectomy. In animals, administration of ACTH causes hypertrophy of the zona fasciculata. Circulating glucocorticoids may act directly on the pitu- itary gland, but they most commonly exert their feedback 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 767 768 FIGURE 21.23 • Photomicrographs of the cortex and medulla of the human adrenal gland. a. This photomicrograph shows an H&E–stained specimen of the outer cortex. It includes the connective tissue capsule, the zona glomerulosa, and the zona fasciculata.

The red linear stripes represent capillaries that are engorged with red blood cells. \u0002120. b. The deep parts of the zona fasciculata, zona reticularis, and medulla are shown here. Note that the linear arrays of the cords in the zona fasciculata give way to irregular groups of cells of the zona reticularis.

Evidence also suggests that circulating glucocorticoids and the physiologic effects that they produce stimulate higher brain centers that, in turn, cause the hypothalamic neurons to release CRH. Zona Reticularis The zona reticularis produces glucocorticoids and androgens. The cells of the zona reticularis are noticeably smaller than those of the zona fasciculata, and their nuclei are more deeply stained. They are arranged in anastomosing cords separated by fenestrated capillaries. The cells have relatively few lipid droplets. Both light and dark cells are seen. Dark cells have abundant large lipofuscin pigment granules, and deeply staining nuclei are evident. The cells in this zone are small be- cause they have less cytoplasm than the cells in the zona fasci- culata; thus the nuclei appear more closely packed. They exhibit features of steroid- secreting cells, namely, a well-de- veloped sER and numerous elongated mitochondria with tubular cristae, but they have little rER. The principal secretions of the zona reticularis are weak androgens. The principal secretion of the cells in the zona reticularis con- sists of weak androgens, mostly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The cells also secrete some glucocorticoids, in much smaller amounts than those of the zona fasciculata. Here, too, the principal glucocorticoid secreted is cortisol. The zona reticularis is also regulated by the feedback control of the CRH–ACTH system and atrophies after hy- pophysectomy. Exogenous ACTH maintains the structure and function of the zona reticularis after hypophysectomy. Fetal Adrenal Gland The fetal adrenal gland consists of an outer narrow perma- nent cortex and an inner thick fetal cortex or fetal zone. Once fully established, the fetal adrenal gland is unusual in terms of its organization and its large size relative to other developing organs. The gland arises from mesodermal cells located between the root of the mesentery and the develop- ing gonad zone (see Fig. 21.19a). The mesodermal cells pen- etrate the underlying mesenchyme and give rise to a large 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 768chapter 21Endocrine Organs\u0003ADRENAL GLANDS 769 769 LL LL L L FIGURE 21.24 • Electron micrograph of cells in the zona fasciculata.

A higher magnification of an area in the cell at the top of the micrograph reveals the extensive sER that is characteristic of steroid- secreting cells. Portions of the Golgi apparatus are also evident. \u000240,000 Cholesterol is the basic precursor of several steroid hor- mones, namely, corticosteroids, sex hormones, bile acids, and vitamin D. About half of the cholesterol in the body comes from the diet and the other half derives from de novo biosynthesis. Cholesterol synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm and organelles from acetyl-CoA. Biosynthesis in the liver accounts for approximately 10%, and in the in- testines, approximately 15%, of the amount produced each day. In addition, a small portion of cholesterol is synthe- sized by the adrenal cortical cells. Both dietary cholesterol and that synthesized de novo are transported within low- density lipoproteins (LDLs). Cholesterol is stored in lipid droplets within the cytoplasm of adrenal cortical cells in the form of cholesterol esters. Steroid hormones in adrenal glands are synthesized from cholesterol esters by removal of part of the side chain and modifications at specific sites on the remainder of the molecule. The enzymes catalyzing these modifications are located in different zones of the cortex as well as in differ- ent cytoplasmic sites within the cells. For instance, cleav- age of the side chain is catalyzed by P450-linked side chain cleavage enzyme (P450ssc) or desmolase, which is found only in mitochondria of steroid-producing cells. The other enzymes necessary for steroid production are located within sER, cytosol, and mitochondria. Thus, a precursor molecule may move from the sER to a mitochon- drion and back again several times before the definitive molecular structure of a given corticosteroid is obtained. Cholesterol esters removed from cytoplasmic lipid droplets and used in steroid hormone synthesis are quickly replenished from the cholesterol esters contained within LDL carried in the bloodstream. These esters are the pri- mary source of the cholesterol used in corticosteroid syn- thesis. Under conditions of short-term or prolonged ACTH stimulation, the lipid stores in adrenal cortical cells are re- cruited for corticosteroid synthesis. • FOLDER 21.6 Functional Considerations: Biosynthesis of Adrenal Hormones eosinophilic cell mass that will become the functional fetal cortex or zone (see Fig. 21.19b). Later, a second wave of cells proliferates from the mesenchyme and surrounds the primary cell mass (see Fig. 21.19c). By the fourth fetal month, the adrenal gland reaches its maximum mass in terms of body weight and is only slightly smaller than the adjacent kidney. At term, the adrenal glands are equivalent in size and weight to those of the adult and produce 100 to 200 mg of steroid compounds per day, about twice that of the adult adrenals. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 769 770 The histologic appearance of the fetal adrenal gland is superficially similar to that of the adult adrenal gland. Dur- ing late fetal life, most of the gland consists of cords of large eosinophilic cells that constitute approximately 80% of its mass. This portion of the gland, referred to as the fetal cortex (also called fetal zone), arises from the initial mesodermal cell migration. The remainder of the gland is composed of the peripheral layer of small cells with scanty cytoplasm. This portion, referred to as the permanent cortex, arises from the secondary mesodermal cell migra- tion. The narrow permanent cortex, when fully established in the embryo, appears similar to the adult zona glomeru- losa. The cells are arranged in arched groups that extend into short cords. They, in turn, become continuous with the cords of the underlying fetal zone (Fig. 21.25). In H&E preparations, the cytoplasm of the cells in the permanent cortex exhibits some basophilia; in combination with the closely packed nuclei, this gives this part of the gland a blue appearance, in contrast to the eosinophilic staining of the fetal zone. With the TEM, the cells of the permanent cortex exhibit small mitochondria with shelf-like cristae, abundant ribo- somes, and small Golgi profiles. The cells of the fetal zone, in contrast, are considerably larger and are arranged in irregular cords of varying width. With the TEM, these cells exhibit spherical mitochondria with tubular cristae, small lipid droplets, an extensive sER that accounts for the eosinophilia of the cytoplasm, and multiple Golgi profiles. Collectively, these features are characteristic of steroid-secreting cells. The development of the fetal adrenal gland is a part of a complex process of maturation and preparation of the fetus for extrauterine life. The fetal adrenal lacks a definitive medulla. Chromaffin cells are present but are scattered among the cells of the fetal zone and are difficult to recognize in H&E preparations. The chro- maffin cells originate from the neural crest (see Fig. 21.19a) and invade the fetal zone at the time of its formation (see Fig. 21.19b). They remain in this location in small, scattered cell clusters during fetal life (see Fig. 21.19c). aa PCPC FZFZ CC acc bb CapCap c b PC FZ C Cap FIGURE 21.25 • Photomicrographs of a human fetal adrenal gland. a.

Donnelly.) 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 770chapter 21Endocrine Organs\u0003ADRENAL GLANDS 771 771 The blood supply to both the permanent cortex and the fetal zone is through sinusoidal capillaries that course between the cords and join to form larger venous channels in the center of the gland. Unlike the postnatal adrenal, arterioles are absent in the parenchyma of the fetal adrenal gland. Functionally, the fetal adrenal gland is under the control of the CRH–ACTH feedback system through the fetal pitu- itary. It interacts with the placenta to function as a steroid- secreting organ because it lacks certain enzymes necessary for steroid synthesis that are present in the placenta. Similarly, the placenta lacks certain enzymes necessary for steroid syn- thesis that are present in the fetal adrenal gland. Thus, the fetal adrenal gland is part of a fetal–placental unit. Precur- sor molecules are transported back and forth between the two organs to enable synthesis of glucocorticoids, aldosterone, androgens, and estrogens. At birth, the fetal cortex undergoes a rapid involution that reduces the gland within the first postnatal month to about a quarter of its previous size. The permanent cortex grows and matures to form the characteristic zonation of the adult cor- tex. With the involution and disappearance of the fetal zone cells, the chromafﬁn cells aggregate to form the medulla. If the adrenal glands fail to develop properly, congenital adrenal hyperplasia may result. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 771 the pars distalis (PD) and the pars nervosa. It borders a small cleft (Cl ) that constitutes the remains of the lumen of Rathke’s pouch. The pars distalis, the anterior lobe of the gland, is its largest part. It contains a variety of cell types that are not uniformly distributed. This accounts for differences in staining (light and dark staining areas) that are seen throughout the pars distalis. Each of the components of the adenohypophysis; i.e., the pars distalis, pars tuberalis, and pars intermedia, when examined at higher magnification, exhibit features at the cellular level that aid in their identification. These features are described in the following figures as well as those on Plate 81.PLATE 80 •PITUITARY I 772 \u0003 PLATE 80 Pituitary I The pituitary gland is located in a bony fossa in the floor of the cranial cavity. It is connected by a stalk to the base of the brain. Although joined to the brain, only posterior lobe of the gland, the neurohypophysis, develops from the neural ectoderm. The larger anterior lobe of the pituitary, the adenohypophysis, develops from oral ectoderm as a diverticulum of the buccal epithelium, called Rathke’s pouch. The adenohypophysis regulates other endocrine glands. It is composed of clumps and cords of epithelioid cells, separated by large-diameter fenestrated capillaries. The neurohypophysis is a nerve tract whose terminals store and release secretory products synthesized by their cell bodies in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. The secretions contain either oxytocin or vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]). Other neurons from the hypothalamus release secretions into the fenestrated capillaries of the infundibulum, the first capillary bed of the hypophyseal portal system that carries blood to the fenestrated capillaries of the adenohypophysis. These hypothalamic secretions regulate the activity of the adenohypophysis. Pituitary, human, H&E ×50. This specimen is a sagittal section of the pituitary gland. The neurohypophysis, the posterior lobe of the gland, is delineated by the dashed line (indicated by arrows) that separates it from the adenohypophysis.

In this particular region, the chromophobe nuclei are readily apparent, but the cytoplasm of the cells is difficult to discern. the bright red appearance. The pars intermedia contains a number of small cysts (Cy). The cells that make up the pars intermedia, which is relatively small in humans, consist of small basophils and chromophobes.

Chromophobes (C ) are also very numerous in this field. The cytoplasm stains poorly in contrast to that of the acidophils and basophils. The cells are arranged in cords and clumps, between which are capillaries (Cap), some of which can be recognized, but most are in a collapsed state and difficult to visualize at this magnification. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 772PLATE 80 •PITUITARY I 773 ClCl PNPN PDPD PTPT PIPI CapsCaps CapsCaps Cl PN PD PT PI Caps Caps BB AA CC CapCap B BBB A C Cap CCC BBB PDPD PIPI PNPN CyCy PD PI PN Cy 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 773PLATE 81 •PITUITARY II 774 KEY A, acidophils B, basophils C, chromophobes Cap, capillaries HB, Herring bodies P, pituicytes stains a reddish or rust color.

With this staining technique, the Herring bodies (HB) distinguished from the unmyelinated nerve fibers. The hormones of the neurohypophysis, oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (also called vasopressin), are formed in the hypothalamic nuclei and pass via the fibers of the hypothalamohypophyseal tract to the neurohypophysis, where they are stored in the expanded nerve terminal portion of the nerve fibers. The stored neurosecretory material appears as Herring bodies (HB). In H&E preparations, the Herring bodies simply appear as small islands of eosin- stained substance. Interspersed among the nerve fibers are capillaries (Cap). appear as the dark black islands. The inset shows the Herring body near the bottom of the micrograph at high magnification. The granular texture of the Herring body as seen here is a reflection of the accumulated secretory granules in the nerve terminals. Also of note in this specimen are the capil- laries (Cap), which are prominent as a result of the contrasting red staining of the red blood cells within them. \u0003 PLATE 81 Pituitary II The parenchyma of the pars distalis consists of two general cell types: chromophobes and chromophils. Chromophobes stain poorly; chromophils stain well. Chromophils are further subdivided into acidophils and basophils. Basophils stain with basic dyes or hematoxylin, whereas the cytoplasm of the acidophil stains with acid dyes such as eosin. The cytoplasm of basophils also stains with the periodic acid- Schiff (PAS) reaction because of the glycoprotein in its secretory granules. Acidophils can be further subdivided into two groups on the basis of special cytochemical and ultrastructural features. One group, called somatotropes, produces the growth hormone, somatotropic hormone (STH); the other group of acidophils, called lactotropes, produces the prolactin (PRL). The groups of basophils can also be distinguished with the electron microscope and with special cytochemical procedures. One group of thyrotropes produces the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH); another group of gonadotropes produces the gonadotropic hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH); and a third group of corticotropes produces adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and lipotropic hormone (LPH). Chromophobes are also a heterogeneous group of cells. Many are considered to be depleted acidophils or basophils. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 774PLATE 81 •PITUITARY II 775 AAA CapCapCap AA CC BB A C B CapCapCap CapCapCap CapCapCap HBHBHB HBHBHB HBHBHB PPP PPP BBB 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 775 \u0003 PLATE 82 Pineal Gland The pineal gland (pineal body, epiphysis cerebri) is located in the brain above the superior colliculi. It de- velops from neuroectoderm but, in the adult, bears little resemblance to nerve tissue. Two cell types have been described within the pineal gland: parenchymal cells and glial cells. The full extent of these cells cannot be appreciated without the application of special methods. Those would show that the glial cells and the parenchymal cells have processes and that the processes of the parenchymal cells are expanded at their periphery. The parenchymal cells are more numerous. In an H&E preparation, the nuclei of the parenchymal cells are pale staining. The nuclei of the glial cells, on the other hand, are smaller and stain more intensely. Although the physiology of the pineal gland is not well understood, the secretions of the gland evidently have an antigonadal effect. For example, hypogenitalism has been reported in pineal tumors that consist chiefly of parenchymal cells, whereas sexual precocity is associated with glial cell tumors (presumably, the parenchymal cells have been destroyed). In addition, experiments with animals indicate that the pineal gland has a neuroendocrine function whereby the pineal gland serves as an intermediary that relates endocrine function (particularly gonadal function) to cycles of light and dark. The external photic stimuli reach the pineal gland via optical pathways that connect with the superior cervical ganglion. In turn, the superior cervical ganglion sends postganglionic nerve fibers to the pineal gland. The extent to which these findings with laboratory animals apply to humans is not yet clear. Recent studies in humans suggest that the pineal gland has a role in adjusting to sudden changes in day length, such as those experienced by travelers who suffer from jet lag, and a role in regulating emo- tional responses to reduced day length during winter in temperate and subarctic zones (seasonal affec- tive disorder [SAD]).PLATE 82 •PINEAL GLAND 776 KEY A, artery BS, brain sand C, capillary Cap, capsule CT, connective tissue F, fibroblast G, glial cell L, lobule V, vein by the connective tissue.

The pineal gland is surrounded by a very thin capsule (Cap) that is formed by the pia mater. Connective tissue tra- beculae (CT ) extend from the capsule into the substance of the gland dividing it into lobules. The lobules (L) appear often as indistinct groups of cells of varying size surrounded Pineal gland, human, H&E ×360; inset ×700. This micrograph shows at higher magnification the parenchyma of the pineal gland as well as a component called brain sand (BS) or corpora arenacea. When viewed at even higher mag- nifications, the corpora arenacea are seen to have an indistinct lamellated structure. Typically, they stain heavily with hema- toxylin. The presence of these structures is an identifying feature of the pineal gland. A careful examination of the cells within the gland at the light microscopic level reveals two specific cell types. One cell type represents the parenchymal cells. These are by far the most numerous and are referred to as pinealocytes (or chief cells of the pineal gland). Pinealocytes are modified neurons. Their nuclei are spherical and are relatively lightly stained because of the amount of euchromatin that they contain. The second cell type is the interstitial cell or glial cell that constitutes a relatively small percentage of the cells in the gland. Their nuclei are smaller and more elongate than those of the pinealocytes. The inset reveals several glial cells (G) that can be iden- tified by their more densely staining nuclei. The majority of the nuclei of the other cells seen here belong to pinealocytes. Also seen in the inset are sev- eral fibroblasts (F ) that are present within a trabecula. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 776PLATE 82 •PINEAL GLAND 777 CapCapCap CTCTCT LLL LLL CCC CTCTCT VV AA V AFFF GGG GGG BSBSBS CTCTCT CCC VVV BSBSBS 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 777 \u0003 PLATE 83 Parathyroid and Thyroid Glands The parathyroid glands are usually four in number. Each is surrounded by a capsule and lies on or is partially embedded in the thyroid gland. Connective tissue trabeculae extend from the capsule into the substance of the gland. The parathyroid glands elaborate a hormone that influences calcium and bone metabolism. Injection of parathyroid hormone into laboratory animals results in the release of calcium from bone by the action of osteocytes (osteocytic osteolysis) and osteoclasts. Removal of parathyroid glands results in a rapid drop in blood calcium levels. The thyroid gland is located in the neck in close relation to the upper part of the trachea and the lower part of the larynx. It consists of two lateral lobes that are joined by a narrow isthmus. The follicle, which consists of a single layer of cuboidal or low columnar epithelium surround- ing a colloid-filled space, is the functional unit of the thyroid gland. A rich capillary network is present in the connective tissue that separates the follicles. The connective tissue also contains lymphatic capillaries.PLATE 83 •PARATHYROID AND THYROID GLANDS 778 KEY A, adipose cells BV, blood vessels CC, chief cells CT, connective tissue F, follicles OC, oxyphil cells arrows, tangential section of follicle wall asterisks, shrinkage artifact are conspicuously larger than chief cells but have a slightly smaller and more intensely staining nucleus. Their cytoplasm stains with eosin, and the boundaries between the cells are usually well marked. Moreover, the oxyphils are arranged in groups of variable size that appear scattered about in a much larger field of chief cells. Even with low magnification it is often possible to identify clusters of oxyphil cells because a unit area contains fewer nuclei than a comparable unit area of chief cells, as is clearly evident in this figure. Oxyphil cells appear during the end of the first decade of life and become more numerous around puberty. A further increase may be seen in older individuals. Parathyroid gland, human, H&E ×320. As seen here, the larger blood vessels are associated with the trabeculae (BV) and, occasionally, adipose cells (A). The parenchyma of the parathyroid glands appears as cords or sheets of cells separated by capillaries and delicate connective tissue septa. Two parenchymal cell types can be distinguished in routine H&E sec- tions: chief cells (principal cells) and oxyphil cells. The chief cells (CC ) are more numerous. They contain a spherical nucleus surrounded by a small amount of cytoplasm. Oxyphil cells (OC ) are less numerous. They Thyroid gland, human, H&E ×200. A histologic section of the thyroid gland is shown here. The thyroid follicles (F ) vary somewhat in size and shape and ap- pear closely packed. The homogeneous mass in the center of each follicle is the colloid. The thyroid cells appear to form a ring around the colloid. Although the individual cells are difficult to distinguish at this magnification, the nuclei of the cells serve as an indication of their location and arrangement. Large groups of cells are seen in association with some follicles. Where the nuclei are of the same size and staining characteristics, one can conclude that in these sites, the section includes the wall of the follicle (arrows) in a tangential manner without including the lumen. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 778PLATE 83 •PARATHYROID AND THYROID GLANDS 779 CTCT F BVBV CCCC OCOCOC A A A CC BV BV CCCCCC BVBVBV OCOCOC OCOCOC CCCCCC BVBVBV F FF FF CT * ** 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 779 \u0003 PLATE 84 Adrenal Gland I There are two adrenal glands, one at the upper pole of each kidney. The gland is a composite of two distinct structural and functional components: a cortex and a medulla. The cortex develops from mesoderm and secretes steroid hormones; the medulla develops from neuroectoderm of the neural crest and secretes catecholamines. The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones according to the type and arrangement of its parenchymal cells. These are designated zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis. The zona glomerulosa constitutes 15% of the cortical volume. It secretes mineralocorti- coids (aldosterone and deoxycorticosterone). The zona fasciculata constitutes nearly 80% of the cortical volume. It secretes the glucocorti- coids (cortisol, cortisone, and corticosterone) and a small amount of adrenal androgens. The zona reticularis (5% to 7% of cortical volume) produces most of the adrenal androgens. The zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis are regulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secreted by the adenohypophysis in response to corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) produced by the hypothalamus. The zona glomerulosa is not regulated by ACTH but is under feedback control of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that also regulates blood pressure.PLATE 84 •ADRENAL GLAND I 780 KEY A, arteries AT, adipose tissue BV, blood vessels Cap, capsule Cort, cortex Med, medulla ZF, zona fasciculata ZG, zona glomerulosa ZR, zona reticularis arrows, connective tissue trabeculae dashed line, corticomedullary boundary and staining characteristics.

A small amount of adipose tissue (AT ) in which the gland is partially embedded is seen at the upper center of the micrograph. The corticomedullary boundary (dashed lines) has a wave- like contour, a reflection of the irregular shape of the gland. Within the medulla are a number of relatively large blood vessels (BV ). These are the adrenomedullary collecting veins that drain both the cortex and the medulla. Adrenal gland, human, H&E ×45. This low-magnification micrograph of a section through the partial thickness of an adrenal gland shows the outer capsule (Cap), the cortex (Cort) from one surface of the gland, the un- derlying medulla (Med ), and a very small portion of the cortex from the other surface of the gland (Cort, bottom center). The cortex has a distinctly different appearance in both structural organization Cortex, adrenal gland, human, H&E ×180. This is a higher magnification of a portion of the capsule and the full thickness of the cortex from an area in figure above. The capsule consists of dense connective tissue in which the larger arteries (A) travel to give rise to smaller vessels that will supply the cortex and medulla. The zona glomerulosa (ZG) is located at the outer part of the cortex, immediately under the capsule. The parenchyma of this zone consists of small cells that appear as arching cords or as oval groups of cells. The zona fasciculata (ZF ) consists of radially oriented cords and sheets of cells, usually two cells in width, that extend toward the medulla. The cells of the outer part of the zona fasciculata are generally larger than those of the inner portion of this zone and typically stain poorly because of the large number of lipid droplets that they contain. The cells of the zona reticularis (ZR) are relatively small and contain little or no lipid droplets and, conse- quently, stain prominently with eosin. Because of their small size, the nuclei are in close proximity to one another, much like the cells of the zona glomerulosa. Cortex, adrenal gland, human, H&E ×245. This is a higher magnification of the area inscribed by the left rectangle in figure above. It shows the zona glomerulosa (ZG) and the outer portion of the zona fasciculata (ZF). Note the smaller size of the cells in the zona glomerulosa than those in the zona fasciculata. In addition, cells of the zona glomerulosa contain fewer lipid droplets than those of the zona fasciculata. Typically, the cells in this part of the zona fasciculata are filled with lipid droplets, thus, the very poor staining characteristic of their cytoplasm. Del- icate connective tissue trabeculae (arrows) extend from the capsule to sur- round the glomerular groups of cells and extend between the cords of cells in the zona fasciculata. Capillaries and arterioles are located within the con- nective tissue trabeculae. Usually, the capillaries are collapsed and, without the presence of red blood cells in their lumina, are thus difficult to identify. Cortex, adrenal gland, human, H&E ×245. This is a higher magnification of the area inscribed by the right rectangle in figure above. This deep portion of the zona fascic- ulata (ZF ) reveals smaller cells, although they are still arranged in cords and contain lipid droplets, though in lesser amounts. The cells of the zona reticularis (ZR) are arranged in irregular anastomosing cords and contain at best only a small amount of lipid and, consequently, their cyto- plasm stains with eosin. 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 780PLATE 84 •ADRENAL GLAND I 781 ATAT CortCort CortCort MedMed BVBV CapCap AT Cort Cort Med BV Cap CapCapCap ZGZGZG ZGZGZG ZFZFZF ZFZFZF ZFZFZF ZRZRZR ZRZRZR AAA 72006_ch21 15/07/10 4:06 PM Page 781 \u0003 PLATE 85 Adrenal Gland II The cells of the adrenal medulla develop from the same source as the postganglionic cells of the sympathetic nervous system. They are directly innervated by preganglionic cells of the sympathetic system and may be regarded as modified postganglionic cells that are specialized to secrete. These cells produce the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine. The adrenal medulla receives its blood supply via two routes: by arterioles that pass through the cortex and by capillaries that continue from the cortex, a type of portal circulation. Thus, some of the blood supplying the medulla contains cortical secretions that regulate medullary function. Blood leaves the medulla via the central adrenomedullary vein. Its structure is unusual in that the tunica media of the vessel contains prominent bundles of longitudinally oriented smooth muscle, the contraction of which facilitates rapid outflow of blood when medullary cate- cholamines are released.PLATE 85 •ADRENAL GLAND II 782 KEY AMV, central adrenomedullary vein Cap, capillary GC, ganglion cells L, lumen of central adrenomedullary vein MC, medullary cells SM, smooth muscle TI, tunica intima TM, tunica media staining.

The accessory sex glands include the seminal vesicles, the prostate, and bulbourethral glands. The two primary func- tions of the testis are spermatogenesis (the production of sperm, called male gametes), and steroidogenesis (synthesis of androgens, also called sex hormones). Androgens, mainly testosterone, are essential for spermatogenesis, play an im- portant role in embryonic development of the male embryo into the phenotypic male fetus, and are responsible for sexual dimorphism (male physical and behavioral characteristics). 784 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:52 PM Page 784chapter 22Male Reproductive System\u0003TESTIS 785 785 with familial Wilms’s tumor and in children with accom- panied genitourinary malformations. • SOX-9 gene found in the genital ridges activates the AMH gene that is responsible for Müllerian-inhibiting factor synthesis. The mutation of the SOX9 gene is linked to a reversal of the gender of a male individual (46, XY). • SF-1 gene (steroidogenic factor-1 gene) that regulates the expression of a number of steroidogenic genes. • DAX-1 gene that encodes nuclear receptor DAX-1. Acti- vation of this receptor suppresses the SRY gene during gonadal sex differentiation and its mutation is responsi- ble for congenital adrenal hypoplasia. The testes develop on the posterior wall of the abdomen and later descend into the scrotum. The testes develop in close association with the urinary sys- tem retroperitoneally on the posterior wall of the abdominal cavity. Testes (like ovaries) are derived from three sources: • Intermediate mesoderm that forms the urogenital ridges on the posterior abdominal wall, giving rise to Ley- dig cells (interstitial cells) and myoid cells (peritubular contractile cells) • Mesodermal epithelium (coelomic mesothelium) that lines the urogenital ridges and gives rise to Sertoli cells • Primordial germ cells that migrate from the yolk sac into developing gonads, where they divide and differentiate into spermatogonia Migration of the primordial germ cells into the genital ridges induces mesodermal cells of the urogenital ridges and cells of the coelomic mesothelium to proliferate and form the primary sex cords. At this stage, these cords are comprised of primordial germ cells, pre-Sertoli cells, and a surrounding layer of myoid cells. Later, primary sex cords wall and projects into the scrotum. Testes are connected by the spermatic cords to the abdominal wall and tethered to the scrotum by scrotal ligaments, the remnants of the gubernacu- lum (see further in the chapter). Gender Determination and Development of the Testis Gender differentiation is accomplished through a cascade of gene activations. Genetic sex is determined at fertilization by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. The testes, however, do not form until the seventh week of development. Gonadal sex is determined by the presence of the SRY gene located in the sex-determining region of the short arm of the Y chromo- some. The SRY gene expression in early embryonic develop- ment is responsible for gender determination. The genetic information encoded in the Y chromosome itself is not sufficient to guide a complex development of the male gonads. Instead, the SRY gene operates as a master switch that controls the cascade of several gene activations on autosomes 9, 11, 17, and 19 and the X chromosome. A tran- scription factor called the testis-determining factor (TDF), encoded by the SRY gene, has a molecular domain that binds into a specific region of DNA and alters it struc- ture. The affected DNA forms a loop that permits binding of other transcription factors. They in turn cause the expres- sion of other genes that initiate formation of not only the testes but also other male sex organs. Several other genes are expressed about the same time as the SRY gene, includ- ing these: • WT-1 gene, that is required for the development of the urogenital system and for regulation of the SRY transcrip- tion. Mutations of the WT-1 gene are found in children FIGURE 22.1 • Schematic diagram demonstrating the components of the male reproductive system.

In the first stage of development, the testes develop on the posterior abdominal wall from indifferent primordia of urogenital ridges that are identical in both sexes. During this indifferent stage an embryo has the potential to de- velop into either a male or female. However, expression of the SRY gene—exclusively in the pre-Sertoli cells—orchestrates male development of the embryo. Early in male develop- ment, mesenchyme separating the seminiferous cords gives rise to Leydig (interstitial) cells that produce testos- terone to stimulate development of the indifferent pri- mordium into a testis. Testosterone is also responsible for the growth and differentiation of the mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts that develop into the male genital excurrent ducts. Also in this early stage, the Sertoli (sustentacular) cells that de- velop within the seminiferous cords produce another important hormonal substance, called Müllerian-inhibiting factor (MIF). MIF’s molecular structure is similar to that of transforming growth factor-\u0002 (TGF-\u0002). It is a large glycopro- tein that inhibits cell division of the paramesonephric (Mül- lerian) ducts, which in turn inhibits development of female reproductive organs (Fig. 22.3). Development and differentiation of the external genitalia (also from the sexually indifferent stage) occur at the same time and result from the action of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a product of the conversion of testosterone by 5\u0003- reductase. Without DHT, regardless of the genetic or gonadal sex, the external genitalia will develop along the female tem- plate. The appearance of testosterone, MIF, and DHT in the developing male embryo determines its hormonal sex. (Folder 22.1) At approximately the 26th week of gestation, the testes descend from the abdomen into the scrotum.

This diagram shows the 5-week embryo in the stage of indifferent gonads. The gonadal ridges visible on the posterior abdominal wall are being infiltrated by primordial germ cells (green) that migrate from the yolk sac. Most of the developing gonad is formed by mesenchyme derived from the coelomic epithelium. The primordial germ cells become incorporated in the primary sex cords. b. At a later stage, under hormonal influence of testis- determining factor (TDF), the developing gonad initiates production of testosterone. This is followed by differentiation of the primary sex cords into seminiferous cords. At the same time, the developing gonad produces Müllerian-inhibiting factor (MIF), which causes regression of the paramesonephric duct and those structures derived from it. Note that the mesonephric tubules come in close contact with the developing rete testis. c. Final stages of testicular development. The tunica albuginea surrounding the testis contributes to development of the testicular septa. The rete testis connects with the seminiferous cords and with the excurrent duct system that develops from the mesonephric duct and tubules. 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:52 PM Page 786 787chapter 22Male Reproductive System\u0003TESTIS 787 XY X Y gonad in indifferent stage Sertoli cells Leydig cells MIF paramesonephric duct spermovum SRY gene TDF(+) region testosterone DHT penis scrotum prostate gland prostatic urethra penile urethra efferent ductules epididymis ductus deferens seminal vesicle ejaculatory duct chromosomes determining genetic sex region determining gonadal sex mesonephric duct and mesonephric tubules regression urogenital sinus indifferent genitalia secretion determining hormonal sex TESTIS FIGURE 22.3 • Schematic diagram of male sex development and hormonal inﬂuence on developing reproductive organs. This diagram illustrates three levels on which the sex of the developing embryo is determined.

During descent, the testes carry their blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves as well as their principal ex- current duct system, the ductus deferens with them. De- scent of the testis is sometimes obstructed, resulting in cryptorchidism, or undescended testes. This condition is common (30%) in premature newborns and about 1% of full- term newborns. Cryptorchidism can lead to irre- versible histologic changes in the testis and increases the risk of testicular cancer. Therefore, an undescended testis requires surgical correction. Orchiopexy (placement in the scrotal sac) should be performed, preferably before histologic changes become irreversible at approximately 2 years of age. Spermatogenesis requires that the testes be maintained below normal body temperature. As the testes descend from the abdominal cavity into the scrotum, they carry with them blood vessels, lymphatic ves- sels, autonomic nerves, and an extension of the abdominal peritoneum called the tunica vaginalis, which covers their anterolateral surface. Within the scrotum the temperature of the testes is 2\u0004C to 3\u0004C below body temperature. This lower temperature is essential for spermatogenesis, but is not required for hormone production (steroidogenesis), which can occur at normal body temperature. If the testes are maintained at higher temperatures (e.g., because of fever) or if they fail to descend into the scrotum, sperm are not produced. Each testis receives blood through a testicular artery, a direct branch of the abdominal aorta. It is highly convo- luted near the testis, where it is surrounded by the pampini- form venous plexus, which carries blood from the testis to the abdominal veins. This arrangement allows heat ex- change between the blood vessels and helps maintain the testes at a lower temperature. The cooler venous blood returning from the testis cools the arterial blood before it enters the testis through a countercurrent heat exchange mechanism. In addition, the cremaster muscle, whose fibers originate from the internal abdominal oblique muscle of the anterior abdominal wall, responds to changes in am- bient temperature. Its contraction moves the testes closer to the abdominal wall, and its relaxation lowers the testes within the scrotum. Cold temperatures also cause contrac- tion of a thin sheet of smooth muscle (dartos muscle) in the superficial fascia of the scrotum. Contraction of dartos abdominal cavity combined with the action of testosterone that causes shortening of the gubernaculum, the testos- terone-sensitive ligament connecting the inferior pole of each testis with the developing scrotum. The testes descend into the scrotum by passing through the inguinal canal, the 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:52 PM Page 787 stroma, in which Leydig (interstitial) cells are contained (Fig. 22.5). Each tubule within the lobule forms a loop and, because of its considerable length, is highly convoluted, actually folding on itself within the lobule. The ends of the loop are located near the mediastinum of the testis, where they assume a short straight course. This part of the seminiferous tubule is called the straight tubule (tubulus rectus). It becomes continuous with the rete testis, an anastomosing channel system within the mediastinum. The seminiferous tubules consist of a seminiferous ep- ithelium surrounded by a tunica propria. Each seminiferous tubule is approximately 50 cm long (range, 30 to 80 cm) and 150 to 250 \u0005m in diameter. The seminiferous epithelium is an unusual and complex stratified epithelium composed of two basic cell populations: • Sertoli cells, also known as supporting, or sustentacular, cells. These cells do not replicate after puberty. Sertoli cells are columnar cells with extensive apical and lateral pro- cesses that surround the adjacent spermatogenic cells and occupy the spaces between them. However, this elaborate configuration of the Sertoli cells cannot be seen distinctly in routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) preparations. muscles causes the scrotum to wrinkle when cold to help regulate heat loss (Folder 22.2). Structure of the Testis The testes have an unusually thick connective tissue capsule, the tunica albuginea. An unusually thick, dense connective tissue capsule, the tunica albuginea, covers each testis (Fig. 22.4). The inner part of this capsule, the tunica vasculosa, is a loose con- nective tissue layer that contains blood vessels. Each testis is divided into approximately 250 lobules by incomplete connective tissue septa that project from the capsule. Along the posterior surface of the testis, the tunica albuginea thickens and projects inward as the mediastinum testis. Blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and the genital excurrent ducts pass through the mediastinum as they enter or leave the testis. Each lobule consists of several highly convoluted seminif- erous tubules. Each lobule of the testis consists of one to four seminiferous tubules, in which sperm are produced, and a connective tissue 788 Normal function of testis is dependent upon hormones acting through endocrine and paracrine pathways. The endocrine function of the testis resides primarily in the Leydig cell pop- ulation that synthesizes and secretes the principal circulating androgen, testosterone. Nearly all of the testosterone is produced by the testis; less than 5% is produced by the adrenal glands. It is estimated in humans that the total Leydig cell population produces about 7 mg of testosterone per day. As testosterone leaves the Leydig cells, it passes into blood and lymphatic capillaries and across the peritubular tissue to reach the seminiferous epithelium. High local levels of testosterone within the testis (esti- mated to be as much as 200 times the circulating levels) are necessary for the proliferation and differentiation of sper- matogenic cells. This high testicular level of testosterone can be significantly decreased by negative feedback from exogenous testosterone. Intensive research in this area is being directed into development of a prototype of testos- terone-based contraceptive drugs for men. In early clinical studies, these drugs have been shown to cause a significant decrease in the testicular testosterone concentration and inhibition of spermatogenesis. Recovery of spermatogene- sis occurs after discontinuation of contraceptive use. How- ever, in some individuals, this type of contraceptive is not efficacious and does not cause spermatogenic suppression. Peripheral testosterone levels have the following effects: • Differentiation of the central nervous system (CNS) and the genital apparatus and genital excurrent duct system • Growth and maintenance of secondary sexual charac- teristics (such as the beard, male distribution of pubic hair, and low-pitched voice) • Growth and maintenance of the accessory sex glands (seminal vesicles and prostate and bulbourethral glands), genital excurrent duct system, and the external genitalia (mainly byproducts of testosterone conversion to DHT) • Anabolic and general metabolic processes, including skeletal growth, skeletal muscle growth, distribution of subcutaneous fat, and kidney function • Behavior, including libido The steroidogenic and spermatogenic activities of the testis are regulated by hormonal interaction among the hy- pothalamus, anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, and gonadal cells (i.e., Sertoli, spermatogenic, and Leydig cells). The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland produces three hormones involved in this process: luteinizing hormone (LH), which in the male is sometimes referred to as interstitial cell–stimulating hormone (ICSH); follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH); and prolactin (PRL). In response to LH release by the pituitary, Leydig cells pro- duce increasing amounts of testosterone. PRL acts in combination with LH to increase the steroidogenic activity of Leydig cells. Because FSH and testosterone receptors are found in Sertoli cells, these cells are the primary regu- lators of spermatogenesis. • FOLDER 22.1 Functional Considerations: Hormonal Regulation of Spermatogenesis 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:52 PM Page 788 789chapter 22Male Reproductive System\u0003TESTIS 789 Spermatogenic cells are very sensitive to noxious agents. Degenerative changes, such as apoptosis, premature sloughing of cells, or formation of multinucleated giant cells, are readily apparent after exposure to such agents. Factors that negatively affect spermatogenesis include these: • Dietary deﬁciencies. Reduced dietary intake is known to impair spermatogenesis. Vitamins, coenzymes, and microelements such as vitamin A, B12, C, E, \u0002- carotenes, zinc, and selenium have been shown to affect sperm formation. • Environmental/lifestyle factors. A recent study con- ducted in Denmark compared the sperm count in two groups of young men from rural and urban populations. A higher median sperm count (24%) was found in the men from the rural group compared with those from the urban group. • Developmental disorders. Cryptorchidism, hypospa- dias, and factors such as low birth weight have been found to be important risk factors for testicular cancer associated with reduced semen quality and reduced fertility. • Systemic diseases or local infections. Infections involving the testis (orchitis) may have an effect on sper- matogenesis. Systemic diseases that can impair sper- matogenesis include fever, kidney diseases, HIV and other viral infections, and metabolic disorders. • Elevated testicular temperature. A sedentary lifestyle may impair the ability to maintain the lower temperature of the testis in the scrotum. A higher than average scrotal temperature has been linked to failure of spermatogenesis. • Steroid hormones and related medications. Expo- sure to synthetic estrogen (diethylstilbestrol) and other sex steroids can exert negative feedback on FSH secre- tion, resulting in decreased spermatogenesis. Prenatal exposure to estrogens can potentially inhibit fetal go- nadotropin secretion and inhibit Sertoli cell proliferation. • Toxic agents. Mutagenic agents, antimetabolites, and some pesticides, e.g., dibromochloropropane (DBCP), can drastically affect spermatogenesis and production of normal sperm. DBCP is a nematocide pesticide that is still used in some developing countries. It has been shown to cause a major decrease in sperm count and infertility after human exposure. Other agents that may affect fertility include chemicals in plastics (e.g., phtha- lates), pesticides (e.g., DDT), products of combustion (e.g., dioxins), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and others. Most of these chemicals possess very weak estrogen properties and may affect fertility. Direct toxic- ity to the spermatogonia is linked to changes in sperm quality. • Ionizing radiation and alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustard gas and procarbazine have been found to have toxic effects on spermatogonia. Electromagnetic and mi- crowave radiation also affect sperm count and motility. Proliferating cells are particularly sensitive to mutagenic agents and the absence of essential metabolites. There- fore, nondividing Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and reserve stem cells, which demonstrate low mitotic activity, are much less vulnerable than actively dividing, differentiating spermatogenic cells. • FOLDER 22.2 Clinical Correlation: Factors Affecting Spermatogenesis Sertoli cells give structural organization to the tubules as they extend through the full thickness of the seminiferous epithelium. • Spermatogenic cells, which regularly replicate and differ- entiate into mature sperm. These cells are derived from pri- mordial germ cells originating in the yolk sac that colonize the gonadal ridges during early development of the testis. Spermatogenic cells are organized in poorly defined layers of progressive development between adjacent Sertoli cells (Fig. 22.6). The most immature spermatogenic cells, called spermatogonia, rest on the basal lamina. The most mature cells, called spermatids, are attached to the apical portion of the Sertoli cell, where they border the lumen of the tubule. The tunica (lamina) propria, also called peritubular tissue, is a multilayered connective tissue that lacks typical fibroblasts. In man, it consists of three to five layers of myoid cells (peritubular contractile cells) and collagen fibrils, exter- nal to the basal lamina of the seminiferous epithelium (see Fig. 22.6). At the ultrastructural level, myoid cells demonstrate features associated with smooth muscle cells, including a basal lamina and large numbers of actin filaments. They also exhibit a significant amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), a feature indicating their role in collagen synthesis in the absence of typical fibroblasts. Rhythmic contractions of the myoid cells create peristaltic waves that help move sper- matozoa and testicular fluid through the seminiferous tubules to the excurrent duct system. Blood vessels and extensive lym- phatic vasculature as well as Leydig cells are present external to the myoid layer. As a normal consequence of aging, the tunica propria increases in thickness. This thickening is accompanied by a de- creased rate of sperm production and an overall reduction in the size of the seminiferous tubules. Excessive thickening of the tunica propria earlier in life is associated with infertility. Leydig Cells Leydig cells (interstitial cells) are large, polygonal, eosinophilic cells that typically contain lipid droplets (Fig. 22.7). 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:52 PM Page 789 head of epididymis body of epididymis mediastinum testis rete testis efferent ductules septum straight tubules tail of the epididymis ductus deferens a tunicatunica albugineaalbuginea tunicatunica vaginalisvaginalis rete testisrete testis body of epididymisbody of epididymis head of epididymis tunica albuginea tunica vaginalis rete testis body of epididymis b seminiferous tubule tunica albuginea tunica vaginalis Lipofuscin pigment is also frequently present in these cells as well as distinctive, rod-shaped cytoplasmic crystals, the crys- tals of Reinke (Fig. 22.8). In routine histologic prepara- tions, these crystals are refractile and measure approximately 3 \u0006 20 \u0005m. Although their exact nature and function re- main unknown, they probably represent a protein product of the cell. Like other steroid-secreting cells, Leydig cells have an elab- orate smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER), a feature that ac- counts for their eosinophilia (see Fig. 22.7). The enzymes necessary for the synthesis of testosterone from cholesterol are associated with the sER. Mitochondria with tubulovesicular cristae, another characteristic of steroid-secreting cells, are also present in Leydig cells. Leydig cells differentiate and secrete testosterone during early fetal life. Secretion of testosterone is required during embryonic development, sexual maturation, and reproduc- tive function: • In the embryo, secretion of testosterone and other andro- gens is essential for the normal development of the gonads in the male fetus. • At puberty, secretion of testosterone is responsible for the initiation of sperm production, accessory sex gland secre- tion, and development of secondary sex characteristics. • In the adult, secretion of testosterone is essential for the maintenance of spermatogenesis and of secondary sex char- acteristics, genital excurrent ducts, and accessory sex glands. The Leydig cells are active in the early differentiation of the male fetus and then undergo a period of inactivity beginning at about 5 months of fetal life. Inactive Leydig cells are difficult to distinguish from fibroblasts. When Leydig cells are exposed to gonadotropic stimulation at puberty, they again become androgen-secreting cells and remain active throughout life. Leydig cell tumors represents predominately benign tumors, which occur during two distinct periods (in childhood and in adults between 20 and 60 years old). They are hormo - nally active and secrete androgens or combination of andro- gens and estrogens. Commonly, they are composed of uniform cells with all characteristics of steroid hormone-secreting cells containing Reinke crystals. The ﬁrst symptom of these benign tumors, besides testicular enlargement, usually is related to abnormal level of hormone production.

Spermatogenesis, the process by which sperm are produced, involves a complex and unique series of events. It begins shortly before puberty, under the influence of rising levels of pituitary gonadotropins, and continues throughout life. For descriptive purposes, spermatogenesis is divided into three distinct phases: • Spermatogonial phase, in which spermatogonia divide by mitosis to replace themselves as well as provide a popu- lation of committed spermatogonia that will eventually differentiate into primary spermatocytes • Spermatocyte phase (meiosis), in which primary sper- matocytes undergo two meiotic divisions to reduce both the chromosome number and amount of DNA to produce haploid cells called spermatids • Spermatid phase (spermiogenesis), in which sper- matids differentiate into mature sperm cells At the end of spermatogenesis, spermatids undergo their final maturation and are released during a process called spermiation from the supporting Sertoli cells into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. Spermatogonial Phase In the spermatogonial phase, stem cells divide to replace themselves and provide a population of committed sper- matogonia. Spermatogonial stem cells undergo multiple divisions and produce spermatogonial progeny that display differences in nuclear appearance in routine H&E preparations. 792 FIGURE 22.7 • Electron micrograph of Leydig cells.

These spermatogonia are thought to be the stem cells of the sem- iniferous epithelium. They divide at irregular intervals to give rise to either a pair of type Ad spermatogonia that re- main as stem cells or to a pair of type Ap spermatogonia. • Type A pale (Ap) spermatogonia have ovoid nuclei with lightly staining, finely granular chromatin. Ap sper- matogonia are committed to the differentiation process that produces the sperm. They undergo several successive mitotic divisions, thereby increasing their number. • Type B spermatogonia have generally spherical nuclei with chromatin that is condensed into large clumps along the nuclear envelope and around a central nucleolus (see Fig. 22.6). An unusual feature of the division of an Ad spermatogo- nium into two type Ap spermatogonia is that the daughter cells remain connected by a thin cytoplasmic bridge. This same phe- nomenon occurs through each subsequent mitotic and meiotic division of the progeny of the original pair of Ap spermatogo- nia (Fig. 22.9). Thus, all of the progeny of an initial pair of Ap spermatogonia are connected, much like a strand of pearls. These cytoplasmic connections remain intact to the last stages of spermatid maturation and are essential for the synchronous development of each clone from an original pair of Ap cells. After several divisions, type A spermatogonia differentiate into type B spermatogonia. The appearance of type B spermato- gonia represents the last event in the spermatogonial phase. Spermatocyte Phase (Meiosis) In the spermatocyte phase, primary spermatocytes un- dergo meiosis to reduce both the chromosome number and the amount of DNA. The mitotic division of type B spermatogonia produces primary spermatocytes. They replicate their DNA shortly after they form and before meiosis begins, so that each primary spermatocyte contains the normal chromosomal number (2n) and double the amount of DNA (4d ). Each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids; hence, 4d amount of DNA. Meiosis I results in reduction of both the number of chro- mosomes (from 2n to 1n) and the amount of DNA to the haploid condition (from 4d to 2d); thus, secondary spermato- cyte is characterized by haploid number of chromosomes (1n) and 2d amount of DNA. Because no DNA replication pre- cedes meiosis II, after this division each spermatid has the hap- loid (1n) number of chromosomes, each containing a single chromatid (1d). Meiosis is described in detail in Chapter 3 (see page 89); a brief description of spermatocyte meiosis follows. Prophase of the first meiotic division, during which the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, lasts up to 22 days in human primary spermatocytes. At the end of prophase, 44 autosomes and an X and a Y chromosome, each having two chromatin strands (chromatids), can be identi- fied. Homologous chromosomes are paired as they line up on the metaphase plate. The paired homologous chromosomes, called tetrads because they consist of four chromatids, exchange genetic material in a process called crossing-over. During this exchange, the four chromatids rearrange into a tripartite structure called a synaptonemal complex. This process ensures genetic diversity. Through genetic exchange, the four spermatids produced from each spermatocyte differ from each other and from every other spermatid. After crossing- over is complete, the homologous chromosomes separate and move to the opposite poles of the meiotic spindle. Thus, the tetrads, which have been modified by crossing-over, separate and become dyads again. The two chromatids of each original chromosome (although modified by crossing-over) remain together. This is just the opposite of what happens in mitosis, in which the paired chromatids—one representing the “tem- plate” and the other, newly synthesized DNA—separate.

Cameron.) 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:52 PM Page 793 The movement of a particular chromosome of a homologous pair to either pole of the spindle is random (i.e., maternally de- rived chromosomes and paternally derived chromosomes do not sort themselves out at the metaphase plate). This random sort- ing is another source of genetic diversity in the resulting sperm. The cells derived from the first meiotic division are called secondary spermatocytes. These cells immediately enter the prophase of the second meiotic division without synthesizing new DNA (i.e., without passing through an S phase; see pages 89–93). Each secondary spermatocyte has a reduced number of chromosomes to (1n), which is represented by 22 autosomes and an X or a Y chromosome. Each of these chromosomes consists of two sister chromatids. The secondary spermatocyte has the (2d), diploid amount of DNA. During metaphase of the second meiotic division, the chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate, and the sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the spindle. As the second meiotic division is completed and the nuclear membranes re-form, two haploid spermatids, each containing 23 single-stranded chromo- somes (1n) and the (1d) amount of DNA, are formed from each secondary spermatocyte (Fig. 22.10). Spermatid Phase (Spermiogenesis) In the spermatid phase, spermatids undergo extensive cell remodeling as they differentiate into mature sperm. Each spermatid that results from the second meiotic division is haploid in DNA content (1d) and chromosome number (1n) represented by 22 autosomes and an X or Y chromosome. No further division occurs. The haploid spermatids undergo a differentiation process that produces mature sperm, which are also haploid. The normal diploid condition is restored when a sperm fertilizes an oocyte. The extensive cell remodeling that occurs during differenti- ation of the spermatid population into mature sperm (spermio- genesis) consists of four phases. These phases occur while the spermatids are physically attached to the Sertoli cell plasma membrane by specialized junctions. The morphologic changes in all four phases that occur during spermiogenesis are de- scribed here and summarized in Figure 22.11. • Golgi phase. This phase is characterized by the presence of periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)-positive granules that accumulate in the multiple Golgi complexes of the spermatid.

This diagram shows the clonal nature of the successive generations of spermatogenic cells. Cytoplasmic division is complete only in the primitive type A dark spermatogonia that serve as stem cells. All other spermatogenic cells remain connected by intercellular bridges as they undergo mitotic and meiotic division and differentiation of the spermatids. The cells separate into individual spermatozoa as they are released from the seminiferous epithelium. The residual bodies remain connected and are phagocytosed by the Sertoli cells.

The two pairs of chromosomes (2n) of maternal and paternal origin are depicted in red and blue, respectively. The mitotic division produces daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parental (2n) cell. The meiotic division, which has two components, a reductional division and an equatorial division, produces a cell that has only half the number of chromosomes (n). In addition, during the chromosome pairing in prophase I of meiosis, chromosome segments are exchanged, crossing-over, creating genetic diversity. In humans, the first polar body does not divide, but it does so in other species. *Note that prophase II, anaphase II, and telophase II are not shown. 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:52 PM Page 795 The centrioles, which had earlier initiated the develop- ment of the flagellum, now move back to the posterior sur- face of the nucleus where the immature centriole becomes attached to a shallow groove in the nucleus. They are then modified to form the connecting piece, or neck region, of the developing sperm. Nine coarse fibers develop from the centri- oles attached to the nucleus and extend into the tail as the outer dense fibers peripheral to the microtubules of the axoneme. These fibers unite the nucleus with the flagellum; hence, the name connecting piece. As the plasma membrane moves posteriorly to cover the growing ﬂagellum, the manchette disappears, and the mito- chondria migrate from the rest of the cytoplasm to form a tight, helically wrapped sheath around the coarse fibers in the neck region and its immediate posterior extension (Fig. 22.12). This region is the middle piece of the tail of the sperm. Dis- tal to the middle piece, a ﬁbrous sheath consisting of two longitudinal columns and numerous connecting ribs sur- rounds the nine longitudinal fibers of the principal piece and extends nearly to the end of the flagellum. This short segment of the tail distal to the fibrous sheath is called the end piece. • Maturation phase. This last phase of spermatid remodel- ing reduces excess cytoplasm from around the flagella to form mature spermatozoon. The Sertoli cells then phagocytose this excess cytoplasm, also termed the resid- ual body. The intercellular bridges that have characterized the developing gametes since the prespermatocyte stages remain with the residual bodies. Spermatids are no longer attached to each other and are released from the Sertoli cells. Spermatids are released into the lumen of the seminifer- ous tubules during the process called spermiation. Toward the end of maturation phase of spermatogenesis, elongated spermatids are released from Sertoli cells into the lumen of seminiferous tubule. This complex process, called spermiation involves progressive removal of specialized Sertoli-to-spermatid junctional complexes and disengagement of spermatids from the Sertoli cell. The presence of the \u00021-integrins in the Sertoli-to-spermatid junctions, as well as in- creased activity of the integrin-linked kinase at the time of sper- miation, suggests an enzymatic control of spermatid release. The rate of spermiation in the testis determines the number of sperm cells in the ejaculate of semen. Various pharmacologic treatments, toxic agents, and gonadotropin suppression result in spermiation failure, in which spermatids are not released but instead are retained and phagocytosed by the Sertoli cell. Structure of the Mature Sperm The events of spermiogenesis result in a structurally unique cell. The mature human sperm is about 60 \u0005m long. The sperm head is flattened and pointed and measures 4.5 \u0005m long by 3 \u0005m wide by 1 \u0005m thick (see Fig. 22.12). The acrosomal cap that covers the anterior two-thirds of the nucleus contains hyaluronidase, neuraminidase, acid phosphatase, and a trypsin-like protease called acrosin. These acrosomal en- zymes are essential for penetration of the zona pellucida of the proacrosomal granules, rich in glycoproteins, coalesce into a membrane-bounded vesicle, the acrosomal vesicle, adjacent to the nuclear envelope. The vesicle enlarges and its contents increase during this phase. The position of the acro- somal vesicle determines the anterior pole of the developing sperm. Also during this phase, the centrioles migrate from the juxtanuclear region to the posterior pole of the spermatid, where the mature centriole aligns at right angles to the plasma membrane. The centriole initiates the assembly of the nine peripheral microtubule doublets and two central micro- tubules that constitute the axoneme of the sperm tail. • Cap phase. In this phase, the acrosomal vesicle spreads over the anterior half of the nucleus. This reshaped struc- ture is called the acrosomal cap. The portion of the nuclear envelope beneath the acrosomal cap loses its pores and becomes thicker. The nuclear contents also condense. • Acrosome phase. In this phase, the spermatid reorients it- self so that the head becomes deeply embedded in the Sertoli cell and points toward the basal lamina. The developing flag- ellum extends into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. The condensed nucleus of the spermatid flattens and elongates, the nucleus and its overlying acrosome also move to a posi- tion immediately adjacent to the anterior plasma membrane, and the cytoplasm is displaced posteriorly. The cytoplasmic microtubules become organized into a cylindrical sheath, the manchette, which extends from the posterior rim of the acrosome toward the posterior pole of the spermatid.

The release of acrosomal enzymes as the sperm touches the egg is the first step in the acrosome reaction. This complex process facilitates sperm penetration and subsequent fertilization and prevents the entry of additional sperm into the ovum. The sperm tail is subdivided into the neck, the middle piece, the principal piece, and the end piece. The short neck contains the centrioles and the origin of the coarse fibers. The middle piece is approximately 7 \u0005m long and contains the mitochondria, helically wrapped around the coarse fibers and the axonemal complex. These mitochondria provide the energy for movement of the tail and thus are responsible for the motility of the sperm. The principal piece is approximately 40 \u0005m long and contains the fibrous sheath external to the coarse fibers and the axonemal complex. The end piece, ap- proximately the last 5 \u0005m of the flagellum in the mature sperm, contains only the axonemal complex. Newly released sperm cells are processed in the epi- didymidis where they acquire motility and undergo fur- ther maturation. Newly released sperm cells are nonmotile and are carried from the seminiferous tubules in a fluid secreted by the Sertoli cells. The fluid and sperm flow through the seminiferous tubules, facilitated by peristaltic contractions of the peritubular contrac- tile cells of the lamina propria.

St. Louis: CV Mosby, 1976.) 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:52 PM Page 797 Each recognizable grouping, or cell association, is con- sidered a stage in a cyclic process. The series of stages that appears between two successive occurrences of the same cell association pattern at any given site in the seminiferous tubule constitutes a cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. The cycle of the seminiferous epithelium has been most thoroughly studied in rats, in which 14 successive stages occur in linear sequence along the tubule. In man, six stages or cell associations are defined in the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium (Fig. 22.13). These stages are not as clearly delin- eated as those in rodents because in man the cellular associa- tions occur in irregular patches that form a mosaic pattern. Duration of spermatogenesis in humans is approximately 74 days. After injecting a pulse of tritiated thymidine, a specific gener- ation of cells can be followed by sequential biopsies of the seminiferous tubules. In this way, the time required for the la- beled cells to go through the various stages can be deter- mined. Several generations of developing cells may be present in the thickness of the seminiferous epithelium at any given site and at any given time, which produces the characteristic cell associations. Autoradiographic studies have revealed that the duration of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium is constant, lasting about 16 days in humans. In humans it would require about 4.6 cycles (each 16 days long), or approx- imately 74 days, for a spermatogonium produced by a stem cell to complete the process of spermatogenesis. It would then require approximately 12 days for the spermatozoon to pass through the epididymis. Approximately 300 million sperm cells are produced daily in the human testis. The length of the cycle and the time required for spermatogenesis are con- stant and specific in each species. Therefore, in any pharma- cologic intervention (e.g., therapy for male infertility), if a drug is given that affects the initial phases of spermatogen- esis, approximately 86 days are required to see the effect of that compound on sperm production. Waves of the Seminiferous Epithelium As indicated above, the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium describes changes that occur with time at any given site in the tubule. In addition, the wave of the seminiferous epithelium describes the distribution of patterns of cellular association (stages) along the length of the tubule. In rodents and other mammals that have been studied, including sub- human primates, each stage occupies a significant length of the seminiferous tubule, and the stages appear to occur sequentially along the length of the tubule. In the rat, there are approximately 12 waves in each tubule. A transverse section through the tubule usually reveals only one pattern of cell associations. There are no waves in the human seminiferous epithelium. Each pattern of cellular associations (stage of the cycle) has a patch-like distribution in the human seminiferous tubule (Fig. 22.14). Patches do not extend around the circum- ference of the tubule, nor are they in sequence. Therefore, a transverse section through a human seminiferous tubule may reveal as many as six different stages of the cycle arranged in a pie-wedge fashion around the circumference of the tubule. epithelium consists only of Sertoli cells. At the mediastinum testis, the fluid and sperm enter the rete testis, an anastomosing system of ducts lined by simple cuboidal epithelium (Plate 87, page 820). From the rete testis, they move into the extratesticu- lar portion of the efferent ductules (ductuli efferentes), the first part of the excurrent duct system, and then into the proxi- mal portion of the duct of the epididymis (ductus epi- didymis). As the sperm cells move through the 4 to 5 m of the highly coiled duct of the epididymis, they acquire motility and undergo several maturational changes,. These changes include • condensation of nuclear DNA. The head of the sperm decreases in size. • further reduction of cytoplasm. The sperm cells become more slender. • changes in plasma membrane lipids, proteins, and glycosy- lation. • alterations in the outer acrosomal membrane (decapacita- tion). The surface-associated decapacitation factor is added to inhibit the fertilizing ability of the sperm cells (page 803). Initiation of sperm cell motility during cell transit through the epididymis is most likely related to changes in the intra- cellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), calcium ions (Ca 2\u0007), and intracellular pH. These factors reg- ulate flagellar activity through changes in protein phospho- rylation, resulting from activities of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. For instance, pharmacologic stim- ulation of protein kinase A activity increases motility of sperm cells, whereas inhibition of protein phosphatase ac- tivity may initiate or stimulate such motility. This suggests that phosphatases have an important role in the regulation of sperm kinetic activity. Contractions of the smooth muscle that surrounds the pro- gressively distal and larger ducts continue to move the sperm by peristaltic action until they reach the distal portion of the duct of the epididymis, where they are stored before ejaculation. Sperm can live for several weeks in the male excurrent duct system, but they will survive only 2 to 3 days in the female re- productive tract. They acquire the ability to fertilize the ovum only after some time in the female tract. This process, which involves removal and replacement of glycocalyx components (glycoconjugates) on the sperm membrane, is called capaci- tation. Capacitation of spermatozoa is described in detail in Chapter 23 (page 840). \u0002 SEMINIFEROUS TUBULES Cycle of the Seminiferous Epithelium Differentiating spermatogenic cells are not arranged at ran- dom in the seminiferous epithelium; specific cell types are grouped together. These groupings or associations occur because intercellular bridges are present between the progeny of each pair of type Ap spermatogonia and because the syn- chronized cells spend specific times in each stage of maturation. All phases of differentiation occur sequentially at any given site in a seminiferous tubule as the progeny of stem cells remain connected by cytoplasmic bridges and undergo synchronous mitotic and meiotic divisions and maturation (see Fig. 22.10). 798 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:52 PM Page 798 799chapter 22Male Reproductive System\u0003SEMINIFEROUS TUBULES 799 type A pale spermatogonium Sd Sa type B pale spermatogonium type A dark spermatogonium type B pale spermatogonium STAGE I STAGE II STAGE III STAGE IV STAGE V STAGE VI type A dark spermatogonium pachytene spermatocyte pachytene spermatocyte pachytene spermatocyte pachytene spermatocyte pachytene spermatocyte leptotene spermatocyte leptotene spermatocyte diplotene spermatocyte primary spermatocytes in division secondary spermatocytes preleptotene spermatocyte type A dark spermatogonium type A pale spermatogonium type A dark spermatogonium type A pale spermatogonium type A dark spermatogonium type A pale spermatogonium type A dark spermatogonium type A pale spermatogonium Sb Sc Sertoli cell Sertoli cell zygotene spermatocyte FIGURE 22.13 • Schematic drawing of the stages of the human seminiferous epithelium.

Sertoli cells (sustentacular cells) are tall, columnar, non- replicating epithelial cells that rest on the thick, multilayered basal lamina of the seminiferous epithelium (Fig. 22.15). They are the supporting cells for the developing sperm that attach to their surface after meiosis. Sertoli cells contain an extensive sER, a well-developed rER, and stacks of annulate lamellae. They have numerous spherical and elongated mito- chondria, a well-developed Golgi apparatus, and varying numbers of microtubules, lysosomes, lipid droplets, vesicles, glycogen granules, and filaments. A sheath of 7- to 9-nm fil- aments surrounds the nucleus and separates it from other cy- toplasmic organelles. The euchromatic Sertoli cell nucleus, a reflection of this very active cell, is generally ovoid or triangular and may have one or more deep infoldings. Its shape and location vary. It may be flattened, lying in the basal portion of the cell near and parallel to the base of the cell, or it may be triangular or ovoid, lying near or some distance from the base of the cell. In some species, the Sertoli cell nucleus contains a unique tripartite structure that consists of an RNA-containing nu- cleolus flanked by a pair of DNA-containing bodies called karyosomes (Fig. 22.16). In man, characteristic inclusion bodies (of Charcot- Böttcher) are found in the basal cytoplasm. These slender fusiform crystalloids measure 10 to 25 \u0005m long by 1 \u0005m wide and are visible in routine histologic preparations. With trans- mission electron microscopy, they are resolved as bundles of poorly ordered, parallel or converging, straight, dense 15-nm- diameter filaments (see Fig. 22.15). Their chemical composi- tion and function are unknown; however, recent studies detected an accumulation of lipoprotein receptor (CLA-1) proteins. This suggests that inclusion bodies might be involved in lipids transport and their utilization by the Sertoli cells. The Sertoli cell–to–Sertoli cell junctional complex con- sists of a structurally unique combination of membrane and cytoplasmic specializations. Sertoli cells are bound to one another by an unusual Sertoli cell- to-Sertoli cell junctional complex (Fig. 22.17). This complex is characterized, in part, by an exceedingly tight junction (zonula occludens) that includes more than 50 parallel fusion lines in the adjacent membranes. In addition, two cytoplasmic components characterize this unique junctional complex: • A ﬂattened cisterna of sER lies parallel to the plasma membrane in the region of the junction in each cell. • Actin ﬁlament bundles, hexagonally packed, are inter- posed between the sER cisternae and the plasma membranes. 5-\u0005m cross section 5-\u0005m cross section III IV IV IIII V VI V IVIV IV III III a b FIGURE 22.14 • Diagram of organization of seminiferous epithelium in humans and other species. a. In subhuman species, a particular cellular association occupies varying lengths along the tubule. Therefore, in a typical cross section only a single cellular association is observed. b. In humans, cellular associations occur in irregularly shaped areas along the tubule, and therefore, a cross section typically shows two or more cellular associations. (Modified from Dym M.

This drawing shows the Sertoli–to–Sertoli junctional specialization between adjacent Sertoli cells and the Sertoli–to–spermatid junctional specialization between the Sertoli cell and late spermatids. The Sertoli–to–Sertoli junctional complex is an adhesion device that includes a tight junction that contributes to the blood–testis barrier. The junctional specialization between the Sertoli cell and late spermatids residing in deep recesses within the apical cytoplasm is an adhesion device only. Lateral processes of the Sertoli cells extend over the surface of the spermatocytes and spermatids. Note the ultrastructural features of the Sertoli cell, including the microtubule arrays and characteristic shape of the nucleus and its karyosome. (Reprinted with permission from Bloom W, Fawcett DW. A Textbook of Histology. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1975.) A similar-appearing junctional complex in the Sertoli cell is also present at the site where the spermatids are attached. However, no tight junction is present, and the spermatid lacks flattened cisternae of sER and actin filament bundles (see Figs. 22.16 and 22.17). Other junctional specializations of the Sertoli cells include gap junctions between Sertoli cells, desmosome-like junctions between Sertoli cells and early- stage spermatogenic cells, and hemidesmosomes at the Sertoli cell–basal lamina interface. The Sertoli cell–to–Sertoli cell junctional complex divides the seminiferous epithelium into basal and luminal com- partments. The Sertoli cell–to–Sertoli cell junctions establish two ep- ithelial compartments, a basal epithelial compartment and a luminal compartment. Spermatogonia and early pri- mary spermatocytes are restricted to the basal compartment (i.e., between the Sertoli cell–to–Sertoli cell junctions and the basal lamina). More mature spermatocytes and sper- matids are restricted to the luminal side of the Sertoli cell–to–Sertoli cell junctions. Early spermatocytes produced by mitotic division of type B spermatogonia must pass through the junctional complex to move from the basal compartment to the luminal compartment. This movement occurs via the formation of a new junctional complex between Sertoli cell processes that extend beneath the newly formed spermatocytes, followed by the breakdown of the junction above them. Thus, in the differentiation of the spermatogenic cells, the processes of meiosis and spermio- genesis occur in the luminal compartment. In both compartments, spermatogenic cells are surrounded by complex processes of the Sertoli cells. Because of the un- usually close relationships between Sertoli cells and differenti- ating spermatogenic cells, it has been suggested that Sertoli cells serve as “nurse,” or supporting, cells (i.e., they function in the exchange of metabolic substrates and wastes between the developing spermatogenic cells and the circulatory system). In addition, Sertoli cells phagocytose and break down the residual bodies formed in the last stage of spermiogenesis. They also phagocytose any spermatogenic cells that fail to differentiate completely. The Sertoli cell–to–Sertoli cell junctional complex is the site of the blood–testis barrier. In addition to the physical compartmentalization described above, the Sertoli cell–to–Sertoli cell junctional complex also 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:53 PM Page 801 creates a permeability barrier called the blood–testis barrier. This barrier is essential in creating a physiologic compartmen- talization within the seminiferous epithelium with respect to ionic, amino acid, carbohydrate, and protein composition. Therefore, the composition of the fluid in the seminiferous tubules and excurrent ducts differs considerably from the composition of the blood plasma and testicular lymph. Plasma proteins and circulating antibodies are excluded from the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. The exocrine secretory products of the Sertoli cells (particularly the androgen-binding protein (ABP), which has a high binding affinity for testosterone and DHT) are highly concentrated in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules and maintain a high concentration of testosterone, which provides a favor- able microenvironment for the differentiating spermato- genic cells. Most important, the blood–testis barrier isolates the genet- ically different and therefore antigenic haploid germ cells (secondary spermatocytes, spermatids, and sperm) from the immune system of the adult male. Antigens produced by, or specific to, the sperm are prevented from reaching the sys- temic circulation. Conversely, \b-globulins and specific sperm antibodies found in some individuals are prevented from reaching the developing spermatogenic cells in the seminifer- ous tubule (Folder 22.3). Therefore, the blood–testis barrier serves an essential role in isolating the spermatogenic cells from the immune system. Sertoli cells have both exocrine and endocrine secretory functions. In addition to secreting fluid that facilitates passage of the maturing sperm along the seminiferous tubules to the intrat- esticular ducts, Sertoli cells produce critical factors necessary for the successful progression of spermatogonia into sperma- tozoa. They secrete a 90-kilodalton androgen-binding pro- tein (ABP). ABP concentrates testosterone in the luminal compartment of the seminiferous tubule, where high concen- trations of testosterone are essential for normal maturation of the developing sperm. FSH and testosterone receptors are present on Sertoli cells; therefore, their secretory function is regulated by both FSH and testosterone (Fig. 22.18). Sertoli cells secrete several en- docrine substances, such as inhibin, a 32-kilodalton glycopro- tein hormone involved in the feedback loop that inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) release from the anterior pituitary gland. In addition, Sertoli cells synthesize plasmino- gen activator, which converts plasminogen to the active pro- teolytic hormone plasmin, transferrin (an iron-transporting protein), and ceruloplasmin (a copper-transporting protein). Furthermore, the Sertoli cells secrete other glycoproteins that function as growth factors or paracrine factors, such as the Müllerian-inhibiting factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). \u0002 INTRATESTICULAR DUCTS At the end of each seminiferous tubule there is an abrupt transition to the straight tubules, or tubuli recti. This short terminal section of the seminiferous tubule is lined only by Sertoli cells (Plate 87, page 820). Near their termination, the straight tubules narrow, and their lining changes to a simple cuboidal epithelium. The straight tubules empty into the rete testis, a complex series of interconnecting channels within the highly vascular connective tissue of the mediastinum (Fig. 22.19). A simple cuboidal or low columnar epithelium lines the channels of the rete testis. These cells have a single apical cilium and rela- tively few short apical microvilli. 802 NNNNN S 1 S 1 S 2 S2 S1 S 1 S 2 S2 S1 S 1 S 2 S2 S1 S 1 S 2 S2 S1 S 1 S 2 S2 AAA FIGURE 22.17 • Electron micrograph of Sertoli cell junctions.

Failure of the spermatogenic cells and spermatozoa to remain isolated results in the production of sperm-specific antibodies. Such an immune response is sometimes seen after vasectomy and in some cases of infertility. After vasectomy, sperm-specific antibodies are pro- duced as the cells of the immune system are exposed to the spermatozoa that may leak from the severed ductus deferens. Thus, sperm no longer remain isolated from the immune system within the reproductive tract. In some cases of infertility, sperm-specific antibodies have been found in the semen. These antibodies cause the sperm to agglutinate, preventing movement and interaction with the ovum. • FOLDER 22.3 Clinical Correlation: Sperm-Speciﬁc Antigens and the Immune Response \u0002 EXCURRENT DUCT SYSTEM The excurrent duct system develops from the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct and mesonephric tubules. The initial development of Leydig cells and initiation of testosterone secretion stimulate the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct to differentiate into the excretory duct system for the de- veloping testis (Fig. 22.20). The portion of the mesonephric duct adjacent to the developing testis becomes convoluted and differentiates into the duct of the epididymis. In addi- tion, a number (about 20) of the remaining mesonephric tubules in this region make contact with the developing sem- iniferous cords and finally develop into the efferent duc- tules (Fig. 22.21 and Plate 88, page 822). They connect the developing rete testis with the duct of the epididymis. The distal part of the mesonephric duct acquires a thick, smooth muscle coat and becomes the ductus deferens. The end of the distal mesonephric duct gives rise to the ejaculatory duct and seminal vesicles. The efferent ductules are lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelium. In man, approximately 20 efferent ductules connect the channels of the rete testis at the superior end of the mediastinum to the proximal portion of the duct of the epi- didymis. As the efferent ductules exit the testis, they become highly coiled and form 6 to 10 conical masses, the coni vas- culosi, whose bases form part of the head of the epididymis. The coni vasculosi, each about 10 mm in length, contain the highly convoluted ducts that measure 15 to 20 cm in length. At the base of the cones, the efferent ducts open into a single channel, the duct of the epididymis (see Fig. 22.4). The efferent ductules are lined with a pseudostratified columnar epithelium that contains clumps of tall and short cells, giving the luminal surface a sawtooth appearance (see Fig. 22.21). Interspersed among the columnar cells are occa- sional basal cells that serve as epithelial stem cells. The tall columnar cells are ciliated. The short nonciliated cells have numerous microvilli and canalicular invaginations of the api- cal surface as well as numerous pinocytotic vesicles, mem- brane-bounded dense bodies, lysosomes, and other cytoplasmic structures associated with endocytotic activity. Most of the fluid secreted in the seminiferous tubules is reab- sorbed in the efferent ductules. A smooth muscle layer in the excurrent ducts first ap- pears at the beginning of the efferent ductules. The smooth muscle cells form a layer several cells thick in which the cells are arrayed as a circular sheath in the wall of the duc- tule. Interspersed among the muscle cells are elastic fibers. Transport of the sperm in the efferent ductules is affected largely by both ciliary action and contraction of this fibro- muscular layer. Epididymis The epididymis is an organ that contains the efferent duc- tules and the duct of the epididymis. The epididymis is a crescent-shaped structure that lies along the superior and posterior surfaces of the testis. It measures about 7.5 cm in length and consists of the efferent ductules and the duct of the epididymis and associated vessels, smooth muscles, and connective tissue coverings (Fig. 22.22 and Plate 88, page 822). The duct of the epididymis is a highly coiled tube measuring 4 to 6 m in length. The epididymis is divided into a head, a body, and a tail (see Fig. 22.4). The efferent ductules occupy the head, and the duct of the epididymis occupies the body and tail. Newly produced sperm, which enter the epididymis from the testis, mature during their passage through the duct of the epi- didymis, acquiring motility and the ability to fertilize an oocyte. During this androgen-dependent maturation process, the head of the sperm is modified by the addition of surface- associated decapacitation factor containing epididymal fluid glycoconjugates. This process, called decapacitation, inhibits the fertilizing ability of the sperm in a reversible 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:53 PM Page 803 manner. The surface-associated decapacitation factor is later released during capacitation that occurs in the female repro - ductive tract just before fertilization. After maturation in the epididymis, sperm can transport their haploid content of DNA to the ovum, and after capacitation, they can bind to sperm receptors on the zona pellucida of the ovum. This binding triggers the acrosome reaction in which the sperm uses its acrosomal enzymes to penetrate the outer covering of the oocyte. The principal cells in the pseudostratified epithelium of the epididymis are characterized by stereocilia. Like most of the excurrent duct system, the duct of the epi- didymis is also lined with a pseudostratified columnar epithe- lium (Fig. 22.23). In general, it contains two types of cells: • Principal cells that vary from about 80 \u0005m in height in the head of the epididymis to about 40 \u0005m in height in the tail. Numerous long, modified microvilli called stereocilia 804 accessory reproductive organs secondary sexual characteristics metabolic effects behavioral effects inhibitory adenohypophysis testosterone stimulatory GnRH-like peptides spermatogenic cells Leydig cells Sertoli cells ? hypothalamus other CNS centers GnRH FSH LH prolactin inhibin estradiol DHT FIGURE 22.18 • Diagram depicting the hormonal regulation of male reproductive function.

The stereocilia vary in height from 25 \u0005m in the head to approximately 10 \u0005m in the tail. • Basal cells that represent small, round cells resting on the basal lamina. They are the stem cells of the duct epithelium. In addition, migrating lymphocytes called halo cells are often found within the epithelium. Under normal condi- tions, the epithelium of the epididymis represents the most proximal level of the excurrent duct system in which lympho- cytes are present. Epididymal cells function in both absorption and secretion. Most of the fluid that is not reabsorbed by the efferent duc- tules is reabsorbed in the proximal portion of the epididymis. The epithelial cells also phagocytose any residual bodies not removed by the Sertoli cells as well as sperm that degenerate in the duct. The apical cytoplasm of the principal cells con- tains numerous invaginations at the bases of the stereocilia, along with coated vesicles, multivesicular bodies, and lyso- somes (Fig. 22.24). The principal cells secrete glycerophosphocholine, sialic acid, and glycoproteins, which, in addition to the glycoca- lyx and steroids, aid in the maturation of the sperm. They have numerous cisternae of rER surrounding the basally lo- cated nucleus and a remarkably large supranuclear Golgi apparatus. Profiles of sER and rER are also present in the apical cytoplasm. The smooth muscle coat of the duct of the epididymis gradually increases in thickness to become three-layered in the tail. In the head of the epididymis and most of the body, the smooth muscle coat consists of a thin layer of circular smooth muscle resembling that of the efferent ductules. In the tail, inner and outer longitudinal layers are added. These three layers are then continuous with the three smooth muscle lay- ers of the ductus deferens, the next component of the excur- rent duct system (Plate 89, page 824). Differences in smooth muscle function parallel these mor- phologic differences. In the head and body of the epididymis, spontaneous, rhythmic peristaltic contractions serve to move the sperm along the duct. Few peristaltic contractions occur in the tail of the epididymis, which serves as the principal reservoir for mature sperm. These sperm are forced into the ductus deferens by intense contractions of the three smooth muscle layers after appropriate neural stimulation associated with ejaculation. ababababab vein rete testisrete testisrete testisrete testisrete testis rete testisrete testisrete testisrete testisrete testis vein seminiferous tubule seminiferous tubule seminiferous tubule seminiferous tubule seminiferous tubule *** FIGURE 22.19 • Photomicrograph of human testis. a.

The ductus deferens (vas deferens) is a direct continu- ation of the tail of the epididymis (see Fig. 22.1). It ascends along the posterior border of the testis, close to the testicu- lar vessels and nerves. It then enters the abdomen as a com- ponent of the spermatic cord, by passing through the inguinal canal. The spermatic cord contains all of the struc- tures that pass to and from the testis. In addition to the duc- tus deferens, the spermatic cord contains the testicular artery, small arteries to the ductus deferens and cremaster muscle, the pampiniform plexus, lymphatic vessels, sympa- thetic nerve fibers, and the genital branch of the gen- itofemoral nerve. All of these structures are surrounded by fascial coverings derived from the anterior abdominal wall. After leaving the spermatic cord, the ductus deferens de- scends in the pelvis to the level of the bladder, where its dis- tal end enlarges to form the ampulla of ductus deferens. The ampulla is joined there by the duct of the seminal vesicle and continues through the prostate gland to the urethra as the ejaculatory duct. The ductus deferens is lined with a pseudostratified colum- nar epithelium that closely resembles that of the epididymis (Plate 89, page 824). The tall columnar cells also have long microvilli that extend into the lumen. The rounded basal cells rest on the basal lamina. Unlike the epididymis, however, the lumen of the duct does not appear smooth. In histologic preparations (Fig. 22.25), it appears to be thrown into deep longitudinal folds throughout most of its length, probably because of contraction of the thick (1 to 1.5 mm) muscular coat of the duct during fixation. The ampulla of ductus deferens has taller, branched mucosal folds that often show glandular diverticula. The muscle coat surrounding the ampulla is thinner than that of the rest of the ductus deferens, and the longitudinal layers disappear near the origin of the ejaculatory duct. The epithe- lium of the ampulla and ejaculatory duct appears to have a BVBVBV FIGURE 22.22 • Photomicrograph of human epididymis.

The wall of the ejaculatory duct does not have a muscularis layer; the fibromuscular tissue of the prostate substitutes for it. \u0002 ACCESSORY SEX GLANDS The paired seminal vesicles secrete a fluid rich in fructose. The seminal vesicles are paired, elongate, and highly folded tubular glands located on the posterior wall of the uri- nary bladder, parallel to the ampulla of the ductus deferens. A short excretory duct from each seminal vesicle combines with the ampulla of the ductus deferens to form the ejacu- latory duct. Seminal vesicles develop as evaginations of the mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts in the region of future ampul- lae. The wall of the seminal vesicles contains a mucosa, a thin layer of smooth muscle, and a fibrous coat (Fig. 22.26). The mucosa is thrown into numerous primary, secondary, and tertiary folds that increase the secretory surface area (Plate 91, page 828). All of the irregular chambers thus formed, how- ever, communicate with the lumen. The pseudostratified columnar epithelium contains tall, nonciliated columnar cells and short, round cells that rest on the basal lamina. The short cells appear identical to those of the rest of the excurrent duct system. They are the stem cells from which the columnar cells are derived. The columnar cells have the morphology of protein-secreting cells, with a well-developed rER and large secretory vacuoles in the apical cytoplasm. The secretion of the seminal vesicles is a whitish yellow, viscous material. It contains fructose, which is the principal metabolic substrate for sperm, along with other simple sugars, amino acids, ascorbic acid, and prostaglandins. Although prostaglandins were first isolated from the prostate gland (hence the name), they are actually synthesized in large amounts in the seminal vesicles. Contraction of the smooth muscle coat of the seminal vesicles during ejaculation discharges their secretion into the ejaculatory ducts and helps to flush sperm out of the urethra. The secretory function and morphology of the seminal vesicles are under the control of testosterone. \u0002 PROSTATE GLAND The prostate, the largest accessory sex gland, is divided into several morphologic and functional zones. The prostate is the largest accessory sex gland of the male reproductive system. Its size and shape are commonly com- pared to those of a walnut.

The gland is located in the pelvis, inferior to the bladder, where it sur- rounds the prostatic part of the urethra. It consists of 30 to 50 tubuloalveolar glands arranged in three concentric layers: an inner mucosal layer, an intermediate submucosal layer, and a peripheral layer containing the main prostatic glands (Fig. 22.27). The glands of the mucosal layer secrete directly into the urethra; the other two layers have ducts that open into the prostatic sinuses located on either side of the urethral crest on the posterior wall of the urethra. The adult prostatic parenchyma is divided into four anatomically and clinically distinct zones: • The central zone surrounds ejaculatory ducts as they pierce the prostate gland. It contains about 25% of the glandular tissue and is resistant to both carcinoma and in- flammation. In comparison to the other zones, cells in the central zone have distinctive morphologic features (a more prominent and slightly basophilic cytoplasm and a larger nuclei displaced at different levels in adjacent cells). Recent findings suggest that this zone originates embryologically from the inclusion of mesonephric duct cells into the de- veloping prostate. • The peripheral zone comprises 70% of the glandular tissue of the prostate. It surrounds the central zone and occupies posterior and lateral parts of the gland. Most prostatic carci- nomas arise from the peripheral zone of the prostate gland. The peripheral zone is palpable during digital examination of the rectum. This zone is also the most susceptible to inﬂammation. • The transitional zone surrounds the prostatic urethra; it comprises about 5% of the prostatic glandular tissue and contains the mucosal glands. In older individuals, the parenchymal cells of this zone frequently undergo exten- sive division (hyperplasia) and form nodular masses of epithelial cells. Because this zone is proximate to the pro- static urethra, these nodules can compress the prostatic urethra, causing difﬁcult urination. This condition is known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and is discussed in Folder 22.4 (page 811). aa bb ductusductus deferensdeferens veins ofveins of pampiniformpampiniform plexusplexus SM(L)SM(L) SM(L)SM(L) SM(C)SM(C) SM(C)SM(C) SM(L)SM(L) ab testicular arterytesticular artery and veinand vein testicular artery and vein ductus deferens veins of pampiniform plexus SM(L) SM(L) SM(C) SM(C) SM(L) FIGURE 22.25 • Photomicrograph of human spermatic cord. a.

In later stages of BPH, this zone may undergo pathologic growth but mainly from the stromal compo- nents. Together with the glandular nodules of the transi- tional zone, this growth causes increased urethral compression and further retention of urine in the bladder. In addition, ﬁbromuscular stroma occupies the anterior surface of the prostate gland anterior to the urethra and is composed of dense irregular connective tissue with large amount of smooth muscle fibers. The growth of the prostatic glandular epithelium is regu- lated by the hormone dihydrotestosterone. Within each prostate zone, the glandular epithelium is gener- ally simple columnar, but there may be patches that are simple cuboidal, squamous, or occasionally pseudostratified (Fig. 22.28). The alveoli of the prostatic glands, especially those in older men, often contain prostatic concretions (corpora amylacea) of varied shape and size, often up to 2 mm in diameter (see Fig. 22.28 and Plate 90, page 826).

A widely accepted theory of the pathogenesis of BPH is related to the action of dihy- drotestosterone (DHT). DHT is synthesized in the stromal cells by conversion from circulating testosterone in the presence of 5\u0003-reductase. Once synthesized, DHT acts as an autocrine agent on the stromal cells and as a paracrine hormone on the glandular epithelial cells, causing them to proliferate (Fig. F22.4.1b). BHP is believed to occur to some extent in all men by age 80. Several options are available to treat BHP. Noninva- sive treatment includes medications (\u0003–receptor block- ers) to relax the prostate smooth muscles and relieve pressure on the compressed urethra. Clinical trials have shown that inhibitors of 5\u0003-reductase reduce the DHT concentration and thus decrease the size of the prostate and reduce urethral obstruction. Minimally invasive treatment options use laser, microwave, or radiofrequency energy to destroy the prostate tissue causing urethral obstruction. These include interstitial laser coagulation (ILC), microwave hyperthermia, and transurethral needle ablation (TUNA). Finally, a variety of surgical procedures are used to remove hypertrophied regions of the prostate gland. They include transurethral in- cision of the prostate (TUIP), a more extensive transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), and most recently, a mod- ification of the TURP procedure that uses laser energy to vaporize the prostate tissue called Greenlight PVP. Cancer of the prostate is one of the most common cancers in the male: the lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer is 16.7% (1 in 6). The incidence of prostatic cancer increases with age, and it is estimated that 70% of men be- tween the ages of 70 and 80 will develop this disease. Tumors usually develop in the peripheral zone of the gland. In the past, early detection was uncommon, because the ab- normal growth of the tumor did not impinge on the urethra to produce symptoms that demanded prompt attention. There- fore, prostatic cancer was often inoperable by the time it was discovered. However, beginning in the late 1980s, the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for aa bb a b FIGURE F22.4.1 • Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) a.

They may become partially calcified. The glandular epithelium is influenced by sex hormones, such as testosterone and adrenal androgens. These hormones enter the secretory cells of glandular epithelium and are converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5\u0002-reductase. DHT is approximately 30 times more potent than testosterone. The binding of DHT to the androgen receptor (AR) results in a conformational change of the re- ceptor and its relocation from the cytosol to the cell nucleus. Here the phosphorylated dimers of AR complex bind to a specific sequence of DNA known as a hormone-response element residing in the promoter regions of target genes. The primary function for AR is direct up- or down-regulation of specific gene transcription. DHT stimulates growth of nor- mal prostatic epithelium and proliferation and growth of BPH and androgen-dependent prostate cancer. The prostate gland secretes prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), fibrinolysin, citric acid, and prostate-specific anti- gen (PSA). The epithelial cells in prostate gland produce several enzymes, particularly prostate-specific antigen (PSA), pro- static acid phosphatase (PAP), fibrinolysin, and citric acid. • Prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA), a 33-kilodalton serine protease, is one of the most clinically important tumor mark- ers. In normal conditions, PSA is secreted into prostatic gland alveoli and ultimately incorporated into seminal fluid. The alveolar secretion from the prostate gland is pumped into the prostatic urethra during ejaculation by contraction of the fibromuscular tissue of the prostate. Because PSA is predominately released into prostatic secretion, only a very small amount of PSA (usually below 4 ng/mL) is circulating in the blood of a healthy individual. However, in prostate cancer, serum concentration of PSA increases; large amounts of PSA are produced and misdirected into the circulation by the transformed prostatic epithelium. There- fore, the elevated levels of PSA are directly related to in- creased activity of the prostatic cancer cells. A PSA level between 4 and 10 ng/mL suggests about 25% percent can- cer risk; levels above 10 ng/mL suggest a risk greater than 67%. An increased PSA serum level is used as marker for the presence and progression of the disease. Recently, it has become widely accepted that small amounts of PSA are also present in many nonprostatic tissues, including breast, ovary, salivary gland, and liver tissue, and in various tumors. It is also important to mention that high circulat- ing levels of PSA can be associated with benign (noncancer- ous) conditions such as prostatitis (infection of the prostate gland), interrupted blood ﬂow to the prostate, or BPH. • The prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) (100-kilodalton) enzyme regulates cell growth and metabolism of prostate glandular epithelium. Because elevated serum levels of PAP are found in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, this enzyme is routinely used as an alternate marker to PSA for prostatic tumors. Measurements of PAP and PSA are use- ful in assessing the prognosis of prostate cancer. • Fibrinolysin, secreted from the prostate gland, liquefies semen. Bulbourethral Glands The bulbourethral glands secrete preseminal fluid. The paired bulbourethral glands (Cowper’s glands) are pea-sized structures located in the urogenital diaphragm (see Fig. 22.1). The duct of each gland passes through the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm and joins the initial portion of the penile urethra. The glands are com- pound tubuloalveolar glands that structurally resemble mucus secretory glands (Fig. 22.29). The simple columnar epithelium, which varies considerably in height depending 812 prostate cancer has dramatically increased early diagnosis of this disease. The PSA test revolutionized the early detection, management, and follow-up of patients with prostate cancer and is considered one of the best biomed- ical markers currently available in the field of oncology. Its use with annual digital rectal examination in prostate can- cer screening programs has significantly increased early detection of the disease. The most common prostate cancer grading system known as the Gleason score is used to predict tumor be- havior and a patient survival rate. Tissue obtained from two biopsies from the largest areas of prostate cancer is evalu- ated and grades ranging from 1 to 5 are assigned. A rank- ing of 1 indicates well-differentiated cells, which form the slowest growing and the least aggressive form of cancer. The ranking 5 is given to poorly differentiated cells charac- teristic for the fastest growing cancers. These grades, when added together, represent a Gleason score or sum between 2 and 10. The higher the score, the more likely that the cancer will grow and spread rapidly. Treatment of the cancer is by surgery, radiotherapy, or both for patients with localized disease. Hormonal therapy is the treatment of choice for advanced cancer with metas- tases. Because prostatic cancer cells depend on andro- gens, the goal of therapy is to deprive the cells of testosterone by performing orchiectomy (removal of the testis) or by administration of estrogens or gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists to suppress testos- terone production. Despite treatment, patients with metastasis have a poor prognosis. 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:53 PM Page 812chapter 22Male Reproductive System\u0003PENIS 813 813 on the functional state of the gland, is under the control of testosterone. The clear, mucus-like glandular secretion contains consid- erable amounts of galactose and galactosamine, galacturonic acid, sialic acid, and methylpentose. Sexual stimulation causes release of this secretion, which constitutes the major portion of the preseminal ﬂuid and probably serves to lubri- cate the penile urethra. \u0002 SEMEN Semen contains fluids and sperm from the testis and secretory products from the epididymis, ductus deferens, prostate, seminal vesicles, and bulbourethral glands. It is alkaline and may help to neutralize the acid environment of the urethra and the vagina. Semen also contains prostaglandins that may influence sperm transit in both the male and female repro- ductive ducts and that may have a role in implantation of a fertilized ovum. The average ejaculate of semen has a volume of about 3 mL and normally contains up to 100 million sperm per milliliter. It is estimated that 20% of the sperm in any ejaculate are mor- phologically abnormal and nearly 25% are immotile. \u0002 PENIS Erection of the penis involves the filling of the vascular spaces of the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum.

A dense, fibroelastic layer, the tunica albuginea, binds the three together and forms a cap- sule around each (Fig. 22.30). The corpora cavernosa contain numerous wide, irregularly shaped vascular spaces lined with vascular endothelium. These spaces are surrounded by a thin layer of smooth muscle that forms trabeculae within the tu- nica albuginea interconnecting and criss-crossing the corpus cavernosum. Irregular smooth muscle bundles are observed frequently as “subendothelial cushions” surrounding irregular vascular spaces (Fig. 22.31).

These arteries dilate during erection (see Folder 22.5) to increase the blood flow to the penis. An arteriovenous (AV) anastomosis exists between the deep artery of the penis and the peripheral venous system (Folder 22.5). The skin of the penis is thin and loosely attached to the underlying loose connective tissue except at the glans penis, where it is very thin and tightly attached. The skin of the glans is so thin that blood within its large, muscular anasto- mosing veins that drain the corpus spongiosum may give it a bluish color. There is no adipose tissue in the subcutaneous tissue. There is, however, a thin layer of smooth muscle that is continuous with the dartos layer of the scrotum. In uncir- cumcised males, the glans is covered with a fold of skin, the prepuce, which resembles a mucous membrane on its inner aspect. Numerous sebaceous glands are present in the skin of the penis just proximal to the glans. The penis is innervated by somatic, sympathetic, and parasympathetic nerves. Many sensory nerve endings are dis- tributed throughout the tissue of the penis, and sympathetic and parasympathetic visceral motor fibers innervate the smooth muscle of the trabeculae of the tunica albuginea and the blood vessels. Both sensory and visceral motor fibers play essential roles in erectile and ejaculatory responses. 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:53 PM Page 814chapter 22Male Reproductive System\u0003PENIS 815 815 Erection of the penis is a vascular event initiated by the CNS and maintained by complex interactions between vascular and neurologic events. The CNS responds to external or internal stimuli (sensory impulses, perception, desire, etc.) that involve the sympathetic and parasympa- thetic innervation of the penis. Parasympathetic stimulation initiates erection by relaxation of the trabecular smooth muscle cells and dila- tion of the helicine arteries. This leads to expansion of the corpora cavernosa and, to a lesser degree, the corpus spongiosum. Arterial blood accumulates in these erectile tissues by compression of the venules against the nondis- tensible tunica albuginea. This process is referred to as the corporal venoocclusive mechanism. The tunica albuginea also compresses the larger veins that drain blood from the corpora cavernosa so that venous outflow is also blocked, resulting in tumescence, and rigidity of the penis. Two neuromediators, acetylcholine and nitric oxide, are involved in the relaxation of smooth muscle during the initi- ation and maintenance of penile erection. • Acetylcholine is released by the parasympathetic nerve endings and acts primarily on the endothelial cells that line the vascular spaces of the corpora cavernosa. This causes the release of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and, more importantly, nitric oxide. • Nitric oxide (NO) activates guanylate cyclase in the trabecular smooth muscle cells to produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP causes the smooth muscle cells to relax. Sympathetic stimulation terminates penile erection by causing contraction of the trabecular smooth muscle cells of the helicine arteries. These events decrease the flow of blood to the corpora cavernosa, reducing blood pressure in the erectile tissue to normal venous pressure. The lower pressure within the corpus cavernosum allows the veins leading from the corpora cavernosa to open and drain the excess blood. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is an inability to achieve and maintain sufficient penile erection to complete satisfactory intercourse. Adequate arterial blood supply is critical for • FOLDER 22.5 Clinical Correlation: Mechanism of Erection and Erectile Dysfunction continued next page aa bba b SMSMSM SMSMSM FIGURE 22.31 • Photomicrograph of corpus spongiosum. a.

Many cases of erectile dysfunction that do not involve parasympathetic nerve damage can now be treated effec- tively with sildenafil citrate (Viagra). This compound enhances the relaxing effect of NO on smooth muscle cells of the corpora cavernosa by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, which is responsible for degradation of cGMP. As noted above, cGMP causes smooth muscle relaxation, which in turn allows inflow of blood into the corpus cavernosum to initiate erection. However, when parasympathetic nerve damage has occurred (e.g., as a complication of prostatic surgery), sildenafil citrate will have no effect because the event involving parasympathetic stimulation and release of acetylcholine cannot occur. Without acetylcholine, NO cannot produce cGMP. Without cGMP, smooth muscle cells cannot relax to allow inflow of blood to fill the erectile tissue. 72006_ch22 15/07/10 3:53 PM Page 81672006_ch22 15/07/10 3:53 PM Page 817 This page intentionally left blank. PLATE 86 •TESTIS I 818 \u0003 PLATE 86 Testis I The male reproductive system consists of the paired testes, epididymides, and genital ducts, as well as accessory reproductive glands and the penis. The functions of the testis are the production of sperm and the synthesis and secretion of androgens, especially testosterone. The events of cell division that lead to the mature sperm involve both normal cell division, mitosis, and reduction division, meiosis, to yield a hap- loid chromosome number and haploid DNA content. Androgen secretion by the testis begins early in fetal development and is essential for continued normal development of the male fetus. At puberty, androgen secretion resumes and is responsible for initiation and maintenance of sperm production (spermatogenesis), secretion by accessory sex glands (e.g., prostate and seminal vesicles), and development of secondary sex characteristics. Testis, monkey, H&E \u000665. This section of the testis shows the seminiferous tubules and the tunica albuginea (TA), the capsule of the organ. Extending from the very thick capsule are connective tissue septa (S) that divide the organ into compartments. Each compartment con- tains several seminiferous tubules and represents a lobule (L). Blood vessels (BV) are present within the inner portion of the capsule, the part referred to as the tunica vasculosa, and in the connective tissue septa. The seminiferous tubules are convoluted; thus, the profiles they present in a section are variable in appearance. Not infrequently, the wall of a tubule is sectioned tangentially, thus obscuring the lumen and revealing what appears to be a solid mass of cells (X). Seminiferous tubules, testis, monkey, H&E \u0006400. Examination at higher magnification, as in this figure, reveals a population of interstitial cells that occur in small clusters and lie in the space between adjoining tubules. They consist mostly of Leydig cells (LC), the chief source of testosterone in the male. They are readily identified by virtue of their location and by their small round nucleus and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Macrophages are also found, in close association with the Leydig cells, but in lesser number. They are, however, difficult to identify in H&E sections. A layer of closely apposed squamous cells forms a sheath-like investment around the tubule epithelium of each seminiferous tubule. In man, several layers of cells invest the tubule epithelium. The cells of this peritubular in- vestment exhibit myoid features and account for the slow peristaltic activity of the tubules. Peripheral to the myoid layer is a broad lymphatic channel that occupies an extensive space between the tubules. In routine histologic sections, however, the lymphatic channels are usually collapsed and, thus, unrecognizable. The cellular elements that surround the tubule epithelium are generally referred to as a lamina propria (LP) or as a boundary tissue. As a lamina propria, it is atypical. It is not a loose connective tissue. Indeed, under normal circumstances, lymphocytes and other cell types related to the immune system are conspicuously absent. Examination of the tubule epithelium reveals two kinds of cells: a prolif- erating population of spermatogenic cells and a nonproliferating popula- tion, the sustentacular, or Sertoli, cells. The Sertoli cells are considerably fewer and can be recognized by their elongate, pale-staining nuclei (Sn) and conspicuous nucleolus. The Sertoli cell cytoplasm extends from the periph- ery of the tubule to the lumen. The spermatogenic cells consist of successive generations arranged in concentric layers. Thus, the spermatogonia (Sg ) are found at the periphery. The spermatocytes (Sc), most of which have large round nuclei with a distinctive chromatin pattern (because of their chromatin material being re- organized), come to lie above the spermatogonia. The spermatid population (Sp) consists of one or two generations and occupies the site closest to the lumen. The tubules in this figure have been identified according to their stage of development. The tubule at the upper right can be identified as stage VI. At this stage, the mature population of spermatids (identified by their dark- blue heads and eosinophilic threadlike flagella protruding into the lumen) are in the process of being released (spermiogenesis). The younger generation of spermatids is composed of round cells and exhibits round nuclei. Moving clockwise, the tubule indicated as stage VII is slightly more advanced. The mature spermatids are now gone. Progressing to stage VIII, the tubule at the bottom of the micrograph reveals that the spermatid population is undergo- ing a change in nuclear shape. Note the tapered nuclei (arrows). Further mat- uration of the spermatids is reflected in the tubule at the top of the micrograph, stage XI. Finally, the tubule marked stage II, on the left, reveals slightly greater maturation of the luminal spermatids, and with the start of the new cycle (stage I), a newly formed spermatid population is now present. By examining the spermatid population and assessing the number of genera- tions present (i.e., one or two) and the degree of maturation, it is possible with the aid of a chart to approximate the stage of a tubule.

At puberty, these cords become canalized, and the gonocytes begin the multiple divisions that give rise to the spermatogonia that, in turn, will divide and differentiate into the mature sperm. The seminiferous tubules terminate as straight tubules (tubuli recti) that are lined only by Sertoli cells. The tubuli recti lead to the rete testis, a complex series of anastomosing channels in the mediastinum testis that is the termination of the intratesticular tubule system. Prepubertal testis, newborn human, H&E \u0006180; inset \u0006360. The various germ cell types representative of spermatogenesis in the mature seminiferous tubules are not present in the testis before puberty or in the postpubertal undescended testis. In- stead, the “tubules” are represented by cords of cells in which a lumen is lacking. The seminiferous cords display the same tortuosity as in the adult; the tunica albuginea (TA) of the testis, though thinner, is of the same relative thickness. The seminiferous cords are of considerably smaller diameter than the tubules of the adult and are composed of two cell types: the gonocyte, or first-generation spermatogonium, derived from the primordial germ cell that migrates from the yolk sac to the developing gonad in the embryo; and a cell that resembles the Sertoli cell of the adult. The latter cell type predom- inates and constitutes the bulk of the cord. The cells are columnar, and their nuclei are close to the basement membrane. The gonocytes (G) are the pre- cursors of the definitive germ cells, or spermatogonia. They are round cells that have a centrally placed, spherical nucleus. The cytoplasm takes little stain and usually appears as a light ring around the nucleus. This gives the gonocyte a distinctive appearance in histologic sections (inset). Generally, the gonocytes are found at the periphery of the cord, but many are also found more centrally. The gonocytes give rise to spermatogonia that begin to proliferate in males between the ages of 10 and 13 years. The seminifer- ous epithelium then becomes populated with cells at various stages of sper- matogenesis, as seen in the adult. The seminiferous cords are surrounded by one or two layers of cells with long processes and flat nuclei. They resemble fibroblasts at the ultrastruc- tural level and give rise to the myoid peritubular cells of the adult. The interstitial cells (of Leydig) are conspicuous in the newborn, a reflection of the residual effects of maternal hormones. Leydig cells, however, regress and do not become conspicuous again until puberty. In this preparation, the Leydig cells (LC) can be seen between the cords (inset). They are ovoid or polygonal and are closely grouped, so that adjacent cells are in contact with each other. Overall, they have the same appearance as the Leydig cells of the adult. Mediastinum testis, testis, monkey, H&E \u000665. In the posterior portion of the testis, the connective tissue of the tunica albuginea extends more deeply into the organ. This inward extension of connective tissue is called the medi- astinum testis. It contains a network of anastomosing chan- nels called the rete testis. Only a small portion of the mediastinum testis (MT) is evident in the figure. The area includes, how- ever, a few seminiferous tubules (ST) in the upper portion of the micrograph and, fortuitously, the site where one of the seminiferous tubules terminates and joins the rete testis (RT). This can be recognized in the area delineated by the rectangle, which is shown at higher magnification in figure below. As noted above, the seminiferous tubules are arranged in the form of a loop, with each end joining the rete testis. The seminiferous tubules open into the rete testis by way of a straight tubule. Straight tubules are very short and are lined by Sertoli-like cells; no germ cell component is present. Straight tubule, testis, monkey, H&E \u0006400. The straight tubule or tubulus rectus (TR) in this figure appears to end on one side before it ends on the other. This simply reflects the angle of section. When the straight tubule ends, however, the epithelial lining suddenly becomes cuboidal. This represents the rete testis, which constitutes an anastomosing system of channels that lead to the efferent ductules. The epithelial lining cells of the rete are sometimes more squamous than cuboidal or, occasionally, may be low columnar in appearance. Typically, they possess a single cilium; however, this is difficult to see in routine H&E preparations. The connective tissue of the mediastinum is very dense but exhibits no other special features, nor is smooth muscle present. Adipose cells (AC) and blood vessels (BV), particularly veins of varying size, are present within the connective tissue.

These are the first elements of the excurrent duct system of the male genital system. Most of the fluid secreted in the seminiferous tubules is reabsorbed in the efferent ductules. The muscular coat characteristic of the excurrent duct system first appears at the beginning of the efferent ductules. The ductus epididymis is a highly coiled tube, 4 to 6 m long; sperm mature during their passage along its length, acquiring motility as well as the ability to fertilize an egg. This maturation is also androgen dependent and involves changes in the sperm plasma membrane and addition to the glycocalyx of glycoproteins secreted by the epididymal epithelial cells. Efferent ductules, testis-epididymis, monkey, H&E \u000260; inset \u0002360. About 12 to 20 efferent ductules leave the testis and serve as channels from the rete testis to the ductus epididymis. Each of the efferent ductules undergoes numerous spiral windings and convolutions to form a group of conical structures; together they constitute the initial part of the head of the epididymis. When examined in a tissue section, the ductules exhibit a variety of irregular profiles due to their twisting and turning. This is evident on the right side of this micrograph. The epithelium that lines the efferent ductules is distinctive in that groups of tall columnar cells alternate with groups of cuboidal cells, giving the luminal surface an unevenly contoured appearance. Thus, small cup-like depressions are created where the epithelium contains groups of cuboidal or low columnar cells. Typically, these shorter cells exhibit a brush border-like apical surface because of the microvilli that they possess (arrowhead, inset). The basal surface of the ductule, in contrast, has a smooth contour (see figure below and inset). Some of the cells, generally the tall columnar cells, possess cilia (C) (inset). Whereas the ciliated cells aid in moving the contents of the tubule toward the epididymis, the cells with the microvilli are largely re- sponsible for absorbing fluid from the lumen. In addition to the columnar and cuboidal cells, basal cells are also present; thus, the epithelium is desig- nated pseudostratified columnar. The basal cells possess little cytoplasm and presumably serve as stem cells. The efferent ductules possess a thin layer of circularly arranged smooth muscle cells (SM, inset). The muscle is close to the basal surface of the epithelial cells, being separated from it by only a small amount of connec- tive tissue (CT, inset). Because of this close association, the smooth muscle may be overlooked or misidentified as connective tissue. Smooth muscle facilitates movement of luminal contents of the ductule to the ductus epididymis. Epididymis, monkey, H&E \u0006180. The epididymis, by virtue of its shape, is divided into a head, body, and tail. The initial part of the head contains the ductus epididymis, a single convoluted duct into which the efferent ductules open. The duct is, at first, highly convoluted but be- comes less tortuous in the body and tail. A section through the head of the epididymis, as shown in figure above, cuts the ductus epi- didymis in numerous places, and as in the efferent ductules, different- shaped profiles are observed. The epithelium contains two distinguishable cell types: tall columnar cells and basal cells similar to those of the efferent ductules. The epithelium is, thus, also pseudostratified columnar. The columnar cells are tallest in the head of the epididymis and diminish in height as the tail is reached. The free surface of the cell possesses stereocilia (SC). These are extremely long, branching microvilli. They evidently adhere to each other during the prepa- ration of the tissue to form the fine tapering structures that are characteris- tically seen with the light microscope. The nuclei of the columnar cells are elongated and are located a moderate distance from the base of the cell. They are readily distinguished from the spherical nuclei of the basal cells that lie close to the basement membrane. Other conspicuous features of the columnar cells include a very large supranuclear Golgi apparatus (not seen at the magnification offered here), pigment accumulations (P), and numer- ous lysosomes, demonstrable with appropriate techniques. Because of the unusual height of the columnar cells and, again, the tor- tuosity of the duct, an uneven lumen appears in some sites; indeed, even “islands” of epithelium can be encountered in the lumen (see arrows, figure above). Such profiles are accounted for by sharp turns in the duct where the epithelial wall on one side of the duct is partially cut. For example, a cut in the plane of the double-headed arrow indicated in this figure would create such an isolated epithelial island. A thin layer of smooth muscle circumscribes the duct and appears simi- lar to that associated with the efferent ductules. In the terminal portion of the epididymis, however, the smooth muscle acquires a greater thickness, and longitudinal fibers are also present. Beyond the smooth muscle coat there is a small amount of connective tissue (CT) that binds the loops of the duct together and carries the blood vessels (BV) and nerves.

At the deep inguinal ring, it continues into the pelvis and, behind the urinary bladder, joins with the excretory duct from the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory duct then pierces the prostate gland and opens into the urethra. Mature sperm are stored in the terminal portion (tail) of the ductus epididymis. These sperm are forced into the ductus deferens by intense contractions of the three smooth muscle layers of the ductus deferens following appropriate neural stimulation. Contraction of the smooth muscle of the ductus deferens continues the movement of the sperm through the ejaculatory duct into the urethra during the ejaculatory reflex. The seminal vesicles (see Plate 91) are not storage sites for sperm but, rather, secrete a fructose-rich fluid that becomes part of the ejaculated semen. Fructose is the principal metabolic substrate for sperm. Spermatic cord, human, H&E \u000680. A cross section through the ductus deferens and some of the vessels and nerves that accompany the duct in the spermatic cord are shown in this figure. The wall of the ductus deferens is extremely thick, mostly because of the presence of a large amount of smooth muscle. The muscle contracts when the tis- sue is removed, causing the mucosa to form longitudinal folds. For this reason, in histologic sections, the lumen (L) usually appears irregular in cross section. The smooth muscle of the ductus deferens is arranged as a thick outer longitudinal layer (SM(L)), a thick middle circular layer (SM(C)), and a thinner inner longitudinal layer (SM(L)). Between the epithelium and the inner longitudinal smooth muscle layer there is a moderately thick cellular layer of loose connective tissue, the lamina propria (LP). The connective tissue immediately surrounding the ductus deferens contains nerves and some of the smaller blood vessels that supply the duct. In fact, some of these vessels can be seen penetrating the outer longitudinal smooth muscle layer (asterisks). Ductus deferens, human, H&E \u0006320; inset \u0006250. The epithelial lining of the ductus deferens consists of pseu- dostratified columnar epithelium with stereocilia (arrowheads). It resembles the epithelium of the epididymis, but the cells are not as tall. The elongated nuclei of the columnar cells are read- ily distinguished from the spherical nuclei of the basal cells (arrows). The ep- ithelium rests on a loose connective tissue that extends to the smooth muscle; no submucosa is described. A unique feature of the spermatic cord is the presence of a plexus of atypical veins (pampiniform plexus) that arise from the spermatic veins. These vessels receive the blood from the testis. (The pampiniform plexus also receives tributaries from the epididymis.) The plexus is an anastomos- ing vascular network that constitutes the bulk of the spermatic cord. Portions of several of these veins (BV) are evident in the upper right of fig- ure above along with a number of nerves (N). The unusual feature of the veins is their thick muscular wall that, at a glance, gives the appearance of an artery rather than a vein. Careful examination of these vessels (inset) shows that the bulk of the vessel wall is composed of two layers of smooth mus- cle—an outer circular layer SM(C) and an inner longitudinal layer SM(L).

It consists of 30 to 50 tubuloalveolar glands that surround the proximal urethra. Because of this relationship, a common condition in later life, benign prostatic hyperplasia, can result in partial or total obstruction of the urethra. The prostatic glands are arranged in three concentric layers: a mucosal layer, a submucosal layer, and a peripheral layer containing the main prostatic glands. The mucosal glands secrete directly into the urethra; the other two sets of glands deliver their secretions through ducts that open into the prostatic sinuses on the posterior wall of the urethra. All of the glands are made up of a pseudostratified columnar epithe- lium that secretes several components of the semen, including acid phosphatase, citric acid (a nutrient for sperm), and fibrinolysin (which keeps the semen liquified). Aggregations of dead epithelial cells and precipitated secretory products form prostatic concretions in the alveoli of the glands; these are a characteristic feature that aids in recognition of the prostate. The stroma is characterized by numerous small bundles of smooth muscle, so that it can also be described as a ﬁbromuscular stroma. Contraction of this muscle occurs at ejaculation, forcing the secretion into the urethra. Surrounding the gland is a fibroelastic capsule that also contains small bundles of smooth muscle. Prostate gland, human H&E \u000647. A portion of the prostate gland in shown in this low- magnification micrograph. A small section of the capsule (Cap) of the gland is seen in the upper left corner. The rest of the field is filled with the glandular and stromal components of the prostate. The secretory tubuloalveoli of the prostate gland vary greatly in form, as is evident in the figure. They may appear as tubes, as isolated alveoli, as alveoli with branches, or as tubes with branches. Tangential sections through alveoli may even produce the ap- pearance of “epithelial islands” (arrowheads) in the lumen of the alveoli. This is due to the extremely uneven contour of the epithelial surface. It should also be noted that many of the alveoli may appear rudimentary in structure (arrows). These are simply in an inactive state and are increasingly observed in older individuals. As noted above, aggregations of dead epithe- lial cells and precipitated secretions form prostatic concretions (C) in the lumina of the alveoli; these gradually increase in number and size with age. The concretions stain with eosin and may have a concentric lamellar ap- pearance, as is clearly shown in the concretion in the lower right. With time, they may become impregnated with calcium salts and thus be easily recognized in X-rays of the lower abdomen. Glands and ﬁbromuscular stroma, prostate, human, H&E \u0006178; upper inset \u0006350; lower inset \u0006650. In this higher magnification view of a portion of the prostate gland, the ﬁbromuscular stroma is clearly seen both imme- diately subtending the secretory epithelium of the tubuloalve- oli as well as in deeper, nonsecretory areas. In the upper inset, corresponding to the larger rectangle, the intensity of the staining of the smooth muscle (SM) clearly distinguishes it from the fibrous stromal con- nective tissue with which it is intimately intermingled. There are no clearly outlined bundles or layers of smooth muscle in the prostate; rather, it is randomly arrayed throughout the stroma. Prostatic concretions (C) are again evident in the lumina of alveoli, in one instance compressing the epithe- lium to a degree that makes it nearly unrecognizable. The lower inset, cor- responding to the smaller rectangle, clearly demonstrates the pseudostratified columnar nature of the prostatic epithelium (Ep). Well-delineated basal cells (arrowheads) are seen along with the taller columnar secretory cells. A small blood vessel immediately subtending the epithelium is recognizable by the red blood cells in its lumen. A lymphocytic infiltration appears to fill the stroma along the lower border of this image suggesting an inflammatory process occurring in the prostate gland.

Although sections through this structure may show many lumina, they are all profiles of a single continuous tubular lumen. The seminal vesicles are lined with a pseudostratified columnar epithelium that closely resembles that of the prostate gland. The secretion of the seminal vesicles is a whitish yellow viscous material that contains fructose, other simple sugars, amino acids, ascorbic acid, and prostaglandins. Although prostaglandins were first isolated from the prostate gland (hence the name), they are actually synthesized in large amounts in the seminal vesicles. Fructose is the primary nutrient source for the sperm in the semen. The mucosa rests on a thick layer of smooth muscle that is directly continuous with that of the ductus deferens, from which the seminal vesicle evaginates. The smooth muscle consists of an indistinct inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal layer (compare with the three layers of the ductus epididymis and the ductus deferens, Plate 88), which are difficult to distinguish. Contraction of the smooth muscle coat during ejaculation forces the secretions of the seminal vesicles into the ejaculatory ducts. Beyond the smooth muscle is the connective tissue of the adventitia. Seminal vesicle, human, H&E \u000630. This figure shows a cross section of a seminal vesicle. Because of the coiled nature of the vesicle, two almost distinct lumina, lying side by side, appear to be present. They are, however, connected so that, in effect, all of the internal spaces are con- tinuous and what is seen here is actually a two-dimensional configuration reflecting coiling of the tube. The mucosa of the seminal vesicles is characterized by being extensively folded or ridged. The ridges vary in size and typically branch and intercon- nect with one another. The larger ridges may form recesses that contain smaller ridges, and when cut obliquely, these appear as mucosal arches that enclose the smaller folds (arrows). When the plane of section is normal to the surface, the mucosal ridges appear as “villi.” In some areas, particularly the peripheral region of the lumen, the interconnecting folds of the mucosa appear as alveoli. Each of these chambers is, however, simply a pocket-like structure that is open and continuous with the lumen. The mucosa is sub- tended by a very cellular loose connective tissue (CT) that, in turn, is sur- rounded by smooth muscle (SM). The seminal vesicles are paired elongated sacs. Each vesicle consists of a single tube folded and coiled on itself with occasional diverticula in its wall. The upper extremity ends as a cul-de-sac; the lower extremity is constricted into a narrow straight excretory duct that joins and empties into its corre- sponding ductus deferens. Mucosal folds, seminal vesicle, human, H&E \u0006220. This higher magnification of the mucosal folds reveals the epithelium (Ep) and the underlying loose connective tissue or lamina propria (LP). The epithelium is described as pseu- dostratified. It is composed of low columnar or cuboidal cells and small, round basal cells. The latter are randomly inter- spersed between the larger principal cells, but they are relatively sparse. For this reason, the epithelium may not be readily recognized as pseudos- tratified. In some areas, the epithelium appears thick (arrowhead) and, based on the disposition of the nuclei, would seem to be multilayered. This is due to a tangential section of the epithelium and is not a true strat- ification. The lamina propria of the mucosa is composed of a very cellular connective tissue containing some smooth muscle cells and is rich in elastic fibers.

The internal female reproductive organs are located in the pelvis, and the external genital structures (external genitalia) are situated in the anterior part of the perineum known as the vulva. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:56 PM Page 830 related to the hormonal activity of the female reproductive system. Similarly, the placenta is included because of its functional and physical relationship to the uterus in pregnancy. Female reproductive organs undergo regular cyclic changes from puberty to menopause. The ovaries, uterine tubes, and uterus of the sexually ma- ture female undergo marked structural and functional changes related to neural activity and changes in hormone levels during each menstrual cycle and during pregnancy. These mechanisms also regulate the early development of the female reproductive system. The initiation of the menstrual cycle, referred to as the menarche, occurs in females between 9 and 14 years of age (the mean age of menarche is 12.7 years) and marks the end of puberty and the beginning of the repro- ductive life span. During this phase of life, the menstrual cycle averages about 28 to 30 days in length. Between 45 and 55 years of age (the mean age is 51.4 years), the menstrual cycle becomes infrequent and eventually ceases. This change in reproductive function is referred to as the menopause or climacterium (commonly called the “change of life”). The ovaries cease their reproductive function of producing oocytes and their endocrine function of producing hormones that regulate reproductive activity. Other organs (e.g., vagina and mammary glands) show varying degrees of reduced func- tion, particularly secretory activity. \u0002 OVARY Production of gametes and steroid hormones are the two major functions of the ovary. The ovaries have two interrelated functions: gametogenesis (the production of gametes) and steroidogenesis (the pro- duction of steroids). In women, the production of gametes is called oogenesis. Developing gametes are called oocytes; mature gametes are called ova. Two major groups of steroid hormones—estrogens and progestogens—are secreted by the ovaries. • Estrogens promote the growth and maturation of inter- nal and external sex organs and are responsible for the fe- male sex characteristics that develop at puberty. Estrogens also act on mammary glands to promote breast develop- ment by stimulating ductal and stromal growth and accu- mulation of adipose tissue. • Progestogens prepare the internal sex organs, mainly the uterus, for pregnancy by promoting secretory changes in the endometrium (discussed in the section on cyclic changes in the endometrium). Progestogens also prepare the mammary gland for lactation by promoting lobular proliferation.chapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003OVARY 831 831 uterine cavity fundus of uterus uterine portion of uterine tube isthmus of uterine tube ampulla of uterine tube mesosalpinx suspensory ligament of ovary fimb infundibulum riae ovarian artery uterine artery mesovarium ovary ligament of ovary mesometrium perimetrium endometrium myometrium mucosal folds body of uterus internal os external os vagina cervical canal cervix FIGURE 23.1 • Schematic drawing of female internal sex organs. This drawing shows the posterior view of the female internal sex organs. Part of the wall of the uterus, uterine tube, and vagina has been removed to reveal their internal structure. Note the three distinct layers of the uterine wall: the inner layer, the endometrium lining the uterine cavity; the middle and thickest layer, the myometrium; and the outer layer, the perimetrium, which is the peritoneal covering of the uterus. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:56 PM Page 831 Both hormones play an important role in the menstrual cycle by preparing the uterus for implantation of a fertilized ovum. If implantation does not occur, the endometrium of the uterus degenerates and menstruation follows. Ovarian Structure In nulliparas (women who have not borne children), the ovaries are paired, almond-shaped, pinkish white structures measuring about 3 cm in length, 1.5 cm in width, and 1 cm in thickness. Each ovary is attached to the posterior surface of the broad ligament by a peritoneal fold, the mesovarium (see Fig. 23.1). The superior (or tubal) pole of the ovary is at- tached to the pelvic wall by the suspensory ligament of the ovary, which carries the ovarian vessels and nerves. The infe- rior (or uterine) pole is attached to the uterus by the ovarian ligament. This ligament is a remnant of the gubernaculum, the embryonic fibrous cord that attaches the developing gonad to the floor of the pelvis. Before puberty, the surface of the ovary is smooth, but during reproductive life it becomes pro- gressively scarred and irregular because of repeated ovulations. In postmenopausal women, the ovaries are about one-fourth the size observed during the reproductive period. The ovary is composed of a cortex and a medulla. A section through the ovary reveals two distinct regions: • The medulla or medullary region is located in the central portion of the ovary and contains loose connective tissue, a mass of relatively large contorted blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves (Fig. 23.2). • The cortex or cortical region is found in the peripheral portion of the ovary surrounding the medulla. The cortex contains the ovarian follicles embedded in a richly cellular connective tissue (Plate 92, page 872). Scattered smooth muscle fibers are present in the stroma around the follicles. The boundary between the medulla and cortex is indistinct. “Germinal epithelium” instead of mesothelium covers the ovary. The surface of the ovary is covered by a single layer of cuboidal and, in some parts, almost squamous cells. This cel- lular layer, known as the germinal epithelium, is continuous with the mesothelium that covers the mesovarium. The term germinal epithelium is a carryover from the past when it was in- correctly thought to be the site of germ cell formation during embryonic development. It is now known that the primordial germ cells (both male and female) are of extragonadal origin and that they migrate from the embryonic yolk sac into the cortex of the embryonic gonad, where they differentiate and induce differentiation of the ovary. A dense connective tissue layer, the tunica albuginea, lies between the germinal epithe- lium and the underlying cortex (Plate 92, page 872). Tumors that arise from the epithelial surface of the ovary account for more than 70% of ovarian cancers.

This drawing shows stages of follicular development from the early primary follicle to the mature (Graafian) follicle. The maturation of the follicles occurs in the direction of the arrow. Changes in the follicle after ovulation lead to development of the corpus luteum and eventually the corpus albicans. Note the highly coiled blood vessels in the hilum and medulla of the ovary. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 832 epithelial tumors may be related to repeated disruption and repair of the germinal epithelium that occurs during ovulations. Ovarian follicles provide the microenvironment for the developing oocyte. Ovarian follicles of various sizes, each containing a single oocyte, are distributed in the stroma of the cortex. The size of a follicle indicates the developmental state of the oocyte. Early stages of oogenesis occur during fetal life when mitotic divi- sions massively increase the number of oogonia (see the section on oogenesis). The oocytes present at birth remain arrested in development at the first meiotic division (see page 92). During puberty, small groups of follicles undergo cyclic growth and maturation. The first ovulation generally does not take place for a year or more after menarche. A cyclic pattern of follicular maturation and ovulation is then established that continues in parallel with the menstrual cycle. Normally, only one oocyte reaches full maturity and is released from the ovary during each menstrual cycle. Obviously, the maturation and release of more than one egg at ovulation may lead to multiple zygotes. During the reproductive life span, a woman produces only about 400 mature ova. Most of the estimated 600,000 to 800,000 pri- mary oocytes present at birth do not complete maturation and are gradually lost through atresia, the spontaneous death and subsequent resorption of immature oocytes. This process be- gins as early as the fifth month of fetal life and is mediated by apoptosis of cells surrounding the oocyte. Atresia reduces the number of primary oocytes in a logarithmic fashion through- out life from as many as 5 million in the fetus to less than 20% of that number at birth. The oocytes that remain at menopause degenerate within a few years. Follicle Development Histologically, three basic types of ovarian follicles can be identified on the basis of developmental state: • primordial follicles; • growing follicles which are further subcategorized as pri- mary and secondary (or antral) follicles; and • mature follicle or Graaﬁan follicles. Some histologists and clinicians identify additional stages in the continuum of follicular development. In the cycling ovary, follicles are found at all stages of development, but pri- mordial follicles predominate. The primordial follicle is the earliest stage of follicular de- velopment. Primordial follicles first appear in the ovaries during the third month of fetal development. Early growth of the primor- dial follicles is independent of gonadotropin stimulation. In the mature ovary, primordial follicles are found in the stroma of the cortex just beneath the tunica albuginea. A single layer of squamous follicle cells surrounds the oocyte (Fig. 23.3 and Plate 92, page 872). The outer surface of the follicle cells is bounded by a basal lamina. At this stage, the oocyte and thechapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003OVARY 833 833 bbbbb XXXXX XXXXX NNN NN NN FCFCFCFCFC PRIMORDIAL FOLLICLE stromal cells basal lamina follicle cells oocyte Balbiani body annulate lamellae a rER mitochondrion FIGURE 23.3 • Primordial follicle. a. Schematic drawing of a primordial follicle shows the oocyte arrested in prophase of the first meiotic division. The oocyte is closely surrounded by a single layer of squamous follicle cells. The outer surface of these cells is separated from the connective tissue by a basal lamina. The ooplasm contains characteristic organelles, as seen with the electron microscope, including a Balbiani body, annulate lamellae, and small spherical mitochondria. b. This photomicrograph of primordial follicles shows the oocytes surrounded by a single layer of flattened follicle cells (FC). Usually, the nucleus (N) of the oocyte is in an eccentric position. Two oocytes in which the nucleus is not included in the plane of section are indicated (X ). Similarly, there are two follicles (arrows) in which the follicle cells are revealed in face or tangential view and the enclosed oocytes are not included in the section. \u0002640. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 833 surrounding follicle cells are closely apposed to one another. The oocyte in the follicle measures about 30 \u0003m in diameter and has a large, eccentric nucleus that contains finely dispersed chromatin and one or more large nucleoli. The cytoplasm of the oocyte, referred to as ooplasm, contains a Balbiani body (Fig. 23.3a). At the ultrastructural level, the Balbiani body is revealed as a localized accumulation of Golgi membranes and vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum, numerous mitochondria, and lysosomes. In addition, human oocytes contain annulate lamellae, and numerous small vesicles are scattered through- out the cytoplasm along with small, spherical mitochondria. Annulate lamellae resemble a stack of nuclear envelope pro- files. Each layer of the stack includes pore structures that are morphologically identical to nuclear pores. The primary follicle is the first stage in the development of the growing follicle. As a primordial follicle develops into a growing follicle, changes occur in the oocyte, in the follicle cells, and in the ad- jacent stroma. Initially, the oocyte enlarges, and the surround- ing flattened follicle cells proliferate and become cuboidal. At this stage—that is, when the follicle cells become cuboidal— the follicle is identified as a primary follicle. As the oocyte grows, it secretes specific proteins that are assembled into an extracellular coat called the zona pellucida. It appears be- tween the oocyte and the adjacent follicle cells (Fig. 23.4). The zonal pellucida in humans is composed of three classes of sulfated acidic zona pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins termed ZP-1 (80 to 120 kilodaltons), ZP-2 (73 kilodaltons), and ZP-3 (59 to 65 kilodaltons). Of the three, the most important is the ZP-3, which functions as the spermatozoa-binding receptor and inducer of the acrosome reaction (see page 841); ZP-2 is believed to act as a secondary spermatozoa-binding protein, and ZP-1 has not yet been functionally characterized. In the light microscope, zona pellucida is clearly visible as a homoge- neous and refractile layer that stains deeply with acidophilic stains and with the periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reagents (Plate 92, page 872). It is first apparent when the oocyte, surrounded by a single layer of cuboidal or columnar follicle cells, has grown to a diameter of 50 \u0003m to 80 \u0003m. Follicle cells undergo stratification to form the granulosa layer of the primary follicle. Through rapid mitotic proliferation, the single layer of follicle cells gives rise to a stratified epithelium, the membrana granulosa (stratum granulosum), surrounding the oocyte. The follicle cells are now identified as granulosa cells. The basal lamina retains its position between the outermost layer of the follicle cells, which become columnar, and the connec- tive tissue stroma. During follicular growth, extensive gap junctions develop between granulosa cells. Unlike Sertoli cells in the testis, how- ever, the basal layer of the granulosa cells does not possess elaborate tight junctions (zonulae occludentes), indicating the absence of a blood–follicle barrier. Movement of nutri- ents and small informational macromolecules from the blood into the follicular fluid is essential for normal development of the ovum and follicle. Connective tissue cells form the theca layers of the pri- mary follicle. As the granulosa cells proliferate, stromal cells immediately surrounding the follicle form a sheath of connective tissue cells, known as the theca folliculi, just external to the basal 834 PRIMARY FOLLICLE stromal cells forming zona pellucida oocyte a follicle cells bbbbb FCFCFCFCFC FIGURE 23.4 • Early primary follicle. a.

The theca folliculi further differentiates into two layers: • The theca interna is the inner, highly vascularized layer of cuboidal secretory cells (Plate 93, page 874). The fully differentiated cells of the theca interna possess ultrastruc- tural features characteristic of steroid-producing cells. Cells of the theca interna possess a large number of luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors. In response to LH stimulation, they synthesize and secrete the androgens that are the precursors of estrogen. In addition to secre- tory cells, the theca interna contains fibroblasts, collagen bundles, and a rich network of small vessels typical of endocrine organs. • The theca externa is the outer layer of connective tissue cells. It contains mainly smooth muscle cells and bundles of collagen fibers. Boundaries between the thecal layers and between the theca externa and surrounding stroma are not distinct. How- ever, the basal lamina between the granulosa layer and the theca interna establishes a distinct boundary between these layers. It separates the rich capillary bed of the theca interna from the granulosa layer, which is avascular during the period of follicular growth. Maturation of the oocyte occurs in the primary follicle. The distribution of organelles changes as the oocyte matures. Multiple, dispersed Golgi elements derived from the single Balbiani body of the primordial oocyte become scattered in the cytoplasm. The number of free ribosomes, mito - chondria, small vesicles, and multivesicular bodies and the amount of rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (rER) in- crease. Occasional lipid droplets and masses of lipochrome pigment may also be seen. The oocytes of many species, in- cluding mammals, exhibit specialized secretory vesicles known as cortical granules (see Fig. 23.5a). They are lo- cated just beneath the oolemma (oocyte’s plasma mem- brane). The granules contain proteases that are released by exocytosis when the ovum is activated by the sperm (dis- cussed in the section on fertilization). Numerous irregular microvilli project from the oocyte into the perivitelline space between the oocyte and the sur- rounding granulosa cells as the zona pellucida is deposited (see Fig. 23.5). At the same time, slender processes from the granulosa cells develop and project toward the oocyte, inter- mingling with oocyte microvilli and, occasionally, invaginat- ing into the oocyte plasma membrane. The processes may contact the plasma membrane but do not establish cytoplas- mic continuity between the cells.chapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003OVARY 835 835 LATE PRIMARY FOLLICLE granulosa cells stratum granulosum cortical granules oocyte cytoplasm granulosa cells microvilli of oocyte gap junction basal lamina zona pellucida process of granulosa cell theca folliculi a bbbbb GCGCGCGCGC ZPZPZPZPZP FIGURE 23.5 • Late primary follicle. a. Schematic drawing of a late primary follicle shows a multilayered mass of granulosa cells (differentiated from follicle cells) surrounding the oocyte. Note that the innermost layer of granulosa cells is adjacent to the zona pellucida, and the outermost layer of these cells rests on the basal lamina, which is adjacent to the stromal cells now called the theca folliculi. The Balbiani body at this stage reorganizes into multiple Golgi units, and cortical granules appear in the cytoplasm. The wedge-shaped enlargement depicts the ultrastructure of an oocyte and adjacent follicle cells.

The primary follicle initially moves deeper into the cortical stroma as it increases in size, mostly through proliferation of the granulosa cells. Several factors are required for oocyte and follicular growth: • Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) • Growth factors (e.g., epidermal growth factor [EGF], insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)) • Calcium ions (Ca2\u0002) When the stratum granulosum reaches a thickness of 6 to 12 cell layers, ﬂuid-ﬁlled cavities appear among the granulosa cells (Fig. 23.6). As the hyaluronan-rich fluid called liquor fol- liculi continues to accumulate among the granulosa cells, the cavities begin to coalesce, eventually forming a single, crescent- shaped cavity called the antrum. The follicle is now identified as a secondary follicle or antral follicle (Plate 93, page 874). The eccentrically positioned oocyte, which has attained a di- ameter of about 125 \u0003m, undergoes no further growth. The inhibition of growth is achieved by the presence of a small, 1- to 2-kilodalton peptide called oocyte maturation inhibitor (OMI), which is secreted by the granulosa cells into the antral fluid. A direct correlation is observed between the size of the secondary follicle and OMI concentration. The concentration is highest in small follicles and lowest in mature follicles. The follicle, which was 0.2 mm in diameter as an early secondary follicle when the fluid first appeared, continues to grow and reaches 10 mm or more in diameter. Cells of the cumulus oophorus form a corona radiata around the secretory follicle oocyte. As the secondary follicle increases in size, the antrum, lined by several layers of granulosa cells, also enlarges (Fig. 23.7). The stratum granulosum has a relatively uniform thickness ex- cept for the region associated with the oocyte. Here the gran- ulosa cells form a thickened mound, the cumulus oophorus, which projects into the antrum. The cells of the cumulus oophorus that immediately surround the oocyte and remain with it at ovulation are referred to as the corona radiata. The corona radiata is composed of cumulus cells that send pene- trating microvilli throughout the zona pellucida to communi- cate via gap junctions with microvilli of the oocyte.

The wedge-shaped enlargement of the shadowed area depicts the relationship of the granulosa cells, basal lamina, and the theca interna and theca externa. The theca interna cells differentiate into highly vascularized, steroid-producing cells. The theca interna is surrounded by an outer layer of stromal cells called the theca externa. The basal lamina separates the granulosa cells from the theca interna. b. Photomicrograph of a secondary follicle. The antrum (A), filled with follicular fluid, is visible within the stratum granulosum (GC). Multiple layers of theca interna cells (TI) and theca externa cells (TE) can be seen outside the basal lamina of the secondary follicle. \u000285. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 836 granulosa cells increases and is correlated with an increased number of LH receptors on the free antral surface. Extracellu- lar, densely staining, PAS-positive material called Call-Exner bodies (see Fig. 23.6a) may be seen between the granulosa cells. These bodies are secreted by granulosa cells and contain hyaluronan and proteoglycans. The mature or Graafian follicle contains the mature secondary oocyte. The mature follicle, also known as a Graaﬁan follicle, has a diameter of 10 mm or more. Because of its large size, it ex- tends through the full thickness of the ovarian cortex and causes a bulge on the surface of the ovary. As the follicle nears its maximum size, the mitotic activity of the granulosa cells decreases. The stratum granulosum appears to become thin- ner as the antrum increases in size. As the spaces between the granulosa cells continue to enlarge, the oocyte and cumulus cells are gradually loosened from the rest of the granulosa cells in preparation for ovulation. The cumulus cells immediately surrounding the oocyte now form a single layer of cells of the corona radiata. These cells and loosely attached cumulus cells remain with the oocyte at ovulation. During this period of follicle maturation, the thecal layers become more prominent. Lipid droplets appear in the cyto- plasm of the theca interna cells, and the cells demonstrate ul- trastructural features associated with steroid-producing cells. In humans, LH stimulates the cells of the theca interna to secrete androgens, which serve as estrogen precursors. Some androgens are transported to the smooth-surfaced endoplas- mic reticulum (sER) in the granulosa cells. In response to FSH, the granulosa cells catalyze the conversion of andro- gens to estrogens, which in turn stimulate the granulosa cells to proliferate and thereby increase the size of the follicle. In- creased estrogen levels from both follicular and systemic sources are correlated with increased sensitization of go- nadotropes to gonadotropin-releasing hormone. A surge in the release of FSH or LH is induced in the adenohypophysis approximately 24 hours before ovulation. In response to the LH surge, LH receptors on granulosa cells are downregu- lated (desensitized), and granulosa cells no longer produce estrogens in response to LH. Triggered by this surge, the first meiotic division of the primary oocyte resumes. This event occurs between 12 and 24 hours after the LH surge, result- ing in the formation of the secondary oocyte and the first polar body. The granulosa and thecal cells then undergo luteinization and produce progesterone (see page 839, section on the corpus luteum). Ovulation Ovulation is a hormone-mediated process resulting in the release of the secondary oocyte. Ovulation is the process by which a secondary oocyte is released from the Graafian follicle.

Dur- ing ovulation, the oocyte traverses the entire follicular wall, including the germinal epithelium. A combination of hormonal changes and enzymatic effects is responsible for the actual release of the secondary oocyte in the middle of the menstrual cycle (i.e., on the 14th day of a 28-day cycle). These factors include: • Increase in the volume and pressure of the follicular fluid • Enzymatic proteolysis of the follicular wall by activated plasminogen • Hormonally directed deposition of glycosaminoglycans between the oocyte–cumulus complex and the stratum granulosum • Contraction of the smooth muscle fibers in the theca externa layer, triggered by prostaglandins Just before ovulation, blood flow stops in a small area of the ovarian surface overlying the bulging follicle. This area of the germinal epithelium, known as the macula pellucida or fol- licular stigma, becomes elevated and then ruptures (Fig. 23.8a). The oocyte, surrounded by the corona radiata and cells of the cumulus oophorus, is released from the ruptured follicle. At the time of ovulation, the fimbriae of the uterine tube become closely apposed to the surface of the ovary, and the cumulus mass containing oocyte is then gently swept by the fimbriae into the abdominal ostium of the uterine tube. The cumulus mass firmly adheres to the fimbriae and is actively transported by the ciliated cells lining the uterine tube, preventing its passage into the peritoneal cavity. Re- cently, nonsurgical ultrasound technology is being used to monitor ovarian follicle development. Transvaginal ultra- sound examination can provide detailed information about the number and size of developing follicles (Fig 23.8b). After ovulation, the secondary oocyte remains viable for ap- proximately 24 hours. If fertilization does not occur during this period, the secondary oocyte degenerates as it passes through the uterine tube. Oocytes that fail to enter the uterine tube usually degen- erate in the peritoneal cavity. Occasionally, however, one may be fertilized and implant in the peritoneal cavity on the surface of the ovary or intestine or inside the rectouter- ine (Douglas) pouch. Such ectopic implantations usually do not develop beyond early fetal stages but may have to be removed surgically. Ectopic pregnancy that develops at any site other than the endometrium of the uterine cavity continues to be the most common cause of death in the ﬁrst half of pregnancy. Normally, only one follicle completes maturation in each cycle and ruptures to release its secondary oocyte. Rarely, oocytes are released from other follicles that have reached full maturity during the same cycle, leading to the possibility of multiple zygotes. Drugs such as clomiphene citrate (Serophene) or human menopausal gonadotropins that stim- ulate ovarian activity greatly increase the possibility of mul- tiple births by causing simultaneous maturation of several follicles. The primary oocyte is arrested for 12 to 50 years in the diplotene stage of prophase of the first meiotic division. The primary oocytes within the primordial follicles begin the first meiotic division in the embryo, but the process is ar- rested at the diplotene stage of meiotic prophase (see the section on meiosis in Chapter 3). The first meiotic prophase is not completed until just before ovulation. There- fore, primary oocytes remain arrested in the first meiotic prophase for 12 to 50 years. This long period of meiotic ar- rest exposes the primary oocyte to adverse environmental inﬂuences and may contribute to errors in meiotic division such as nondisjunction. Such errors result in anomalies such as trisomy of chromosome 21 (Down syndrome). As the first meiotic division (reduction division) is com- pleted in the mature follicle (Fig. 23.9), each daughter cell of the primary oocyte receives an equal share of chromatin, but one daughter cell receives most of the cytoplasm and becomes the secondary oocyte. It measures 150 \u0003m in diameter. The other daughter cell receives a minimal amount of cyto- plasm and becomes the ﬁrst polar body. The secondary oocyte is arrested at metaphase in the second meiotic division just before ovulation. As soon as the first meiotic division is completed, the secondary oocyte begins the second meiotic division. As the secondary oocyte surrounded by the cells of the corona radiata leaves the follicle at ovulation, the second meiotic division (equatorial division) is in progress. This division is arrested at metaphase and completed only if the secondary oocyte is pen- etrated by a spermatozoon. If fertilization occurs, the secondary oocyte completes the second meiotic division and forms a ma- ture ovum with the maternal pronucleus containing a set of 838 follicular stigma tunica albuginea follicles ovary ab FIGURE 23.8 • Endoscopic and ultrasound examination of the ovary. a.

Development of nonsurgical techniques such as ultrasound imaging helps in monitoring of follicular growth and is useful as a method for determining the time for harvesting preovulatory oocytes.

In humans, the first polar body persists for more than 20 hours after ovulation and does not divide; therefore, the fertilized egg can be recognized by the presence of two polar bodies (diploid first polar body and haploid sec- ond polar body). In some mammals, the first polar body can divide, so the final outcome of meiosis consists of one oocyte and three haploid polar bodies (see Fig. 23.9). The polar bod- ies, which are not capable of further development, undergo apoptosis. Corpus Luteum The collapsed follicle undergoes reorganization into the corpus luteum after ovulation. At ovulation, the follicular wall, composed of the remaining granulosa and thecal cells, is thrown into deep folds as the fol- licle collapses and is transformed into the corpus luteum (yellow body), or luteal gland (Fig. 23.10a and Plate 94, page 876). At first, bleeding from the capillaries in the theca interna into the follicular lumen leads to formation of the corpus hemorrhagicum with a central clot. Connective tis- sue from the stroma then invades the former follicular cavity. Cells of the granulosa and theca interna layers then differen- tiate into granulosa luteal and theca luteal cells in the process called luteinization. These luteal cells undergo dramatic morphologic changes, increasing in size and filling with lipid droplets (Fig. 23.10b). A lipid-soluble pigment, lipochrome, in the cytoplasm of the cells gives them a yellow appearance in fresh preparations. At the ultrastructural level, the cells demonstrate features associated with steroid-secreting cells, namely, abundant sER and mitochondria with tubular cristae (Fig. 23.11). Two types of luteal cells are identified: • Granulosa lutein cells are large (about 30 \u0003m in diame- ter), centrally located cells derived from the granulosa cells. • Theca lutein cells are smaller (about 15 \u0003m), more deeply staining, and peripherally located cells derived from the cells of the theca interna layer (Plate 94, page 876) As the corpus luteum begins to form, blood and lymphatic vessels from the theca interna rapidly grow into the granu- losa layer. A rich vascular network is established within the corpus luteum. This highly vascularized structure located in the cortex of the ovary secretes progesterone and estrogens. These hormones stimulate the growth and secretory activity of the lining of the uterus, the endometrium, to prepare it for the implantation of the developing zygote in the event that fertilization occurs.chapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003OVARY 839 839 Polycystic ovarian disease is characterized by bilaterally enlarged ovaries with numerous follicular cysts. When asso- ciated with oligomenorrhea, scanty menstruation, the clinical term Stein-Leventhal syndrome is used. The individual is infertile because of lack of ovulation. Morphologically, the ovaries resemble a small, white balloon filled with tightly packed marbles. Affected ovaries, often called oyster ovaries, have a smooth, pearl-white surface but do not show surface scarring because no ovulations have occurred. The condition is attributable to the large number of fluid-filled fol- licular cysts and atrophic secondary follicles that lie beneath an unusually thick tunica albuginea. The pathogenesis is not clear but seems to be related to a defect in the regulation of androgen biosynthesis that causes production of excessive amounts of androgens that are converted to estrogens. The selection process of the follicles that undergo maturation also seems to be disturbed. The individual has an anovula- tory cycle characterized by only estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium because of the inhibition of progesterone pro- duction. Progesterone inhibition is caused by failure of the Graafian follicle to transform into a progesterone-producing corpus luteum. The treatment of choice is hormonal to stabi- lize and reconstruct the estrogen-to-progesterone ratio, but in some cases, surgical intervention is necessary. A wedge- shaped incision is made into the ovary to expose the cortex, thus allowing the ova, after hormonal treatment, to leave the ovary without physical restrictions created by the preexisting thickened tunica albuginea (Fig. F23.1.1). • FOLDER 23.1 Clinical Correlation: Polycystic Ovarian Disease TATATATATA FIGURE F23.1.1 • Polycystic ovarian disease. This photo- micrograph shows a section through the cortex of the ovary from an individual with polycystic ovarian disease.

Note that one of the follicles has developed to the primary follicle stage. \u000245. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 839 The corpus luteum of menstruation is formed in the absence of fertilization. If fertilization and implantation do not occur, the corpus lu- teum remains active only for 14 days; in this case it is called the corpus luteum of menstruation. In the absence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and other lu- teotropins, the rate of secretion of progestogens and estrogens declines, and the corpus luteum begins to degenerate about 10 to 12 days after ovulation. The corpus luteum degenerates and undergoes a slow involution after pregnancy or menstruation. The cells become loaded with lipid, decrease in size, and undergo autolysis. A white scar, the corpus albicans, is formed as intercellular hyaline material accumulates among the degenerating cells of the former corpus luteum (Fig. 23.12). The corpus albicans sinks deeper into the ovarian cortex as it slowly disappears over a period of several months. Capacitation and Fertilization During capacitation, the mature spermatozoa acquire the ability to fertilize the oocyte. Following their maturation in the epididymis, spermatozoa must be activated within the female reproductive tract. Dur- ing this activation process, called capacitation, structural and functional changes take place in the spermatozoon that result in its increased affinity to bind to zona pellucida receptors. Successful capacitation is confirmed by hyperactivation of the spermatozoa, which manifests as a vigorous, whiplash-like beating pattern of their flagella. Capacitation involves several biochemical changes and modifications to the spermatozoon and its plasma mem- brane. They include: • Increased activity of adenylyl cyclase leading to increasing levels of cAMP • Increased rate of tyrosine phosphorylation (measurement of tyrosine phosphorylation is used clinically as a biochem- ical marker of capacitation) • Activation of Ca2\u0004 channels resulting in increased intracel- lular Ca 2\u0004 levels • Release of seminal fluid glycoconjugates from the surface of the head of the spermatozoon. These surface glycosides (also called decapacitation factors) added during sperm maturation in the epididymis inhibit binding to the zona pellucida receptors • Extensive modification of the plasma membrane by removal of cholesterol, the predominant inhibitor of capacitation, and redistribution of phospholipids and carbohydrate moieties 840 formation of second polar body centrosome of spermatozoon unpacked nucleus of spermatozoon migration of nucleus to cell surface first meiotic division hyperactivation of spermatozoa formation of first polar body fertilization by penetrating spermatozoon impregnation of oocyte and resumption of second meiotic division alignment of male and female pronuclei zygote primary oocyte FIGURE 23.9 • Diagram illustrating changes that occur during growth, maturation, and fertilization of the oocyte. The primary oocyte remains arrested in prophase I of meiosis. The first meiotic or reductional division is completed only after the oocyte progresses to ovulation. The second meiotic or equatorial division is not completed unless the secondary oocyte is impregnated by a spermatozoon. Note the formation of first and second polar bodies. In some mammals, the first polar body divides (as shown on this drawing) so that there are four total meiotic products. However, in humans, the first polar body does not divide but persists for about 20 hours; therefore, the fertilized egg can be recognized by the presence of two polar bodies. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 840 Fertilization normally occurs in the ampulla of the uterine tube. Usually, only a few hundred of the millions of spermatozoa in an ejaculate reach the site of fertilization, typically the am- pulla of the uterine tube. On arrival, spermatozoa are con- fronted with the secondary oocyte surrounded by the corona radiata. Spermatozoa must penetrate the corona radiata to gain access to the zona pellucida. Although several spermato- zoa may penetrate the zona pellucida, only one spermatozoon completes the fertilization process. Capacitation is complete when spermatozoa are able to bind to the zona pellucida re- ceptors. Binding to the ZP-3 receptors on the zona pellucida triggers the acrosome reaction in which enzymes (mainly hyaluronidases) released from the acrosome enable a single spermatozoon to penetrate the zona pellucida. Penetration is accomplished by limited proteolysis of the zona pellucida in front of the advancing hypermotile spermatozoon. After penetrating the zona pellucida, the spermatozoon enters the perivitelline space between the zona pellucida and the oocyte plasma membrane (or oolemma). Here the sper- matozoon plasma membrane fuses with the oolemma, and the nucleus of the sperm head is finally incorporated into the oocyte. It forms the male pronucleus containing 23 pater- nal chromosomes. After the alignment and dissolution of nu- clear membranes of the two pronuclei, the resulting zygote, with its diploid (2n) complement of 46 chromosomes, un- dergoes a mitotic division or first cleavage. This two-cell stage marks the beginning of embryonic development. Before spermatozoa can fertilize the secondary oocyte, they must acquire more thrust to penetrate the corona ra- diata and zona pellucida. When approaching a secondary oocyte, a spermatozoon be- comes hyperactivated: It swims faster, and its tail movements become more forceful and erratic. Recent studies indicate that this hyperactivation reaction is caused by a sudden influx of Ca 2\u0004 into the tails of spermatozoa. The plasma membrane of the sperm tail contains large numbers of transmembrane Ca 2\u0004chapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003OVARY 841 841 aaaaa bbbbb GLC TLC GLC TLC GLC TLC GLC TLC GLC TLC CavCavCavCavCav aaaaa bbbbb GLC TLC GLC TLC GLC TLC GLC TLC GLC TLC CavCavCavCavCav FIGURE 23.10 • Photomicrograph of human corpus luteum. a.

This photomicrograph shows the wall of the corpus luteum at higher magnification. The main cell mass is composed of granulosa lutein cells (GLC). These cells have a large spherical nucleus and a large amount of cytoplasm. The theca lutein cells (TLC) also have a spherical nucleus, but the cells are considerably smaller than the granulosa lutein cells. \u0002240. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 841 channel proteins called CatSpers (cation channels of sperm). CatSper proteins are expressed exclusively in membranes of the tail. Influx of Ca 2\u0004 causes the tail to be more active and bend more forcefully, resulting in faster sperm movement through the viscous environment of the uterine tube. Together with limited proteolysis of the zona pellucida, hyperactivation is responsible for the physical penetration of the oocyte. Sperm hyperactivity is necessary for breaking physical barri- ers that protect the secondary oocyte from fertilization. Thus, activation of CatSpers is required for male fertility. Impregnation of the oocyte allows structures lying inside the spermatozoon to enter the cytoplasm of the oocyte. After penetrating the zona pellucida, the spermatozoon en- ters the perivitelline space between the zona pellucida and the oolemma (oocyte’s plasma membrane). Here, after docking to the oolemma, the spermatozoon plasma membrane fuses with the oolemma. This process, called the impregnation of the oocyte, allows the nucleus of the sperm (containing highly concentrated DNA), the centrosome, the midpiece with the mitochondria, and the kinocilium to be incorpo- rated into the cytoplasm of the oocyte. The tail plasma mem- brane remains as an appendage to the oolemma. An impregnating spermatozoon generates a molecular sig- nal for resumption and termination of the second meiotic division. This division transforms the secondary oocyte into a mature oocyte and triggers the expulsion of the second polar body into the perivitelline space. The male genetic material lying within the nucleus of incorporated sperm head is unpacked and used for building the male pronucleus, which contains 23 paternal chromo- somes. Nuclear membranes of both female and male pronu- clei dissolve (without fusion), and the chromosomes align themselves within the common mitotic spindle. The result- ing zygote contains a diploid (2n) complement of 46 chro- mosomes and later undergoes the first mitotic division or cleavage. The male centrosome is essential for the alignment of the mitotic spindle that divides chromosomes into the first two cells of the embryo. Only centrosomes from the father are used in building first and subsequent mitotic spin- dles. The incorporated kinocilium is finally dissolved, and all sperm mitochondria are eliminated from the cytoplasm of 842 L L Cap GGGGG sERsERsERsERsER MMMMM FIGURE 23.11 • Electron micrograph of theca lutein cells from the corpus luteum of a monkey.

Note that all mitochondria in human cells nor- mally derive from the mother, but all centrosomes originate from the father’s sperm cell. Several spermatozoa may penetrate the zona pellucida, but only one spermatozoon completes the fertilization process. As the fertilizing spermatozoon penetrates the ooplasm, at least three types of postfusion reactions occur to prevent other spermatozoa from entering the secondary oocyte (polyspermy). These events include the following. • Fast block to polyspermy. A large and long-lasting (up to 1 minute) depolarization of the oolemma creates a tran- sient electrical block to polyspermy. • Cortical reaction. Changes in the polarity of the oolemma then trigger release of Ca 2\u0004 from the ooplasmic stores. The Ca 2\u0004 propagates a cortical reaction wave in which cortical granules move to the surface and fuse with the oolemma, leading to a transient increase in surface area of the ovum and reorganization of the membrane. The contents of the cortical granules are released into the perivitelline space. • Zona reaction. The released enzymes (proteases) of the cortical granules not only degrade the glycoprotein oocyte plasma membrane receptors for sperm binding but also form the perivitelline barrier by cross-linking proteins on the surface of the zona pellucida. This event creates the final and permanent block to polyspermy. The corpus luteum of pregnancy is formed after fertilization and implantation. If fertilization and implantation occur, the corpus luteum in- creases in size to form the corpus luteum of pregnancy. The existence and function of the corpus luteum depends on a combination of paracrine and endocrine secretions, collec- tively described as luteotropins. Paracrine luteotropins are locally produced by the ovary. They include: • Estrogens • IGF-I and IGF-II Endocrine luteotropins are produced at a distance from their target organ, the corpus luteum. They include: • hCG, a 37-kilodalton glycoprotein secreted by the tro- phoblast of the chorion, which stimulates LH receptors on the corpus luteum and prevents its degeneration (page 840) • LH and prolactin, both secreted by the pituitary gland • Insulin, produced by the pancreas High levels of progesterone, produced from cholesterol by the corpus luteum, block the cyclic development of ovarian follicles. In early pregnancy, the corpus luteum measures 2 cm to 3 cm, thus filling most of the ovary. Its function begins to decline gradually after 8 weeks of pregnancy, although it per- sists throughout pregnancy. Although the corpus luteum re- mains active, the placenta produces sufficient amounts of estrogens and progestogens from maternal and fetal precur- sors to take over the function of the corpus luteum after 6 weeks of pregnancy. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) can be detected in the serum as early as 6 days after conception and in the urine as early as 10 to 14 days of pregnancy. Detection of hCG in the urine by speciﬁc anti- bodies forms the basis of most over-the-counter pregnancy tests. In addition, the rapid increase in circulating level of hGC in early pregnancy is responsible for “morning sick- ness,” a condition characterized by nausea and vomiting. These symptoms usually occur in the early hours of the morning are often among the ﬁrst signs of pregnancy. Atresia Most ovarian follicles are lost by atresia mediated by apoptosis of granulosa cells. As stated, very few of the ovarian follicles that begin their dif- ferentiation in the embryonic ovary are destined to complete their maturation. Most of the follicles degenerate and disappear through a process called ovarian follicular atresia. Atresia is mediated by apoptosis of granulosa cells. Large numbers of follicles undergo atresia during fetal development, early post- natal life, and puberty. After puberty, groups of follicles begin to mature during each menstrual cycle; normally, only one follicle completes its maturation. Atresia is now thought to be a mechanism whereby a few follicles are stimulated to main- tain their development through the programmed death of the other follicles. Thus, at any stage of its maturation a follicle may undergo atresia. The process becomes more complex as the follicle progresses toward maturation. In atresia of primordial and small, growing follicles, the immature oocyte becomes smaller and degenerates; similar changes occur in the granulosa cells. Atretic follicles shrink and eventually disappear from the stroma of the ovary as a re- sult of repeated apoptosis and phagocytosis by granulosa cells (Plate 93, page 874). As the cells are reabsorbed and disap- pear, the surrounding stromal cells migrate into the space pre- viously occupied by the follicle, leaving no trace of its existence. In atresia of large, growing follicles, the degeneration of the mature oocyte is delayed and appears to occur secondary to degenerative changes in the follicular wall (Plate 93, page 874). This delay indicates that once the oocyte has achieved its ma- turity and competence, it is no longer sensitive to the same stimuli that initiate the atresia in granulosa cells. The follicular changes include the following sequential events: • Initiation of apoptosis within the granulosa cells, indicated by cessation of mitosis and expression of endonucleases and other hydrolytic enzymes within the granulosa cells • Invasion of the granulosa layer by neutrophils and macrophages • Invasion of the granulosa layer by strands of vascularized connective tissue • Sloughing of the granulosa cells into the antrum of the follicle • Hypertrophy of the theca interna cells • Collapse of the follicle as degeneration continues • Invasion of connective tissue into the cavity of the follicle Recent studies indicate that several gene products regulate the process of follicular atresia. One of these products is thechapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003OVARY 843 843 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 843 844 There are several indications for in vitro fertilization (IVF), but the primary one is infertility as a result of surgically un- correctable damage to, or absence of, the uterine tubes. To induce multiple follicle development and maturation, women selected for an IVF procedure undergo controlled hyper- stimulation of the ovaries. Hyperstimulation is achieved by different hormonal therapies using human menopausal go- nadotropins and clomiphene citrate (Serophene), with or without FSH. Mature preovulatory oocytes are collected from the Graafian follicles by either laparoscopic or ultrasound- guided percutaneous aspiration or transvaginal aspiration. Before insemination, the oocytes are preincubated in a specialized medium with serum complements for a time determined by their stage of maturity. The collected semen is placed in a special medium. The oocytes are then added to the medium containing the col- lected semen for fertilization. Twelve to 16 hours later, the oocytes are examined with the differential interference con- trast microscope to determine the presence of female and male pronuclei, the indication of successful fertilization (Fig. F23.2.1a). At this stage, the fertilized oocyte may be frozen for future IVF transfers. Generally, 80% of mature oocytes cultured in vitro are fertilized. At this point, the embryo is transferred to a special growth medium for 24 to 48 hours, where it is allowed to grow to the stage of four to six cells (Fig. F23.2.1b). Several embryos are then trans- ferred into the uterus via the vagina and cervical canal on the third or fourth day after the initial aspiration of the oocyte. Before embryo transfer, the uterus has been pre- pared to receive the embryo by administration of appropri- ate hormones. Embryos are therefore placed into a hormonally prepared uterus under conditions equivalent to those in normal implantation (see page 852). Intensive pro- gesterone treatment is usually begun just after the transfer to mimic the function of the corpus luteum of pregnancy. In recent years, existing treatment protocols have been optimized to such an extent that success rates of pregnancy and delivery with IVF programs have reached greater than 30% per embryo transfer. Further improvements in preg- nancy rates may be achieved by the introduction of new drugs, such as recombinant FSH or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists that provide individualized hormonal treatment. Additionally, the occurrence of multiple pregnancies, which is the main complication of IVF, may be limited by reducing the number of transferred embryos. • FOLDER 23.2 Clinical Correlation: In Vitro Fertilization aa ba b FIGURE F23.2.1 • Early developmental stages of the human embryo. a.

(Courtesy of Dr. Peter Fehr.) 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 844 gonadotropin-induced neural apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP), which inhibits and delays apoptotic changes in the granulosa cell. NAIP gene expression is present in all stages of the growing follicle but absent in follicles undergoing atresia. A high level of gonadotropins inhibits apoptosis in ovarian follicles by increasing the expression of NAIP in the ovaries. The oocyte undergoes typical changes associated with de- generation and autolysis, and the remnants are phagocytosed by invading macrophages. The zona pellucida, which is resis- tant to the autolytic changes occurring in the cells associated with it, becomes folded and collapses as it is slowly broken down within the cavity of the follicle. Macrophages in the connective tissue are involved in the phagocytosis of the zona pellucida and the remnants of the degenerating cells. The basement membrane between the follicle cells from the theca interna may separate from the follicle cells and increase in thickness, forming a wavy hyaline layer called the glassy membrane. This structure is characteristic of follicles in late stages of atresia. Enlargement of the cells of the theca interna occurs in some atretic follicles. These cells are similar to theca lutein cells and become organized into radially arranged strands sep- arated by connective tissue. A rich capillary network develops in the connective tissue. These atretic follicles, which resem- ble an old corpus luteum, are called corpora lutea atretica. The interstitial gland arises from the theca interna of the atretic follicle. As atretic follicles continue to degenerate, a scar with hyaline streaks develops in the center of the cell mass, giving it the appearance of a small corpus albicans. This structure eventu- ally disappears as the ovarian stroma invades the degenerating follicle. In the ovaries of a number of mammals, the strands of luteal cells do not degenerate immediately but become bro- ken up and scattered in the stroma. These cords of cells con- tribute to the interstitial gland of the ovary and produce steroid hormones. The development of the interstitial gland is most extensive in animal species that have large litters. In the human ovary, there are relatively few interstitial cells. They occur in the largest numbers in the first year of life and during the early phases of puberty, corresponding to times of increased follicular atresia. At menarche, involution of the interstitial cells occurs; therefore, few are present dur- ing the reproductive life span and menopause. It has been suggested that in humans the interstitial cells are an impor- tant source of the estrogens that influence growth and devel- opment of the secondary sex organs during the early phases of puberty. In other species, the interstitial cells have been shown to produce progesterone. In humans, cells called ovarian hilar cells are found in the hilum of the ovary in association with vascular spaces and nonmyelinated nerve fibers. These cells, which appear to be structurally related to the interstitial cells of the testis, contain Reinke crystalloids. The hilar cells appear to respond to hormonal changes during pregnancy and at the onset of menopause. Research suggests that the hilar cells secrete an- drogens; hyperplasia or tumors associated with these cells usually lead to masculinization. Blood Supply and Lymphatics Blood supply to the ovaries comes from two different sources: Ovarian and uterine arteries. The ovarian arteries are the branches of the abdominal aorta that pass to the ovaries through the suspensory liga- ments and provide the principal arterial supply to the ovaries and uterine tubes. These arteries anastomose with the second blood source to the ovary, the ovarian branches of the uterine arteries, which arise from the internal iliac arteries. Relatively large vessels arising from this region of anastomosis pass through the mesovarium and enter the hilum of the ovary. These large arteries are called spiral arteries because they branch and become highly coiled as they pass into the ovarian medulla (see Fig. 23.2). Veins accompany the arteries and form a plexus called the pampiniform plexus as they emerge from the hilum. The ovarian vein is formed from the plexus. In the cortical region of the ovary, networks of lymphatic vessels in the thecal layers surround the large developing and atretic follicles and corpora lutea. The lymphatic vessels fol- low the course of the ovarian arteries as they ascend to paraaortic lymph nodes in the lumbar region. Innervation Ovaries are innervated by the autonomic ovarian plexus. Autonomic nerve fibers that supply the ovary are conveyed mainly by the ovarian plexus. Although it is clear that the ovary receives both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers, little is known about their actual distribution. Groups of parasympathetic ganglion cells are scattered in the medulla. Nerve fibers follow the arteries, supplying the smooth muscle in the walls of these vessels, as they pass into the medulla and cortex of the ovary. Nerve fibers associated with the follicles do not penetrate the basal lamina. Sensory nerve endings are scat- tered in the stroma. The sensory fibers convey impulses via the ovarian plexus and reach the dorsal root ganglia of the first lumbar spinal nerves. Therefore, ovarian pain is referred over the cutaneous distribution of these spinal nerves. At ovulation, about 45% of women experience midcycle pain (“mittelschmerz”). It is usually described as a sharp, lower abdominal pain that lasts from a few minutes to as long as 24 hours and is frequently accompanied by a small amount of bleeding from the uterus. It is believed that this pain is related to smooth muscle cell contraction in the ovary as well as in its ligaments. These contractions are in response to an increased level of prostaglandin F2\u0005 mediated by the surge of LH. \u0002 UTERINE TUBES The uterine tubes are paired tubes that extend bilaterally from the uterus toward the ovaries (see Fig. 23.1). Also commonly referred to as the Fallopian tubes, the uterine tubes transport the ovum from the ovary to the uterus and provide the necessary environment for fertilization and initial development of the zygote to the morula stage. One end ofchapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003UTERINE TUBES 845 845 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 845 846 During each menstrual cycle, the ovary undergoes cyclic changes that involve two phases: • Follicular phase • Luteal phase Ovulation occurs between the two phases (Fig. F23.3.1). The follicular phase begins with the development of a small number of primary follicles (10 to 20) under the influ- ence of FSH and LH. Selection of dominant follicles occurs by days 5 to 7 of the menstrual cycle. During the first 8 to 10 days of the cycle, FSH is the principal hormone influenc- ing the growth of the follicles. It stimulates the granulosa and thecal cells, which begin to secrete steroid hormones, principally estrogens, into the follicular lumen. As estrogen production from the dominant follicle increases, FSH is in- hibited by a negative feedback loop from the pituitary gland. Estrogens continue to accumulate in the follicular lumen, fi- nally reaching a level that makes the follicle independent of FSH for its continued growth and development. Late in the follicular phase, before ovulation, progesterone levels begin to rise under the influence of LH. The amount of estrogens in the circulating blood inhibits further production of FSH by the adenohypophysis. Ovulation is induced by a surge in the LH level, which occurs concomitantly with a smaller increase in the FSH level. It occurs approximately 34 to 36 hours after the start of the LH surge or about 10 to 12 hours after the peak of the LH surge. The luteal phase begins immediately after ovulation as the granulosa and thecal cells of the ruptured follicle undergo rapid morphologic transformation to form the cor- pus luteum. Estrogens and large amounts of progesterone are secreted by the corpus luteum. Under the influence of both hormones, but primarily progesterone, the en- dometrium begins its secretory phase, which is essential for the preparation of the uterus for implantation in the event that the egg is fertilized. LH appears to be responsi- ble for the development and maintenance of the corpus lu- teum during the menstrual cycle. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates within a few days as the hormonal levels drop. If fertilization does occur, the corpus luteum is maintained and continues to secrete pro- gesterone and estrogens. hCG, which is initially produced by the embryo and later by the placenta, stimulates the corpus luteum and is responsible for its maintenance dur- ing pregnancy. • FOLDER 23.3 Functional Considerations: Summary of Hormonal Regulation of the Ovarian Cycle menstrual phase proliferative phase secretory phase 0 5 10 14 20 25 28 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 menstrual cycle ovarian hormones (in blood) estrogen progesterone ovarian cycle pituitary hormones (in blood) LH FSH FIGURE F23.3.1 • Relationship of morphologic and physiologic events that occur in the men - strual cycle.

Each uterine tube is approximately 10 cm to 12 cm long and can be divided into four segments by gross inspection: • The infundibulum is the funnel-shaped segment of the tube adjacent to the ovary. At the distal end, it opens into the peri- toneal cavity. The proximal end communicates with the am- pulla. Fringed extensions, or ﬁmbriae, extend from the mouth of the infundibulum toward the ovary. • The ampulla is the longest segment of the tube, constitut- ing about two thirds of the total length, and is the site of fertilization. • The isthmus is the narrow, medial segment of the uterine tube adjacent to the uterus. • The uterine or intramural part, measuring about 1 cm in length, lies within the uterine wall and opens into the cavity of the uterus. The wall of the uterine tube is composed of three layers. The uterine tube wall resembles the wall of other hollow vis- cera, consisting of an external serosal layer, an intermediate muscular layer, and an internal mucosal layer. However, there is no submucosa. • The serosa or peritoneum is the outermost layer of the uterine tube and is composed of mesothelium and a thin layer of connective tissue. • The muscularis, throughout most of its length, is orga- nized into an inner, relatively thick circular layer and an outer, thinner longitudinal layer. The boundary between these layers is often indistinct. • The mucosa, the inner lining of the uterine tube, exhibits relatively thin longitudinal folds that project into the lumen of the uterine tube throughout its length. The folds are most numerous and complex in the ampulla (Fig. 23.13 and Plate 95, page 878) and become smaller in the isthmus. The mucosal lining is simple columnar epithelium composed of two kinds of cells—ciliated and nonciliated (Fig. 23.13b). They represent different functional states of a single cell type. • Ciliated cells are most numerous in the infundibulum and ampulla. The wave of the cilia is directed toward the uterus.chapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003UTERINE TUBES 847 847 ab BVBVBV FIGURE 23.13 • Photomicrograph of a human uterine tube. a. This cross section is near the ampulla region of the uterine tube. The mucosa is thrown into extensive folds that project into the lumen of the tube.

Note several branches of the uterine and ovarian arteries (BV ) that travel along the uterine tube. \u000216. b.

The epithelial cells undergo cyclic hypertrophy during the follicular phase and atrophy during the luteal phase in re- sponse to changes in hormonal levels, particularly estrogens. Also, the ratio of ciliated to nonciliated cells changes during the hormonal cycle. Estrogen stimulates ciliogenesis, and pro- gesterone increases the number of secretory cells. At about the time of ovulation, the epithelium reaches a height of about 30 \u0003m and is then reduced to about one-half that height just before the onset of menstruation. Bidirectional transport occurs in the uterine tube. The uterine tube demonstrates active movements just before ovulation as the fimbriae become closely apposed to the ovary and localize over the region of the ovarian surface where rup- ture will occur. As the oocyte is released, the ciliated cells in the infundibulum sweep it toward the opening of the uter- ine tube and thus prevent it from entering the peritoneal cavity. The oocyte is transported along the uterine tube by peristaltic contractions. The mechanisms by which spermatozoa and the oocyte are transported from opposite ends of the uterine tube are not fully understood. Research suggests that both ciliary movements and peristaltic muscular activity are involved in the movements of the oocyte. The movement of the sperma- tozoa is much too rapid, however, to be accounted for by in- trinsic motility. Fertilization usually occurs in the ampulla, near its junction with the isthmus. The ovum remains in the uterine tube for about 3 days before it enters the uterine cavity. Several conditions that may alter the integrity of the tubal transport system (e.g., inﬂammation, use of intrauterine de- vices, surgical manipulation, tubal ligation) may cause ec- topic pregnancy. The majority of ectopic pregnancies, 98% occur in the uterine tube (tubal pregnancies); remaining sites for the implantation of the blastocyst in ectopic pregnancies are the peritoneal cavity, ovaries, and cervix. \u0002 UTERUS The uterus receives the rapidly developing morula from the uterine tube. All subsequent embryonic and fetal development occurs within the uterus, which undergoes dramatic increases in size and development. The human uterus is a hollow, pear- shaped organ located in the pelvis between the bladder and rectum. In a nulliparous woman, it weighs 30 g to 40 g and measures 7.5 cm in length, 5 cm in width at its superior aspect, and 2.5 cm in thickness. Its lumen, which is also flat- tened, is continuous with the uterine tubes and the vagina. Anatomically, the uterus is divided into two regions: • The body is the large upper portion of the uterus. The an- terior surface is almost flat; the posterior surface is convex. The upper, rounded part of the body that expands above the attachment of the uterine tubes is termed the fundus. • The cervix is the lower, barrel-shaped part of the uterus separated from the body by the isthmus (see Fig. 23.1). The lumen of the cervix, the cervical canal, has a constricted opening at each end. The internal os communicates with the cavity of the uterus; the external os with the vagina. The uterine wall is composed of three layers (Fig. 23.14). From the lumen outward they are as follows. • The endometrium is the mucosa of the uterus. • The myometrium is the thick muscular layer. It is contin- uous with the muscle layer of the uterine tube and vagina. The smooth muscle fibers also extend into the ligaments connected to the uterus. • The perimetrium, the outer serous layer or visceral peri- toneal covering of the uterus, is continuous with the pelvic and abdominal peritoneum and consists of a mesothelium and a thin layer of loose connective tissue. Beneath the mesothelium, a layer of elastic tissue is usually prominent. 848 endometrium myometrium perimetrium endometrium myometrium perimetrium endometrium myometrium perimetrium endometrium myometrium perimetrium endometrium myometrium perimetrium BVBVBVBVBV FIGURE 23.14 • Photomicrograph of a sagittal section of a human uterus. This section shows the three layers of the uterine wall: the endometrium, the innermost layer that lines the uterine cavity; the myometrium, the middle layer of smooth muscle; and the perimetrium, the very thin layer of peritoneum that covers the exterior surface of the uterus. The deep portion of the myometrium contains the larger blood vessels (BV ) that supply the uterus. \u00028. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 848 The perimetrium covers the entire posterior surface of the uterus but only part of the anterior surface. The remaining part of the anterior surface consists of connective tissue or adventitia. Both myometrium and endometrium undergo cyclic changes each month to prepare the uterus for implantation of an em- bryo. These changes constitute the menstrual cycle. If an em- bryo implants, the cycle stops, and both layers undergo considerable growth and differentiation during pregnancy (described in the next section). The myometrium forms a structural and functional syncytium. The myometrium is the thickest layer of the uterine wall. It is composed of three indistinctly defined layers of smooth muscle: • The middle muscle layer contains numerous large blood ves- sels (venous plexuses) and lymphatics and is called the stra- tum vasculare. It is the thickest layer and has interlaced smooth muscle bundles oriented in a circular or spiral pattern. • The smooth muscle bundles in the inner and outer lay- ers are predominantly oriented parallel to the long axis of the uterus. As in most bulb-shaped hollow organs, such as the gall- bladder and urinary bladder, muscular orientation is not distinctive. The muscle bundles seen in routine histologic sections appear to be randomly arrayed. During uterine contraction, all three layers of the myometrium work to- gether as a functional syncytium expelling the contents of the lumen through a narrow orifice. In the nonpregnant uterus, the smooth muscle cells are about 50 \u0003m long. During pregnancy, the uterus undergoes enormous enlargement. The growth is primarily owing to the hypertrophy of existing smooth muscle cells, which may reach more than 500 \u0003m in length, and secondarily at- tributable to the development of new fibers through the divi- sion of existing muscle cells and the differentiation of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. The amount of connec- tive tissue also increases. As pregnancy proceeds, the uterine wall becomes progressively thinner as it stretches because of the growth of the fetus. After parturition, the uterus returns to almost its original size. Some muscle ﬁbers degenerate, but most return to their original size. The collagen pro- duced during pregnancy to strengthen the myometrium is then enzymatically degraded by the cells that secreted it. The uterine cavity remains larger and the muscular wall re- mains thicker than before pregnancy. Compared with the body of the uterus, the cervix has more connective tissue and less smooth muscle. Elastic fibers are abundant in the cervix but are found in appreciable quan- tities only in the outer layer of the myometrium of the body of the uterus. The endometrium proliferates and then degenerates during a menstrual cycle. Throughout the reproductive lifespan, the endometrium undergoes cyclic changes each month that prepare it for the implantation of the embryo and the subsequent events of embryonic and fetal development. Changes in the secretory activity of the endometrium during the cycle are correlated with the maturation of the ovarian follicles (see Folder 23.3). The end of each cycle is characterized by the partial destruc- tion and sloughing of the endometrium, accompanied by bleeding from the mucosal vessels. The discharge of tissue and blood from the vagina, which usually continues for 3 to 5 days, is referred to as menstruation or menstrual ﬂow. The menstrual cycle is defined as beginning on the day when menstrual flow begins. During reproductive life, the endometrium consists of two layers or zones that differ in structure and function (Fig. 23.15 and Plate 96, page 880):chapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003UTERUS 849 849 capillaryepithelium lacunae uterine glandendometriumstratum functionalestratum basalemyometrium uterine artery arcuate artery straight artery spiral artery radial branch FIGURE 23.15 • Schematic diagram illustrating arterial blood supply to the endometrium of the uterus. The two layers of the endometrium, the stratum basale and stratum functionale, are supplied by branches of the uterine artery. The spiral arteries located at the interface between these two layers degenerate and regenerate during the menstrual cycle under the influence of estrogens and progesterone. (Based on Weiss L, ed.

Baltimore: Urban & Schwarzenberg, 1988.) 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 849 850 • The stratum functionale or functional layer is the thick part of the endometrium, which is sloughed off at men- struation. • The stratum basale or basal layer is retained during menstruation and serves as the source for the regeneration of the stratum functionale. The stratum functionale is the layer that proliferates and degenerates during the menstrual cycle. During the phases of the menstrual cycle, the endometrium varies from 1 mm to 6 mm in thickness. It is lined by a simple columnar epithelium with a mixture of secretory and ciliated cells. The surface epithelium invaginates into the underlying lamina propria, the endometrial stroma, forming the uter- ine glands. These simple tubular glands, containing fewer ciliated cells, occasionally branch in the deeper aspect of the endometrium. The endometrial stroma, which resembles mesenchyme, is highly cellular and contains abundant inter- cellular ground substance. As in the uterine tube, no submu- cosa separates the endometrium from the myometrium. The vasculature of the endometrium also proliferates and degenerates during each menstrual cycle. The endometrium contains a unique system of blood vessels (see Fig. 23.15). The uterine artery gives off 6 to 10 arcuate ar- teries that anastomose in the myometrium. Branches from these arteries, the radial arteries, enter the basal layer of the endometrium where they give off small straight arteries that supply this region of the endometrium. The main branch of the radial artery continues upward and becomes highly coiled; it is therefore called the spiral artery. Spiral arteries give off numerous arterioles that often anastomose as they supply a rich capillary bed. The capillary bed includes thin-walled dilated segments called lacunae. Lacunae may also occur in the ve- nous system that drains the endometrium. The straight arteries and the proximal part of the spiral arteries do not change dur- ing the menstrual cycle. The distal portion of the spiral arteries, under the influence of estrogens and progesterone, undergoes degeneration and regeneration with each menstrual cycle. Cyclic Changes During the Menstrual Cycle Cyclic changes of the endometrium during the menstrual cycle are represented by the proliferative, secretory, and menstrual phases. The menstrual cycle is a continuum of developmental stages in the functional layer of the endometrium. It is ultimately controlled by gonadotropins secreted by the pars distalis of the pituitary gland that regulate the steroid secretions of the ovary. The cycle normally repeats every 28 days, during which the endometrium passes through a sequence of morphologic and functional changes. It is convenient to describe the cycle as having three successive phases: • The proliferative phase occurs concurrently with follicular maturation and is influenced by ovarian estrogen secretion. • The secretory phase coincides with the functional activ- ity of the corpus luteum and is primarily influenced by progesterone secretion. • The menstrual phase commences as hormone produc- tion by the ovary declines with the degeneration of the cor- pus luteum (see Folder 23.3). The phases are part of a continuous process; there is no abrupt change from one to the next. The proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle is regulated by estrogens. At the end of the menstrual phase, the endometrium consists of a thin band of connective tissue, about 1 mm thick, con- taining the basal portions of the uterine glands and the lower portions of the spiral arteries (see Fig. 23.15). This layer is the stratum basale; the layer that was sloughed off was the stra- tum functionale. Under the inﬂuence of estrogens, the proliferative phase is initiated. Stromal, endothelial, and epithelial cells in the stratum basale proliferate rapidly, and the following changes can be seen: • Epithelial cells in the basal portion of the glands reconstitute the glands and migrate to cover the denuded endometrial surface. • Stromal cells proliferate and secrete collagen and ground substance. • Spiral arteries lengthen as the endometrium is reestablished; these arteries are only slightly coiled and do not extend into the upper third of the endometrium. The proliferative phase continues until 1 day after ovulation, which occurs at about day 14 of a 28-day cycle. At the end of this phase, the endometrium has reached a thickness of about 3 mm. The glands have narrow lumina and are relatively straight but have a slightly wavy appearance (Fig. 23.16a). Accumulations of glycogen are present in the basal portions of the epithelial cells. In routine histologic preparations, ex- traction of the glycogen gives an empty appearance to the basal cytoplasm. The secretory phase of the menstrual cycle is regulated by progesterone. Under the inﬂuence of progesterone, dramatic changes occur in the stratum functionale, beginning a day or two after ovula- tion. The endometrium becomes edematous and may eventually reach a thickness of 5 mm to 6 mm. The glands enlarge and be- come corkscrew shaped, and their lumina become sacculated as they fill with secretory products (Fig. 23.16b). The mucoid fluid produced by the gland epithelium is rich in nutrients, particu- larly glycogen, required to support development if implantation occurs. Mitoses are now rare. The growth seen at this stage re- sults from hypertrophy of the epithelial cells, an increase in vas- cularity, and edema of the endometrium. The spiral arteries, however, lengthen and become more coiled. They extend nearly to the surface of the endometrium (Plate 97, page 882). The sequential influence of estrogens and progesterone on the stromal cells enables their transformation into decidual cells. The stimulus for transformation is the implantation of the blastocyst. Large, pale cells rich in glycogen result from this transformation. Although the precise function of these cells is not known, it is clear that they provide a favorable environ- ment for the nourishment of the embryo and that they create a 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 850chapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003UTERUS 851 851 specialized layer that facilitates the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall at the termination of pregnancy. The menstrual phase results from a decline in the ovarian secretion of progesterone and estrogen. The corpus luteum actively produces hormones for about 10 days if fertilization does not occur. As hormone levels rapidly decline, changes occur in the blood supply to the stra- tum functionale. Initially, periodic contractions of the walls of the spiral arteries, lasting for several hours, cause the stratum myometriummyometriummyometriummyometriummyometriummyometriummyometriummyometriummyometriummyometrium myometriummyometriummyometriummyometriummyometrium aa bb ccab c FIGURE 23.16 • Photomicrographs of the uterine lining in proliferative, secretory, and menstrual phases of the menstrual cycle. a.

The glands stop secreting, and the endometrium shrinks in height as the stroma becomes less edematous. After about 2 days, extended periods of arterial contraction, with only brief periods of blood flow, cause dis- ruption of the surface epithelium and rupture of the blood ves- sels. When the spiral arteries close off, blood flows into the stratum basale but not into the stratum functionale. Blood, uterine fluid, and sloughing stromal and epithelial cells from the stratum functionale constitute the vaginal discharge. As patches of tissue separate from the endometrium, the torn ends of veins, arteries, and glands are exposed (Fig. 23.16c). The desquamation continues until only the stratum basale remains. Clotting of blood is inhibited during this period of menstrual flow. Arterial blood flow is restricted except for the brief peri- ods of relaxation of the walls of the spiral arteries. Blood con- tinually seeps from the open ends of the veins. The period of menstrual ﬂow normally lasts about 5 days. The average blood loss in the menstrual phase is 35 ml to 50 ml. Blood flow through the straight arteries maintains the stratum basale. As noted, this process is cyclic. Figure F23.2.1 in Folder 23.3 shows a single cycle of the endometrium and then demonstrates a gravid state as it is established at the end of a secretory phase. In the absence of fertilization, cessation of bleeding would accompany the growth and maturation of new ovarian follicles. The epithelial cells would rapidly prolif- erate and migrate to restore the surface epithelium as the pro- liferative phase of the next cycle begins. In the absence of ovulation (a cycle referred to as an anovulatory cycle), a corpus luteum does not form, and progesterone is not produced. In the absence of progesterone, the endometrium does not enter the secretory phase and con- tinues in the proliferative phase until menstruation. In cases of infertility, biopsies of the endometrium can be used to di- agnose such anovulatory cycles as well as other disorders of the ovary and endometrium. Implantation If fertilization and implantation occur, a gravid phase replaces the menstrual phase of the cycle. If fertilization and subsequent implantation occur, decline of the endometrium is delayed until after parturition. As the blastocyst becomes embedded in the uterine mucosa in the early part of the second week, cells in the chorion of the developing placenta begin to secrete hCG and other lu- teotropins. These hormones maintain the corpus luteum and stimulate it to continue the production of progesterone and estrogens. Thus, the decline of the endometrium is pre- vented, and the endometrium undergoes further development during the first few weeks of pregnancy. Implantation is the process by which the blastocyst settles into the endometrium. The fertilized human ovum undergoes a series of changes as it passes through the uterine tube into the uterine cavity in preparation for becoming embedded in the uterine mucosa. The zygote undergoes cleavage, followed by a series of mitotic divisions without cell growth, resulting in a rapid increase in the number of cells in the embryo. Initially, the embryo is under the control of maternal informational macromolecules that have accumulated in the cytoplasm of the ovum during oogenesis. Later development depends on activation of the embryonic genome, which encodes various growth factors, cell junction components, and other macromolecules re- quired for normal progression to the blastocyst stage. The cell mass resulting from the series of mitotic divisions is known as a morula (L. morum, mulberry), and the individ- ual cells are known as blastomeres. During the third day after fertilization, the morula, which has reached a 12- to 16- cell stage and is still surrounded by the zona pellucida, enters the uterine cavity. The morula remains free in the uterus for about a day while continued cell division and development occur. The early embryo gives rise to a blastocyst, a hollow sphere of cells with a centrally located clump of cells. This inner cell mass will give rise to the tissues of the embryo proper; the surrounding layer of cells, the outer cell mass, will form the trophoblast and then the placenta (Fig. 23.17). Fluid passes inward through the zona pellucida during this process, forming a fluid-filled cavity, the blastocyst cavity. This event defines the beginning of the blastocyst. As the blastocyst remains free in the uterine lumen for 1 or 2 days and undergoes further mitotic divisions, the zona pellucida disappears. The outer cell mass is now called the trophoblast, and the inner cell mass is referred to as the embryoblast. Implantation occurs during a short period known as the implantation window. The attachment of the blastocyst to the endometrial epithe- lium occurs during the implantation window, the period when the uterus is receptive for implantation of the blasto- cyst. This short period results from a series of programmed actions of progesterone and estrogens on the endometrium. Antiprogesterone drugs such as mifepristone (RU-486) and its derivatives compete for the receptors in the endometrial epithelium, thus blocking hormone binding. The failure of progesterone to gain access to its receptors prevents implan- tation, thus effectively closing the window. In the human, the implantation window begins on day 6 after the LH surge and is completed by day 10. As contact is made with the uterine wall by the trophoblas- tic cells over the embryoblast pole, the trophoblast rapidly pro- liferates and begins to invade the endometrium. The invading trophoblast differentiates into the syncytiotrophoblast and the cytotrophoblast. • The cytotrophoblast is a mitotically active inner cell layer producing cells that fuse with the syncytiotrophoblast, the outer erosive layer. • The syncytiotrophoblast is not mitotically active and consists of a multinucleate cytoplasmic mass; it actively invades the epithelium and underlying stroma of the endometrium. Through the activity of the trophoblast, the blastocyst is entirely embedded within the endometrium on about the 11th day of development. (Further development of the syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast is described in the section on the placenta.) 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 852chapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003UTERUS 853 853 The syncytiotrophoblast has well-developed Golgi com- plexes, abundant sER and rER, numerous mitochondria, and relatively large numbers of lipid droplets. These features are consistent with the secretion of progesterone, estrogens, hCG, and lactogens by this layer. Recent evidence indicates that cy- totrophoblast cells may also be a source of steroid hormones and hCG. After implantation, the endometrium undergoes decid- ualization. During pregnancy, the portion of the endometrium that un- dergoes morphologic changes is called the decidua or de- cidua graviditas. As its name implies, this layer is shed with the placenta at parturition. The decidua includes all but the deepest layer of the endometrium. The stromal cells differen- tiate into large, rounded decidual cells (see page 850). The uterine glands enlarge and become more coiled during the early part of pregnancy and then become thin and flattened as the growing fetus fills the uterine lumen. Three different regions of the decidua are identified by their relationship to the site of implantation (Fig. 23.18): • The decidua basalis is the portion of the endometrium that underlies the implantation site. • The decidua capsularis is a thin portion of en- dometrium that lies between the implantation site and the uterine lumen. • The decidua parietalis includes the remaining en- dometrium of the uterus. By the end of the third month, the fetus grows to the point that the overlying decidua capsularis fuses with the decidua parietalis of the opposite wall, thereby obliterating the uterine cavity. By the 13th day of development, an extraembryonic space, the chorionic cavity, has been established (see Fig. 23.17c). The cell layers that form the outer boundary of this cavity (i.e., the syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast, and extraem- bryonic somatic mesoderm) are collectively referred to as the chorion. The innermost membranes enveloping the embryo are called the amnion (see Fig. 23.18). Cervix The endometrium of the cervix differs from the rest of the uterus. The cervical mucosa measures about 2 to 3 mm in thick- ness and differs dramatically from the rest of the uterine endometrium in that it contains large, branched glands (Fig. 23.19 and Plate 98, page 884). It also lacks spiral ar- teries. The cervical mucosa undergoes little change in thickness during the menstrual cycle and is not sloughed dur- ing the period of menstruation. During each menstrual cycle, however, the cervical glands undergo important functional changes that are related to the transport of spermatozoa within the cervical canal. The amount and properties of the mucus secreted by the gland cells vary during the menstrual cycle under the influence of the ovarian hormones. At midcy- cle, the amount of mucus produced increases 10-fold. This mucus is less viscous and appears to provide a more favorable environment for sperm migration. The cervical mucus at other times in the cycle restricts the passage of sperm into the uterus. Thus, hormonal mechanisms ensure that ovulation and changes in the cervical mucus are coordinated, thereby in- creasing the possibility that fertilization will occur if freshly ejaculated spermatozoa and the ovum arrive simultaneously at the site of fertilization in the uterine tube. Blockage of the openings of the mucosal glands results in the retention of their secretions, leading to formation of dilated cysts within the cervix called Nabothian cysts.

At this stage, the trophoblast cells have differentiated into syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 853 854 cysts develop frequently but are clinically important only if nu- merous cysts produce marked enlargement of the cervix. The transformation zone is the site of transition between vaginal stratified squamous epithelium and cervical sim- ple columnar epithelium. The portion of the cervix that projects into the vagina, the vaginal part or ectocervix, is covered with a stratified squa- mous epithelium (Fig. 23.20). An abrupt transition between this squamous epithelium and the mucus-secreting columnar epithelium of the cervical canal, the endocervix, occurs in the transformation zone that during the reproductive age of the woman is located just outside the external os (Plate 98, page 884). Before puberty and after menopause, the trans- formation zone resides in the cervical canal (Fig. 23.21). Metaplastic changes in this transformation zone constitute precancerous lesions of the cervix. Metaplasia (Gr. \u0003\u0006\u0007\u0005\b \t \u0005\u000bí\u0005, change in form) represents an adoptive and re- versible response to persistent injury of the epithelium caused by chronic infections. It results from a reprogramming of ep- ithelial stem cells that begin to differentiate into new cell lin- eage. Within the cervical canal (endocervix) it is manifested as a replacement of the simple columnar epithelium with fully mature stratiﬁed squamous epithelium (Fig. 23.22). The cer- vical epithelial cells are constantly exfoliated into the vagina. Stained preparations of the cervical cells (Papanicolaou [Pap] smears) are used routinely for screening and diagnosis of pre- cancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix. \u0002 PLACENTA The developing fetus is maintained by the placenta, which develops from fetal and maternal tissues. The placenta consists of a fetal portion, formed by the chorion, and a maternal portion, formed by the decidua basalis. The two parts are involved in physiologic exchange of substances between the maternal and fetal circulations. The uteroplacental circulatory system begins to de- velop around day 9, with development of vascular spaces called trophoblastic lacunae within the syncytiotro- phoblast. Maternal sinusoids, which develop from capillaries of the maternal side, anastomose with the trophoblastic lacu- nae (Fig. 23.23). The differential pressure between the arterial and venous channels that communicate with the lacunae es- tablishes directional flow from the arteries into the veins, thereby establishing a primitive uteroplacental circulation. Numerous pinocytotic vesicles present in the syncytiotro- phoblast indicate the transfer of nutrients from the maternal vessels to the embryo. Proliferation of the cytotrophoblast, growth of chorionic mesoderm, and blood vessel development successively give rise to the following. • Primary chorionic villi are formed by the rapidly prolifer- ating cytotrophoblast. They send cords or masses of cells into the blood-filled trophoblastic lacunae in the syncy- tiotrophoblast (see Fig. 23.17b). The primary villi appear between days 11 and 13 of development. • Secondary chorionic villi are composed of a central core of mesenchyme surrounded by an inner layer of cytotro- phoblast and an outer layer of syncytiotrophoblast. They develop at about day 16 when the primary chorionic villi become invaded by loose connective tissue from chorionic mesenchyme. The secondary villi cover the entire surface of the chorionic sac (Fig. 23.23a). • Tertiary chorionic villi are formed by the end of the third week as the secondary villi become vascularized by blood vessels that have developed in their connective tissue cores (Fig. 23.23b and Plate 100, page 888). As the tertiary villi are forming, cytotrophoblastic cells in the villi continue to grow out through the syncytiotrophoblast. yolk sac amnion villi chorion chorion chorionic villi decidua basalisdecidua basalis decidua capsularisdecidua capsularis uterine cavity uterine cavity chorion decidua basalis placenta decidua parietalis decidua parietalis FIGURE 23.18 • Development of the placenta.

Thus, a thin layer of cytotrophoblastic cells called the trophoblastic shell is formed around the syncytiotro- phoblast. The trophoblastic shell is interrupted only at sites where maternal vessels communicate with the intervillous spaces. Future growth of the placenta is accomplished by in- terstitial growth of the trophoblastic shell. cervicalcervical glandsglands cervical glands cervicalcervical canalcanal cervical canal nabothian cysts nabothian cysts cervical canal SCESCESCE SSESSESSE SSESSESSE external os XXX FIGURE 23.19 • Photomicrograph of a human cervix. This H&E–stained specimen is from a postmenopausal woman. Its lower portion projects into the upper vagina where an opening, the external os, leads to the uterus through the cervical canal. The surface of the cervix is covered by stratified squamous epithelium (SSE) that is continuous with the epithelial lining of the vagina. An abrupt transition from stratified squamous epithelium to simple columnar epithelium (SCE) occurs at the entry to the cervical canal. In this specimen, the stratified epithelium has extended into the canal, an event that occurs with aging. Mucus- secreting cervical glands are seen along the cervical canal. These are simple branched tubular glands that arise as invaginations of the epithelium lining the canal. Frequently, the glands develop into nabothian cysts as a result of retention of mucous secretion by blockage of the gland opening. The material marked by the X is mucus secreted from the cervical glands. \u000210. FIGURE 23.20 • Stratified squamous epithelium of the ecto- cervix.

Fetal placental antigen–presenting cells are the specific villous macrophages of fetal origin that participate in the placental in- nate immune reactions. In response to antigen, they proliferate and upregulate specific surface receptors that recognize and bind to a variety of pathogens. Like other antigen-presenting cells, if stimulated, they increase the number of MHC II (major histocompatibility complex) molecules on their surface. They are more common in the early placenta. The vacuoles in these cells contain lipids, glycosaminoglycans, and glycopro- teins. Recent studies of HIV-infected placentas indicate that HIV is primarily localized within the fetal placental anti- gen–presenting cells and in the syncytiotrophoblast. Early in development, the blood vessels of the villi become connected with vessels from the embryo. Blood begins to circulate through the embryonic cardiovascu- lar system and the villi at about 21 days. The intervillous spaces provide the site of exchange of nutrients, metabolic products and intermediates, and wastes between the maternal and fetal circulatory systems. During the first 8 weeks, villi cover the entire chorionic surface, but as growth continues, villi on the decidua capsu- laris begin to degenerate, producing a smooth, relatively avas- cular surface called the chorion laeve. The villi adjacent to the decidua basalis rapidly increase in size and number and become highly branched. This region of the chorion, which is the fetal component of the placenta, is called the chorion frondosum or villous chorion. The layer of the placenta from which the villi project is called the chorionic plate (Plate 99, page 886). During the period of rapid growth of the chorion fron- dosum, at about the fourth to fifth month of gestation, the fetal part of the placenta is divided by the placental (de- cidual) septa into 15 to 25 areas called cotyledons. Wedge-like placental septa form the boundaries of the cotyledons, and because they do not fuse with the chorionic plate, maternal blood can circulate easily between them. Cotyledons are visible as the bulging areas on the maternal side of the basal plate. The decidua basalis forms a compact layer known as the basal plate that is the maternal component of the placenta. 856 endocervical stroma simple columnar epithelium metaplastic stratified squamous epithelium FIGURE 23.22 • Metaplastic stratified squamous epithelium of the cervical canal.

Except for relatively rare rupturing of capillary walls, which is more common at delivery, fetal blood and maternal blood do not mix. Fetal and maternal blood are separated by the placental barrier. Separation of the fetal and maternal blood, referred to as the placental barrier, is maintained primarily by the layers of fetal tissue (Fig. 23.25). Starting at the fourth month, these layers become very thin to facilitate the exchange of products across the placental barrier. The thinning of the wall of the villus is caused in part by the degeneration of the inner cy- totrophoblast layer. At its thinnest, the placental barrier consists of the: • Syncytiotrophoblast • Discontinuous inner cytotrophoblast layer • Basal lamina of the trophoblast • Connective (mesenchymal) tissue of the villus • Basal lamina of the endothelium • Endothelium of the fetal placental capillary in the tertiary villus This barrier bears a strong resemblance to the air–blood barrier of the lung, with which it has an important parallel function, namely, the exchange of oxygen and carbon diox- ide—in this case between the maternal blood and the fetal blood. It also resembles the air–blood barrier by having a particular type of macrophage in its connective tissue— in this instance, the fetal placental antigen–presenting cells (Hofbauer cell).chapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003PLACENTA 857 857 A CPCPCP SBSBSB CVCVCV CVCVCV BVBVBV BVBVBV aaa b CTCTCT FIGURE 23.24 • Photomicrographs of a human placenta. a.

Fetal blood enters the placenta through a pair of umbilical ar- teries (Fig. 23.26). As they pass into the placenta, these arter- ies branch into several radially disposed vessels that give numerous branches in the chorionic plate. Branches from these vessels pass into the villi, forming extensive capillary networks in close association with the intervillous spaces. Gases and metabolic products are exchanged across the thin fetal layers that separate the two bloodstreams at this level. Antibodies can also cross this layer and enter the fetal circulation to provide passive immunity against a variety of infectious agents—for example, those of diphtheria, smallpox, and measles. Fetal blood returns through a system of veins that parallel the arter- ies except that they converge on a single umbilical vein. Maternal blood is supplied to the placenta through 80 to 100 spiral endometrial arteries that penetrate the basal plate. Blood from these spiral arteries flows into the base of the in- tervillous spaces, which contain about 150 ml of maternal blood that is exchanged three to four times per minute. The blood pressure in the spiral arteries is much higher than that in the intervillous spaces. As blood is injected into these spaces at each pulse, it is directed deep into the spaces. As the pressure decreases, the blood flows back over the surfaces of the villi and eventually enters endometrial veins also located in the base of the spaces. Exchange of gases and metabolic products occurs as the blood passes over the villi. Normally, water, carbon dioxide, metabolic waste products, and hormones are transferred from the fetal blood to the maternal blood; water, oxygen, metabo- lites, electrolytes, vitamins, hormones, and some antibodies pass in the opposite direction. The placental barrier does not exclude many potentially dangerous agents such as alcohol, nicotine, viruses, drugs, exogenous hormones, and heavy metals. Therefore, during pregnancy, exposure to or ingestion of such agents should be avoided to reduce the risk of injury to the embryo or fetus. Before the establishment of blood flow through the pla- centa, the growth of the embryo is supported in part by metabolic products that are synthesized by or transported through the trophoblast. The syncytiotrophoblast synthesizes glycogen, cholesterol, and fatty acids, as well as other nutri- ents used by the embryo. The placenta is a major endocrine organ producing steroid and protein hormones. The placenta also functions as an endocrine organ, produc- ing steroid and peptide hormones as well as prostaglandins that play an important role in the onset of labor. Immunocy- tochemical studies indicate that the syncytiotrophoblast is the site of synthesis of these hormones. The steroid hormones progesterone and estrogen have essential roles in the maintenance of pregnancy. As pregnancy proceeds, the placenta takes over the major role in the secre- tion of these steroids from the corpus luteum. The placenta produces enough progesterone by the end of the eighth week to maintain pregnancy if the corpus luteum is surgically 858 NNN FEFEFE TBLTBLTBL CTCTCT EBLEBLEBL FEnFEnFEn MEMEME SynSynSyn FIGURE 23.25 • Human placental barrier in a third trimester of the pregnancy.

In the production of placental es- trogen, the fetal adrenal cortex plays an essential role, provid- ing the precursors needed for estrogen synthesis. Because the placenta lacks the enzymes needed for the production of estro- gen precursors, a cooperative fetoplacental (endocrine) unit is established. Clinically, the monitoring of estrogen production during pregnancy can be used as an index of fetal development. The following peptide hormones are secreted by the placenta: • Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is required for implantation and maintenance of the pregnancy. Its synthe- sis begins around day 6, even before the syncytiotrophoblast is formed. HCG exhibits extensive (about 85%) sequence homology to LH, which is required for ovulation and main- tenance of the corpus luteum during the menstrual cycle. Similar to the work of LH during the menstrual cycle, hCG maintains the corpus luteum during early pregnancy. HCG also possesses marked homology to pituitary thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH), which may account for hy- perthyroidism in pregnancy by stimulating the maternal thyroid gland to increase secretion of tetraiodothyronine (T4). Measurement of hCG is used to detect early preg- nancy and assess pregnancy viability. Two other clinical conditions that increase the blood levels of hCG include trophoblastic diseases and ectopic pregnancies. • Human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS), also known as human placental lactogen (hPL), is closely re- lated to human growth hormone. Synthesized in the syn- cytiotrophoblast, it promotes general growth, regulates glucose metabolism, and stimulates mammary duct prolif- eration in the maternal breast. The effects of hCS on ma- ternal metabolism are significant, but the role of this hormone in fetal development remains unknown. • IGF-I and IGF-II are produced by and stimulate prolifera- tion and differentiation of the cytotrophoblast. • Endothelial growth factor (EGF) exhibits an age- dependent dual action on the early placenta. In the 4- to 5-week-old placenta, EGF is synthesized by the cytotro- phoblast and stimulates proliferation of the trophoblast. In the 6- to 12-week-old placenta, synthesis of EGF is shifted to the syncytiotrophoblast; it then stimulates and maintains the function of the differentiated trophoblast. • Relaxin is synthesized by decidual cells and is involved in the “softening” of the cervix and the pelvic ligaments in preparation for parturition. • Leptin is synthesized by the syncytiotrophoblast, particu- larly during the last month of gestation. Leptin appears tochapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003PLACENTA 859 859 stump of main stem villi main stem villus decidua basalis umbilical arteries umbilical vein chorionic plate amnion FETAL CIRCULATION MATERNAL CIRCULATION placental septa myometrium basal plate endometrial spiral artery endometrial vein placenta decidua basalis chorion amnion uterine cavity decidua parietalis cotyledons FIGURE 23.26 • Schematic diagram of mature human placenta. The sagittal section of the uterus (left) with the developing embryo shows the most common location of the placenta. The mature placenta (right) is divided into cotyledons by placental septa that are formed by outgrowths of the decidua basalis. Maternal blood enters the placenta through numerous endometrial spiral arteries that penetrate the basal plate. As the blood enters the cotyledon, it is directed deep into the intervillous spaces (red arrows). It then passes over the surface of the villi, where exchange of gases and metabolic products occurs. The maternal blood finally leaves the intervillous space (black arrows) through endometrial veins. The fetal blood enters the placenta through the umbilical arteries that divide into a series of radially disposed arteries within the chorionic plate. Branches from the vessels pass into the main stem villi and there form extensive capillary networks. The veins within the villi then carry the blood back through a system of veins that parallels the fetal arteries. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 859 regulate maternal nutrient storage to the nutrient require- ments of the fetus. It is also involved in transporting nutri- ents across the placental barrier from mother to the fetus. • Other growth factors stimulate cytotrophoblastic growth (e.g., fibroblast growth factor, colony-stimulating factor [CSF-1], platelet-derived growth factor, and interleukins [IL-1 and IL-3]) or inhibit trophoblast growth and prolifer- ation (e.g., tumor necrosis factor). \u0002 VAGINA The vagina is a fibromuscular tube that joins internal reproductive organs to the external environment. The vagina is a fibromuscular sheath extending from the cervix to the vestibule, which is the area between the labia minora. In a virgin, the opening into the vagina may be sur- rounded by the hymen, folds of mucous membrane extend- ing into the vaginal lumen. The hymen or its remnants are derived from the endodermal membrane that separated the developing vagina from the cavity of the definitive urogenital sinus in the embryo. The vaginal wall (Fig. 23.27) consists of the following. • An inner mucosal layer has numerous transverse folds or rugae (see Fig. 23.1) and is lined with stratified squamous epithelium (Fig. 23.28). Connective tissue papillae from the underlying lamina propria project into the epithelial layer. In humans and other primates, keratohyalin granules may be present in the epithelial cells, but under normal conditions, keratinization does not occur. Therefore, nu- clei can be seen in epithelial cells throughout the thickness of the epithelium. • An intermediate muscular layer is organized into two sometimes indistinct, intermingling smooth muscle layers, an outer longitudinal layer, and an inner circular layer. The outer layer is continuous with the corresponding layer in the uterus and is much thicker than the inner layer. Stria - ted muscle fibers of the bulbospongiosus muscle are pre- sent at the vaginal opening (Plate 101, page 890). • An outer adventitial layer is organized into an inner dense connective tissue layer adjacent to the muscularis and an outer loose connective tissue layer that blends with the ad- ventitia of the surrounding structures. The inner layer con- tains numerous elastic fibers that contribute to the elasticity and strength of the vaginal wall. The outer layer contains numerous blood and lymphatic vessels and nerves. The vagina possesses a stratified, squamous nonkeratinized epithelium and lacks glands. The lumen of the vagina is lined by stratiﬁed squamous, nonkeratinized epithelium. Its surface is lubricated mainly by mucus produced by the cervical glands. The greater and lesser vestibular glands located in the wall of the vaginal vestibule produce additional mucus that lubricates the vagina. Glands are not present in the wall of the vagina. The epithelium of the vagina undergoes cyclic changes during the menstrual cycle. Under the influence of estrogens, during the follicular 860 The mature placenta measures about 15 to 20 cm in diameter and 2 to 3 cm in thickness, covers 25% to 30% of the uterine surface, and weighs 500 g to 600 g at term. The surface area of the villi of human placenta is estimated to be about 10 m 2. The microvilli on the syncytiotrophoblast increase the effective area for metabolic exchange to more than 90 m 2. After birth, the uterus continues to contract, reducing the luminal surface and inducing placental separa- tion from the uterine wall. The entire fetal portion of the pla- centa, fetal membranes, and the intervening projections of decidual tissue are released. During uncomplicated labor, the placenta separates from the uterine wall and is delivered approximately 30 minutes after birth. One of the most severe complications of labor results from abnormal placentation (abnormal attachment of the placenta on uterine wall). If decidual tissue during im- plantation is disrupted, the placenta invades deep into the uterine wall. This may cause one of the three clinical condi- tions, known as placenta accreta, placenta increta, or pla- centa percreta. Classification depends on the severity and deepness of the placental attachment. Placenta accreta, accounting for approximately 75% of all cases, occurs when the placenta attaches too deeply into the uterine wall but does not penetrate the myometrium. Placenta increta (about 15% of all cases) occurs when the placental villi penetrate deep into the muscular layer of the myometrum. In the remaining 10% of all cases, placenta percreta pen- etrates through the entire uterine wall and attaches to an- other organ such as the bladder, rectum, intestines, or large blood vessels. It is the most serious complication of placentation and may cause rupture of the uterus and other complications related to its attachment. A retained abnor- mal placenta or placental fragments may cause massive postpartum bleeding and need to be manually removed. Placenta increta and percreta are often treated by perform- ing a hysterectomy. After physiologic delivery of the placenta, the endome- trial glands and stroma of the decidua basalis regenerate. Endometrial regeneration is completed by the end of the third week postpartum except at the placental site, where regeneration usually extends for another three weeks. Dur- ing the first week after delivery, remnants of the decidua are shed and constitute the red-brown uterine discharge known as lochia rubra. • FOLDER 23.4 Clinical Correlation: Fate of the Mature Placenta at Birth 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 860chapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003EXTERNAL GENITALIA 861 861 phase, the epithelial cells synthesize and accumulate glycogen as they migrate toward the surface. Cells are continuously desqua- mated, but near or during the menstrual phase, the superficial layer of the vaginal epithelium may be shed. The lamina propria exhibits two distinct regions. The outer region immediately below the epithelium is a highly cel- lular loose connective tissue. The deeper region, adjacent to the muscular layer, is denser and may be considered a submucosa. The deeper region contains many thin-walled veins that simu- late erectile tissue during sexual arousal. Numerous elastic fibers are present immediately below the epithelium, and some of the fibers extend into the muscular layer. Many lymphocytes and leukocytes (particularly neutrophils) are found in the lam- ina propria and migrate into the epithelium. Solitary lymphatic nodules may also be present. The number of lymphocytes and leukocytes in the mucosa and vaginal lumen dramatically in- creases around the time of menstrual flow. The vagina has few general sensory nerve endings. The sensory nerve endings that are more plentiful in the lower third of the vagina are probably associated primarily with pain and stretch sensations. \u0002 EXTERNAL GENITALIA The female external genitalia consist of the following parts, which are collectively referred to as the vulva and have a stratified squamous epithelium as follows. • The mons pubis is the rounded prominence over the pubic symphysis formed by subcutaneous adipose tissue. • The labia majora are two large longitudinal folds of skin, homologous to the skin of the scrotum, that extend from the mons pubis and form the lateral boundaries of the uro- genital cleft. They contain a thin layer of smooth muscle that resembles the dartos muscle of the scrotum and a large amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue. The outer surface, like that of the mons pubis, is covered with pubic hair. The inner surface is smooth and devoid of hair. Sebaceous and sweat glands are present on both surfaces (Fig. 23.29). • The labia minora are paired, hairless folds of skin that border the vestibule and are homologous to the skin of the stratifiedstratified squamoussquamous epitheliumepithelium stratified squamous epithelium mucosalmucosal layerlayer mucosal layer muscularmuscular layerlayer muscular layer blood vesselsblood vesselsblood vessels FIGURE 23.27 • Photomicrograph of a human vagina. This low-magnification H&E–stained specimen of the vaginal wall shows two of three layers of the vagina: the mucosal layer and the muscular layer (the outer layer, the adventitia, is not included). The mucosal layer consists of a stratified squamous epithelium and the underlying connective tissue. The epithelial connective tissue boundary is typically very irregular, with prominent papillae projecting into the undersurface of the epithelium. The muscular layer is seen only in part; it consists of irregularly arranged bundles of smooth muscle cells. Also, the deep region of the connective tissue contains a rich supply of blood vessels that supply the various layers of the vaginal wall. \u000240. stratifiedstratified squamoussquamous epitheliumepithelium stratified squamous epithelium basal cellsbasal cellsbasal cells FIGURE 23.28 • Photomicrograph of the vaginal mucosa.

The tips of these projections often appear as isolated structures surrounded by epithelium (arrows). \u0002180. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 861 penis. Abundant melanin pigment is present in the deep cells of the epithelium. The core of connective tissue within each fold is devoid of fat but does contain numer- ous blood vessels and fine elastic fibers. Large sebaceous glands are present in the stroma. • The clitoris is an erectile structure that is homologous to the penis. Its body is composed of two small erectile bod- ies, the corpora cavernosa; the glans clitoris is a small, rounded tubercle of erectile tissue. The skin over the glans is very thin, forms the prepuce of the clitoris, and contains numerous sensory nerve endings. • Vestibule. The vestibule is lined with stratified squamous epithelium. Numerous small mucous glands, the lesser vestibular glands (also called Skene’s glands), are pre- sent primarily near the clitoris and around the external ure- thral orifice. The large, paired greater vestibular glands (also called Bartholin’s glands) are homologous to the male bulbourethral glands. These tuboalveolar glands are 862 The examination of Pap smears is a valuable diagnostic tool in evaluating the vaginal and cervical mucosae (Fig. F23.5.1). The superficial epithelial cells are scraped from the mucosa, spread on a glass slide, fixed, and then stained with the Papanicolaou stain (a combination of hematoxylin, orange G, and eosin azure). Examination of the Pap smear provides valuable diagnostic information about the epithelium regard- ing pathologic changes, response to hormonal changes dur- ing the menstrual cycle, and the microbial environment of the vagina. The synthesis and release of glycogen by the epithelial cells of the uterus and vagina are directly related to changes in the pH of vaginal fluid. The pH of the fluid, which is normally low, around pH 4, becomes more acid near midcycle as Lactobacillus acidophilus, a lactic acid–forming bacterium in the vagina, metabolizes the se- creted glycogen. An alkaline environment can favor the growth of infectious agents such as Staphylococci, Corynebacterium vaginale, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Candida albicans, causing an abnormal increase in vaginal transexudates and inflammation of the vaginal mucosa and vulvar skin known as vulvovaginitis. These pathologic con- ditions are readily diagnosed with Pap smears. Specific antimicrobial agents (antibiotics, sulfonamides) are used to- gether with nonspecific therapy (acidified 0.1% hexetidine gel) to restore the normal low pH in the vagina and thus pre- vent the growth of these agents. In addition, cervicovaginal Pap smears are widely used for diagnosis of early cervical cancer as well as endome- trial carcinoma. Because cervical lesions may exist in a noninvasive stage for as long as 20 years, the abnormal cells shed from the epithelium are easily detected with a Pap smear examination. Microscopic examination of these cells permits differentiation between normal and abnormal cells, determines their site of origin, and allows classifying cellular changes related to the spread of the disease. The Pap smear is an extremely effective and in- expensive screening method in preventing cervical can- cer. Most of the cell abnormalities detected by Pap smears are in the precancerous stage, which allows the clinician to implement appropriate therapy. • FOLDER 23.5 Clinical Correlation: Cytologic Pap Smears aa bbab FIGURE F23.5.1 • Photomicrographs of cervical smears. a.

The greater vestibular glands secrete lubricating mucus. The ducts of these glands open into the vestibule near the vaginal opening. If the duct of the Bartholin’s gland becomes ob- structed, it usually dilates and ﬁlls with a secretion pro- duced by the gland. This condition, known as Bartholin’s cyst, may become infected within a few days, causing se- vere pain, redness, and enlargement of the involved labia majora. Purulent material in Bartholin’s abscess usually re- quires surgical incision with drainage or complete excision. Numerous sensory nerve endings are present in the external genitalia: • Meissner’s corpuscles are particularly abundant in the skin over the mons pubis and labia majora. • Pacinian corpuscles are distributed in the deeper layers of the connective tissue and are found in the labia majora and in association with the erectile tissue. The sensory im- pulses from these nerve endings play an important role in the physiologic response during sexual arousal. • Free nerve endings are present in large numbers and are equally distributed in the skin of the external genitalia. \u0002 MAMMARY GLANDS The mammary glands, or breasts, are a distinguishing fea- ture of mammals. They are structurally dynamic organs, vary- ing with age, menstrual cycle, and reproductive status of the female. During embryologic development, growth and devel- opment of breast tissue occur in both sexes. Multiple glands develop along paired epidermal thickenings called mam- mary ridges (milk lines) that extend from the developing axilla to the developing inguinal region. In humans, normally only one group of cells develops into a breast on each side. An extra breast (polymastia) or nipple (polythelia) may occur as an inheritable condition in about 1% of the female pop- ulation. These relatively rare conditions may also occur in men. In females, mammary glands develop under the influence of sex hormones. Until puberty, both females and males mammary glands de- velop in similar fashion. At the onset of puberty in males, testosterone acts on the mesenchymal cells to inhibit further growth of the mammary gland. In the same time, the mam- mary glands in women undergo further development under hormonal influence of estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen stimulates mesenchymal cells further development. The mammary gland increases in size, mainly due to the growth of interlobular adipose tissue. The ducts extend and branch into the expanding connective tissue stroma. Proliferation of ep- ithelial cells is controlled by interactions between the epithe- lium and the specialized intralobular hormone-sensitive loose connective tissue stroma. By adulthood, the complete ductal architecture of the gland has been established. The mammary glands remain in inactive state until preg- nancy, during which the mammary glands assume their com- plete morphologic and functional maturation. This occurs in response to estrogens and progesterone initially secreted from the corpus luteum and later from placenta, prolactin from pituitary gland, and gonadocorticoids produced by adrenal cortex. By the end of pregnancy, secretory vessicles are found in the epithelial cells, but milk production is inhibited by high levels of progesterone. The actual initiation of milk secretion occurs immediately after birth and is induced by prolactin (PRL) secreted by the adenohypophysis. The ejection of the milk from the breast is stimulated by oxytocin released from the neurohypophysis. With the change in the hormonal envi- ronment at menopause, the glandular component of the breast regresses or involutes and is replaced by fat and connec- tive tissue. In men, some additional development of the mam- mary glands normally occurs after puberty, and the glands remain rudimentary. Constant hormonal exposure and genetic predisposition are the major risk factors for the development of breast cancer. It is the most common malignancy in women in the United States.

At this magnification, several smooth muscle bundles can just barely be discerned (arrows). 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 863 200,000 women (and also 1,700 men) are diagnosed with breast cancer. Most breast cancers are linked to hormonal exposure (which increases with age, early menarche, late menopause, and with older age of a ﬁrst full-term preg- nancy). About 5% of all breast cancers are attributable to mutation in autosomal dominant breast cancer genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2). Mammary glands are modified tubuloalveolar apocrine sweat glands. The tubuloalveolar mammary glands, derived from modified sweat glands in the epidermis, lie in the subcutaneous tissue. The inactive adult mammary gland is composed of 15 to 20 irregular lobes separated by fibrous bands of connective tissue. They radiate from the mammary papilla, or nipple, and are further subdivided into numerous lobules known as terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) (Fig. 23.30). Some of the fi- brous bands, called suspensory or Cooper’s ligaments, connect with the dermis. Abundant adipose tissue is present in the dense connective tissue of the interlobular spaces. Each gland ends in a lactiferous duct that opens through a constricted orifice into the nipple. Beneath the areola, the pig- mented area surrounding the nipple, each duct has a dilated portion, the lactiferous sinus. Near their openings, the lactif- erous ducts are lined with stratified squamous keratinized ep- ithelium. The epithelial lining of the duct shows a gradual transition from stratified squamous to two layers of cuboidal cells in the lactiferous sinus and finally to a single layer of colum- nar or cuboidal cells through the remainder of the duct system. The epidermis of the adult nipple and areola is highly pig- mented and somewhat wrinkled and has long dermal papillae invading into its deep surface (Fig. 23.31). It is covered by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. The pigmenta- tion of the nipple increases at puberty, and the nipple be- comes more prominent. During pregnancy, the areola becomes larger and the degree of pigmentation increases fur- ther. Deep to the areola and nipple, bundles of smooth mus- cle fibers are arranged radially and circumferentially in the dense connective tissue and longitudinally along the lactifer- ous ducts. These muscle fibers allow the nipple to become erect in response to various stimuli. The areola contains sebaceous glands, sweat glands, and modified mammary glands (glands of Montgomery). These glands have a structure intermediate between sweat glands and true mammary glands, and they produce small elevations on the surface of the areola. It is believed that Montgomery glands produce a lubricating and protective secretion that changes the skin’s pH and discourages microbial growth. Nu- merous sensory nerve endings are present in the nipple; the areola contains fewer sensory nerve endings. Terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU) of the mammary gland represents a cluster of small secretory alveoli (in lactating gland) or terminal ductules (in inactive gland) surrounded by intralobular stroma. Successive branching of lactiferous ducts leads to the terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU). Each TDLU represents a grapelike cluster of small alveoli that forms a lobule (Fig. 23.32) and consists of the following. • Terminal ductules are present in the inactive gland. Dur- ing pregnancy and after birth, epithelium of the terminal ductules, which is lined by secretory cells, differentiates into fully functional secretory alveoli producing milk. • The intralobular collecting duct carries alveolar secre- tions into the lactiferous duct. • The intralobular stroma is specialized hormonally sensi- tive loose connective tissue that surrounds the terminal ductules and alveoli. The intralobular connective tissue contains little adipose cells. Glandular epithelial and myoepithelial cells are the most im- portant cells associated with mammary ducts and lobules. Glandular epithelial cells line the duct system, whereas myoepithelial cells lie deep within the epithelium between the epithelial cells and the basal lamina. These cells, arranged in a basketlike network, are present in the secretory portions of the gland. In routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) preparation, the myoepithelial cells are more apparent in the larger ducts. However, in the immunocytochemical prepara- tion, their discontinuous, basketlike arrangement is better visualized within the alveoli (Fig. 23.33). Contraction of myoepithelial cells assists in milk ejection during lactation. Recent immunoﬂuorescence studies have proven that breast progenitor cells found in the ductular epithelium give rise to both glandular cells of the alveoli and myoep- ithelial cells. The morphology of the secretory portion of the mam- mary gland varies with the menstrual cycle. 864 lactiferous duct lactiferous sinus lobules of tubuloalveolar glands connective tissue adipose tissue FIGURE 23.30 • Schematic drawing of the human breast as seen during lactation.

During the menstrual cycle, the inactive breast undergoes slight cyclic changes. Early during the follicular phase, the intralobular stroma is less dense, and terminal ductules appear as cords formed by the cuboidal-shaped ep- ithelial cells with little or no lumen. During the luteal phase, the epithelial cells increase in height, and lumina appear in the ducts as small amounts of secretions accumulate. Also, fluid accumulates in the connective tissue.

Mammary glands undergo dramatic proliferation and development during pregnancy. The mammary glands exhibit a number of changes in prepa- ration for lactation. These can be examined by the trimester of pregnancy. • First trimester is characterized by elongation and branch- ing of the terminal ductules. The lining epithelial and my- oepithelial cells proliferate and differentiate from breast progenitor cells found in epithelium of terminal ductules. Myoepithelial cells proliferate between the base of the ep- ithelial cells and the basal lamina in both the alveolar and ductal portions of the gland. • Second trimester is characterized by differentiation of alveoli from the growing ends of the terminal ductules. The development of the glandular tissue is not uniform, and variation in the degree of development is seen even within a single lobule. The cells vary in shape from flattened to low columnar. Plasma cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophils infiltrate the intralobular connective tissue stroma as the breast develops (Plate 103, page 894). At this stage, amount of glandular tissue and mass of the breast in- creases mainly due to the growth of the alveoli (Fig. 23.35). • Third trimester commences maturation of the alveoli. The epithelial glandular cells become cuboidal with nuclei positioned at the basal cell surface. They develop an exten- sive rER; secretory vesicles and lipid droplets appear in the cytoplasm. The actual proliferation of the interlobular stromal cells declines and subsequent enlargement of the breast occurs through hypertrophy of the secretory cells and accumulation of secretory product in the alveoli. The changes in glandular tissue during pregnancy are accom- panied by a decrease in the amount of connective tissue and adipose tissue. Both merocrine and apocrine secretion are involved in production of milk. The secreting cells contain abundant granular endoplasmic reticulum, a moderate number of large mitochondria, a supranuclear Golgi apparatus, and a number of dense lyso- somes (Fig. 23.36). Depending on the secretory state, large lipid droplets and secretory vesicles may be present in the api- cal cytoplasm. The secretory cells produce two distinct prod- ucts that are released by different mechanisms. • Merocrine secretion: The protein component of the milk is synthesized in the rER, packaged into membrane- limited secretory vesicles for transport in the Golgi appara- tus, and released from the cell by fusion of the vesicle’s limiting membrane with the plasma membrane. • Apocrine secretion: The fatty or lipid component of the milk arises as lipid droplets free in the cytoplasm. The lipid coalesces to form large droplets that pass to the apical re- gion of the cell and project into the lumen of the acinus. The droplets are invested with an envelope of plasma membrane as they are released. A thin layer of cytoplasm is trapped between the plasma membrane and lipid droplet and is released with the lipid, but the cytoplasmic loss in this process is minimal. The secretion released in the first few days after childbirth is known as colostrum. This premilk is an alkaline, yellowish secretion with a higher protein, vitamin A, sodium, and chlo- ride content and a lower lipid, carbohydrate, and potassium content than milk. It contains considerable amounts of anti- bodies (mainly secretory IgA) that provide the newborn with some degree of passive immunity. The antibodies in the colostrum are believed to be produced by the lymphocytes and plasma cells that infiltrate the loose connective tissue of the breast during its proliferation and development and are secreted across the glandular cells as in salivary glands and in- testine. As these wandering cells decrease in number after par- turition, the production of colostrum stops, and lipid-rich milk is produced. Hormonal Regulation of the Mammary Gland The initial growth and development of the mammary gland at puberty occur under the influence of estrogens and proges- terone produced by the maturing ovary. Under hormonal 866 FIGURE 23.33 • Myoepithelial cells in the mammary gland. This imunofluorescence image is obtained from mammary gland of lactating mouse two days post-parturition. The mouse carried a transgene composed of the smooth muscle \u0005-actin promoter conjugated to enhance green fluorescent protein (GFP) reaction. Three-dimensional organization of myoepithelial cells is visualized in green color due to the expression of the promoter transgene in myoepithelial cells. The tissue was also stained red with antibody against smooth muscle \u0005-actin conjugated directly with CY3 fluorescent dye. The orange color staining results from overlapping of the green and red staining. The cells on the surface of the terminal duct lobular unit are stained orange, while those deeper in the tissue stained only green because the antibody did not penetrate deep into the tissue. Note a small intralobular duct that merges into the larger lactiferous duct. \u0002600. (Courtesy Dr. James J.

Subsequent to this initial development, slight changes in the morphology of the glandular tissue occur during each ovarian cycle. During the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, estrogen in the circulation stimu- lates proliferation of the lactiferous duct components. After ovulation in the luteal phase, progesterone stimulates growth of alveoli; intralobular stroma become edematous. Clinically, during the luteal phase, women perceive tenderness and a progressive increase of breast tissue mass. During preg- nancy, the corpus luteum and placenta continuously produce estrogens and progesterone, causing a massive increase in TDLUs. It is now believed that the growth of the mammary glands also depends on the presence of prolactin, which is produced by the adenohypophysis; hCS, which is produced by the placenta; and adrenal glucocorticoids. Lactation is under the neurohormonal control of the adenohypophysis and hypothalamus. Although estrogen and progesterone are essential for the phys- ical development of the breast during pregnancy, both of these hormones also suppress the effects of prolactin and hCS, the levels of which increase as pregnancy progresses. Immediately after birth, however, the sudden loss of estrogen and proges- terone secretion from the placenta and corpus luteum allows prolactin to assume its lactogenic role. Production of milk also requires adequate secretion of growth hormone, adrenal glucocorticoids, and parathyroid hormones. The act of suckling during breast-feeding initiates sensory impulses from receptors in the nipple to the hypothalamus. The impulses inhibit the release of prolactin-inhibiting fac- tor, and prolactin is then released from the adenohypophysis. The sensory impulses also cause the release of oxytocin in the neurohypophysis. Oxytocin stimulates the myoepithelial cells that surround the base of the alveolar secretory cells and the base of the cells in the larger ducts, causing them to contract and eject the milk from the alveoli and the ducts. In the ab- sence of suckling, secretion of milk ceases, and the mam- mary glands begin to regress and atrophy. The glandular tissue then returns to an inactive condition. Involution of the Mammary Gland The mammary gland atrophies or its specialized stroma invo- lutes after menopause. In the absence of ovarian hormone stimulation, the secretory cells of the TDLUs degenerate and disappear, leaving only ducts to create a histologic pattern that resembles that of male breast. The connective tissue also demonstrates degenerative changes, marked by a decrease in the number of fibroblasts and collagen fibers, and loss of elas- tic fibers.chapter 23Female Reproductive System\u0003MAMMARY GLANDS 867 867 aa bbab densedense connectiveconnective tissuetissue dense connective tissue ductsductsducts MEpMEpMEp FIGURE 23.34 • Photomicrograph of an inactive mammary gland. a.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United States. More than 40 HPV types are known to infect the urogenital and anal regions of men and women, targeting the stratified squa- mous epithelium of the perineal skin or mucous mem- branes. Most women will be infected by HPV in their lifetime, but only a small percentage (5%–10%) will de- velop a persistent infection and the associated risk of cer- vical cancer. Of the approximately 40 sexually transmitted HPV types, most (90%) cause genital warts rather than cervical cancer and so are called low-risk HPV types (e.g., HPV types 6 and 11). Low-risk HPV types tend to infect mature epithelial cells and lead to genital warts or mild cervical dysplasia. HPV types 16 and 18 are the most common high-risk HPV types and are associated with 70% of cervical cancers. High-risk HPV types usually infect di- viding cells, cause moderate to severe cervical dysplasia or carcinomas, and are linked to anal cancer, vulvar cancer, and cancer of the penis in men. Most HPV-associated lesions can be diagnosed by microscopic examination of smears or biopsies. In difficult cases, ancillary techniques such as in situ hybridization can help to confirm the diagnosis (Fig. F23.6.1). Recently, two vaccines (Cervarix and Gar- dasil) have become available to protect women against the types of HPV that cause most cervical cancers. Cervarix is designed to prevent infections from HPV types 16 and 18 and contains recombinant noninfectious viruslike particles (VLPs) from both virus types. Gardasil contains a mixture of recombinant VLPs from HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. Nei- ther vaccine is therapeutic (i.e., they do not clear prior in- fection), but both lead to the development of specific immunity against HPV infections. The vaccines are most ef- fective for girls and young women between ages 9 and 26 who have had no prior HPV exposure and who complete the three-injection immunization protocol before initiation of sexual activity. • FOLDER 23.6 Clinical Correlation: Cervix and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infections continued next page 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 868 • FOLDER 23.6 Clinical Correlation: Cervix and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infections (Cont.) 869 lipid milk protein Golgi apparatus process of myoepithelial cell mitochondria rER basal laminaababababab alveolaralveolar lumenslumens alveolar lumens ductductduct c FIGURE 23.36 • Photomicrographs and diagram of a lactating mammary gland. a.

Branches of the vessels pass primarily along the path of the alveolar ducts as they reach capillary beds surrounding the alveoli. Veins basically follow the path of the arteries as they return to the axillary and internal thoracic veins. Lymphatic capillaries are located in the connective tis- sue surrounding the alveoli. The larger lymphatic vessels drain into axillary, supraclavicular, or parasternal lymph nodes. Innervation The nerves that supply the breast are anterior and lateral cuta- neous branches from the second to sixth intercostal nerves. The nerves convey afferent and sympathetic fibers to and from the breast. The secretory function is primarily under hor- monal control, but afferent impulses associated with suckling are involved in the reflex secretion of prolactin and oxytocin. 870 Almost 50% of fully breast-feeding women exhibit lacta- tional amenorrhea (lack of menstruation during lactation) and infertility. This effect is caused by high levels of serum prolactin, which suppress secretion of LH. Ovulation usually resumes after 6 months or earlier with a decrease in suckling frequency. In cultures in which breast-feeding may continue for 2 to 3 years, lactational amenorrhea is the principal means of birth control. • FOLDER 23.7 Functional Considerations: Lactation and Infertility 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 87072006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 871 This page intentionally left blank. PLATE 92 •OVARY I 872 Early primary follicles, ovary, monkey, H&E ×450. When a primordial follicle begins the changes leading to the formation of a mature follicle, the layer of squamous follicu- lar cells becomes cuboidal, as in this figure. In addition, the follicular cells proliferate and become multilayered. A follicle undergoing these early changes is called a primary follicle. Thus, an early primary follicle may still be unilaminar, but it is surrounded by cuboidal cells, and this distinguishes it from the more numerous unilaminar primor- dial follicles that are surrounded by squamous cells. Cortex, ovary, monkey, H&E ×120. The cortex of an ovary from a sexually mature individual is shown here. On the surface, there is a single layer of epithelial cells designated the germinal epithelium (GEp). This epithe- lium is continuous with the serosa (peritoneum) of the meso- varium. Contrary to its name, the epithelium does not give rise to the germ cells. The germinal epithelium covers a dense fibrous connective tissue layer, the tunica albuginea (TA); under the tunica albuginea are the primordial follicles (PF ). It is not unusual to see follicles at various stages of development or atresia in the ovary. In this figure, along with the large number of primordial follicles, there are four growing follicles (SF ), an atretic follicle (AF ), and part of a large follicle on the right. The region of the large follicle shown in the figure includes the theca interna (TI ), granulosa cells (GC ), and part of the antrum (A). Primordial follicles, ovary, monkey, H&E ×450. This figure shows several primordial follicles at higher mag- nification. Each follicle consists of an oocyte surrounded by a single layer of squamous follicular cells (F). The nucleus (N) of the oocyte is typically large, but the oocyte itself is so large that the nucleus is often not included in the plane of section, as in the oocyte marked X. The group of epithelioid-appearing cells (arrow- head) are follicular cells of a primordial follicle that has been sectioned in a plane that just grazes the follicular surface. In this case, the follicular cells are seen en face. Late primary follicle, ovary, monkey, H&E ×450. The primary follicle in this figure shows a multilayered mass of follicular cells (FC) surrounding the oocyte. The inner- most layer of follicular cells is adjacent to a thick eosinophilic layer of extracellular homogeneous material called the zona pellucida (ZP). At this stage of development, the oocyte has also enlarged slightly. The entire structure surrounded by the zona pellucida is actually the oocyte. Surrounding the follicles are elongate cells of the highly cellular con- nective tissue, referred to as stromal cells. The stromal cells surrounding a secondary follicle become disposed into two layers designated the theca interna and the theca externa. As seen in figure above stromal cells become epithelioid in the cell-rich theca interna (TI).

On one side is a hilum for the transit of neu- rovascular structures; on this same side is a mesovarium that joins the ovary to the broad ligament. The functions of the ovary are the produc- tion of ova and the synthesis and secretion of estrogen and progesterone. In the cortex are numerous primordial follicles that are present at the time of birth and that remain unchanged until sexual maturation. The oogonia in these follicles are arrested in prophase of the first meiotic division. At puberty, under the influence of pituitary gonadotropins, the ovaries begin to undergo the cyclical changes designated the ovarian cycle. During each cycle, the ovaries normally produce a single oocyte that is ready for fertilization. At the beginning of the ovarian cycle, under the influence of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), some of the primordial follicles begin to undergo changes that lead to the development of a mature (Graafian) follicle. These changes include a proliferation of follicular cells and enlargement of the follicle. Although several primordial follicles begin these developmental changes, usually only one reaches maturity and yields an oocyte. Occasionally, two follicles will mature and ovulate, leading to the possibility of dizygotic twin development. The dis- charge of the oocyte and its adherent cells is called ovulation. At ovulation, the oocyte completes the first meiotic division. Only if fertilization occurs does the oocyte complete the second meiotic division. Whether or not fertilization occurs, the other follicles that began to proliferate in the same cycle degenerate, a process referred to as atresia. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 872PLATE 92 •OVARY I 873 xx FCFC F FCFC N TATA GEpGEp PFPF AFAF SFSF ZPZP TITI GCGC A TA ZP SF AF PF GEp TI GC A ZPZPZPSFSFSF ZPZPZP N FC FCFCFC NN NN F FF x FC FCFCFC xx 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 873PLATE 93 •OVARY II 874 Atretic follicle, ovary, monkey, H&E ×65. Atretic follicles (AF) are shown here and at higher magnifica- tion in adjacent figure on right. The two smaller atretic follicles can be identified by virtue of the retained zona pellucida (ZP) marked by arrows in adjacent figure on right. The two larger, more advanced follicles do not display the remains of a zona pellucida, but they do display other features of follicular atresia. Secondary follicles, ovary, monkey, H&E ×120. Two follicles growing under the influence of FSH are shown in figure on left. The more advanced follicle is a secondary folli- cle. The oocyte in this follicle is surrounded by several layers of follicular cells (FC) that, at this stage, are identified as granu- losa cells. At a slightly earlier time, small lakes of fluid formed between the follicular cells, and these lakes have now fused into a well-defined larger cavity called the follicular antrum (FA), which is evident in the figure. The antrum is also filled with fluid and stains with the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction, although only lightly. The substance that stains with the PAS reaction has been retained as an eosinophilic precipitate in the antra of the sec- ondary follicles shown here and in figure on right. Immediately above the ob- vious secondary follicle is a slightly smaller follicle. Because no antral spaces are evident between the follicular cells, it is appropriate to classify it as a pri- mary follicle. In both follicles, but particularly in the larger follicle with the antrum, the surrounding stromal cells have become altered to form two dis- tinctive layers designated theca interna (TI) and theca externa (TE). The theca interna is a more cellular layer, and the cells are epithelioid. When seen with the electron microscope, they display the characteristics of endocrine cells, particularly steroid-secreting cells. In contrast, the theca externa is a connective tissue layer. Its cells are more or less spindle shaped. In figure on right, a later stage in the growth of the secondary follicle is shown. The antrum (FA) is larger, and the oocyte is off to one side, sur- rounded by a mound of follicular cells called the cumulus oophorus. The re- maining follicular cells that surround the antral cavity are referred to as the membrana granulosa (MG), or simply granulosa cells. Atretic follicles, ovary, monkey, H&E ×120. In atresia of a more advanced follicle, the follicular cells tend to degenerate more rapidly than the cells of the theca interna, and the basement membrane separating the two becomes thick- ened to form a hyalinized membrane, the glassy membrane. Thus, the glassy membrane (arrows) separates an outer layer of remaining theca interna cells from the degenerating inner follicular cells. The remain- ing theca interna cells may show cytologic integrity (RTI); these intact theca cells remain temporarily functional in steroid secretion. Atretic follicles, ovary, monkey, H&E ×120. Additional atretic follicles (AF) are shown here. Again, some show remnants of a zona pellucida (ZP), and two show a glassy membrane (arrows). Note that even though the atresia in these follicles is well advanced, some of the cells external to one of the glassy membranes still retain their epithelioid character (arrowhead). These are persisting theca interna cells.

In any section through the postpubertal ovary, follicles of various stages can be seen undergoing atresia. In atresia, the initial changes involve pyknosis of the nuclei of the follicular cells and dissolution of their cytoplasm. The follicle is then invaded by macrophages and other connective tissue cells. The oocyte degenerates, leaving behind the prominent zona pellucida. This may fold inward or collapse, but it usually retains its thickness and staining characteristics. When included in the plane of section, a distorted zona pellucida serves as a reliable diagnostic feature of an atretic follicle. In atresia of large, nearly mature follicles, cells of the theca interna remain to form clusters of epithelioid cells in the ovarian cortex. These are referred to collectively as interstitial glands and continue to secrete steroid hormones. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 874PLATE 93 •OVARY II 875 ZPZP AFAF MGMGFAFA TETE FAFA FCFC TITITI FC FA TE TITITI TITITI TETETE FAFAFAFAFA MG MGMGRTI AF AFAFAF AFAFAF AFAFAF AFAFAF ZP ZPZPZP 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 875PLATE 94 •CORPUS LUTEUM 876 Corpus luteum, ovary, human, H&E ×20. A portion of a fully formed corpus luteum is shown here. Most endocrine cells are the granulosa lutein cells (GLC). These form a folded cell mass that surrounds the remains of the former follicular cavity (FC). External to the corpus luteum is the connective tissue of the ovary (CT). Keep in mind that the theca interna was derived from the connective tissue stroma of the ovary. The location of theca lutein cells (TLC) reflects this origin, and these cells can be found in the deep outer recesses of the glandular mass, adjacent to the surrounding connective tissue. Corpus luteum, ovary, human, H&E ×20. This figure shows ovarian cortex shortly after ovulation. The arrowhead points toward the surface of the ovary at the site of ovulation. The cavity (FC) of the former follicle has been in- vaded by connective tissue (CT). The membrana granulosa has become plicated, and the granulosa cells, now transforming into cells of the corpus luteum, are called granulosa lutein cells (TC). The plication of the membrana granulosa begins just before ovulation and continues as the corpus luteum develops. As the corpus luteum becomes more plicated, the former follicular cavity becomes reduced in size. At the same time, blood vessels (BV) from the theca of the follicle invade the for- mer cavity and the transforming membrana granulosa cells. Cells of the theca interna follow the blood vessels into the outermost depressions of the plicated structure. These theca interna cells become transformed into cells of the corpus luteum called theca lutein cells. Corpus luteum, ovary, human, H&E ×65 (on left) and ×240 (on right). A segment of the plicated corpus luteum is shown in figure on left at higher magnification. As noted above, the main cell mass is composed of granulosa lutein cells (GLC). On one side of this cell mass is the connective tissue (CT) within the former follicular cavity; on the other side are the theca lutein cells. The granulosa lutein cells contain a large spherical nucleus (see, also, GLC, in figure on right) and a large amount of cytoplasm. The cytoplasm contains yellow pigment (usually not evident in routine H&E sections), hence the name, corpus luteum. Theca lutein cells (TLC) also contain a spherical nucleus, but the cells are smaller than the granulosa lutein cells. Thus, when identifying the two-cell types, aside from location, note that the nuclei of adjacent theca lutein cells generally appear to be closer to each other than nuclei of adjacent granulosa lutein cells. The connective tissue (CT) and small blood vessels that invaded the mass of granulosa lutein cells can be identified as the flattened and elongated components between the granulosa lutein cells. The changes whereby the ruptured ovarian follicle is transformed into a corpus luteum occur under the influence of pituitary luteinizing hor- mone. In turn, the corpus luteum itself secretes progesterone, which has a profound effect on the estrogen-primed uterus. If pregnancy occurs, the corpus luteum remains functional; if pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum regresses after having reached a point of peak development, roughly 2 weeks after ovulation. The regressing cellular components of the corpus luteum are replaced by fibrous connective tissue, and the structure is then called a corpus albicans.

The cells of the corpus luteum, luteal cells, rapidly increase in size and become filled with lipid droplets. A lipid-soluble pigment in the cytoplasm of the cells, lipochrome, gives them their yellow appearance in fresh tissue. Electron micrographs of the luteal cells demonstrate that they have features typical of steroid-secreting cells, namely, abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria with tubular cristae. Two types of luteal cells are identified: Large, centrally located granulosa lutein cells are derived from the granulosa cells; smaller, peripherally located theca lutein cells are derived from the theca interna. A rich vascular network is established in the corpus luteum into which progesterone and estrogen are secreted by the lutein cells. These hormones stimulate growth and differentiation of the uterine endometrium to prepare it for implantation of a fertilized ovum. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 876PLATE 94 •CORPUS LUTEUM 877GLCGLC TLCTLC FCFC BVBV TCTC CTCT FCFCFC CT TC BV CTCTCT CTCTCT CTCTCT CTCTCT BVBVBV FC GLC TLC GLCGLCGLC TLCTLCTLC GLCGLCGLC GLCGLCGLC TLCTLCTLC 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 877PLATE 95 •UTERINE TUBE 878 Mucosal fold, uterine tube, human, H&E ×160; inset ×320. The area enclosed by the rectangle in figure above is shown here at higher magnification. The specimen shows a longitudinal section through a lymphatic vessel (Lym). In other planes of section, the lymphatic vessels are difficult to identify. The for- tuitously sectioned lymphatic vessel is seen in the core of the mucosal fold, along with a highly cellular connective tissue (CT) and the blood vessels (BV) within the connective tissue. The epithelium lining the mucosa is shown in the inset. The ciliated cells are readily identified by the presence of well-formed cilia (C). Nonciliated cells, also called peg cells (PC), are readily identified by the absence of cilia; moreover, they have elongate nuclei and sometimes appear to be squeezed between the ciliated cells. The connective tissue (CT) contains cells whose nuclei are arranged typically in a random manner. They vary in shape, being elongated, oval, or round. Their cyto- plasm cannot be distinguished from the intercellular material (inset). The character of the connective tissue is essentially the same from the epithelium to the muscularis, and for this reason, no submucosa is described. Uterine tube, human, H&E ×40. A cross section through the ampulla of the uterine tube is shown here. Many mucosal folds project into the lumen (L), and the complicated nature of the folds is evident by the variety of profiles that is seen. In addition to the mucosa (Muc), the remainder of the wall consists of a muscularis (Mus) and connective tissue. The muscularis consists of smooth muscle that forms a relatively thick layer of circular fibers and a thinner outer layer of longitudinal fibers. The layers are not clearly delineated, and no sharp boundary separates them.

The oviduct undergoes cyclical changes along with those of the uterus, but these are not nearly as pronounced. The epithelial cells increase in height during the middle of the cycle, just about the time the ovum will be passing through the tube, and become reduced during the premenstrual period. Some of the epithelial cells are ciliated. The epithelial cells depend on the ovaries for their viability. Not only does the number of ciliated cells increase during the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle, but also removal of the ovaries leads to atrophy of the epithelium and loss of ciliated cells. The uterine tube varies in size and degree of mucosal folding along its length. The mucosal folds are evident in its distal portion, the infundibulum, as it nears the open end. Near the opening, the tube flares outward and is called the infundibulum. It has fringed folded edges called fimbria. The infundibulum leads proximally to the ampulla, which constitutes about two thirds of the length of the oviduct, has the most numerous and complex mucosal folds, and is the site of fertilization. Mucosal folds are least numerous at the proximal end of the oviduct, near the uterus, where the tube is narrow and referred to as the isthmus. A uterine or intramural portion measures about 1 cm in length and passes through the uterine wall to empty into the uterine cavity. Fertilization of the ovum usually occurs in the distal portion of the ampulla. For the first several days of development, as it navigates the complex pathway created by the mucosal folds, the embryo is transported proximally by the beating of the cilia of the ciliated epithelial cells and by peristaltic contractions of the well-developed muscularis layer that underlies the mucosa. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 878PLATE 95 •UTERINE TUBE 879 LymLym BVBV CTCT EpEpCTCT PCPC MusMus MucMucMuc L LMus L MusMusMus C CT PC C Ep CTBV Lym EpEpEp CTCTCT CTCTCT BVBVBV 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 879PLATE 96 •UTERUS I 880 Endometrium, proliferative phase, uterus, human, H&E ×25; inset ×120. Under the influence of estrogen, the various components of the endometrium proliferate (proliferative phase), so that the total thickness of the endometrium is increased. As shown in this figure, the endometrial glands (Gl) become rather long and follow a fairly straight course within the stratum func- tionale (SF) to reach the surface. The stratum basale (SB) remains es- sentially unaffected by the estrogen and appears much the same as in above figure. In this figure, the stratum functionale (SF), on the other hand, has increased in thickness and constitutes about four fifths of the endometrial thickness. Uterus, human, H&E ×25; inset ×120. After the stratum functionale (SF) is sloughed off, resurfac- ing of the raw tissue occurs. The epithelial resurfacing comes from the glands that remain in the stratum basale (SB). The gland epithelium simply proliferates and grows over the sur- face. This figure shows the endometrium as it appears when resurfacing is complete. The area inscribed in the upper small rectangle is shown at higher magnification in the inset on the right. Note the simple columnar epithelium (SEp) that covers the endometrial surface and its sim- ilarity to the glandular epithelium (Gl). The endometrium is relatively thin at this phase and over half of it consists of the stratum basale. The area in- scribed by the lower small rectangle, located in the region of the stratum basale, is shown at higher magnification in the inset in figure below. The glandular epithelium of the deep portion of the glands is similar to that of the endometrial surface. Below the endometrium is the myometrium (M), in which a number of large blood vessels (BV) are present.

The uterine wall is composed of a mucosa, referred to as the endometrium; a muscularis, referred to as a myometrium; and, externally, a serosal cover, the perimetrium. The myometrium consists of smooth muscle and connective tissue and contains the large blood vessels that give rise to the vessels that supply the endometrium. The uterus undergoes cyclical changes that are largely manifested by changes that occur in the endometrium. If implantation of an ovum does not occur after preparation for this event, the state of readiness is not maintained, and much of the endometrium degenerates and is sloughed off, constituting the menstrual flow. The part of the endometrium that is lost is referred to as the stratum functionale; the part that is retained is called the stratum basale. The stratum basale is the deeper part of the endometrium and adjoins the myometrium. The myometrium also undergoes changes associated with implantation of a zygote. In the nonpregnant uterus, the smooth muscle cells are about 50 \u0003m in length; during pregnancy, they undergo enormous hypertrophy, often reaching more than 500 \u0003m in length. In addition, new muscle fibers develop after division of existing muscle cells and division and differentiation of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. The connective tissue also increases to strengthen the uterine wall. Fibroblasts increase by division and secrete additional collagen and elastic fibers. After parturition, the uterus nearly returns to its normal size. Most muscle fibers return to their normal size, and some degenerate. Collagen secreted during pregnancy is digested by the very cells that secreted it, the fibroblasts. Similar, but less pronounced, proliferation and degeneration of fibroblasts and collagen occur in each menstrual cycle. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 880PLATE 96 •UTERUS I 881 SEpSEp M BVBV SBSB SFSF GIGIGI SF SB BVM SEp GIGIGI GIGIGI SFSFSF BVBVBV GIGIGI GIGIGI SBSBSB MM 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 881PLATE 97 •UTERUS II 882 Endometrium, secretory phase, uterus, human, H&E ×30; inset ×120. This slightly higher-magnification view of the stratum func- tionale shows essentially the same characteristics of the endometrial glands (Gl) described above; it also shows other modifications that occur during the secretory phase. One of these is that the endometrium becomes edematous. The increase in endome- trial thickness because of edema is reflected by the presence of empty spaces between cells and other formed elements. Thus, many areas of this figure, es- pecially the area within and near the rectangle, show histologic signs of edema. In addition, in this phase the glandular epithelial cells begin to secrete a mucoid fluid that is rich in glycogen. This product is secreted into the lumen of the glands, causing them to dilate. Typically, the glands of the secretory endometrium are more dilated than those of the proliferative endometrium. The rectangle in this figure highlights two glands that are shown at higher magnification in the inset. Each of these glands contains some sub- stance within the lumen. The mucoid character of the substance within one of the glands can be surmised from its blue staining. Although not evident in routine H&E paraffin sections, the epithelial cells also contain glycogen during the secretory phase and as mentioned above, this becomes part of the secretion. The arrowheads indicate stromal cells; some of these cells undergo enlargement late in the secretory phase. These modified stromal cells, called decidual cells, play a role in implantation. Uterus, human, H&E ×25. This view of the endometrium in the secretory phase shows the stratum functionale (SF), the stratum basale (SB), and, in the lower left of the photomicrograph, a small amount of the myometrium (M). The uterine glands have been cut in a plane that is close to their long axes, and one gland (arrow) is seen opening at the uterine surface. Except for a few glands near the center of the figure that resemble those of the proliferative phase, most of the glands (Gl) in this figure, including those that are labeled, show numerous shallow sacculations that give the profile of the glandular epithelium a ser- rated appearance. This is one of the distinctive features of the secretory phase. It is seen most advantageously in areas where the plane of section is close to the long axis of the gland. In contrast to the characteristic sinuous course of the glands in the stratum functionale, glands of the stratum basale more closely resemble those in the proliferative phase. They are not oriented in any noticeable relationship to the uterine surface, and many of their long profiles are even parallel to the plane of the surface.

This hormone brings the endometrium to a state of readiness for implantation, and as a consequence of its actions, the thickness of the endometrium increases further. There are conspicuous changes in the glands, primarily in the stratum functionale, where the glands take on a more pronounced corkscrew shape and secrete mucus that accumulates in sacculations along their length. The vasculature of the endometrium also proliferates and degenerates in each menstrual cycle. Radial arteries enter the stratum basale of the endometrium from the myometrium and give rise to small, straight arteries that supply the stratum basale and continue into the endometrium to become the highly coiled spiral arteries. Arterioles derived from the spiral arteries supply the stratum functionale. The distal portion of the spiral arteries and the arterioles are sloughed with the stratum functionale during menstruation. Alternating contraction and relaxation of the basal portions of the spiral arteries prevent excessive blood loss during menstruation. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 882PLATE 97 •UTERUS II 883 M SBSB GIGI SFSFSF GI SB M GIGIGI 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 883PLATE 98 •CERVIX 884 Ectocervix, uterus, human, H&E ×240. The surface of the vaginal part of the cervix, ectocervix is covered by the stratified squamous epithelium (SSEp). The ep- ithelium-connective tissue junction presents a relatively even contour in contrast to the irregular profile seen in the vagina. In other respects, the epithelium has the same general features as the vaginal epithelium. Another similarity is that the epithelial surface of the ectocervix undergoes cyclical changes similar to those of the vagina in response to ovar- ian hormones. The mucosa of the ectocervix, like that of the vagina, is de- void of glands. Cervix, uterus, human, H&E ×15. The portion of the cervix that projects into the vagina, the vaginal part or ectocervix, is represented by the upper two thirds of top figure. The lower third of the micrograph reveals the portion of the cervical canal (CC). Lower figure shows the continuation of cervical canal (CC). The plane of section in both figures passes through the long axis of the cervical canal which is nar- rowed and cone shaped at its two ends. The upper end, the internal os, communicates with the uterine cavity, and the lower end, the external os (Os), communicates with the vagina. (For purposes of orientation, realize that only one side of the longitudinal section of the cervix is shown in these figures and that the actual specimen, as seen in a section, would present a similar image on the other side of the cervical canal.) The mucosa (Muc) of the cervix differs according to the cavity it faces. The two rectangles in upper figure delineate representative areas of the mu- cosa that are shown at higher magnification in upper right and middle right figures, respectively. Bottom figure emphasizes the nature of the cervical glands (Gl). The glands differ from those of the uterus in that they branch extensively. They secrete a mucous substance into the cervical canal that serves to lubricate the vagina.

The mucosa of the cervical canal is covered with columnar epithelium. An abrupt change from stratified squamous epithelium (SSEp) to simple columnar epithelium (CEp) occurs within the transformation zone at the vaginal opening of the cervical canal (external os). The lower rectangle in top left figure marks this site, known as the transition zone, which is shown at higher magnification here. Note the abrupt change in the epithelium at the point indicated by the diamond-shaped marker, as well as the large number of lymphocytes present in this region. Cervical glands, cervix, uterus, human, H&E ×500. This figure shows, at high magnification, portions of the cervi- cal gland identified in the rectangle in Figure on left. Note the tall epithelial cells and the lightly staining supranuclear cyto- plasm, a reflection of the mucin dissolved out of the cell during tissue preparation. The crowding and the change in shape of the nuclei (aster- isk) seen at the upper part of one of the glands in this figure are due to a tan- gential cut through the wall of the gland as it passed out of the plane of section. (It is not uncommon for cervical glands to develop into cysts as a re- sult of obstruction in the duct. Such cysts are referred to as Nabothian cysts.) \u0003 PLATE 98 Cervix The cervix is the narrow or constricted inferior portion of the uterus, part of which projects into the vagina. The cervical canal traverses the cervix and provides a channel connecting the vagina and the uterine cavity. The structure of the cervix resembles the rest of the uterus in that it consists of a mucosa (endometrium) and a myometrium. There are, however, some important differences in the mucosa. The endometrium of the cervix does not undergo the cyclical growth and loss of tissue that is characteristic of the body and fundus of the uterus. Rather, the amount and character of the mucous secretion of its simple columnar epithelium vary at different times in the uterine cycle under the influence of the ovarian hormones. At midcycle, there is a 10-fold increase in the amount of mucus produced; this mucus is less viscous and provides a favorable environment for sperm migration. At other times in the cycle, the mucus restricts the passage of sperm into the uterus. The myometrium forms the major thickness of the cervix. It consists of interweaving bundles of smooth muscle cells in an extensive, continuous network of fibrous connective tissue. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 884PLATE 98 •CERVIX 885 ** BVBV SSEpSSEp MucMuc GIGI Os Muc CC GI GIGIGI CC SSEp SSEpSSEpSSEp BV CEpvv * 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 885PLATE 99 •PLACENTA I 886 Placenta, human, H&E ×70; inset ×370. The maternal side of the placenta is shown in this figure. The basal plate, or stratum basale (SB), is on the right side of the illustration. This is the part of the uterus to which the chori- onic villi anchor. Along with the usual connective tissue ele- ments, the basal plate contains specialized cells called decidual cells (DC). The same cells are shown at higher magnification in the inset. Decidual cells are usually found in clusters and have an epithelial appearance. Because of these features, they are easily identified. Septa from the basal plate extend into the portion of the placenta that contains the chorionic villi. The septa do not contain the branches of the umbilical vessels and, on this basis, can frequently be distinguished from stem villi or their branches. Placenta, human, H&E ×16. A section extending from the amniotic surface into the sub- stance of the placenta is shown here. This includes the amnion (A), the chorionic plate (CP), and the chorionic villi (CV). The amnion consists of a layer of simple cuboidal epithelium and an underlying layer of connective tissue. The connective tissue of the amnion is continuous with the connective tissue of the chori- onic plate as a result of their fusion at an earlier time. The plane of fusion, however, is not evident in H&E sections; the separation (asterisks) in parts of this figure in the vicinity of the fusion is an artifact. The chorionic plate is a thick connective tissue mass that contains the ram- ifications of the umbilical arteries and vein. These vessels (BVp) do not have the distinct organizational features characteristic of arteries and veins; rather, they resemble the vessels of the umbilical cord. Although their identification as blood vessels is relatively simple, it is difficult to distinguish which vessels are branches of an umbilical artery and which are tributaries of the vein. The main substance of the placenta consists of chorionic villi of different sizes (see Plate 100). These emerge from the chorionic plate as large stem villi that branch into increasingly smaller villi. Branches of the umbilical arteries and vein (BVv, in figure below) enter the stem villi and ramify through the branching villous network. Some villi extend from the chorionic plate to the maternal side of the placenta and make contact with the maternal tissue; these are called anchoring villi. Other villi, the free villi, simply arborize within the substance of the placenta without anchoring onto the maternal side.

It develops primarily from embryonic tissue, the chorion frondosum. One side of the placenta is embedded in the uterine wall at the basal plate. The other side faces the amniotic cavity that contains the fetus. After birth, the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus and is discharged along with the contiguous membranes of the amniotic cavity. The umbilical cord connects the fetus to the placenta. It contains two arteries that carry blood from the fetus to the placenta and a vein that returns blood from the placenta to the fetus. The umbilical arteries have thick muscular walls. These are arranged as two layers, an inner longitudinal layer and an outer circular layer. Elastic lamellae are poorly developed in these vessels and, indeed, may be absent. The umbilical vein is similar to the arteries, also having a thick muscular wall arranged as an inner longitudinal and an outer circular layer. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 886PLATE 99 •PLACENTA I 887 BVvBVv SBSB DCDC CVCVBVpBVp CPCP A CP CPCPCP BVp A BVpBVpBVp CV * * * BVv SB DC 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 887 Tertiary chorionic villi, placenta, mid-term, human, H&E ×320. This higher-magnification photomicrograph shows a cross section through immature chorionic tertiary villi surrounded by the intervillous space (IS). At this stage, chorionic villi are growing by proliferation of their core mesenchyme, syncy- tiotrophoblast (S), and fetal endothelial cells. The syncytiotrophoblastPLATE 100 •PLACENTA II 888 Tertiary chorionic villi, placenta, full-term, human, H&E ×280. This photomicrograph shows a section through the inter- villous space of the placenta at term. It includes chorionic villi (CV) of different sizes and the surrounding intervillous space (IS). The connective tissue of the villi contains branches and tributaries of the umbilical vein (UV) and arteries. The intervillous space usually contains maternal blood (only a few maternal blood cells are seen here). The outermost layer of each chorionic villus derives from the fusion of cytotrophoblast cells. This layer, known as the syncytiotrophoblast (S), has no intercellular boundaries, and its nuclei are rather evenly distributed, giving this layer an appearance similar to that of cuboidal epithelium. In some areas, nuclei are gathered in clusters (arrowheads); in other regions the syncytiotrophoblast layer appears relatively free of nuclei (arrows). These stretches of the syncytiotrophoblast may be so attenuated in places that the villous surface appears devoid of a covering. The syncytiotrophoblast con- tains microvilli that project into the intervillous space. In well-preserved specimens they may appear as a striated border (see inset below). The cytotro- phoblast consists of an irregular layer of mono-nucleated cells that lies be- neath the syncytiotrophoblast. In immature placentas, the cytotrophoblasts form an almost complete layer of cells. In this full-term placenta, only occa- sional cytotrophoblast cells (C) can be discerned. Most of the cells within the core of the villus are typical connective tissue fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Other cells have a visible amount of cytoplasm that surrounds the nu- cleus. These are considered to be fetal placental antigen–presenting cells or placental macrophages (PM) historically known as the Hofbauer cells.

This micrographs shows the secondary chorionic villi in the third week of embryonic development. These villi are com- posed of a mesenchymal core (MC) surrounded by two dis- tinct layers of the trophoblast. Secondary villi have a much larger number of cytotrophoblast cells (C) than the mature tertiary villi and form an almost complete layer of cells immediately deep to the syncy- tiotrophoblast (S) (see inset). The syncytiotrophoblast covers not only the surface of the chorionic villi, but also extends into chorionic plate. Maternal red blood cells are present in the intervillous space. surrounding the chorionic villus (center of the image) forms trophoblastic bud (TB), which will be invaded subsequently by cells of the cytotro- phoblast (C), connective tissue, and rapidly developing new blood vessels. In addition to fibroblasts, several fetal placental antigen–presenting cells (placental macrophages) (PM) can be identified by the amount of cyto- plasm surrounding their nuclei. \u0003 PLATE 100 Placenta II As the embryo develops, the invasive activity of the syncytiotrophoblast erodes the maternal capillaries and anastomoses them with the tro- phoblast lacunae, forming the maternal blood sinusoids. These communicate with each other and form a single blood compartment, lined by syn- cytiotrophoblasts, called the intervillous space. At the end of the second week of development, cytotrophoblast cells form primary chorionic villi. They project into the maternal blood space. In the third week of development, invasion of the extra embryonic mesenchyme into the primary chori- onic villi creates secondary chorionic villi. At the end of the third week, core mesenchyme differentiates into connective tissue and blood vessels that connect with the embryonic circulation. These tertiary chorionic villi constitute functional units for exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products between maternal and fetal circulation without direct contact with each other. This separation of fetal and maternal blood is referred to as the placental barrier. Each tertiary villus consists of a connective tissue core surrounded by two distinct layers of trophoblast-derived cells. The outermost layer consists of the syncytiotrophoblast; immediately under it is a layer of cytotrophoblast cells. Starting at the fourth month, these lay- ers become very thin to facilitate the exchange of products across the placental barrier. The thinning of the wall of the villus is due to the loss of the inner, cytotrophoblastic layer. At this stage, the syncytiotrophoblast forms numerous trophoblastic buds that resemble the primary chorionic villi; however, the cytotrophoblast and the connective tissue grow very rapidly into these structures, transforming them into tertiary villi. At term, the placental barrier consists of the syncytiotrophoblasts; a spare, discontinuous, inner cytotrophoblast layer; the basal lamina of the trophoblast; the connective tissue of the villus; the basal lamina of the endothelium; and the endothelium of the fetal placental capillary in the tertiary villus. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 888PLATE 100 •PLACENTA II 889 CC CC UVUV CC CVCVISIS CC PMPM PMPM CVCV SS PMPM C C UV C CVIS C PM PM CV S PM ISIS TBTB PMPM CCPMPM SS CC CC CC SS MCMC MCMC SS IS TB PM CPM S C C C S MC MC S 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 889PLATE 101 •VAGINA 890 Mucosa, vagina, human H&E ×110. This is a higher magnification of the epithelium that includes the area outlined by the rectangle in upper figure (turned 90\f). The obliquely cut and cross-sectioned portions of connective tissue papillae that appear as connective tissue islands in the epithelium are more clearly seen here (arrows), in some instances outlined by the surrounding closely packed cells of the basal epithelial cell layer. Note, again, that the epithelial cells even at the surface still retain their nu- clei and there is no evidence of keratinization. Vagina, human, H&E ×90. The mucosa of the vagina consists of a stratified squamous epithelium (Ep) and an underlying fibrous connective tissue (CT) that often appears more cellular than other fibrous con- nective tissue. The boundary between the two is readily identi- fied because of the conspicuous staining of the closely packed small cells of the basal layer (B) of the epithelium. Connective tissue papillae project into the underside of the epithelium, giving the epithelial– connective tissue junction an uneven appearance. The papillae may be cut obliquely or in cross section and thus may appear as connective tissue islands (arrows) within the lower portion of the epithelium. The epithelium is char- acteristically thick and although keratohyaline granules may be found in the superficial cells, keratinization does not occur in human vaginal epithelium. Thus, nuclei can be observed throughout the entire thickness of the epithe- lium despite the fact that the cytoplasm of most of the cells above the basal layers appears empty. These cells are normally filled with large deposits of glycogen that is lost in the processes of fixation and embedding of the tissue. The rectangle outlines a portion of the epithelium and connective tissue papillae that is examined at higher magnification below. The muscular layer of the vaginal wall consists of smooth muscle arranged in two ill-defined layers. The outer layer is generally said to be longitudinally arranged (SML), and the inner layer is generally said to be circularly arranged (SMC), but the fibers are more usually organized as interlacing bundles surrounded by connective tissue. Many blood vessels (BV) are seen in the connective tissue.

This is a higher-magnification micrograph of the basal portion of the epithelium (Ep) between connective tissue papillae. Note the regularity and dense packing of the basal epithelial cells. They are the stem cells for the stratified squamous epithe- lium. Daughter cells of these cells migrate toward the surface and begin to accumulate glycogen and become less regularly arranged as they move toward the surface. The highly cellular connective (CT) tissue immediately beneath the basal layer (B) of the epithelium typically contains many lymphocytes (L). The number of lymphocytes varies with the stage of the ovarian cycle. Lymphocytes invade the epithelium around the time of menstruation and appear along with the epithelial cells in vaginal smears. Muscularis, vagina, human, H&E ×125. This higher-magnification micrograph of the smooth muscle of the vaginal wall emphasizes the irregularity of the arrange- ment of the muscle bundles. At the right edge of the figure is a bundle of smooth muscle cut in a longitudinal section (SML). Adjacent to this is a bundle of smooth muscle cut in cross section (SMC). This bundle abuts on a longitudinally sectioned lymphatic vessel (LV). To the left of the lymphatic vessel is another longitudinal bundle of smooth muscle (SML). A valve (Va) is seen in the lymphatic vessel. A small vein (V) is present in the circular smooth muscle close to the lymphatic. \u0003 PLATE 101 Vagina The vagina is the fibromuscular tube of the female reproductive tract that leads to the exterior of the body. The wall of the vagina consists of three layers: a mucosa, a muscularis, and an adventitia. The epithelium of the mucosa is nonkeratinized stratified squamous. It undergoes changes that correspond to the ovarian cycle. The amount of glycogen stored in the epithelial cells increases under the influence of estrogen, whereas the rate of desquamation increases under the influence of progesterone. The glycogen liberated from the desquamated cells is fermented by lactobacilli vaginalis, producing lactic acid that acidifies the vaginal surface and inhibits colonization by yeasts and potentially harmful bacteria. The vagina has certain histologic similarities to the proximal portion of the alimentary canal but is distinguished by the following features: The epithelium does not keratinize, and except for the deepest layers, the cells appear to be empty in routine H&E sections; the mucosa contains neither glands nor a muscularis mucosae; the muscle is smooth and not well ordered. This should be contrasted with the oral cavity, pharynx, and upper part of the esophagus in which the muscle is striated. The more distal portion of the esophagus, which contains smooth muscle, can be distinguished easily from the vagina because it has a muscularis mucosae. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 890PLATE 101 •VAGINA 891 SMCSMCSMC BVBVBV SMLSMLSML CTCTCT EpEpEp BBB BBB BVBVBV EpEpEp EpEpEp LLL LLL CTCTCT SMCSMCSMC SMLSMLSML SMLSMLSML VaVaVa LVLVLV VVV 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 891PLATE 102 •MAMMARY GLAND INACTIVE STAGE 892 Mammary gland, inactive stage, human, H&E ×200; inset ×400. Additional details are evident at higher magnification. In distin- guishing between the loose and dense connective tissue, recall that both extracellular and cellular features show differences that are evident in both the figure and the inset. Note the thicker collagenous fibers in the dense connective tissue in contrast to the much thin- ner fibers of the loose connective tissue. The loose connective tissue contains far more cells per unit area and a greater variety of cell types. This figure shows a cluster of lymphocytes (L) and, at still higher magnification (inset), plasma cells (P) and individual lymphocytes (L). Both plasma cells and lym- phocytes are cells with a rounded shape, but plasma cells are larger and show more cytoplasm. In addition, regions of plasma cell cytoplasm display ba- sophilia. Elongate nuclei in spindle-shaped cells belong to fibroblasts. In con- trast, although the cell types in the dense connective tissue may also be diverse, a simple examination of equal areas of loose and dense connective tissue will, by far, show fewer cells in the dense connective tissue. Characteristically, the dense connective tissue contains numerous aggregates of adipocytes (A). The epithelial cells within the resting lobular units are regarded as being chiefly duct elements. Usually, alveoli are not found; their precursors, how- ever, are represented as cellular thickenings of the duct wall. The epithelium of the resting lobule is cuboidal; in addition, myoepithelial cells are present. Reexamination of the inset shows a thickening of the epithelium in one loca- tion, presumably the precursor of an alveolus, and myoepithelial cells (M) at the base of the epithelium. As elsewhere, the myoepithelial cells are on the epithelial side of the basement membrane. During pregnancy, the glands begin to proliferate. This can be thought of as a dual process in which ducts proliferate and alveoli grow from the ducts. Mammary gland, inactive stage, human, H&E ×80. This figure is a section through an inactive gland. The parenchyma is sparse and consists mainly of duct elements. Several ducts (D) are shown in the center of the field. A small lumen can be seen in each. The ducts are surrounded by a loose connective tissue (see CT(L), in figure below, and together, the ducts and surrounding connective tissue constitute a lobule. Two terminal duct lobu- lar units (TDLU) are bracketed in this figure. Beyond the lobular unit, the connective tissue is more dense (CT(D)).

They begin to develop at puberty in the female but do not reach a fully functional state until after pregnancy. The glands also develop in the male at puberty; the development is limited, however, and the glands usually remain in a stabilized state. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 892PLATE 102 •MAMMARY GLAND INACTIVE STAGE 893 AA AA DD CT(D)CT(D) CT(D)CT(D) DD TDLUTDLU A A D CT(D) CT(D) D TDLU TDLUTDLUTDLUPP MM LL P M L LLL AA AA DD DD CT(L)CT(L) A A D D CT(L) 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 893PLATE 103 •MAMMARY GLAND, LATE PROLIFERATIVE ANDLACTATING STAGES 894 Mammary gland, lactating stage, human, methyl green-osmium ×90; inset ×700. The specimen shown here is from a lactating mammary gland. It is similar in appearance to the gland at the late pro- liferative stage but differs mainly to the extent that the alveoli are more uniform in appearance and their lumina are larger. As in the late proliferative stage, several alveoli can be seen merging with one another (asterisks). The use of osmium in this specimen stains the lipid com- ponent of the secretion. The inset reveals the lipid droplets within the ep- ithelial cell cytoplasm as well as lipid that has been secreted into the lumen of the alveolus. The lipid first appears as small droplets within the epithelial cells. These droplets become larger and ultimately are secreted into the alve- olar lumen along with milk proteins. The milk proteins are present in small vacuoles in the apical part of the cell but cannot be seen by light microscopic methods. They are secreted by exocytosis. The lipid droplets, in contrast, are large and surrounded by the apical cell membrane as they are pinched off to enter the lumen; thus it is an apocrine secretion. Several interlobular ducts (D) are evident. One of these ducts reveals a small branch, an ending in- tralobular duct (arrows) joining the interlobular duct. Mammary gland, late proliferative stage, human, H&E ×90; inset ×560. Whereas the development of the duct elements in the mam- mary gland occurs during the early proliferative stage, the development of the alveolar elements becomes conspicuous in the late proliferative stage. This figure shows the terminal duct lobular units (TDLU) at the late proliferative stage. Individual lobular units are separated by narrow dense connective tissue septa (S). The con- nective tissue within the lobular unit is a typical loose connective tissue that is now more cellular, containing mostly plasma cells and lymphocytes. The alveoli are well developed, and many exhibit precipitated secretory product. Each of the alveoli is joined to a duct, although that relationship can be dif- ficult to identify. The epithelium of the intralobular ducts is similar in appearance to the alveolar epithelium. The cells of both components are se- cretory. The alveoli as well as the intralobular ducts consist of a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells subtended by myoepithelial cells. Often, what ap- pear to be several alveoli are seen merging with one another (asterisks). Such profiles represent alveolar units opening into a duct. Interlobular ducts (D) are easy to identify as they are surrounded by dense connective tissue. In one instance, an intralobular duct can be seen emptying into an interlobu- lar duct (arrow). The inset shows the secretory epithelium at a much higher magnification. Note that it is a simple columnar epithelium. The nucleus of a myoepithelial cell (M) is seen at the base of the epithelium. Generally, these cells are difficult to recognize. Also, as noted above, numerous plasma cells (P) and lymphocytes (Ly) are present in the loose connective tissue of the lobule.

Lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrate the loose connective tissue as the glandular tissue develops. As the cells of the glandular portion proliferate by mitotic division, the ducts branch and alveoli begin to develop at their growing ends. Alveolar development becomes most prominent in the later stages of pregnancy, and accumulation of secretory product takes place in the alveoli. At the same time, lymphocytes and plasma cells become prominent in the loose connective tissue of the developing lobules. Myoepithelial cells proliferate between the base of the epithelial cells and the basal lamina in both the alveolar and the ductal portion of the glands. They are most prominent in the larger ducts. Both merocrine and apocrine secretion are involved in the production of milk. The protein component is synthesized, concentrated, and secreted by exocytosis in a manner typical for protein secretion. The lipid component begins as droplets in the cytoplasm that coalesce into large droplets in the apical cytoplasm of the alveolar cells and cause the apical plasma membrane to bulge into the alveolar lumen. The droplets are surrounded by a thin layer of cytoplasm and are enveloped in plasma membrane as they are released. The initial secretion in the first days after birth is called colostrum. This premilk is an alkaline secretion with a higher protein, vitamin A, sodium, and chloride content than milk and a lower lipid, carbohydrate, and potassium content. Considerable amounts of antibodies are contained in colostrum, and these provide the newborn with passive immunity to many antigens. The antibodies are produced by the plasma cells in the stroma of the breast and are carried across the glandular cells in a manner similar to that for secretory IgA in the salivary glands and intestine. A few days after parturition, the secretion of colostrum stops and lipid-rich milk is produced. 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 894PLATE 103 •MAMMARY GLAND, LATE PROLIFERATIVE ANDLACTATING STAGES 895 TDLUTDLUTDLU TDLUTDLUTDLU TDLUTDLUTDLU DDD MMM *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** DD DD D DDDD LyLy PP Ly P SSS SSS 72006_ch23 15/07/10 3:57 PM Page 895 slightly different images from each eye, separates them into layers, and projects them onto the primary visual cortex located in the occipital lobes. Complex neural mechanisms coordinate eye movements, enabling us to perceive depth and distance to achieve a three-dimensional image. Therefore, the way in which we perceive the world around us largely de- pends on impulses processed within the retina and analysis and interpretation of these impulses by the CNS. \u0002 GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE EYE The eye measures approximately 25 mm in diameter. It is sus- pended in the bony orbital socket by six extrinsic muscles that control its movement. A thick layer of adipose tissue partially surrounds and cushions the eye as it moves within the orbit. The extraocular muscles are coordinated so that the eyes move symmetrically around their own central axes. Layers of the Eye The wall of the eye consists of three concentric layers or coats. The eyeball is composed of three structural layers (Fig. 24.1): • The corneoscleral coat, the outer or fibrous layer, in- cludes the sclera, the white portion, and the cornea, the transparent portion.

In many ways, the eye is similar to a digital camera. Like the optical system of a camera, the cornea and lens of the eye capture and automatically focus light. The iris also automatically adjusts the eye to differences in illumination of visual fields. In many aspects, the optical system of the eye is far more elaborate and complex than a camera. For exam- ple, the eye has the ability to track moving objects with coor- dinated eye movements. The eye can also protect, maintain, self-repair, and clean its transparent optical system. The light detector in a digital camera, the charge-coupled device (CCD), consists of closely spaced photodiodes that capture, collect, and convert the light image into a series of electrical impulses. Similarly, the photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye detect light intensity and color (wavelengths of vis- ible light that are reflected by different objects) and encode these parameters into electrical impulses for transmission to the brain via the optic nerve. The retina has other capabilities beyond those of a CCD: It can extract and modify specific impulses from the visual image before sending them to the central nervous system (CNS). Because the eyes are paired, two somewhat different and overlapping images (visual fields) are sent to the brain. The brain can be compared to a computer, which processes the chapter 24 896 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 896 897chapter 24Eye \u0003GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE EYE 897 • The vascular coat, the middle layer, or uvea, includes the choroid and the stroma of the ciliary body and iris. • The retina, the inner layer, includes an outer pigment ep- ithelium, the inner neural retina, and the epithelium of the ciliary body and iris. The neural retina is continuous with the central nervous system through the optic nerve. The corneoscleral coat consists of the transparent cornea and the white opaque sclera. The cornea covers the anterior one-sixth of the eye (Fig. 24.1a). In this windowlike region, the surface of the eye has a prominence or convexity. The cornea is continuous with the sclera (Gr. skleros, hard). The sclera is composed of dense fi- brous connective tissue that provides attachment for the ex- trinsic muscles of the eye. The sclera constitutes the “white” of the eye. In children, it has a slightly blue tint because of its thinness; in elderly people, it is yellowish because of the accumulation of lipofuscin in its stromal cells. The cor- neoscleral coat encloses the inner two layers except where it is penetrated by the optic nerve. The uvea consists principally of the choroid, the vascular layer that provides nutrients to the retina. Blood vessels and melanin pigment give the choroid an in- tense dark brown color. The pigment absorbs scattered and reflected light to minimize glare within the eye. The choroid contains many venous plexuses and layers of capillaries and is firmly attached to the retina (Fig. 24.1b). The anterior rim of the uveal layer continues forward, where it forms the stroma of the ciliary body and iris. The ciliary body is a ringlike thickening that extends in- ward just posterior to the level of the corneoscleral junction. Within the ciliary body is the ciliary muscle, a smooth mus- cle that is responsible for lens accommodation. Contrac- tion of the ciliary muscle changes the shape of the lens, which enables it to bring light rays from different distances to focus on the retina. The iris is a contractile diaphragm that extends over the anterior surface of the lens. It also contains smooth muscle and melanin-containing pigment cells scattered in the con- nective tissue. The pupil is the central circular aperture of the iris. It appears black because one looks through the lens to- ward the heavily pigmented back of the eye. In the process of adaptation, the pupil changes in size to control the amount of light that passes through the lens to reach the retina. The retina consists of two components: The neural retina and pigment epithelium. The retina is a thin, delicate layer (Fig. 24.1c) consisting of two components: • The neural retina is an inner layer that contains light- sensitive receptors and complex neuronal networks. • The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is an outer layer composed of simple cuboidal melanin-containing cells. Externally, the retina rests on the choroid; internally, it is associ- ated with the vitreous body. The neural retina consists largely of photoreceptor cells, called retinal rods and cones, and in- terneurons. Visual information encoded by the rods and cones is sent to the brain via impulses conveyed along the optic nerve. Chambers of the Eye The layers of the eye and the lens serve as boundaries for three chambers within the eye. The chambers of the eye are the following. • The anterior chamber is the space between the cornea and the iris. • The posterior chamber is the space between the poste- rior surface of the iris and the anterior surface of the lens. • The vitreous chamber is the space between the posterior surface of the lens and the neural retina (Fig. 24.2). The cornea, the anterior and posterior chambers, and their contents constitute the anterior segment of the eye. The FIGURE 24.1 • Schematic diagram of the layers of the eye. The wall of the eyeball is organized in three separate concentric layers: (a) an outer supporting layer, the corneoscleral coat (colorless and blue); (b) a middle vascular coat or uvea (pink); and (c) an inner photosensitive layer, the retina (yellow). cornea sclera meningeal coverings ciliary body iris ciliary processes choroid nonvisual part of retina photosensitive part of retina retinal pigment epithelium sclera ab c 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 897 898 vitreous chamber, visual retina, RPE, posterior sclera, and uvea constitute the posterior segment. The refractile media components of the eye alter the light path to focus it on the retina. As light rays pass through the components of the eye, they are refracted. Refraction focuses the light rays on the photorecep- tor cells of the retina. Four transparent components of the eye, called the refractile (or dioptric) media, alter the path of the light rays: • The cornea is the anterior window of the eye. • The aqueous humor is the watery fluid located in the anterior and posterior chambers. • The lens is a transparent, crystalline, biconcave structure suspended from the inner surface of the ciliary body by a ring of radially oriented fibers, the zonule of Zinn. • The vitreous body is composed of a transparent gel sub- stance that fills the vitreous chamber. It acts as a “shock absorber” that protects the fragile retina during rapid eye movement and helps to maintain the shape of the eye. The vitreous body is almost 99% water with soluble pro- teins, hyaluronan, glycoproteins, widely dispersed colla- gen fibrils, and traces of other insoluble proteins. The fluid component of the vitreous body is called the vitre- ous humor. The cornea is the chief refractive element of the eye. It has a refractive index of 1.376 (air has a refractive index of 1.0). The lens is second in importance to the cornea in the refrac- tion of light rays. Because of its elasticity, the shape of the lens can undergo slight changes in response to the tension of the ciliary muscle. These changes are important in accommoda- tion for proper focusing on near objects. The aqueous humor and vitreous body have only minor roles in refraction. How- ever, the aqueous humor plays an important role in providing nutrients to two avascular structures, the lens and cornea. In addition to transmitting light, the vitreous body helps main- tain the position of the lens and helps keep the neural retina in contact with the RPE. Development of the Eye To appreciate the unusual structural and functional relation- ships in the eye, it is helpful to understand how it forms in the embryo. The tissues of the eye are derived from neuroectoderm, surface ectoderm, and mesoderm. By the 22nd day of development, the eyes are evident as shallow grooves—the optic sulci or grooves—in the neural folds at the cranial end of the human embryo. As the neural tube closes, the paired grooves form outpocketings called optic vesicles (Fig. 24.3a). As each optic vesicle grows laterally, the connection to the forebrain becomes constricted into an optic stalk, and the overlying surface ectoderm thickens and forms a lens placode. These events are followed by concomitant in- vagination of the optic vesicles and the lens placodes. The in- vagination of the optic vesicle results in the formation of a double-layered optic cup (Fig. 24.3b). The inner layer becomes the neural retina. The outer layer becomes the RPE. Invagination of the central region of each lens placode re- sults in the formation of the lens vesicles. By the fifth week of development, the lens vesicle loses contact with the surface ectoderm and comes to lie in the mouth of the optic cup. After the lens vesicle detaches from the surface ectoderm, this same site again thickens to form the corneal epithelium. Mes- enchymal cells from the periphery then give rise to the corneal endothelium and the corneal stroma. Grooves containing blood vessels derived from mesenchyme develop along the inferior surface of each optic cup and stalk. Called the choroid ﬁssures, the grooves enable the hyaloid artery to reach the inner chamber of the eye. This artery and its branches supply the inner chamber of the optic cup, lens vesicle, and mesenchyme within the optic cup. The hyaloid vein returns blood from these structures. The distal portions of the hyaloid vessels degenerate, but the proximal portions remain as the cen- tral retinal artery and central retinal vein. By the end of the seventh week, the edges of the choroid fissure fuse, and a round opening, the future pupil, forms over the lens vesicle. FIGURE 24.2 • Schematic diagram illustrating the internal structures of the human eye. The retina consists of photosensitive and nonphotosensitive regions that differ in their function. Note that the photosensitive region of the retina occupies the posterior part of the eye and terminates anteriorly along the ora serrata. The nonphotosensitive region of the retina is located anterior to the ora serrata and lines the inner aspect of the ciliary body and the posterior surface of the iris.

Pigmentation begins at the end of the fifth week. The inner layer undergoes a complex dif- ferentiation into the nine layers of the neural retina. The photoreceptor cells (rods and cones), as well as the bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells and nerve fibers are present by the seventh month. The macular depression begins to de- velop during the eighth month and is not complete until about 6 months after birth. During the third month, growth of the optic cup gives rise to the ciliary body and the future iris, which forms a double row of epithelium in front of the lens. The mesoderm located external to this region becomes the stroma of the ciliary body and iris. Both epithelial layers of the iris become pigmented. In the ciliary body, however, only the outer layer is pigmented. At birth, the iris is light blue in fair-skinned people because pigment is usually not present. The dilator and sphincter pupillary muscles develop during the sixth month as deriva- tives of the neuroectoderm of the outer layer of the optic cup. The embryonic origins of the individual eye structures are summarized in Table 24.1. \u0002 MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THE EYE Corneoscleral Coat The cornea consists of five layers: Three cellular layers and two noncellular layers. The transparent cornea (see Figs. 24.1 and 24.2) is only 0.5 mm thick at its center and about 1 mm thick peripherally. It consists of three cellular layers that are distinct in both FIGURE 24.3 • Schematic drawing illustrating the development of the eye. a.

These layers are separated by two im- portant membranes that appear homogeneous when viewed in the light microscope. Thus, the ﬁve layers of the cornea seen in a transverse section are the following: • Corneal epithelium • Bowman’s membrane (anterior basement membrane) • Corneal stroma • Descemet’s membrane (posterior basement membrane) • Corneal endothelium The corneal epithelium is a nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium. The corneal epithelium (Fig. 24.4) consists of approxi- mately five layers of nonkeratinized cells and measures about 50 \u0002m in average thickness. It is continuous with the con- junctival epithelium that overlies the adjacent sclera. The ep- ithelial cells adhere to neighboring cells via desmosomes that are present on short interdigitating processes. Like other stratified epithelium, such as that of the skin, the cells prolif- erate from a basal layer and become squamous at the surface. The basal cells are low columnar with round, ovoid nuclei; the surface cells acquire a squamous or discoid shape, and their nuclei are flattened and pyknotic (see Fig. 24.4b). As the cells migrate to the surface, the cytoplasmic organelles gradu- ally disappear, indicating a progressive decline in metabolic activity. The corneal epithelium has a remarkable regenerative capacity with a turnover time of approximately 7 days. The actual stem cells for the corneal epithelium reside at the corneoscleral limbus, the junction of the cornea and sclera. The microenvironment of this stem cell niche is im- portant in maintaining the population of stem cells that also act as a “barrier” to conjunctival epithelial cells and normally prevent their migration to the corneal surface. The corneal epithelial stem cells may be partially or totally depleted by disease or extensive injury, resulting in abnormalities of the corneal surface that lead to conjunctivalization of the cornea, which is characterized by vascularization, appear- ance of goblet cells, and an irregular and unstable epithe- lium. These changes cause ocular discomfort and reduced vision. Minor injuries of the corneal surface heal rapidly by inducing stem cell proliferation and migration of cells from the corneoscleral limbus to ﬁll the defect. Numerous free nerve endings in the corneal epithelium provide it with extreme sensitivity to touch. Stimulation of FIGURE 24.4 • Photomicrograph of the cornea. a.

Microvilli present on the surface epithelial cells help retain the tear film over the entire corneal surface. Drying of the corneal surface may cause ulceration. DNA in corneal epithelial cells is protected from UV light damage by nuclear ferritin. Despite constant exposure of the corneal epithelium to UV light, cancer of this epithelium is extremely rare. Unlike the epidermis, which is also exposed to UV light, melanin is not present as a defense mechanism in corneal epithelium. The presence of melanin in the cornea would diminish light transmission. Instead, it has recently been shown that corneal epithelial cell nuclei contain ferritin, an iron-storage pro- tein. Experimental studies with avian corneas have shown that nuclear ferritin protects the DNA in the corneal epithelial cells from free radical damage caused by UV light exposure. Bowman’s membrane is a homogeneous-appearing layer on which the corneal epithelium rests. Bowman’s membrane (anterior basement membrane) is a homogeneous, faintly fibrillar lamina that is approximately 8 \u0002m to 10 \u0002m thick. It lies between the corneal epithelium and the underlying corneal stroma and ends abruptly at the corneoscleral limbus. The collagen fibrils of Bowman’s mem- brane have a diameter of about 18 nm and are randomly ori- ented. Bowman’s membrane imparts some strength to the cornea, but more signiﬁcantly, it acts as a barrier to the spread of infections. It does not regenerate. Therefore, if damaged, an opaque scar forms that may impair vision. In addition, changes in Bowman’s membrane are associated with recurrent corneal erosions. The corneal stroma constitutes 90% of the corneal thickness. The corneal stroma, also called substantia propria, is composed of about 60 thin lamellae. Each lamella consists of parallel bundles of collagen fibrils. Located between lamellae are nearly complete sheets of slender, flattened fibroblasts. The fibrils measure approximately 23 nm in diameter and are as long as 1 cm. The collagen fibrils in each lamella are ar- ranged at approximately right angles to those in the adjacent lamellae (Fig. 24.5). The ground substance contains corneal proteoglycans, which are sulfated glycosaminoglycans— chiefly, keratan sulfate (lumican) and chondroitin sulfate covalently bound to protein (decorin). Lumican regulates normal collagen fibril assembly in the cornea and is critical in the development of a highly organized collagenous matrix. It is believed that the uniform spacing of collagen fibrils and lamellae, as well as the orthogonal array of the lamellae (alternating layers at right angles), is responsible for the trans- parency of the cornea. Proteoglycans (lumican), along with type V collagen, regulate the precise diameter and spacing of the collagen fibrils. Swelling of the cornea after injury to the epithelium or endothelium disrupts this precise array and leads to translucency or opacity of the cornea. Lumican is overexpressed during the wound-healing process following corneal injury. Normally, the cornea contains no blood vessels or pig- ments. During an inﬂammatory response involving the cornea, large numbers of neutrophilic leukocytes and lym- phocytes migrate from blood vessels of the corneoscleral limbus and penetrate the stromal lamellae. Descemet’s membrane is an unusually thick basal lamina. Descemet’s membrane (posterior basement membrane) is the basal lamina of corneal endothelial cells. It is intensely posi- tive to periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) and can be as thick as 10 \u0002m. Descemet’s membrane has a feltlike appearance and consists of an interwoven meshwork of fibers and pores. It separates the corneal endothelium from the adjacent corneal stroma. Unlike Bowman’s membrane, Descemet’s membrane readily regenerates after injury. It is produced continuously but slowly thickens with age. Descemet’s membrane extends peripherally beneath the sclera as a trabecular meshwork forming the pectinate liga- ment. Strands from the pectinate ligament penetrate the cil- iary muscle and sclera and may help to maintain the normal curvature of the cornea by exerting tension on Descemet’s membrane. The corneal endothelium provides for metabolic exchange between the cornea and aqueous humor. The corneal endothelium is a single layer of squamous cells covering the surface of the cornea that faces the anterior cham- ber (see Fig. 24.4). The cells are joined by well-developed zonulae adherentes, relatively leaky zonulae occludentes, and FIGURE 24.5 • Electron micrograph of the corneal stroma. This electron micrograph shows parts of three lamellae and a portion of a corneal fibroblast (CF) between two of the lamellae. Note that the collagen fibrils in adjacent lamellae are oriented at right angles to one another. \u000316,700. CFCFCFCFCF 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 901 902 desmosomes. Virtually all of the metabolic exchanges of the cornea occur across the endothelium. The endothelial cells contain many mitochondria and vesicles and an extensive rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (rER) and Golgi appa- ratus. They demonstrate endocytotic activity and are engaged in active transport. Na \u0004/K \u0004-activated ATPase is located on the lateral plasma membrane. Transparency of the cornea requires precise regulation of the water content of the stroma. Physical or metabolic dam- age to the endothelium leads to rapid corneal swelling and, if the damage is severe, corneal opacity. Restoration of endothelial integrity is usually followed by deturgescence, although corneas can swell beyond their ability for self- repair. Such swelling can result in permanent focal opaci- ties caused by aggregation of collagen ﬁbrils in the swollen cornea. Essential sulfated glycosaminoglycans that nor- mally separate the corneal collagen ﬁbers are extracted from the swollen cornea. Human corneal endothelium has a limited proliferative capacity. Severely damaged endothelium can only be re- paired by transplantation of a donor cornea. Recent studies indicate that the periphery of the cornea represents a regen- erative zone of the corneal endothelial cells. However, soon after corneal transplantation, endothelial cells exhibit con- tact inhibition when exposed to the extracellular matrix of Descemet’s membrane. This ﬁnding that inhibitory factors released by Descemet’s membrane prevent proliferation of endothelial cells has focused some current corneal research on reversal or prevention of this inhibition with exogenous growth factors. The sclera is an opaque layer that consists predominantly of dense connective tissue. The sclera is a thick fibrous layer containing flat collagen bundles that pass in various directions and in planes parallel to its surface. Both the collagen bundles and fibrils that form them are irregular in diameter and arrangement. Inter- spersed between the collagen bundles are fine networks of elastic fibers and a moderate amount of ground sub- stance. Fibroblasts are scattered among these fibers (Plate 107, page 926). The opacity of the sclera, like that of other dense connec- tive tissues, is primarily attributable to the irregularity of its structure. The sclera is pierced by blood vessels, nerves, and the optic nerve (see Fig. 24.2). It is 1 mm thick posteriorly, 0.3 to 0.4 mm thick at its equator, and 0.7 mm thick at the corneoscleral margin or “limbus.” The sclera is divided into three rather ill-defined layers: • The episcleral layer (episclera), the external layer, is the loose connective tissue adjacent to the periorbital fat. • The substantia propria (sclera proper, also called Tenon’s capsule), is the investing fascia of the eye and is composed of a dense network of thick collagen fibers. • The suprachoroid lamina (lamina fusca), the inner as- pect of the sclera, is located adjacent to the choroid and contains thinner collagen fibers and elastic fibers as well as fibroblasts, melanocytes, macrophages, and other connec- tive tissue cells. In addition, the episcleral space (Tenon’s space) is located between the episcleral layer and substantia propria of the sclera. This space and the surrounding periorbital fat allow the eye to rotate freely within the orbit. The tendons of the extraocular muscles attach to the substantia propria of the sclera. The corneoscleral limbus is the transitional zone between the cornea and sclera. At the junction of the cornea and sclera (Fig. 24.6 and Plate 107, page 926), Bowman’s membrane ends abruptly. The overlying epithelium at this site thickens from the 5 cell layers of the cornea to the 10 to 12 cell layers of the conjunc- tiva. The surface of the limbus is composed of two distinct types of epithelial cells: one type constitutes the conjunctival cells and the other corneal epithelial cells. At this junction, the corneal lamellae become less regular as they merge with the oblique bundles of collagen fibers of the sclera. An abrupt transition from the avascular cornea to the well-vascularized sclera also occurs here. The limbus region, specifically, the iridocorneal angle, contains the apparatus for the outflow of aqueous humor (Fig. 24.7). In the stromal layer, endothelium-lined channels called the trabecular meshwork (or spaces of Fontana) merge to form the scleral venous sinus (canal of Schlemm). This sinus encircles the eye (see Figs. 24.6 and 24.7). The aqueous humor is produced by the ciliary pro- cesses that border the lens in the posterior chamber of the eye. The fluid passes from the posterior chamber into the anterior chamber through the valvelike potential opening between the iris and lens. The fluid then passes through the openings in the trabecular meshwork in the limbus region as it continues its course to enter the scleral venous sinus. Collecting vessels in the sclera, called aqueous veins because they convey aqueous humor instead of blood, transport the aqueous humor to (blood) veins located in the sclera. Changes in the iridocorneal angle may lead to blockage in the drainage of aqueous humor causing glaucoma (see Folder 24.1). The iridocorneal angle can be visualized during eye examination using a gonioscope, a specialized optical device that uti- lizes mirrors or prisms to reﬂect the light from the irido- corneal angle into the direction of the observer. In conjunction with a slit lamp or operating microscope, the ophthalmologist can examine this region to monitor various eye conditions associated with glaucoma. Vascular Coat (Uvea) The iris, the most anterior part of the vascular coat, forms a contractile diaphragm in front of the lens. The iris arises from the anterior border of the ciliary body (Fig. 24.7) and is attached to the sclera about 2 mm posterior to the corneoscleral junction. The pupil is the central aper- ture of this thin disc. The iris is pushed slightly forward as it changes in size in response to light intensity. It consists of highly vascularized connective tissue stroma that is covered on its posterior surface by highly pigmented cells, the poste- rior pigment epithelium (Fig. 24.8). The basal lamina of 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 902 903chapter 24Eye \u0003MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THEEYE 903 these cells faces the posterior chamber of the eye. The degree of pigmentation is so great that neither the nucleus nor char- acter of the cytoplasm can be seen in the light microscope. Located beneath this layer is a layer of myoepithelial cells, the anterior pigment myoepithelium. The apical (posterior) portions of these myoepithelial cells are laden with melanin granules, which effectively obscure their boundaries with the adjacent posterior pigment epithelial cells. The basal (ante- rior) portions of myoepithelial cells possess processes contain- ing contractile elements that extend radially and collectively make up the dilator pupillae muscle of the iris. The con- tractile processes are enclosed by a basal lamina that separates them from the adjacent stroma. Constriction of the pupil is produced by smooth muscle cells located in the stroma of the iris near the pupillary mar- gin of the iris. These circumferentially oriented cells collec- tively compose the sphincter pupillae muscle. The anterior surface of the iris reveals numerous ridges and grooves that can be seen in clinical examination with the ophthalmoscope. When this surface is examined in the light microscope, it appears as a discontinuous layer of fibroblasts and melanocytes. The number of melanocytes in the stroma is responsible for variation in eye color. The function of these pigment-containing cells in the iris is to absorb light rays. If there are few melanocytes in the stroma, eye color is derived from light reﬂected from the pigment present in the cells of the posterior surface of the iris, giving it a blue appearance. As the amount of pigment present in the stroma increases, the color changes from blue to shades of greenish blue, gray, and, ﬁnally, brown. The sphincter pupillae is innervated by parasympathetic nerves; the dilator pupillae muscle is under sympathetic nerve control. The size of the pupil is controlled by contraction of the sphincter pupillae and dilator pupillae muscles. The process of adaptation (increasing or decreasing the size of the pupil) ensures that only the appropriate amount of light enters the eye. Two muscles are actively involved in adaptation: • The sphincter pupillae muscle, a circular band of smooth muscle cells (Plate 106, page 924), is innervated by parasympathetic nerves carried in the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) and is responsible for reducing pupillary size in response to bright light.

This photomicrograph of the human eye shows the anterior portion of the ciliary body and parts of the iris and sclera. The inner surface of the ciliary body forms radially arranged, ridge- shaped elevations, the ciliary processes, to which the zonula fibers are anchored. The ciliary body contains the ciliary muscle, connective tissue with blood vessels of the vascular coat, and the ciliary epithelium, which is responsible for the production of aqueous humor. Anterior to the ciliary body, between the iris and the cornea, is the iridocorneal angle. The scleral venous sinus (canal of Schlemm) located in close proximity to this angle drains the aqueous humor to regulate intraocular pressure. \u0003120.

This muscle is innervated by sympathetic nerves from the superior cervical ganglion and is responsible for in- creasing pupillary size in response to dim light. Just before ophthalmoscopic examination, mydriatic agents such as atropine are given as eye drops to cause dilation of the pupil. Acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system (it innervates the sphinc- ter pupillae muscle); the addition of atropine blocks mus- carinic acetylcholine receptors, temporally blocking the action of the sphincter muscle and leaving the pupil wide open and unreactive to light originating from ophthalmoscope. The ciliary body is the thickened anterior portion of the vascular coat and is located between the iris and choroid. The ciliary body extends about 6 mm from the root of the iris posterolaterally to the ora serrata (see Fig. 24.2). As seen from behind, the lateral edge of the ora serrata bears 17 to 34 grooves or crenulations. These grooves mark the anterior limit of both the retina and the choroid. The anterior third of the ciliary body has about 75 radial ridges or ciliary pro- cesses (see Fig. 24.7). The fibers of the zonule arise from the grooves between the ciliary processes. The layers of the ciliary body are similar to those of the iris and consist of a stroma and an epithelium. The stroma is divided into two layers: • An outer layer of smooth muscle, the ciliary muscle, makes up the bulk of the ciliary body. • An inner vascular region extends into the ciliary processes. The epithelial layer covering the internal surface of the ciliary body is a direct continuation of the two layers of the retinal epithelium (see Fig. 24.1). The ciliary muscle is organized into three functional por- tions or groups of smooth muscle fibers. The smooth muscle of the ciliary body has its origin in the scleral spur, a ridgelike projection on the inner surface of the sclera at the corneoscleral junction. The muscle fibers spread 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 904 905chapter 24Eye \u0003MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THEEYE 905 Glaucoma is a clinical condition resulting from increased intraocular pressure over a sustained period of time. It can be caused by excessive secretion of aqueous humor or impedance of the drainage of aqueous humor from the an- terior chamber. The internal tissues of the eye, particularly the retina, are nourished by the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients from the intraocular vessels. Blood flows normally through these vessels (including the capillaries and veins) when the hydrostatic pressure within the vessels exceeds the intraocular pressure. If the drainage of the aqueous humor is impeded, the intraocular pressure increases be- cause the layers of the eye do not allow the wall to expand. This increased pressure interferes with normal retinal nour- ishment and function, causing the retinal nerve fiber layer to atrophy (Fig. F24.1.1). There are two major types of glaucoma: • Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma and the leading cause of blindness among adults. The removal of aqueous humor is obstructed be- cause of reduced flow through the trabecular meshwork of the iridocorneal angle into the scleral venous sinus (canal of Schlemm). • Close-angle glaucoma (acute glaucoma) is much less common and is characterized by a narrowed irido- corneal angle that obstructs inflow of the aqueous humor into the scleral venous sinus. Usually it is associ- ated with a sudden, painful, complete blockage of the scleral venous sinus and can result in permanent blind- ness if not treated promptly. Visual deficits associated with glaucoma include blurring of vision and impaired dark adaptation (symptoms that indicate loss of normal retinal function) and halos around lights (a symptom indicating corneal endothelial damage). If the con- dition is not treated, the retina will be permanently damaged, and blindness will occur. Treatments are directed toward lowering the intraocular pressure by decreasing the rate of production of aqueous humor or eliminating the cause of the obstruction of normal drainage. Recently, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors that specifically inhibit carbonic an- hydrase isoenzyme CA-II, which plays an important role in the production of aqueous humor in humans, are used as the pharmacologic treatment of choice. Dorzolamide and brinzolamide are two carbonic anhydrase inhibitors that are currently available as eyedrops to treat glaucoma. • FOLDER 24.1 Clinical Correlation: Glaucoma FIGURE F24.1.1 • Glaucoma. This image shows a view of the fundus of the left eye in a patient with advanced glaucoma. As a result of the increased intraocular pressure, retinal nerve fibers undergo atrophy and shrink in size. Note a pale optic disc in the center of the image with a less pronounced rim due to atrophy of nerve fibers. Enlargement of the optic nerve cup (central area of the optic disc) is also visible and a characteristic finding for glaucoma. Compare this image to a normal retina in Fig. 24.14. (Courtesy of Dr. Renzo A. Zaldivar.) out in several directions and are classified into three func- tional groups on the basis of their direction and insertion: • The meridional (or longitudinal) portion consists of the outer muscle fibers that pass posteriorly into the stroma of the choroid. These fibers function chiefly in stretching the choroid. It also may help open the iridocorneal angle and facilitate drainage of the aqueous humor. • The radial (or oblique) portion consists of deeper mus- cle fiber bundles that radiate in a fanlike fashion to insert in the ciliary body. Its contraction causes the lens to flatten and thus focus for distant vision. • The circular (or sphincteric) portion consists of inner muscle fiber bundles oriented in a circular pattern that forms a sphincter. It reduces the tension on the lens, causing the lens to accommodate for near vision. Examination of a histologic preparation does not clearly reveal the arrangement of the muscle fibers. Rather, the organizational grouping is based on microdissection techniques. Ciliary processes are ridgelike extensions of the ciliary body from which zonular fibers emerge and extend to the lens. Ciliary processes are thickenings of the inner vascular re- gion of the ciliary body. They are continuous with the vascu- lar layers of the choroid. Scattered macrophages containing melanin pigment granules and elastic fibers are present in these processes (Plate 106, page 924). The processes and the ciliary body are covered by a double layer of columnar epithelial cells, the ciliary epithelium, which was originally 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 905 906 derived from the two layers of the optic cup. The ciliary epithelium has three principal functions: • Secretion of aqueous humor • Participation in the blood–aqueous barrier (part of the blood–ocular barrier • Secretion and anchoring of the zonular ﬁbers that form the suspensory ligament of the lens The inner cell layer of the ciliary epithelium has a basal lam- ina facing the posterior and vitreous chambers. The cells in this layer are nonpigmented. The cell layer that has its basal lamina facing the connective tissue stroma of the ciliary body is heavily pigmented and is directly continuous with the pig- mented epithelial layer of the retina. The double-layered cil- iary epithelium continues over the iris, where it becomes the posterior pigmented epithelium and anterior pigmented my- oepithelium. The zonular fibers extend from the basal lamina of the nonpigmented epithelial cells of the ciliary processes and insert into the lens capsule (the thickened basal lamina of the lens). The cells of the nonpigmented layer have all the charac- teristics of a fluid-transporting epithelium, including com- plex cell-to-cell junctions with a well-developed zonular occludens, extensive lateral and basal plications, and local- ization of Na\u0004/K\u0004-ATPase in the lateral plasma mem- brane. In addition, they have an elaborate rER and Golgi complex consistent with their role in secreting the zonular fibers. The cells of the pigmented layer have a less devel- oped junctional zone and often exhibit large, irregular lat- eral intercellular spaces. Both desmosomes and gap junctions hold together the apical surfaces of the two cell layers, creating discontinuous “luminal” spaces called ciliary channels. The aqueous humor is similar in ionic composition to plasma but contains less than 0.1% protein (compared with 7% protein in plasma). The aqueous humor passes from the ciliary body toward the lens, and then between the iris and lens, before it reaches the anterior chamber of the eye (see Fig. 24.6). In the anterior chamber of the eye, the aqueous humor passes laterally to the angle formed between the cornea and iris. Here it penetrates the tissues of the limbus as it enters the labyrinthine spaces of trabecular meshwork and finally reaches the canal of Schlemm, which communicates with the veins of the sclera (see Folder 24.1). The choroid is the portion of the vascular coat that lies deep to the retina. The choroid is a dark brown vascular sheet only 0.25 mm thick posteriorly and 0.1 mm thick anteriorly. It lies between the sclera and retina (see Fig. 24.1). Two layers can be identified in the choroid: • The choriocapillary layer, an inner vascular layer • Bruch’s membrane, a thin, amorphous hyaline membrane bbbbb lenslenslenslenslens stromal melanocytes stromal melanocytes stromal melanocytes stromal melanocytes stromal melanocytes connective tissue connective tissue connective tissue connective tissue connective tissue smooth muscle smooth muscle smooth muscle smooth muscle smooth muscle anterior pigment epithelium anterior pigment epithelium anterior pigment epithelium anterior pigment epithelium anterior pigment epithelium posterior pigment epithelium posterior pigment epithelium posterior pigment epithelium posterior pigment epithelium posterior pigment epithelium pupillary margin basal lamina sphincter pupillae muscle pigment-laden macrophage dilator pupillae muscle myoepithelial cells epithelial cells ridges and grooves fibroblasts melanocyte fibroblasts and melanocytes a loose connective tissue FIGURE 24.8 • Structure of the iris. a. This schematic diagram shows the layers of the iris. Note that the pigmented epithelial cells are reflected as occurs at the pupillary margin of the iris. The two layers of pigmented epithelial cells are in contact with the dilator pupillae muscle. The incomplete layer of fibroblasts and stromal melanocytes is indicated on the anterior surface of the iris. b. Photomicrograph of the iris showing the histologic features of this structure. The lens, which lies posterior to the iris, is included for orientation. The iris is composed of a connective tissue stroma covered on its posterior surface by the posterior pigment epithelium. The basal lamina (not visible) faces the posterior chamber of the eye. Because of intense pigmentation, the histologic features of these cells are not discernible. Just anterior to these cells is the anterior pigment myoepithelium layer (the dashed line separates the two layers). Note that the posterior portion of the myoepithelial cells contains melanin, whereas the anterior portion contains contractile elements forming the dilator pupillae muscle of the iris. The sphincter pupillae muscle is evident in the stroma. The color of the iris depends on the number of stromal melanocytes scattered throughout the connective tissue stroma. At the bottom, note the presence of the lens. \u0003570. 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 906 The choroid is attached firmly to the sclera at the margin of the optic nerve. A potential space, the perichoroidal space (between the sclera and retina), is traversed by thin, ribbon- like, branching lamellae or strands that pass from the sclera to the choroid. These lamellae originate from the suprachoroid lamina (lamina fusca) and consist of large, flat melanocytes scattered between connective tissue elements including colla- gen and elastic fibers, fibroblasts, macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and mast cells. The lamellae pass inward to sur- round the vessels in the remainder of the choroid layer. Free smooth muscle cells, not associated with blood vessels, are present in this tissue. Lymphatic channels called epichoroid lymph spaces, long and short posterior ciliary vessels, and nerves on their way to the front of the eye are also present in the suprachoroid lamina. Most of the blood vessels decrease in size as they approach the retina. The largest vessels continue forward beyond the ora serrata into the ciliary body. These vessels can be seen with an ophthalmoscope. The large vessels are mostly veins that course in whorls before passing obliquely through the sclera as vortex veins. The inner layer of vessels, arranged in a single plane, is called the choriocapillary layer. The vessels of this layer provide nutrients to the cells of the retina. The fenestrated capillaries have lumina that are large and irregular in shape. In the region of the fovea, the choriocapillary layer is thicker, and the capillary network is denser. This layer ends at the ora serrata. Bruch’s membrane measures 1 to 4 \u0002m in thickness and lies between the choriocapillary layer and the pigment epithe- lium of the retina. It runs from the optic nerve to the ora ser- rata, where it undergoes modifications before continuing into the ciliary body. Bruch’s membrane is a thin, amorphous re- fractile layer, also called the lamina vitrea. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals its structure as consisting of a multilaminar sheet containing a center layer of elastic and collagen fibers. Five different layers are identified in Bruch’s membrane: • The basal lamina of the endothelial cells of the choriocap- illary layer • A layer of collagen fibers approximately 0.5 \u0002m thick • A layer of elastic fibers approximately 2 \u0002m thick • A second layer of collagen fibers (thus forming a “sandwich” around the intervening elastic tissue layer) • The basal lamina of the retinal epithelial cells At the ora serrata, the collagenous and elastic layers disap- pear into the ciliary stroma, and Bruch’s membrane be- comes continuous with the basal lamina of the RPE of the ciliary body. Retina The retina represents the innermost layer of the eye. The retina, derived from the inner and outer layers of the optic cup, is the innermost of the three concentric layers of the eye (see Fig. 24.1c). It consists of two basic layers: • The neural retina or retina proper is the inner layer that contains the photoreceptor cells. • The RPE is the outer layer that rests on and is firmly at- tached through the Bruch’s membrane to the choriocapil- lary layer of the choroid. A potential space exists between the two layers of the retina. The two layers may be separated mechanically in the prepara- tion of histologic specimens. Separation of the layers, “retinal detachment” (Folder 24.2), also occurs in the living state because of eye disease or trauma. In the neural retina, two regions or portions that differ in function are recognized: • The nonphotosensitive region (nonvisual part), located anterior to the ora serrata, lines the inner aspect of the ciliary body and the posterior surface of the iris (this portion of the retina is described in the sections on the iris and ciliary body). • The photosensitive region (optic part) lines the inner sur- face of the eye posterior to the ora serrata except where it is pierced by the optic nerve (see Fig. 24.1). The site where the optic nerve joins the retina is called the optic disc or optic papilla. Because the optic disc is de- void of photoreceptor cells, it is a blind spot in the visual field. The fovea centralis is a shallow depression located about 2.5 mm lateral to the optic disc. It is the area of greatest visual acuity. The visual axis of the eye passes through the fovea. A yellow-pigmented zone called the macula lutea surrounds the fovea. In relative terms, the fovea is the region of the retina that contains the highest concentration and most precisely ordered arrangement of the visual elements. Layers of the Retina Ten layers of cells and their processes constitute the retina. Before discussing the ten layers of the retina, it is important to identify the types of cells found there. This identifica- tion will aid in understanding the functional relationships of the cells. Studies of the retina in primates have identified at least 15 types of neurons that form at least 38 different types of synapses. For convenience, neurons and support- ing cells can be classified into four groups of cells (Fig. 24.9): • Photoreceptor cells—the retinal rods and cones • Conducting neurons—bipolar neurons and ganglion cells • Association neurons and others—horizontal, centrifu- gal, interplexiform, and amacrine neurons • Supporting (neuroglial) cells—Müller’s cells, microglial cells, and astrocytes The specific arrangement and associations of the nuclei and processes of these cells result in the retina being organized in ten layers that are seen with the light microscope. The ten layers of the retina, from outside inward, are (Figs. 24.9 and 24.10). 1. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)—the outer layer of the retina, actually not part of the neural retina but intimately associated with it 2. Layer of rods and cones—contains the outer and inner segments of photoreceptor cells 907chapter 24Eye \u0003MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THEEYE 907 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 907 908 A potential space exists in the retina as a vestige of the space between the apical surfaces of the two epithelial lay- ers of the optic cup. If this space expands, the neural retina separates from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which remains attached to the choroid layer. This condition is called retinal detachment. As a result of retinal detach- ment, the photoreceptor cells are no longer supplied by nu- trients from the underlying vessels in the choriocapillary plexus of the choroid. Clinical symptoms of retinal detachment include visual sensations commonly described as a “shower of pepper” or floaters. These are caused by red blood cells extravasated from the capillary vessels that have been injured during the retinal tear or detachment. In addition, some individuals describe sudden flashes of light, as well as a “web” or “veil” in front of the eye in conjunction with the onset of floaters. A detached retina can be observed and diagnosed during ophthalmoscopic eye examination (Fig. F24.2.1). If not repositioned quickly, the detached area of the retina will undergo necrosis, resulting in blindness. More commonly, as the vitreous body ages (in the sixth and sev- enth decades of life), it tends to shrink and pull away from the neural retina, which causes single or multiple tears in the neural retina. An argon laser is often used to repair reti- nal detachment by photocoagulating the edges of the de- tachment and producing scar tissue. This method prevents the retina from further detachment and facilitates the repo- sitioning of photoreceptor cells. • FOLDER 24.2 Clinical Correlation: Retinal Detachment fovea area of retinal detachment area of retinal detachment optic disc FIGURE F24.2.1 • Retinal detachment. This image shows a view of the fundus of the right eye in a patient with retinal detachment. The central retinal vessels emerging from the optic disc are in focus, but in the area of the retinal detachment they appear to be out of focus. This is due to the fact that the area of retinal detachment is elevated (note multiple ridges and shadows) and is located anterior to the plane of focus of the ophtalmoscope.

Inner limiting membrane—composed of the basal lamina of Müller’s cells Each of the layers is more fully described in the following sec- tions (see corresponding numbers). The cells of the RPE (layer 1) have extensions that sur- round the processes of the rods and cones. The RPE is a single layer of cuboidal cells about 14 \u0002m wide and 10 to 14 \u0002m tall. The cells rest on Bruch’s membrane of the choroid layer. The pigment cells are tallest in the fovea and adja- cent regions, which accounts for the darker color of this region. Adjacent RPE cells are connected by a junctional complex consisting of gap junctions and elaborate zonulae occludentes and adherentes. This junctional complex is the site of the blood–retina barrier. The pigment cells have cylindrical sheaths on their apical surface that are associated with, but do not directly contact, the tip of the photoreceptor processes of the adjacent rod and cone cells. Complex cytoplasmic processes project for a short distance between the photoreceptor cells of the rods and cones. Numerous elongated melanin granules, unlike those found elsewhere in the eye, are present in many of these pro- cesses. They aggregate on the side of the cell nearest the rods and cones and are the most prominent feature of the cells. The nucleus with its many convoluted infoldings is located near the basal plasma membrane adjacent to Bruch’s membrane. The cells also contain material phagocytosed from the pro- cesses of the photoreceptor cells in the form of lamellar debris contained in residual bodies or phagosomes.

Al- though the cause of this disease is still unknown, evi- dence suggests both genetic and environmental (UV irradiation, drugs) components. The disease causes loss of central vision, although peripheral vision remains unaffected. Two forms of ARMD are recognized: a dry (at- rophic, nonexudative) form and a wet (exudative, neovas- cular) form. The latter is considered a complication of the first. Dry ARMD is the most common form (90% of all cases) and involves degenerative lesions localized in the area of the macula lutea. The degenerative lesions in- clude a focal thickening of Bruch’s membrane called drusen, atrophy, and depigmentation of RPE, and obliter- ation of capillaries in the underlying choroid layer. These changes lead to deterioration of the overlying photosensi- tive retina, resulting in the formation of blind spots in the visual field (Fig. F24.3.1). Wet ARMD is a complication of dry ARMD caused by neovascularization of blind spots of the retina in the large drusen. These newly formed, thin, fragile vessels frequently leak and produce exudates and hemorrhages in the space just beneath the retina, result- ing in fibrosis and scarring. These changes are responsi- ble for the progressive loss of central vision over a short time. The treatment of wet ARMD includes conventional laser treatment therapy; however, new surgical methods such as macular translocation have been recently introduced. In this procedure, the retina is detached, translocated, and reattached in a new location, away from the choroid neovascular tissue. Conventional laser treat- ment is then applied to destroy pathologic vessels with- out destroying central vision. • FOLDER 24.3 Clinical Correlation: Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD) FIGURE F24.3.1 • Photograph depicting the visual ﬁeld in individuals with age-related macular degeneration. Note that central vision is absent because of the changes in the macula region of the retina. To maximize their remaining vision, individuals with this condition are instructed to use eccentric fixation of their eyes. endoplasmic reticulum (sER) surround the melanin granules and residual bodies that are present in the cytoplasm. The RPE serves several important functions, including the following: • It absorbs light passing through the neural retina to prevent reflection and resultant glare. • It isolates the retinal cells from blood-borne substances. It serves as a major component of the blood–retina barrier via tight junctions between RPE cells. • It participates in restoring photosensitivity to visual pig- ments that were dissociated in response to light. The metabolic apparatus for visual pigment resynthesis is pre- sent in the RPE cells. • It phagocytoses and disposes of membranous discs from the rods and cones of the retinal photoreceptor cells. The rods and cones of the photoreceptor cell (layer 2) extend from the outer layer of the neural retina to the pigment epithelium. The rods and cones are the outer segments of photorecep- tor cells whose nuclei form the outer nuclear layer of the retina (Figs. 24.10 and 24.11). The light that reaches the photoreceptor cells must first pass through all of the internal lay- ers of the neural retina. The rods and cones are arranged in a palisade manner; therefore, in the light microscope, they ap- pear as vertical striations. The retina contains approximately 120 million rods and 7 million cones. The rods are about 2 \u0002m thick and 50 \u0002m long (ranging from about 60 \u0002m at the fovea to 40 \u0002m pe- ripherally). The cones vary in length from 85 \u0002m at the fovea to 25 \u0002m at the periphery of the retina. Functionally, the rods are more sensitive to light and are the receptors used during periods of low light intensity (e.g., at dusk or at night). The rod pigments have a maximum absorp- tion at 496 nm of visual spectrum, and the image provided is one composed of gray tones (a “black and white picture”). In contrast, the cones exist in three classes: L, M, and S (long-, middle-, and short-wavelength sensitive, respectively) that cannot be distinguished morphologically. They are less sensi- tive to low light but more sensitive to red, green, and blue re- gions of the visual spectrum. Each class of cones contains a different visual pigment molecule that is activated by the ab- sorption of light at the blue (420 nm), green (531 nm), and red (588 nm) ranges in the color spectrum. Cones provide a visual image composed of color by mixing the appropriate proportion of red, green, and blue light. 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 909 The specificity of the cones provides a functional basis to explain color blindness. Trichromats, almost 90% of the population, are those people who can mix a given color from impulses generated in all three classes of cones. True color-blind individuals (almost all are male) are dichromats and are believed to have a defect in the red-, green-, or (much less commonly) blue-sensitive cones. They are able to distinguish different colors by matching the impulses generated by any of the two normal classes of cones. In addition, about 6% of the population of trichromats matches colors with an unusual proportion of red and green. These individuals are called anomalous trichromats. Each rod and cone photoreceptor consists of three parts: • The outer segment of the photoreceptor is roughly cylindrical or conical (hence, the descriptive name rod or cone). This portion of the photoreceptor is intimately re- lated to microvilli projecting from the adjacent pigment epithelial cells. • The connecting stalk contains a cilium composed of nine peripheral microtubule doublets extending from a basal body. The connecting stalk appears as the constricted region of the cell that joins the inner to the outer segment. In this region, a thin, tapering process called the calyceal process extends from the distal end of the inner segment to surround the proximal portion of the outer segment (see Fig. 24.11). • The inner segment is divided into an outer ellipsoid and an inner myoid portion. This segment contains a typical complement of organelles associated with a cell that actively synthesize proteins. A prominent Golgi apparatus, rER, and free ribosomes are concentrated in the myoid region. Mito- chondria are most numerous in the ellipsoid region. Micro- tubules are distributed throughout the inner segment. In the outer ellipsoid portion, cross-striated fibrous rootlets may extend from the basal body among the mitochondria. The outer segment is the site of photosensitivity, and the inner segment contains the metabolic machinery that sup- ports the activity of the photoreceptor cells. The outer seg- ment is considered a highly modified cilium because it is joined to the inner segment by a short connecting stalk con- taining a basal body (Fig. 24.12a). With the TEM, 600 to 1,000 regularly spaced horizontal discs are seen in the outer segment (Fig. 24.12).

They are enclosed within the plasma membrane of the outer segment (Fig. 24.12a). The parallel membranes of the discs are about 6 nm thick and are continuous at their ends. The central enclosed space is about 8 nm across. In both rods and cones, the membranous discs are formed from repetitive transverse infolding of the plasma membrane in the region of the outer segment near the cilium. Autoradiographic studies have demonstrated that rods form new discs by infolding of the plasma membrane throughout their life span. Discs are formed in cones in a similar manner but are not replaced on a regular basis. Rod discs lose their continuity with the plasma membrane from which they are derived soon after they are formed. They then pass like a stack of plates, proximally to distally, along the length of the cylindrical portion of the outer segment until they are eventually shed and phagocytosed by the pigment ep- ithelial cells. Thus, each rod disc is a membrane-enclosed com- partment within the cytoplasm. Discs within the cones retain their continuity with the plasma membrane (Fig. 24.12b). Rod cells contain the visual pigment rhodopsin; cone cells contain the visual pigment iodopsin. Rhodopsin (also called visual purple) in rod cells initiates the visual stimulus when it is bleached by light. Rhodopsin is pre- sent in globular form on the outer surface of the lipid bilayer (on the cytoplasmic side) of the membranous discs. In the cone cells, the visual pigment on the membranous discs is the photopig- ment iodopsin. Each cone cell is specialized to respond maximally to one of three colors: red, green, or blue. Both rhodopsin and iodopsin contain a membrane-bound subunit called an opsin and a second component called a chro- mophore. The opsin of rods is scotopsin; the opsins of cones are photopsins. The chromophore of rods is a vitamin A–de- rived carotenoid called retinal. Thus, an adequate intake of vi- tamin A is essential for normal vision. Prolonged dietary deﬁciency of vitamin A leads to the inability to see in dim light (night blindness). The interior of the discs of cones is continuous with the extracellular space. The basic difference in the structure of the rod and cone discs—that is, continuity with the plasma membrane—is correlated with the slightly different means by which the vi- sual pigments are renewed in rods and cones. Newly synthe- sized rhodopsin is incorporated into the membrane of the rod disc as the disc is being formed at the base of the outer segment. It then takes several days for the disc to reach the tip of the outer segment. In contrast, although visual pro- teins are constantly produced in retinal cones, the proteins are incorporated into cone discs located anywhere in the outer segment. Vision is a process by which light striking the retina is converted into electrical impulses that are transmitted to the brain. The impulses produced by light reaching the photoreceptor cells are conveyed to the brain by an elaborate network of nerves. The conversion of the incident light into nerve impulses is called visual processing and involves two basic steps: • Step 1 is a photochemical reaction that occurs in the outer segment of the rod and cone receptors as absorbed light en- ergy causes conformational changes in the chromophores. The activated opsin molecules interact with a G-protein called transducin. Transducin then activates phosphodi- esterase, which breaks down cyclic GMP (cGMP). In the dark, high levels of cGMP in the photoreceptor cells are bound to the cytoplasmic surface of Na \u0004 channels, causing them to stay open. As a result, photoreceptor cells have a low membrane potential. • Step 2 consists of a decrease in the concentration of cGMP within the cytoplasm of the inner segment of the photorecep- tor cells. These changes, which are activated by light energy, decrease the Na \u0004 permeability of the plasma membrane. When fewer cGMP molecules are bound to Na \u0004 channel proteins, the photoreceptor becomes hyperpolarized, result- ing in a decrease of neurotransmitter (glutamate) secretion. This decrease in glutamate secretion is detected by bipolar cells of the retina, which initiate electrical impulses that are conveyed to the brain. In rods, absorbed light energy causes conformational changes in retinal, converting it to retinol. The conversion of retinal to retinol results in its release from scotopsin (a reaction called bleaching). The energy for this process is provided by the mitochondria located in the inner segment.

During normal functioning of the photoreceptor cells, the membranous discs of the outer segment are shed and phago- cytosed by the pigment epithelial cells (Fig. 24.13). It is esti- mated that each of these cells is capable of phagocytosing and disposing of about 7,500 discs per day. The discs are con- stantly turning over, and the production of new discs must equal the rate of disc shedding. Discs are shed from both rods and cones. In rods, after a period of sleep, a burst of disc shedding occurs as light first enters the eye. The time of disc shed- ding in cones is more variable. The shedding of discs in cones also enables the receptors to eliminate superfluous membrane. Although not fully understood, the shedding process in cones also alters the size of the discs so that the conical form is maintained as discs are released from the distal end of the cone. 912 cilium basal body centriole cilium basal body centriole cilium basal body centriole cilium basal body centriole cilium basal body centriole ababababab calyceal process calyceal process calyceal process calyceal process calyceal process FIGURE 24.12 • Electron micrographs of portions of the inner and outer segments of cones and rods. a.

The outer limiting membrane is not a true membrane. It is a row of zonulae adherentes that attaches the apical ends of Müller’s cells (i.e., the end that faces the pigment epithe- lium) to each other and to the rods and cones (see Fig. 24.10). Because Müller’s cells end at the base of the inner segments of the receptors, they mark the location of this layer. Thus, the supporting processes of Müller’s cells, on which the rods and cones rest, are pierced by the inner and outer segments of the photoreceptor cells. This layer is thought to be a metabolic barrier that restricts the passage of large molecules into the inner layers of the retina. The outer nuclear layer (4) contains the nuclei of the reti- nal rods and cones. The region of the rod cytoplasm that contains the nucleus is separated from the inner segment by a tapering process of the cytoplasm. In cones, the nuclei are located close to the outer segments, and no tapering is seen. The cone nuclei stain lightly and are larger and more oval than rod nuclei. Rod nu- clei are surrounded by only a thin rim of cytoplasm. In con- trast, a relatively thick investment of cytoplasm surrounds the cone nuclei (see Fig. 24.11). The outer plexiform layer (5) is formed by the processes of the photoreceptor cells and neurons. The outer plexiform layer is formed by the processes of retinal rods and cones and the processes of horizontal, inter- plexiform, amacrine, and bipolar cells. The processes allow the electrical coupling of photoreceptor cells to these special- ized interneurons via synapses. A thin process extends from the region of the nucleus of each rod or cone to an inner ex- panded portion with several lateral processes. The expanded portion is called a spherule in a rod and a pedicle in a cone. Normally, many photoreceptor cells converge onto one bipolar cell and form interconnecting neural networks. Cones located in the fovea, however, synapse with a single bipolar cell. The fovea is also unique in that the compactness of the inner neural layers of the retina causes the photorecep- tor cells to be oriented obliquely. Horizontal cell dendritic processes synapse with photoreceptor cells throughout the retina and further contribute to the elaborate neuronal con- nections in this layer. The inner nuclear layer (6) consists of the nuclei of horizon- tal, amacrine, bipolar, interplexiform, and Müller’s cells. Müller’s cells form the scaffolding for the entire retina. Their processes invest the other cells of the retina so com- pletely that they fill most of the extracellular space. The basal and apical ends of Müller’s cells form the inner and outer lim- iting membranes, respectively. Microvilli extending from their apical border lie between the photoreceptor cells of the rods and cones. Capillaries from the retinal vessels extend 913chapter 24Eye \u0003MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THEEYE 913 microvillimicrovillimicrovillimicrovillimicrovilli melanin granules melanin granules melanin granules melanin granules melanin granules phagosomesphagosomesphagosomesphagosomesphagosomes RPE RPERPE RPE RPE FIGURE 24.13 • Electron micrograph of the retinal pigment epithelium in association with the outer segments of rods and cones.

The retinal pigment epithelial cells contain numerous mitochondria and phagosomes. The arrow indicates the location of the junctional complex between two adjacent cells. \u000320,000.

The rods and cones carry out their metabolic exchanges with extracellular fluids transported across the blood–retina barrier of the RPE. The four types of conducting cells—bipolar, horizontal, interplexiform, and amacrine—found in this layer have dis- tinct orientations (see Fig. 24.9). • Bipolar cells and their processes extend to both the inner and outer plexiform layer. In the peripheral re- gions of the retina, the axons of bipolar cells pass to the inner plexiform layer where they synapse with several ganglion cells. Through these connections, the bipolar cells establish communication with multiple cells in each layer except in the fovea, where they may synapse only with a single ganglion cell to provide greater visual acu- ity in this region. • Horizontal cells and their processes extend to the outer plexiform layer where they intermingle with processes of bipolar cells. The cells have synaptic connections with rod spherules, cone pedicles, and bipolar cells. This electrical coupling of cells is thought to affect the functional thresh- old between rods and cones and bipolar cells. • Amacrine cells processes pass inward, contributing to a complex interconnection of cells. Their processes branch extensively to provide sites of synaptic connections with axonal endings of bipolar cells and dendrites of ganglion cells. Besides bipolar and ganglion cells, the amacrine cells synapse in the inner plexiform layer with interplexiform and other amacrine cells (see Fig. 24.9). • Interplexiform cells and their processes have synapses in both inner and outer plexiform layers. These cells convey impulses from the inner plexiform to the outer plexiform layer. The inner plexiform layer (7) consists of a complex array of intermingled neuronal cell processes. The inner plexiform layer consists of synaptic connections between axons of the bipolar neurons and dendrites of gan- glion cells. It also contains synapses between intermingling processes of amacrine cells and bipolar neurons, ganglion cells, and interplexiform neurons. The course of these pro- cesses is parallel to the inner limiting membrane, thus giv- ing the appearance of horizontal striations to this layer (see Fig. 24.10). The ganglion cell layer (8) consists of the cell bodies of large multipolar neurons. The cell bodies of large multipolar nerve cells, measuring as much as 30 \u0002m in diameter, constitute the ganglion cell layer. These nerve cells have lightly staining round nuclei with prominent nucleoli and Nissl bodies in their cyto- plasm. An axonal process emerges from the rounded cell body, passes into the nerve fiber layer, and then goes into the optic nerve. The dendrites extend from the opposite end of the cell to ramify in the inner plexiform layer. In the peripheral regions of the retina, a single ganglion cell may synapse with a hundred bipolar cells. In marked contrast, in the macular region surrounding the fovea, the bipolar cells are smaller (some authors refer to them as “midget” bipolar cells), and they tend to make one-to-one connec- tions with ganglion cells. Over most of the retina, the gan- glion cells are only a single layer of cells. At the macula, however, they are piled as many as eight deep, although they are absent over the fovea itself. Scattered among the ganglion cells are small neuroglial cells with densely stain- ing nuclei (see Fig. 24.10). The layer of optic nerve fibers (9) contains axons of the ganglion cells. The axonal processes of the ganglion cells form a flattened layer running parallel to the retinal surface. This layer increases in depth as the axons converge at the optic disc (Fig. 24.14). The axons are thin, nonmyelinated processes measuring as much as 5 \u0002m in diameter (see Fig. 24.10). The retinal vessels, includ- ing the superficial capillary network, are primarily located in this layer. The inner limiting membrane (layer 10) consists of a basal lamina separating the retina from the vitreous body. The inner limiting membrane forms the innermost bound- ary of the retina. It serves as the basal lamina of Müller’s cells (see Fig. 24.10). In younger individuals, reﬂections from the internal limiting membrane produce a retinal sheen that is seen during ophthalmoscopic examination of the eye. Specialized Regions of the Retina The fovea (fovea centralis) appears as a small (1.5 mm in diameter), shallow depression located at the posterior pole of the optical axis of the eye. Its central region, known as the foveola, is about 200 \u0002m in diameter (see Fig.24.14). Ex- cept for the photoreceptor layer, most of the layers of the retina are markedly reduced or absent in this region (see Fig. 24.6). Here the photoreceptor is composed entirely of cones (approximately 4,000) that are longer and more slender and rodlike than they are elsewhere. In this area, the retina is spe- cialized for discrimination of details and color vision. The ratio between cones and ganglion cells is close to 1:1. Retinal vessels are absent in the fovea, allowing light to pass unob- structed into the cone’s outer segment. The adjacent pigment epithelial cells and choriocapillaris are also thickened in this region. The macula lutea is the area surrounding the fovea, ap- proximately 5.5 mm in diameter. It is yellowish because of the presence of yellow pigment (xanthophyll). The macula lutea contains approximately 17,000 cones and gains rods at its periphery. Retinal vessels are also absent in this re- gion. Here the retinal cells and their processes, especially the ganglion cells, are heaped up on the sides of the fovea so that light may pass unimpeded to this most sensitive area of the retina. Vessels of the Retina The central retinal artery and central retinal vein, the vessels that can be seen and assessed with an ophthalmo- scope, pass through the center of the optic nerve to enter the bulb of the eye at the optic disc (see Fig. 24.2 and page 898, 914 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 914 the section on the development of the eye). The central reti- nal artery provides nutrients to the inner retinal layers. The artery branches immediately into upper and lower branches, each of which divides again into nasal and temporal branches (see Fig. 24.14). Veins undergo a similar pattern of branching. The vessels initially lie between the vitreous body and inner limiting membrane. As the vessels pass laterally, they also move deeper within the inner retinal layers. Branches from these vessels form a capillary plexus that reaches the inner nuclear layer and therefore provides nutrients to the inner retinal layers (layers 6–10; see pages 907–908). Nutrients to the remaining layers (layers 1–5) are provided by diffusion from the vascular choriocap- illary layer of the choroid. The branches of the central reti- nal artery do not anastomose and therefore are classiﬁed as anatomic end arteries. Evaluation of the retinal vessels and appearance of the optic disc during the ophthal- moscopy not only provides important information on the state of the eye but also provides early clinical signs of a number of conditions, including elevated intracranial pressure, hypertension, glaucoma, and diabetes. Crystalline Lens The lens is a transparent, avascular, biconvex structure. It is suspended between the edges of the ciliary body by the zonular ﬁbers. The pull of the zonular fibers keeps the lens in a flattened condition. Release of tension causes the lens to fatten or accommodate to bend light rays originating close to the eye so that they focus on the retina. The lens has three principal components (Fig. 24.15): • The lens capsule is a thick basal lamina measuring ap- proximately 10 \u0002m to 20 \u0002m produced by the anterior lens cells. • The Subcapsular epithelium is a cuboidal layer of cells present only on the anterior surface of the lens. • The lens ﬁbers are structures derived from subcapsular epithelial cells. The lens capsule, composed primarily of type IV collagen and proteoglycans, is elastic. It is thickest at the equator where the fibers of the zonule attach to it. Gap junctions connect the cuboidal cells of the subcap- sular epithelium. They have few cytoplasmic organelles and stain faintly. The apical region of the cell is directed toward the internal aspect of the lens and the lens ﬁbers, with which they form junctional complexes. The lens increases in size during normal growth and then continues to produce new lens fibers at an ever-decreasing rate throughout life. The new lens fibers develop from the subcapsular epithelial cells located near the equator (see Fig. 24.15). Cells in this region increase in height and then differentiate into lens fibers. As the lens fibers develop, they become highly elongated and appear as thin, flattened structures. They lose their nuclei and other organelles as they become filled with proteins called crystallins. Mature lens fibers attain a length of 7 to 10 mm, a width of 8 to 10 \u0002m, and a thickness of 2 \u0002m. Near the center of the lens, in the nucleus, the fibers are com- pressed and condensed to such a degree that individual fibers are impossible to recognize. Despite its density and protein content, the lens is normally transparent (see Fig. 24.15). The high density of lens fibers makes it difficult to obtain routine histologic sections of the lens that are free from artifacts. Changes in the lens are associated with aging. With increasing age, the lens gradually loses its elasticity and ability to accommodate. This condition, called presbyopia, usually occurs in the fourth decade of life. It is easily cor- rected by wearing reading glasses or using a magnifying lens. Loss of transparency of the lens or its capsule is also a rel- atively common condition associated with aging. This con- dition, called cataract, may be caused by conformational changes or cross-linking of proteins. The development of a cataract may also be related to disease processes, metabolic or hereditary conditions, trauma, or exposure to a deleteri- ous agent (such as ultraviolet radiation). Cataracts that sig- niﬁcantly impair vision can usually be corrected surgically by removing the lens and replacing it with a plastic lens implanted in the posterior chamber. Vitreous Body The vitreous body is the transparent jellylike substance that fills the vitreous chamber in the posterior segment of the eye. The vitreous body is loosely attached to the surrounding structures, including the inner limiting membrane of the 915chapter 24Eye \u0003MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THEEYE 915 nasaltemporal fovea optic disc macula lutea central retinal vessels fovea optic disc macula lutea central retinal vessels FIGURE 24.14 • Normal view of the fundus in ophthalmoscopic examination of the right eye. The site where the axons converge to form the optic nerve is called the optic disc. Because the optic disc is devoid of photoreceptor cells, it is a blind spot in the visual field. From the center of the optic nerve (clinically called the optic cup), central retinal vessels emerge. The artery divides into upper and lower branches, each of which further divides into nasal and temporal branches (note the nasal and temporal directions on the image). Veins have a similar pattern of tributaries. Approximately 17 degrees or 2.5 times optic disc diameters lateral to the disc, the slightly oval-shaped, blood-vessel-free, and pigmented area represents the macula lutea. The fovea centralis, a shallow depression in the center of the macula lutea, is also visible. (Courtesy of Dr. Renzo A. Zaldivar.) 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 915 retina. The main portion of the vitreous body is a homoge- neous gel containing approximately 99% water (the vitre- ous humor), collagen, glycosaminoglycans (principally hyaluronan), and a small population of cells called hyalo- cytes. These cells are believed to be responsible for synthe- sis of collagen fibrils and glycosaminoglycans. Hyalocytes in routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) preparation are difficult to visualize. Often, they exhibit a well-developed rER and Golgi apparatus. Fibroblasts and tissue macrophages are sometimes seen in the periphery of the vitreous body. The hyaloid canal (or Cloquet’s canal), which is not always visible, runs through the center of the vitreous body from the optic disc to the posterior lens cap- sule. It is the remnant of the pathway of the hyaloid artery of the developing eye. Accessory Structures of the Eye The conjunctiva lines the space between the inner surface of the eyelids and the anterior surface of the eye lateral to the cornea. The conjunctiva is a thin, transparent mucous membrane that extends from the corneoscleral limbus located on the peripheral margin of the cornea across the sclera (bulbar conjunctiva) and covers the internal surface of the eyelids (palpebral conjunctiva). It consists of a stratified columnar epithelium containing numerous goblet cells and rests on a lamina propria composed of loose connective tissue. The goblet cell secretion is a component of the tears that bathe the eye. Conjunctivitis, an inﬂammation of the conjunctiva that is commonly called pinkeye, is characterized by redness, irrita- tion, and watering of the eyes. For more clinical informa- tion, see Folder 24.4. The primary function of the eyelids is to protect the eye. The skin of the eyelids is loose and elastic to accommodate their movement. Within each eyelid is a flexible support, the tarsal plate, consisting of dense fibrous and elastic tissue. Its lower free margin extends to the lid margin, and its supe- rior border serves for the attachment of smooth muscle fibers of the superior tarsal muscle (of Müller). The undersur- face of the tarsal plate is covered by the conjunctiva (Fig. 24.16). The orbicularis oculi muscle, a facial expres- sion muscle, forms a thin oval sheet of circularly oriented skeletal muscle fibers overlying the tarsal plate. In addition, the connective tissue of the eyelid contains tendon fibers of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle that open the eyelid (see Fig. 24.16). In addition to eccrine sweat glands, which discharge their secretions directly onto the skin, the eyelid contains four other major types of glands (see Fig. 24.16): • The tarsal glands (Meibomian glands), long seba- ceous glands embedded in the tarsal plates, appear as ver- tical yellow streaks in the tissue deep in the conjunctiva. 916 forming lens fiber germinal zone lens capsule (basal lamina) subcapsular epithelium lens fiber a bbbb lens capsule (basal lamina) mature lens fibers lens capsule (basal lamina) mature lens fibers lens capsule (basal lamina) mature lens fibers lens capsule (basal lamina) mature lens fibers lens capsule (basal lamina) mature lens fibers forming lens fibersforming lens fibersforming lens fibersforming lens fibersforming lens fibers bbbbb subcapsular epitheliumsubcapsular epitheliumsubcapsular epitheliumsubcapsular epitheliumsubcapsular epithelium FIGURE 24.15 • Structure of the lens. a.

The sebaceous se- cretion of the tarsal glands produces an oily layer on the surface of the tear film that retards the evaporation of the normal tear layer. Blockage of the tarsal gland secre- tion leads to chalazion (tarsal gland lipogranuloma), an inflammation of the tarsal gland. It presents as a painless cyst usually on the upper eyelid that disappears after a few months without any therapeutic intervention. • Sebaceous glands of eyelashes (glands of Zeis) are small, modified sebaceous glands that are connected with and empty their secretion into the follicles of the eyelashes. Bacterial infection of these sebaceous glands causes a stye (also called hordeolum), a painful tenderness and redness of the affected area of the eyelid. • Apocrine glands of eyelashes (glands of Moll) are small sweat glands with unbranched sinuous tubules that begin as a simple spiral. • Accessory lacrimal glands are compound serous tubu- loalveolar glands that have distended lumina. They are located on the inner surface of the upper eyelids (glands of Wolfring) and in the fornix of the lacrimal sac (glands of Krause). All glands of the human eyelid are innervated by neurons of the autonomic nervous system, and their secretion is synchro- nized with the lacrimal glands by a common neurotransmit- ter, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). The eyelashes emerge from the most anterior edge of the lid margin, in front of the openings of the Meibomian glands. The lashes are short, stiff, curved hairs and may occur in dou- ble or triple rows. The lashes on the same eyelid margin may have different lengths and diameters. The lacrimal gland produces tears that moisten the cornea and pass to the nasolacrimal duct. Tears are produced by the lacrimal glands and to a lesser degree by the accessory lacrimal glands. The lacrimal gland is 917chapter 24Eye \u0003MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THEEYE 917 Conjunctivitis otherwise known as pinkeye, is an inflam- mation of the conjunctiva. It may be localized in either the palpebral conjunctiva or bulbar conjunctiva. Individuals may present with relatively nonspecific symptoms and signs that include redness, irritation, and watery discharge from the eye (Fig. F24.4.1). The symptoms can also mimic a foreign body sensation. Extended use of contact lenses can cause an allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis and may be the first sign of more serious ocular disease (i.e., corneal ulcer). In general, symptoms that last less than 4 weeks are classified as acute conjunctivitis, and those extending for a longer period are referred to as chronic conjunctivitis. Acute conjunctivitis is most commonly caused by bac- teria; a variety of viruses including HIV, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV); or allergic reac- tions. Bacterial conjunctivitis often shows an opaque puru- lent discharge containing white cells and desquamated epithelial cells. On eye examination, the purulent discharge and conjunctival papillae help to differentiate between bac- terial and viral etiology. Viral conjunctivitis is most common in adults. Clinically, it presents as a diffuse pinkness of the conjunctiva with particularly numerous lymphoid follicles on the palpebral conjunctiva, often accompanied by en- larged preauricular lymph nodes. Viral conjunctivitis is very contagious and usually associated with a recent upper res- piratory infection. Patients need to be advised to avoid touching their eyes, to wash their hands frequently, and to avoid sharing towels and washcloths. Bacterial conjunctivitis is usually treated with antibiotic eye drops or ointments. For viral etiology, no antimicrobials therapy is needed. However, conservative management with artificial tears to keep the eye lubricated may relieve symptoms. Although there is no cure for viral conjunctivitis, symp- tomatic relief may be achieved with warm compresses and artificial tears. For the worst cases, topical corticos- teroid drops may be prescribed to reduce the discomfort of inflammation. However, prolonged use of corticos- teroid drops increases the risk of side effects. Antibiotic drops may also be used for treatment of complementary infections. Viral conjunctivitis usually resolves within 3 weeks. However, in worst cases it may take more than a month. • FOLDER 24.4 Clinical Correlation: Conjunctivitis FIGURE F24.4.1 • Conjunctivitis. This photograph of the lower part of the eyeball with reflected lower eyelid shows an infected conjunctiva.

The lacrimal gland consists of several separate lobules of tubuloacinar serous glands. The acini have large lumina lined with columnar cells. Myoepithelial cells, located below the epithelial cells within the basal lam- ina, aid in the release of tears. Approximately 12 ducts drain from the lacrimal gland into the reflection of conjunctiva just beneath the upper eyelid, known as the fornix of the lacrimal sac. Tears drain from the eye through lacrimal puncta, the small openings of the lacrimal canaliculi, located at the medial angle. The upper and lower canaliculi join to form the common canaliculus, which opens into the lacrimal sac. The sac is continuous with the nasolacrimal duct, which opens into the nasal cavity below the inferior turbinate. A pseudostratified ciliated epithelium lines the lacrimal sac and the nasolacrimal duct. Dacryocystitis is an inﬂammation of the lacrimal sac that is frequently caused by an obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct. It can be acute, chronic, or congenital. It usually affects older individuals and is most often secondary to stenosis of the lacrimal canaliculi. Tears protect the corneal epithelium and contain antibac- terial and UV-protective agents. Tears keep the conjunctiva and corneal epithelium moist and wash foreign material from the eye as they flow across the corneal surface toward the medial angle of the eye (see Fig. 24.17). The thin film of tears covering the corneal surface is not homogeneous but a mixture of products secreted by the lacrimal glands, the accessory lacrimal glands, the goblet cells of the conjunctiva, and the tarsal glands of the eyelid. The tear film contains proteins (tear albumins, lactoferrin), enzymes (lysozyme), lipids, metabolites, electrolytes, and drugs, the latter secreted dur- ing therapy. The tear cationic protein lactoferrin increases the activity of various antimicrobial agents such as lysozyme. 918 orbicularis oculi muscle orbicularis oculi muscle orbicularis oculi muscle orbicularis oculi muscle orbicularis oculi muscle epidermis palpebral conjunctiva tarsal (Meibomian) glands duct of tarsal glands apocrine glands of eyelids (of Moll) sebaceous glands of eyelashes (of Zeis) eyelash b accessory lacrimal glands (of Wolfring) tarsal muscle orbital palpebral lacrimal gland accessory lacrimal gland (of Krause) fornix of lacrimal sac bulbar conjunctiva lacrimal sac palpebral conjunctiva aprocrine glands of eyelids (of Moll) sebaceous glands of eyelashes (of Zeis) tarsal (Meibomian) gland tarsal plate a orbicularis oculi muscle FIGURE 24.16 • Structure of the eyelid. a.

Six muscles of the eyeball (also called extraocular or ex- trinsic muscles) attach to each eye. These are the medial, lateral, superior, and inferior rectus muscles and the supe- rior and inferior oblique muscles. The superior oblique muscle is innervated by the trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV). The lateral rectus muscle is innervated by the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI). All of the remaining extraocular muscles are innervated by the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). The combined, precisely controlled action of these muscles allows vertical, lateral, and rotational move- ment of the eye. Normally, the actions of the muscles of both eyes are coordinated so that the eyes move in parallel (called conjugate gaze). 919chapter 24Eye \u0003MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THEEYE 919 lacrimal gland secretory ducts superior canaliculus common canaliculus lacrimal sac inferior canaliculus nasolacrimal duct inferior nasal concha inferior nasal meatus nasal cavity lacrimal punctum FIGURE 24.17 • Schematic diagram of the eye and lacrimal apparatus.

Sobotta. The innermost layer is the retina (R), which consists of several layers of cells. Among these are receptor cells (rods and cones), neurons (e.g., bipolar and ganglion cells), supporting cells, and a pigment epithelium (see Plate 105). The receptor components of the retina are situated in the posterior three fifths of the eyeball. At the anterior boundary of the receptor layer, the ora serrata (OS ), the retina becomes re- duced in thickness, and nonreceptor components of the retina continue for- ward to cover the posterior or inner surface of the ciliary body (CB) and the iris (I). This anterior nonreceptor extension of the inner layer is highly pigmented, and the pigment (melanin) is evident as the black inner border of these structures. The uvea, the middle layer of the eyeball, consists of the choroid, the ciliary body, and the iris. The choroid is a vascular layer; it is relatively thin and difficult to distinguish in the accompanying figure except by location. On this basis, the choroid (Ch) is identified as being just external to the pig- mented layer of the retina. It is also highly pigmented; the choroidal pigment is evident as a discrete layer in several parts of the section. Anterior to the ora serrata, the uvea is thickened; here, it is called the ciliary body (CB). This contains the ciliary muscle (see Plate 106), which brings about adjustments of the lens to focus light. The ciliary body also contains processes to which the zonular fibers are attached. These fibers function as suspensory ligaments of the lens (L). The iris (I ) is the most anterior component of the uvea and contains a central opening, the pupil. The outermost layer of the eyeball, the ﬁbrous layer, consists of the sclera (S ) and the cornea (C ). Both of these contain collagenous fibers as their main structural element; however, the cornea is transparent, and the sclera is opaque. The extrinsic muscles of the eye insert into the sclera and ef- fect movements of the eyeball. These are not included in the preparation ex- cept for two small pieces of a muscle insertion (arrows) in the lower left and top center of the illustration. Posteriorly, the sclera is pierced by the emerging optic nerve (ON ). A deep depression in the neural retina lateral to the optic nerve (above the ON in this figure) is the fovea centralis (FC ), the thinnest and most sensitive portion of the neural retina. The lens is considered in Plate 107. Just posterior to the lens is the large cavity of the eye, the vitreous cavity (V ), which is filled with a thick jelly- like material, the vitreous humor or body. Anterior to the lens are two addi- tional, fluid-filled chambers of the eye, the anterior chamber (AC ) and the posterior chamber (PC ), separated by the iris.

The wall of the eye consists of three concentric layers or coats: the retina, the inner layer; the uvea, the middle or vascular layer; and the corneosclera, the outer fibrous layer. The eye is often compared to a simple camera with a lens to capture and focus light, a diaphragm to regulate the amount of light, and film to record the image. In the eye, the cornea and lens concentrate and focus light on the retina. The iris, located between the cornea and lens, regulates the size of the pupil through which light enters the eye. Photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) in the retina detect the intensity (rods) and color (cones) of the light that reaches them and encode the various parameters for transmission to the brain via the optic nerve (cranial nerve II). The eye measures 25 mm in diameter. It is suspended in the bony orbit by six extrinsic striated muscles that control its movement. The extraocular muscles are coordinated so that both eyes move synchronously, with each moving symmetrically around its own central axis. A thick layer of adipose tissue partially surrounds and cushions the eye as it moves within the orbit. 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 920PLATE 104•EYE I 921 ONON L C I AC CB OS L PC R ON Ch S OS FCV 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 921 Retina, eye, human, H&E \u0003325. On the basis of structural features that are evident in histologic sections, the retina is divided into ten layers, from posterior to anterior, as listed below and labeled in this figure: 1. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE ), the outermost layer of the retina 2. Layer of rods and cones (R&C ), the photoreceptor layer of the retina 3. External limiting membrane (ELM ), a line formed by the junctional com- plexes of the photoreceptor cells 4. Outer nuclear layer (ONL), containing nuclei of rod and cone cells 5. Outer plexiform layer (OPL), containing neural processes and synapses of rod and cone cells with bipolar, amacrine, interplexiform and horizontal cells 6. Inner nuclear layer (INL), containing nuclei of bipolar, horizontal, inter- plexiform amacrine, and Müller’s cells 7. Inner plexiform layer (IPL), containing processes and synapses of bipo- lar, horizontal, interplexiform amacrine, and ganglion cells 8. Layer of ganglion cells (GC ), containing cell bodies and nuclei of gan- glion cells 9. Nerve fiber layer (NFL), containing axons of ganglion cells 10. Internal limiting membrane (ILM ), consisting of the external (basal) lamina of Müller’s cells This figure also shows the innermost layer of the choroid (Ch), a cell-free membrane, the lamina vitrea (LV ), also called Bruch’s membrane. Electron micrographs reveal that it corresponds to the basement membrane of the pigment epithelium. Immediately external to the lamina vitrea is the capil- lary layer of the choroid (lamina choriocapillaris). These vessels supply the outer part of the retina. Optic disc and nerve, eye, human, H&E \u000365. The site where the optic nerve leaves the eyeball is called the optic disc (OD). It is characteristically marked by a depres- sion, evident here. Receptor cells are not present at the optic disc, and because it is not sensitive to light stimulation, it is sometimes referred to as the blind spot. The fibers that give rise to the optic nerve originate in the retina, more specifically, in the ganglion cell layer (see below). They traverse the sclera through a number of openings (arrows) to form the optic nerve (ON ). The region of the sclera that contains these openings is called the lamina cribrosa (LC) or cribriform plate. The optic nerve contains a central artery and vein (not seen here) that also traverse the lamina cribrosa. Branches of these blood vessels (BV ) supply the inner portion of the retina.

The fibrous cover of the optic nerve is an extension of the meninges of the brain. The neural retina is a multilayered structure consisting of photoreceptors (rods and cones), neurons, some of which are specialized as conducting and associating neurons, and supporting cells (Müller’s cells). External to the neural retina is a layer of simple columnar retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The Müller’s cells are comparable to neuroglia in the rest of the central nervous system. Processes of Müller’s cells ramify virtually through the entire thickness of the retina. The internal limiting membrane is the basal lamina of these cells; the external limiting membrane is actually a line formed by the junctional complexes between processes of these cells and the photoreceptor cells. The neurons of the retina are arranged sequentially in three layers: (1) a deep layer of rods and cones; (2) an intermediate layer of bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cells; and (3) a superficial layer of ganglion cells. Nerve impulses originating in the rods and cones are transmitted to the intermediate layer and then to the ganglion cells. Synaptic connections occur in the outer plexiform layer (between the rods and cones and the intermediate neuronal layer) and the inner plexiform layer (between the intermediate layer and the ganglion cells), resulting in summation and neuronal integration. Finally, the ganglion cells send their axons to the brain as components of the optic nerve.PLATE 105•EYE II: RETINA 922 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 922PLATE 105•EYE II: RETINA 923 LVLV ChCh RPERPE R&CR&C ELMELM ONLONL OPLOPL INLINL IPLIPL GCGC NFLNFL LCLC BVBVBV OD LC ILM NFL GC IPL INL OPL ONL R&C ELM RPE Ch LV ONONON 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 923 Anterior segment, eye, human, H&E \u000345; inset \u000375. A portion of the anterior segment of the eye, shown in this fig- ure, includes parts of the cornea (C ), sclera (S ), iris (I ), ciliary body (CB), anterior chamber (AC ), posterior chamber (PC ), lens (L), and zonular fibers (ZF ). The relationship of the cornea to the sclera is illustrated to advantage here. The junction between the two (arrows) is marked by a change in staining, with the substance of the cornea appearing lighter than that of the sclera. The corneal epithelium (CEp) is continuous with the conjunctival epithelium (CjEp) that covers the sclera. Note that the epithe- lium thickens considerably at the corneoscleral junction and resembles that of the oral mucosa. The conjunctival epithelium is separated from the dense fibrous component of the sclera by a loose vascular connective tissue. Together, this connective tissue and the epithelium constitute the conjunc- tiva (Cj). The epithelial-connective tissue junction of the conjunctiva is irregular; in contrast, the undersurface of the corneal epithelium presents an even profile. Just lateral to the junction of the cornea and sclera is the canal of Schlemm (CS; see also figure below). This canal takes a circular route about the perimeter of the cornea. It communicates with the anterior chamber through a loose trabecular meshwork of tissue, the spaces of Fontana. The canal of Schlemm also communicates with episcleral veins. By means of its communications, the canal of Schlemm provides a route for the fluid in the anterior and posterior chambers to reach the bloodstream. The inset shows the tip of the iris. Note the heavy pigmentation on the posterior surface of the iris, which is covered by the same double-layered ep- ithelium as the ciliary body and ciliary processes. In the ciliary epithelium, the outer layer is pigmented and the inner layer is nonpigmented. In the iris, both layers of the iridial epithelium (IEp) are heavily pigmented. A portion of the iridial constrictor muscle (M ) is seen beneath the epithelium.

These include the cornea and sclera, the iris, the lens, the ciliary body, and the connections between the basal lamina of the ciliary processes and the lens capsule (thick basal lamina of the lens epithelium) that form the suspensory ligament of the lens, the zonular ﬁbers. The posterior chamber is bounded posteriorly by the anterior surface of the lens and anteriorly by the posterior surface of the iris. The ciliary body forms the lateral boundary. Aqueous humor flows through the pupil into the anterior chamber, which occupies the space between the cornea and the iris, and drains into the canal of Schlemm. Anterior segment, eye, human, H&E \u000390; inset \u0003350. Immediately internal to the anterior margin of the sclera (S) is the ciliary body (CB). The inner surface of this forms radially arranged, ridge-shaped elevations, the ciliary processes (CP), to which the zonular fibers (ZF ) are anchored. From the outside in, the components of the ciliary body are the ciliary muscle (CM), the connective tissue (vascular) layer (VL) representing the choroid coat in the ciliary body, the lamina vitrea (LV, inset), and the ciliary epithe- lium (CiEp, inset). The ciliary epithelium consists of two layers (inset), the pigmented layer (PE ) and the nonpigmented layer (npE ). The lamina vitrea is a continuation of the same layer of the choroid; it is the basement mem- brane of the pigmented ciliary epithelial cells. The ciliary muscle is arranged in three patterns. The outer layer is immedi- ately deep to the sclera. These are the meridionally arranged fibers of Brücke. The outermost of these continues more posteriorly into the choroid and is re- ferred to as the tensor muscle of the choroid. The middle layer is the radial group. It radiates from the region of the sclerocorneal junction into the ciliary body. The innermost layer of muscle cells is circularly arranged. These are seen in cross section. The circular artery (CA; barely discernible) and vein (CV) for the iris, also cut in cross section, are just anterior to the circular group of muscle cells.PLATE 106•EYE III: ANTERIOR SEGMENT 924 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 924PLATE 106•EYE III: ANTERIOR SEGMENT 925 VLVL CVCV CACA CMCM CBCB S LVLV CiEpCiEp L L C S CjCj CjEp CEp Cj S C CS AC CB PC I ZF M IEp L L npE PE Ch LV V A CiEp I CSS CB CM CV CA VL ZF CP ZF 72006_ch24 15/07/10 4:00 PM Page 925 Corneoscleral junction and canal of Schlemm, eye, human, H&E \u0003360.

This low-magnification micrograph shows the full thickness of the sclera just lateral to the corneoscleral junction or limbus. To the left of the arrow is sclera; to the right is a small amount of corneal tissue. The conjunctival epithelium (CjEp) is irregular in thickness and rests on a loose vascular connective tissue. Together, this epithelium and underlying connective tissue represents the conjunctiva (Cj). The white opaque appearance of the sclera is due to the irregular dense arrangement of the collagen fibers that make up the stroma (S ). The canal of Schlemm (CS ) is seen at the left close to the inner surface of the sclera. \u0003 PLATE 107 Eye IV: Sclera, Cornea, and Lens The transparent cornea is the primary dioptric (refractive element) of the eye and is covered with nonkeratinized, stratified squamous epithelium. Its stroma consists of alternating lamellae of collagen fibrils and fibroblasts (keratocytes). The fibrils in each lamella are extremely uniform in diameter and uniformly spaced; fibrils in adjacent lamellae are arranged at approximately right angels to each other. This orthogonal array of highly regular fibrils is responsible for the transparency of the cornea. The posterior surface is covered with a single layer of low cuboidal cells, the corneal endothelium, which rest on a thickened basal lamina called Descemet’s membrane. Nearly all of the metabolic exchanges of the avascular cornea occur across the endothelium. Damage to this layer leads to corneal swelling and can produce temporary or permanent loss of transparency. The lens is a transparent, avascular, biconvex epithelial structure suspended by the zonular fibers. Tension on these fibers keeps the lens flattened; reduced tension allows it to fatten or accommodate to bend light rays originating close to the eye to focus them on the retina. Cornea, eye, human, H&E \u0003175. This low-magnification micrograph shows the full thickness of the cornea (C ) and can be compared with the sclera shown in figure on left. The corneal epithelium (CEp) presents a uni- form thickness and the underlying stroma (S ) has a more homogeneous appearance than the stroma of the sclera (the white spaces seen here and in figure on left are artifacts). Nuclei (N ) of the keratocytes of the stroma lie between lamellae. The corneal epithelium rests on a thickened anterior basement membrane called Bowman’s membrane (B). The posterior surface of the cornea is lined by a simple squamous epithelium called the corneal endothelium (CEn); its thick posterior base- ment membrane is called Descemet’s membrane (D).

This micrograph shows a portion of the lens near its equator. The lens consists entirely of epithelial cells surrounded by a homogeneous-appearing lens capsule (LC ) to which the zonula fibers attach. The lens capsule is a very thick basal lam- ina of the epithelial cells. Simple cuboidal lens epithelial cells are present on the anterior surface of the lens, but at the lateral margin they become extremely elongated and form layers that extend toward the center of the lens. These elongated columns of epithelial cytoplasm are referred to as lens ﬁbers (LF ). New cells are produced at the margin of the lens and displace the older cells inwardly. Eventually, the older cells lose their nuclei, as evidenced by the deeper portion of the cornea in this micrograph.

The connective tissue part of the pharyngeal arches produces the ossicles. The malleus and incus develop from the first pharyngeal arch, and the stapes from the second pharyngeal arch. The sen- sory epithelia of the membranous labyrinth that originates from the otic vesicle link with cranial nerve VIII, which is an outgrowth of the central nervous system. The cartilaginous, bony, and muscular structures of the ear develop from the mesenchyme surrounding these early epithelia. \u0002 EXTERNAL EAR The auricle is the external component of the ear that collects and amplifies sound. The auricle (pinna) is the oval appendage that projects from the lateral surface of the head. The characteristic shape of the auricle is determined by an internal supporting structure of elastic cartilage. Thin skin with hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands cover the auricle. The auricle is consid- ered a nearly vestigial structure in humans, compared with its development and role in other animals. However, it is an essential component in sound localization and amplification. The external acoustic meatus conducts sounds to the tympanic membrane. The external acoustic meatus is an air-filled tubular space that follows a slightly S-shaped course for about 25 mm to the tympanic membrane (eardrum).

Each of the three divisions of the ear— the external ear, middle ear, and internal ear—is an essen- tial part of the auditory and vestibular systems (Fig. 25.1). The external and middle ear collect and conduct sound energy to the internal ear, where auditory sensory receptors convert that energy into electrical impulses. The sensory receptors of the vestibular system respond to gravity and movement of the head. They are responsible for the sense of balance and equilibrium and help to coordinate movements of the head and eyes. The ear develops from surface ectoderm and components of the first and second pharyngeal arch. Embryologically, the functions of the ear—hearing and balance—are elaborated from an invagination of surface ec- toderm that appears on each side of the myelencephalon. This invagination forms the otic vesicle (otocyst), which sinks deep to the surface ectoderm into the underlying mes- enchyme (Fig. 25.2). The otic vesicle serves as a primordium for development of the epithelia that line the membranous labyrinth of the internal ear. Later, development of the first and part of the second pharyngeal arch provides structures that augment hearing. The endodermal component of the first pouch gives rise to the tubotympanic recess, which ultimately develops into the auditory tube (Eustachian tube) and the middle ear and its epithelial lining. The chapter 25 928 72006_ch25 15/07/10 4:02 PM Page 928chapter 25Ear \u0003MIDDLE EAR 929 929 is continuous externally with the auricle. The wall of the lat- eral one third of the canal is cartilaginous and is continuous with the elastic cartilage of the auricle. The medial two thirds of the canal is contained within the temporal bone. The lateral part of the canal is lined by skin that contains hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and ceruminous glands but no ec- crine sweat glands. The coiled tubular ceruminous glands closely resemble the apocrine glands found in the axillary region. Their secretion mixes with that of the sebaceous glands and desquamated cells to form cerumen, or earwax. The cerumen lubricates the skin and coats the meatal hairs to impede the entry of foreign particles into the ear. Excessive accumulation of cerumen can plug the meatus, however, resulting in conduc- tive hearing loss. The medial part of the canal located within the temporal bone has thinner skin and fewer hairs and glands. \u0002 MIDDLE EAR The middle ear is an air-filled space that contains three small bones, the ossicles. The middle ear is located in an air-filled space, called the tympanic cavity, within the temporal bone (Fig. 25.3). It is spanned by three small bones, the auditory ossicles, which are connected by two movable joints. The middle ear also contains the auditory tube (Eustachian tube) as well as the muscles that attach to the ossicles. The middle ear is bounded anteriorly by the auditory tube and posteriorly by the spongy bone of the mastoid process, which contains the mastoid antrum and other, smaller air-filled spaces called mastoid cells. Laterally, the middle ear is bounded by the tympanic membrane and medially by the bony wall of the internal ear. The middle ear works as a full-fledged mechanical energy transformer. Its primary function is to convert sound waves (air vibrations) arriving from the external acoustic meatus into mechanical vibrations that are transmitted to the internal ear. Two openings in the medial wall of the middle ear, the oval (vestibular) window and the round (cochlear) window, are essential components in this conversion process. The tympanic membrane separates the external acoustic meatus from the middle ear. The tympanic membrane is in the shape of an irregular cone, the apex of which is located at the umbo that corresponds to the tip of the manubrium of the malleus. During otoscopic ex- amination of the normal ear, tympanic membrane is in a light gray color and a cone of light (light reflex) should reflect off its surface (Fig. 25.4). The malleus is one of three small auditory ossicles residing in the middle ear and the only one that at- taches to the tympanic membrane (see Fig. 25.1). Tympanic membrane forms the medial boundary of the external acoustic meatus and the lateral wall of the middle ear (Fig. 25.5). The layers of the tympanic membrane from outside to inside are • The skin of the external acoustic meatus • A core of radially and circularly arranged collagen fibers • The mucous membrane of the middle ear Sound waves cause the tympanic membrane to vibrate, and these vibrations are transmitted through the ossicular chain of three small bones that link the external ear to the internal ear. temporal bone auditory ossicles semicircular canals bony labyrinth vestibule vestibulocochlear nerve internal ear middle ear external ear internal acoustic meatus cochlea auditory tube tympanic cavity parotid gland tympanic membrane external acoustic meatus auricle FIGURE 25.1 • Three divisions of the ear. The three divisions of the ear are represented by different colors and consist of the exter- nal ear (auricle and external acoustic meatus; pink tone), the middle ear (tympanic cavity, auditory ossicles, tympanic membrane, and auditory tube; green), and the internal ear containing the bony labyrinth (semicircular canals, vestibule, and cochlea; blue) and the membranous labyrinth (not visible). 72006_ch25 15/07/10 4:02 PM Page 929 930 Perforation of the tympanic membrane may cause transient or permanent hearing impairment. The auditory ossicles connect the tympanic membrane to the oval window. The three auditory ossicles, or bones—the malleus, the incus, and the stapes—cross the space of the middle ear in series (Fig. 25.6) and connect the tympanic membrane to the oval window. These bones work like a lever system that in- creases the force transmitted from the vibrating tympanic membrane to the stapes by decreasing the ratio of their oscil- lation amplitudes. The ossicles help to convert sound waves to mechanical (hydraulic) vibrations in tissues and fluid- filled chambers. Movable synovial joints connect the bones, which are named according to their approximate shape: • The malleus (hammer) attaches to the tympanic mem- brane and articulates with the incus. • The incus (anvil), is the largest of the ossicles and links the malleus to the stapes. • The stapes (stirrup), the footplate of which fits into the oval window, acts like a small piston on the cochlear fluid. Diseases that affect the external acoustic meatus, tympanic membrane, or ossicles are responsible for the conductive hearing loss (see Clinical Folders 25.1 and 25.2). Two muscles attach to the ossicles and affect their movement. The tensor tympani muscle lies in a bony canal above the auditory tube; its tendon inserts on the malleus. Contraction of this muscle increases tension on the tympanic membrane. The stapedius muscle lies in a bony eminence on the posterior wall of the middle ear; its tendon inserts on the stapes. Contraction of the stapedius tends to dampen the otic vesicle stapes otic cartilaginous capsule tubotympanic recess tubotympanic recess otic vesicle developing stapes (second arch cartilage) tympanic ring external acoustic meatus auditory tube tympanic cavity tympanic membrane malleus incus otic vesicle petrous part of temporal bone first pharyngeal groove developing malleus and incus (first arch cartilage) round window first pharyngeal pouch (tubotympanic recess) developing external acoustic meatus squamous part of petrous bone a b c d membranous labyrinth FIGURE 25.2 • Schematic drawings showing development of the ear. a. This drawing shows the relationship of the surface ectoderm- derived otic vesicle to the first pharyngeal arch during the fourth week of development. b. The otic vesicle sinks deep into the mes- enchymal tissue and develops into the membranous labyrinth. Note the development of the tubotympanic recess lined by endoderm into the future middle-ear cavity and auditory tube. In addition, accumulation of mesenchyme from the first and second pharyngeal arches gives rise to the auditory ossicles. c. At this later stage of development, the first pharyngeal groove grows toward the develop- ing tubotympanic recess. The auditory ossicles assume a location inside the tympanic cavity. d. This final stage of development shows how the tympanic membrane develops from all three germ layers: surface ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Note that the wall of the otic vesicle develops into the membranous labyrinth. 72006_ch25 15/07/10 4:02 PM Page 930 movement of the stapes at the oval window. The stapedius is only a few millimeters long and is the smallest skeletal muscle. The two muscles of the middle ear are responsible for a protective reflex called the attenuation reﬂex. Contraction of the muscles makes the chain of ossicles more rigid, thus reducing the transmission of vibrations to the internal ear. This reflex protects the internal ear from the damaging effects of very loud sound. The auditory tube connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx. The auditory (Eustachian) tube is a narrow flattened chan- nel approximately 3.5 cm long. This tube is lined with cil- iated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, about one fifth of which is composed of goblet cells. It vents the mid- dle ear, equalizing the pressure of the middle ear with at- mospheric pressure. The walls of the tube are normally pressed together but separate during yawning and swal- lowing.

The endolymph of the membranous labyrinth is similar in composition to intracellular ﬂuid (it has a high K \u0003 concentration and a low Na \u0003 concentration). • The perilymphatic space lies between the wall of the bony labyrinth and the wall of the membranous labyrinth. The perilymph is similar in composition to extracellular ﬂuid (it has a low K\u0003 concentration and a high Na\u0003 concentration). • The cortilymphatic space lies within the organ of Corti. It is a true intercellular space. The cells surrounding the space loosely resemble an absorptive epithelium. The corti- lymphatic space is filled with cortilymph, which has a composition similar to that of extracellular ﬂuid. Structures of the Bony Labyrinth The bony labyrinth consists of three connected spaces within the temporal bone. The three spaces of the bony labyrinth, as illustrated in Figure 25.7, are the: • Semicircular canals • Vestibule • Cochlea 932 tympanic membrane tympanic cavity external acoustic meatus SCE CT SSE FIGURE 25.5 • Cross section through a human tympanic membrane.

A small mass of lymphatic tissue, the tubal tonsil, is often found at the pharyngeal orifice of the au- ditory tube. The mastoid air cells extend from the middle ear into the temporal bone. A system of air cells projects into the mastoid portion of the temporal bone from the middle ear. The epithelial lining of these air cells is continuous with that of the tympanic cavity and rests on periosteum. This continuity allows infections in the middle ear to spread into these cells, causing mas- toiditis. Before the development of antibiotics, repeated episodes of otitis media and mastoiditis usually led to deafness. \u0002 INTERNAL EAR The internal ear consists of two labyrinthine compartments, one contained within the other. The bony labyrinth is a complex system of interconnected cavities and canals in the petrous part of the temporal bone. The membranous labyrinth lies within the bony labyrinth and consists of a complex system of small sacs and tubules that also form a continuous space enclosed within a wall of epithelium and connective tissue. 72006_ch25 15/07/10 4:02 PM Page 932chapter 25Ear \u0003INTERNAL EAR 933 933 malleus incus stapes malleus incus stapes malleus incus stapes malleus incus stapes malleus incus stapes Otosclerosis is one of most common causes of acquired hearing loss. It is reported that about 13% of the U.S. population has nonclinical otosclerosis (histologic oto- sclerosis); however, incidence of clinical disease ranges from 0.5% to 1.0%. Individuals with otosclerosis complain about progressive hearing loss. Symptoms usually become apparent between ages 20 and 45. Otosclerosis is a metabolic bone disease that uniquely affects the temporal bone and ossicles and is characterized by abnormal bone remodeling. The stimulus to initiate bone remodeling in oto- sclerosis is still unknown, but recent studies associate this event with measles virus infection. Mature bone in the area of the oval window on the medial wall of the tympanic cav- ity, which separates the middle ear from the internal ear, is removed by osteoclasts and replaced with much thicker immature (woven) bone. Since the footplate of the stapes normally resides and freely vibrates within the oval window to allow the transmission of sound into the internal ear, the bone remodeling in this area results in fixation of the stapes into the surrounding bone. The cemented (or frozen in place) stapes does not vibrate and prevents sound waves from reaching the perilymphatic fluid space of the internal ear, causing conductive hearing loss. The treatment of otosclerosis includes several options: phar- macologic treatment to suppress bone remodeling with fluorides and bisphosphonates, amplification of sounds with hearing aids, and surgical removal of the stapes (stapedectomy) with subsequent implantation of a pros- thesis between the incus and the oval window. Surgery is usually the most effective method of managing otosclero- sis; more than 90% of patients experience complete elim- ination of conductive hearing loss. • FOLDER 25.1 Clinical Correlation: Otosclerosis The vestibule is the central space that contains the utricle and saccule of the membranous labyrinth. The vestibule is the small oval chamber located in the center of the bony labyrinth. The utricle and saccule of the FIGURE 25.6 • Photograph of the three articulated human auditory ossicles. The three ossicles are the malleus, the incus, and the stapes. \u000230. membranous labyrinth lie in elliptical and spherical recesses, respectively. The semicircular canals extend from the vestibule posteriorly, and the cochlea extends from the vestibule anteriorly. The oval window into which the foot- plate of the stapes inserts lies in the lateral wall of the vestibule. The semicircular canals are tubes within the temporal bone that lie at right angles to each other. Three semicircular canals, each forming about three quarters of a circle, extend from the wall of the vestibule and return to it. The semicircular canals are identified as anterior, posterior, and lateral and lie within the temporal bone at approximately right angles to each other. They occupy three planes in space— sagittal, frontal, and horizontal. The end of each semicircular canal closest to the vestibule is expanded to form the ampulla (Fig. 25.8a). The three canals open into the vestibule through five orifices; the anterior and posterior semicircular canals join at one end to form the common bony limb (see Fig. 25.8a). The cochlea is a cone-shaped helix connected to the vestibule. The lumen of the cochlea, like that of the semicircular canals, is continuous with that of the vestibule. It connects to the vestibule on the side opposite the semicircular canals. Between its base and the apex, the cochlea makes about 2.75 turns around a central core of spongy bone called the modiolus (Plate 108, page 946). A sensory ganglion, the spiral gan- glion, lies in the modiolus. A thin membrane (the secondary tympanic membrane) covers one opening of the canal, the round window on its inferior surface near the base. Structures of the Membranous Labyrinth The membranous labyrinth contains the endolymph and is suspended within the bony labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth consists of a series of com - municating sacs and ducts containing endolymph. It is 72006_ch25 15/07/10 4:02 PM Page 933 suspended within the bony labyrinth (Fig. 25.8b), and the remaining space is filled with perilymph. The membranous labyrinth is composed of two divisions: the cochlear labyrinth and the vestibular labyrinth (Fig. 25.8c). 934 FIGURE 25.7 • Photograph of a cast of the bony labyrinth of the internal ear. The cochlear portion of the bony labyrinth appears blue-green; the vestibule and semicircular canals appear orange-red. (Courtesy of Dr. Merle Lawrence.) Several types of disorders can affect the auditory and vestibular system and result in deafness, dizziness (vertigo), or both. Auditory disorders are classified as either sen- sorineural or conductive. Conductive hearing loss results when sound waves are mechanically impeded from reaching the auditory sensory receptors within the internal ear. This type of hearing loss principally involves the external ear or structures of the middle ear. Conductive hearing loss is the second most common type of loss after sensorineural hear- ing loss, and it usually involves a reduction in sound level or the inability to hear faint sounds. A conductive hearing loss may be caused by otitis media (ear infection); in fact, this is the most common cause of temporary hearing loss in chil- dren. Fluid that collects in the tympanic cavity can also cause significant hearing problems in children. Other com- mon causes of conductive hearing loss include excess wax or foreign bodies in the external acoustic meatus or dis- eases that affect the ossicles in the middle ear (otosclero- sis; see also Folder 25.1). In many cases, conductive hearing loss can be treated either medically or surgically and may not be permanent. Sensorineural hearing impairment may also occur after injury to the auditory sensory hair cells within the inter- nal ear, cochlear division of cranial nerve VIII, nerve path- ways in the CNS, or auditory cortex. Sensorineural hearing loss accounts for about 90% of all hearing loss. It may be congenital or acquired. Causes of acquired sensorineural hearing loss include infections of the membranous labyrinth (e.g., meningitis, chronic otitis media), fractures of the tem- poral bone, acoustic trauma (i.e., prolonged exposure to excessive noise), and administration of certain classes of antibiotics and diuretics. Another example of sensorineural hearing loss often re- sults from aging. Sensorineural hearing loss not only in- volves a reduction in sound level; it also affects the ability to hear clearly or to distinguish speech. A loss of the sensory hair cells or associated nerve fibers begins in the basal turn of the cochlea and progresses apically over time. The char- acteristic impairment is a high-frequency hearing loss termed presbycusis (see presbyopia, page 915). In selected patients, the use of a cochlear implant can partially restore some hearing function. The cochlear implant is an electronic device consisting of an external microphone, amplifier, and speech processor linked to a receiver implanted under the skin of the mastoid region. The receiver is con- nected to the multielectrode intracochlear implant inserted along the wall of the cochlear canal. After considerable train- ing and tuning of the speech processor, the patient’s hearing can be partially restored to various degrees ranging from recognition of critical sounds to the ability to converse. • FOLDER 25.2 Clinical Correlation: Hearing Loss—Vestibular Dysfunction The vestibular labyrinth contains the following: • Three semicircular ducts lie within the semicircular canals and are continuous with the utricle. • The utricle and the saccule, which are contained in recesses in the vestibule, are connected by the membranous utriculosaccular duct. The cochlear labyrinth contains the cochlear duct, which is contained within the cochlea and is continuous with the saccule (see Fig. 25.8b and Fig. 25.8c). Sensory Cells of the Membranous Labyrinth Specialized sensory cells are located in six regions in the membranous labyrinth. Six sensory regions of membranous labyrinth are composed of sensory hair cells and accessory supporting cells. These re- gions project from the wall of the membranous labyrinth into the endolymphatic space in each internal ear (see Fig. 25.7c): • Three cristae ampullaris (ampullary crests) are located in the membranous ampullae of the semicircular ducts. They are sensitive to angular acceleration of the head (i.e., turning the head). • Two maculae, one in the utricle (macula of utricle) and the other in the saccule (macula of saccule), sense the position of the head and its linear movement. • The spiral organ of Corti projects into the endolymph of the cochlear duct. It functions as the sound receptor. 72006_ch25 15/07/10 4:02 PM Page 934 Hair cells are epithelial mechanoreceptors of the vestibular and cochlear labyrinth. The hair cells of the vestibular and cochlear labyrinths function as mechanoelectric transducers; they convert mechanical energy into electrical energy that is then transmit- ted via the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain. The hair cells derive their name from the organized bundle of rigid projec- tions at their apical surface. This surface holds a hair bundle that is formed of rows of stereocilia called sensory hairs. The rows increase in height in one particular direction across the bundle (Fig. 25.9). In the vestibular system, each hair cell pos- sesses a single true cilium called a kinocilium, which is located behind the row of longest stereocilia (Fig. 25.10). In the audi- tory system, the hair cells lose their cilium during development but retain the basal body. The position of the kinocilium (or basal body) behind the longest row of stereocilia defines the po- larity of this asymmetric hair bundle. Therefore, movement of the stereocilia toward the kinocilium is perceived differently than movement in the opposite direction (see below). Stereocilia of hair cells are rigid structures that contain mechanoelectric transducer channel proteins at their distal ends. The stereocilia of hair cells have a molecular structure similar to those described on page 110. Tightly packed actin ﬁlaments cross-linked by ﬁmbrin and espin (actin-bundling proteins) form their internal core structure. The high density of actin fila- ments and the extensive cross-linking pattern imparts rigidity and stiffness to the shaft of the stereocilium. The shaft tapers at its proximal end near the apical surface of the cell, where the core filaments of each stereocilium are anchored within the terminal web (cuticular plate). When stereocilia are deflected, they pivot at their proximal ends like stiff rods (see Fig. 25.10). Transmis- sion electron microscope examination of the distal free end of the stereocilium reveals an electron-dense plaque at the cytoplas- mic site of the plasma membrane. This plaque represents mechanoelectric transducer (MET) channel protein. A fib- rillar cross-link called the tip link connects the tip of the stere- ocilium with the shaft of an adjacent longer stereocilium (see Fig. 25.10). The tip link plays an important role in activating the MET channels at the tip of the stereocilia and opening addi- tional transduction K \u0003 channels at the site of its attachment to the shaft of neighboring stereocilium (see Fig. 25.10). The molecular structures of the transduction K \u0003 channels and tip links are as yet unknown. Individual stereocilia are also con- nected by a variety of fibrillar extracellular cross-links. A mutation that disrupts the gene that produces espin causes cochlear and vestibular symptoms in experimental mice. They lose their hearing early in life; these animals also spend most of their time walking or spinning in circles. The stereocilia of these animals do not maintain the rigidity nec- essary for proper functioning of the MET channels. All hair cells use mechanically gated ion channels to gener- ate action potentials. All hair cells of the internal ear appear to function by moving (pivoting) their rigid stereocilia.

This movement exerts tension on the fibrillar tip links, and the generated force is used to open mechanically gated ion channels near the tip of the stereocilium. This allows for an influx of K \u0003, caus- ing depolarization of the receptor cell. This depolarization results in the opening of voltage-gated Ca 2\u0003 channels in the basolateral surface of the hair cells and the secretion of a neu- rotransmitter that generates an action potential in afferent nerve endings. Movement in the opposite direction (away from the kinocilium) closes the MET channels, causing hyperpolarization of the receptor cell. The means by which stereocilia are deflected varies from receptor to receptor; these are discussed in the sections describing each receptor area. Two types of hair cells are present in the vestibular labyrinth. Both hair cell types are associated with afferent and effer- ent nerve endings (Fig. 25.10). Type I hair cells are flask-shaped, with a rounded base and thin neck, and are surrounded by an afferent nerve chalice and a few efferent nerve fibers. Type II hair cells are cylindrical and have afferent and efferent bouton nerve endings at the base of the cell (see Fig. 25.10). Sensory Receptors of the Membranous Labyrinth Cristae ampullaris are sensors of angular movements of the head. Each ampulla of the semicircular duct contains a crista ampullaris, which is a sensory receptor for angular move- ments of the head (see Figs. 25.8c and 25.11). The crista ampullaris is a thickened transverse epithelial ridge that is oriented perpendicularly to the long axis of the semicircular canal and consists of the epithelial hair cells and supporting cells (Plate 108, page 946). A gelatinous protein–polysaccharide mass, known as the cupula, is attached to the hair cells of each crista (see Fig. 25.11). The cupula projects into the lumen and is sur- rounded by endolymph. During rotational movement of the head, the walls of the semicircular canal and the membra- nous semicircular ducts move, but the endolymph contained within the ducts tends to lag behind because of inertia. The cupula, projecting into the endolymph, is swayed by the 936 SSSSS SSSSS KKKKK KKKKK aa b FIGURE 25.9 • Electron micrographs of the kinocilium and stereocilia of a vestibular sensory hair cell. a.

The type I hair cell has a flask-shaped structure with a rounded base. The base is enclosed in a chalicelike afferent nerve ending that has several synaptic boutons for efferent nerve endings. Note the apical surface specializations of this cell, which include a kinocilium and hair bundle. The apical cytoplasm of hair cells contains basal bodies for the attachment of the kinocilium and a terminal web for the attachment of stereocilia. The type II hair cell is cylindrical and possesses several nerve terminals at its base for both afferent and efferent nerve fibers. The apical surface specializations are identical to those of the type I cell. The molecular organization of the stereocilia is depicted in the enlarged rectangle. The top link connects the lateral plasma membrane of the stereocilium shaft (where K \u0003 transduction channels are located) with the tip of the shorter stereocilium (where the mechanoelectric transduction [MET] channel protein is located). Note that the proximal end of each stereocilium is tapered and its narrow rootlets are anchored within the terminal web (cuticular plate) of the hair cell. Several other fibrillar connectors between neighboring stereocilia are also shown. The sensation of rotation without equilibrium (dizziness, vertigo) signifies dysfunction of the vestibular system. Causes of vertigo include viral infections, certain drugs, and tumors such as acoustic neuroma. Acoustic neuro- mas develop in or near the internal acoustic meatus and exert pressure on the vestibular division of cranial nerve VIII or branches of the labyrinthine artery. Vertigo can also be produced normally in individuals by excessively stimulating the semicircular ducts. Similarly, excessive stimulation of the utricle can produce motion sickness (seasickness, car- sickness, or airsickness) in some individuals. Some diseases of the internal ear affect both hearing and equilibrium. For example, people with Ménière’s syn- drome initially complain of episodes of dizziness and tinni- tus (ringing in the ears) and later develop a low-frequency hearing loss. The causes of Ménière’s syndrome are related to blockage of the cochlear aqueduct, which drains excess endolymph from the membranous labyrinth. Blockage of this duct causes an increase in endolymphatic pressure and distension of the membranous labyrinth (endolymphatic hydrops). • FOLDER 25.3 Clinical Correlation: Vertigo 72006_ch25 15/07/10 4:02 PM Page 937 movement differential between the crista fixed to the wall of the duct and the endolymph. Deflection of the stereocilia in the narrow space between the hair cells and the cupula gen- erates nerve impulses in the associated nerve endings. The maculae of the saccule and utricle are sensors of gravity and linear acceleration. The maculae of the saccule and the utricle are innervated sensory thickenings of the epithelium that face the en- dolymph of the saccule and utricle (see Fig. 25.8c). As in the cristae, each macula consists of type I and type II hair cells, supporting cells, and nerve endings associated with the hair cells. The maculae of the utricle and saccule are oriented at right angles to each another. When a person is standing, the macula of the utricle is in a horizontal plane, and the macula of the saccule is in a vertical plane. The gelatinous polysaccharide material that overlies the mac- ulae is called the otolithic membrane (Fig. 25.12). Its outer surface contains 3-\u0004m to 5-\u0004m crystalline bodies of calcium carbonate and a protein (Fig. 25.13). Otoliths are heavier than the endolymph.

The otolithic membrane moves on the macula in a manner analogous to that by which the cupula moves on the crista. Stereocilia of the hair cells are deflected by gravity in the stationary individual when the otolithic membrane and its otoliths pull on the stereocilia. They are also displaced during linear movement when the individual is moving in a straight line and the otolithic membrane drags on the stereocilia because of inertia. In both cases, movement of the otolithic membrane activates MET channels and depolarizes hair cells. The spiral organ of Corti is the sensor of sound vibrations. The cochlear duct divides the cochlear canal into three par- allel compartments or scalae: • Scala media, the middle compartment in the cochlear canal • Scala vestibuli • Scala tympani The cochlear duct itself is the scala media (Figs. 25.14 and 25.15). The scala vestibuli and scala tympani are the spaces above and below, respectively, the scala media. The scala media is an endolymph-containing space that is continuous with the lumen of the saccule and contains the spiral organ of Corti, which rests on its lower wall (see Fig. 25.15). The scala vestibuli and the scala tympani are perilymph- containing spaces that communicate with each other at the apex of the cochlea through a small channel called the heli- cotrema (see Fig. 25.14). The scala vestibuli begins at the oval window, and the scala tympani ends at the round window. The scala media is a triangular space with its acute angle attached to the modiolus. In transverse section, the scala media appears as a triangu- lar space with its most acute angle attached to a bony exten- sion of the modiolus, the osseous spiral lamina (see Fig. 25.15).

This photomicrograph shows a section of the basal turn of the cochlear canal. The osseous spiral lamina (OSL) and its membranous continuation, the basilar membrane (BM), as well as the vestibular membrane (VM) divide the cochlear canal into three parallel compartments: The scala vestibuli, the cochlear duct (CD), and the scala tympani. Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani are filled with perilymph, whereas the cochlear canal is filled with endolymph. Note the three walls of the cochlear canal, which are formed by the basilar membrane inferiorly, the stria vascularis (SV ) and underlying spiral ligament (SL) laterally, and the vestibular membrane superiorly. The spiral organ of Corti resides on the inferior wall of the cochlear canal. Dendrites of the cochlear nerve (CN) fibers that originate in the spiral ganglion (SG) enter the spiral organ of Corti. The axons of the cochlear nerve form the cochlear part of the vestibulocochlear nerve. \u000265. 72006_ch25 15/07/10 4:02 PM Page 939 separates it from the scala vestibuli, is the vestibular (Reissner’s) membrane (Fig. 25.16). The lateral or outer wall of the scala media is bordered by a unique epithelium, the stria vascularis. It is responsible for production and maintenance of endolymph. The stria vascularis encloses a complex capillary network and contains three types of cells (Fig. 25.17). The marginal cells, primarily involved in K\u0003 transport, line the endolymphatic space of the scala media. Intermediate pigment-containing cells are scattered among capillaries. The basal cells separate stria vascularis from un- derlying spiral ligament. The lower wall or floor of the scala media is formed by a relatively flaccid basilar membrane that increases in width and decreases in stiffness as it coils from the base to apex of the cochlea. The spiral organ of Corti rests on the basilar membrane and is overlain by the tectorial membrane. The spiral organ of Corti is composed of hair cells, phalangeal cells, and pillar cells. The spiral organ of Corti is a complex epithelial layer on the floor of the scala media (Fig. 25.18 and Plate 109, page 948). It is formed by the following: • Inner hair cells (close to the spiral lamina) and outer hair cells (farther from the spiral lamina) • Inner phalangeal (supporting) cells and outer pha- langeal cells • Pillar cells Several other named cell types of unknown function are also present in the spiral organ. The hair cells are arranged in inner and outer rows of cells. The inner hair cells form a single row of cells throughout all 2.75 turns of the cochlear duct. The number of cells forming the width of the continuous row of outer hair cells is variable. Three ranks of hair cells are found in the basal part of the coil (Fig. 25.19). The width of the row gradually increases to five ranks of cells at the apex of the cochlea. The phalangeal and pillar cells provide support for the hair cells. Phalangeal cells are supporting cells for both rows of hair cells. The phalangeal cells associated with the inner hair cells surround the cells completely (Fig. 25.20a). The phalangeal cells associated with the outer hair cells surround only the basal portion of the hair cell completely and send apical processes to- ward the endolymphatic space (Fig. 25.20b). These processes flatten near the apical ends of the hair cells and collectively form a complete plate surrounding each hair cell (Fig. 25.21). 940 mesothelial cellperilymph of scala vestibuli endolymph of scala media epithelial cell FIGURE 25.16 • Transmission electron micrograph of the vestibular (Reissner’s) membrane.

These junctions form the reticular lamina that seals the endolymphatic compartment from the true intercellular spaces of the organ of Corti (Figs. 25.18 and 25.20b). The extra cellular fluid in this intercellular space is cortilymph. Its composition is similar to that of other extracellular fluids and to perilymph. Pillar cells have broad apical and basal surfaces that form plates and a narrowed cytoplasm. The inner pillar cells rest on the tympanic lip of the spiral lamina; the outer pillar cells rest on the basilar membrane. Between them, they form a trian- gular tunnel, the inner spiral tunnel (see Fig. 25.18). The tectorial membrane extends from the spiral limbus over the cells of the spiral organ of Corti. The tectorial membrane is attached medially to the modi- olus. Its lateral free edge projects over and attaches to the organ of Corti by the stereocilia of the hair cells. It is formed from the radially oriented bundles of collagen types II, V, and IX embedded in a dense amorphous ground substance. Glycoproteins unique to the internal ear, called otogelin and tectorin, are associated with the collagen bundles. These proteins are also present in the otolithic membranes overlying the maculae of the utricle and saccule, as well as in the cupu- lae of the cristae in the semicircular canals. Sound Perception As described on page 929, sound waves striking the tympanic membrane are translated into simple mechanical vibrations. The ossicles of the middle ear convey these vibrations to the cochlea. In the internal ear, the vibrations of the ossicles are transformed into waves in the perilymph. Movement of the stapes in the oval window of the vestibule sets up vibrations or traveling waves in the perilymph of the scala vestibuli. The vibrations are transmitted throughchapter 25Ear \u0003INTERNAL EAR 941 941 cochlear duct (scala media) vestibular membrane tectorial membrane Claudius' cells Hensen’s cells (outer border) outer hair cells inner hair cell inner border cell inner phalangeal cell inner/outer pillar cells outer phalangeal cells Böttcher’s cells outer/inner tunnels cochlear nerve internal spiral tunnel tectorial membrane stria vascularis stria vascularis stria vascularis stria vascularis stria vascularis FIGURE 25.18 • Photomicrograph of the vestibular duct and spiral organ of Corti.

Pressure changes in this closed perilymphatic–endolymphatic system are re- flected in movements of the membrane that covers the round window in the base of the cochlea. As a result of sound vibrations entering the internal ear, a traveling wave is set up in the basilar membrane (Fig. 25.22). A sound of specified frequency causes displacement of a rela- tively long segment of the basilar membrane, but the region of maximal displacement is narrow. The point of maximal displacement of the basilar membrane is specified for a given frequency of sound and is the morphologic basis of frequency discrimination. High-frequency sounds cause maximal vibra- tion of the basilar membrane near the base of the cochlea; low-frequency sounds cause maximal displacement nearer the apex. Amplitude discrimination (i.e., perception of sound intensity or loudness) depends on the degree of displacement of the basilar membrane at any given frequency range. Thus, coding acoustic information into nerve impulses depends on the vibratory pattern of the basilar membrane. Movement of the stereocilia of the hair cells in the cochlea initiates neuronal transduction. Hair cells are attached through the phalangeal cells to the basilar membrane, which vibrates during sound reception. The stereocilia of these hair cells are, in turn, attached to the tectorial membrane, which also vibrates. However, the tectorial membrane and the basilar membrane are hinged at different points. Thus, a shearing effect occurs be- tween the basilar membrane (and the cells attached to it) and the tectorial membrane when sound vibrations impinge on the internal ear. Because they are inserted into the tectorial membrane, the stereocilia of the hair cells are the only structures that connect the basilar membrane and its complex epithelial layer to the tectorial membrane. The shearing effect between the basilar membrane and the tectorial membrane deflects the stereocilia and thus the apical portion of the hair cells. This deflection activates MET channels located at the tips of stereocilia and generates action potentials that are conveyed to the brain via the cochlear nerve (cochlear division of the vestibulocochlear nerve, cranial nerve VIII). Innervation of the Internal Ear The vestibular nerve originates from the sensory receptors associated with the vestibular labyrinth. The vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) is a special sensory nerve and is composed of two divisions: A vestibular di- vision called the vestibular nerve and a cochlear division called the cochlear nerve. The vestibular nerve is associated with equilibrium and carries impulses from the sensory receptors located within the vestibular labyrinth. The cochlear nerve is associated with hearing and conveys impulses from the sensory receptors within the cochlear labyrinth (Fig. 25.23). The cell bodies of the bipolar neurons of the vestibular nerve are located in the vestibular ganglion (of Scarpa) in the internal acoustic meatus. Dendritic processes of the vestibular ganglion cells originate in the cristae ampullaris of the three semicircular ducts, the macula of the utricle, and the macula of the saccule. They synapse at the base of the vestibu- lar sensory hair cells, either as a chalice around a type I hair cell or as a bouton associated with a type II hair cell. The axons of the vestibular nerve originate from the vestibular ganglion, enter the brain stem and terminate in four vestibu- lar nuclei. Some secondary neuronal fibers travel to the cere- bellum and to the nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, which innervate the muscles of the eye. The cochlear nerve originates from the sensory receptors of the spiral organ of Corti. Neurons of the cochlear nerve are also bipolar, and their cell bodies are located in the spiral ganglion within the modiolus. Dendritic processes of spiral ganglion cells exit the 942 FIGURE 25.19 • Scanning electron micrograph of the spiral organ of Corti.

About 90% of dendrites orig- inating from the spiral ganglion cells synapse with the inner hair cells; the remaining 10% of dendrites synapse with outer hair cells of the spiral ganglion of Corti. The axons of the spiral ganglion cells form the cochlear nerve, which en- ters the bony cochlea through the modiolus to appear in the internal acoustic meatus (see Fig. 25.23). From the internal acoustic meatus, the cochlear nerve enters the brain stem and terminates in the cochlear nuclei of the medulla.

The cochlear duct is shown here as if straightened. Sound waves are collected and transmitted from the external ear to the middle ear, where they are converted into mechanical vibrations. The mechanical vibrations are then converted at the oval window into fluid vibrations within the internal ear. Fluid vibrations cause displacement of the basilar membrane (traveling wave) on which rest the auditory sensory hair cells. Such displacement leads to stimulation of the hair cells and a discharge of neural impulses from them. Note that high-frequency sounds cause vibrations of the narrow, thick portion of the basilar membrane at the base of the cochlea, whereas low-frequency sounds displace basilar membrane toward the apex of the cochlea near its helicotrema. spiral ganglion cochlear nerve vestibular ganglion (of Scarpa) superior part of vestibular nerve inferior part of vestibular nerve internal acoustic meatus dorsal cochlear nuclei ventral cochlear nuclei facial nerve vestibular nuclei brainstem vestibulocochlear nerve FIGURE 25.23 • Diagram illustrating the innervation of the sensory regions of the membranous labyrinth.

It is interesting that the organ of Corti also receives small amounts of efferent fibers conveying impulses from the brain pass parallel to the afferent nerve fibers of the vestibulo- cochlear nerve (olivocochlear tract, cochlear efferents of Rasmussen). Efferent nerve fibers from the brain stem pass through the vestibular nerve. They synapse either on afferent endings of the inner hair cell or on the basal aspect of an outer hair cell. Efferent fibers are thought to affect control of audi- tory and vestibular input to the central nervous system, pre- sumably by enhancing some afferent signals while suppressing other signals. Damage to the organ of Corti, cochlear nerve, nerve pathways, or auditory cortex is responsible for perma- nent sensorineural hearing loss. Blood Vessels of the Membranous Labyrinth Arterial blood is supplied to the membranous labyrinth by the labyrinthine artery; venous blood drainage is to the venous dural sinuses. The blood supply to the external ear, middle ear, and bony labyrinth of the internal ear is derived from vessels associated with the external carotid arteries. The arterial blood sup- ply to tissues of the membranous labyrinth of the internal ear is derived intracranially from the labyrinthine artery, a common branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar or basilar artery (Fig. 25.24). The labyrinthine artery is a terminal artery: It has no anastomoses with other surrounding arter- ies. Branches of this artery exactly parallel the distribution of the superior and inferior parts of the vestibular nerve. Venous drainage from the cochlear labyrinth is via the posterior and anterior spiral modiolar veins that form the common modiolar vein. The common modiolar vein and the vestibulocochlear vein form the vein of the cochlear aqueduct, which empties into the inferior petrosal sinus. Venous drainage from the vestibular labyrinth is via vestibu- lar veins that join the vein of the cochlear aqueduct and by the vein of vestibular aqueduct, which drains into the sigmoid sinus.chapter 25Ear \u0003INTERNAL EAR 945 945 labyrinthine artery common cochlear anterior vestibular main cochlear cochlear ramus vestibulocochlear posterior vestibular FIGURE 25.24 • Diagram of the arterial supply of the membranous labyrinth of the internal ear.

These are referred to, respectively, as the bony labyrinth and membranous labyrinth. In places, the membranous labyrinth forms the lining of the bony labyrinth; in other places, there is a separation of the two. Within the space lined by the membranous labyrinth is a watery fluid called endolymph. External to the membranous labyrinth, i.e., between the membranous and bony labyrinths, is additional fluid called perilymph. The bony labyrinth is divided into three parts: cochlea, semicircular canals, and vestibule. The cochlea and semicircular canals contain membranous counterparts of the same shape; however, the membranous components of the vestibule are more complex in form, being composed of ducts and two chambers, the utricle and saccule. The cochlea contains the receptors for hearing, i.e., the organ of Corti, the semicircular canals contain the receptors for movement of the head, and the utricle and saccule contain receptors for position of the head.

A higher magnification of one of the semicircular canals and of the crista ampullaris (CA) within the canal seen in the lower right corner of figure above is provided here. The receptor for movement, the crista ampullaris (note its relationships in figure above), is present in each of the semicircular canals. The epithelial (EP) surface of the crista consists of two cell types, sustentacular (supporting) cells and hair (receptor) cells. (Two types of hair cells are distinguished with the electron microscope.) It is difficult to identify the hair and sustentacular cells on the basis of specific characteristics; they can, however, be distinguished on the basis of location (see inset), as the hair cells (HC) are situated in a more superficial location than the sustentacular cells (SC). A gelatinous mass, the cupula (Cu), surmounts the epithelium of the crista ampullaris. Each receptor cell sends a hair-like projection deep into the substance of the cupula. The epithelium rests on a loose, cellular connective tissue (CT ) that also contains the nerve fibers associated with the receptor cells. The nerve fibers are difficult to identify because they are not organized into a discrete bundle. Internal ear, ear, guinea pig, H&E \u000220. In this section through the internal ear, bone surrounds the entire internal ear cavity. Because of its labyrinthine character, sections of the internal ear appear as a number of separate cham- bers and ducts. These, however, are all interconnected (except that the perilymphatic and endolymphatic spaces remain sepa- rate). The largest chamber is the vestibule (V ). The left side of this chamber (black arrow) leads into the cochlea (C). Just below the black arrow and to the right is the oval ligament (OL) surrounding the base of the stapes (S). Both structures have been cut obliquely and are not seen in their entirety. The facial nerve (FN ) is in an osseous tunnel to the left of the oval ligament. The com- munication of the vestibule with one of the semicircular canals is marked by the white arrow. At the upper right are cross sections of the membranous labyrinth passing through components of the semicircular duct system (DS). The cochlea is a spiral structure having the general shape of a cone. The specimen illustrated here makes 3 1⁄2 turns (in humans, there are 23⁄4 turns). The section goes through the central axis of the cochlea. This consists of a bony stem called the modiolus (M). It contains the beginning of the cochlear nerve (CN ) and the spiral ganglion (SG ). Because of the plane of section and the spiral arrangement of the cochlear tunnel, the tunnel is cut crosswise in seven places (note 31⁄2 turns). A more detailed examination of the cochlea and the organ of Corti is provided in Plate 109. 72006_ch25 15/07/10 4:02 PM Page 946PLATE 108 •EAR 947 CTCT M CNCN FNFN C M CN SG DS V OL S CA FN Cu HC SC CT EP Cu CTCTCT 72006_ch25 15/07/10 4:02 PM Page 947PLATE 109 •COCHLEAR CANAL AND ORGAN OF CORTI 948 KEY BM, basilar membrane CB, cells of Böttcher CC, cells of Claudius CD, cochlear duct CH, cells of Hensen CN, cochlear nerve HC, hair cells IBC, inner border cells IPHC, inner phalangeal and hair cells IPC, inner pillar cells IST, internal spiral tunnel IT, inner tunnel LS, limbus spiralis OP, outer phalangeal cells OPC, outer pillar cells OSL, osseous spiral lamina OT, outer tunnel RM, reticular membrane SG, spiral ganglion SL, spiral ligament ST, scala tympani StV, stria vascularis SV, scala vestibuli TM, tectorial membrane VM, vestibular membrane \u0003 PLATE 109 Cochlear Canal and Organ of Corti The hair cell, a nonneuronal mechanoreceptor, is the common receptor cell of the vestibulocochlear system. Hair cells are epithelial cells that possess numerous stereocilia, modified microvilli also called sensory hairs. They convert mechanical energy to electrical energy that is transmitted via the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) to the brain. Hair cells are associated with afferent, as well as efferent, nerve endings. All hair cells have a common basis of receptor cell function that involves bending or flexing of their stereocilia. The specific means by which the stereocilia are bent varies from receptor to receptor, but in each case, stretching of the plasma membrane caused by the bending of the stereocilia generates transmembrane potential changes that are transmitted to the afferent nerve endings associated with each cell. Efferent nerve endings on the hair cells serve to regulate their sensitivity. Organ of Corti, ear, guinea pig, H&E \u0002180; inset \u0002380. The components of the organ of Corti, beginning at the limbus spiralis (LS), are as follows: inner border cells (IBC ); inner pha- langeal and hair cells (IP&HC); inner pillar cells (IPC ); (the se- quence continues, repeating itself in reverse) outer pillar cells (OPC ); hair cells (HC ) and outer phalangeal cells (OP); and outer border cells or cells of Hensen (CH ). Hair cells are receptor cells; the other cells are collectively referred to as supporting cells. The hair and outer phalangeal cells can be distinguished in this figure by their location (see inset) and because their nuclei are well aligned. Because the hair cells rest on the pha- langeal cells, it can be concluded that the upper three nuclei belong to outer hair cells, whereas the lower three nuclei belong to outer phalangeal cells. The supporting cells extend from the basilar membrane (BM) to the surface of the organ of Corti (this is not evident here but can be seen in the inset), where they form a reticular membrane (RM). The free surface of the receptor cells fits into openings in the reticular membrane, and the “hairs” of these cells project toward, and make contact with, the tectorial membrane (TM ). The latter is a cuticular extension from the columnar cells of the limbus spiralis. In ideal preparations, nerve fibers can be traced from the hair cells to the cochlear nerve (CN). In their course from the basilar membrane to the reticular membrane, groups of supporting cells are separated from other groups by spaces that form spiral tunnels. These tunnels are named the inner tunnel (IT ), the outer tunnel (OT ), and the internal spiral tunnel (IST ). Beyond the sup- porting cells are two additional groups of cells, the cells of Claudius (CC) and the cells of Böttcher (CB). Cochlear canal, ear, guinea pig, H&E \u000265; inset \u0002380. A section through one of the turns of the cochlea is shown here. The most important functional component of the cochlea is the organ of Corti, enclosed by the rectangle and shown at higher magnification in figure below. Other struc- tures are included in this figure. The spiral ligament (SL) is a thickening of the periosteum on the outer part of the tunnel. Two mem- branes, the basilar membrane (BM ) and the vestibular membrane (VM), join with the spiral ligament and divide the cochlear tunnel into three par- allel canals, namely, the scala vestibuli (SV ), the scala tympani (ST ), and the cochlear duct (CD). Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani are perilymphatic spaces; these communicate at the apex of the cochlea. The cochlear duct, on the other hand, is the space of the membranous labyrinth and is filled with endolymph. It is thought that the endolymph is formed by the portion of the spiral ligament that faces the cochlear duct, the stria vascularis (StV ). This is highly vascularized and contains specialized “secretory” cells. A shelf of bone, the osseous spiral lamina (OSL), extends from the modi- olus to the basilar membrane. Branches of the cochlear nerve (CN) travel along the spiral lamina to the modiolus, where the main trunk of the nerve is formed. The components of the cochlear nerve are bipolar neurons whose cell bodies constitute the spiral ganglion (SG). These cell bodies are shown at higher magnification in the inset (upper right). The spiral lamina sup- ports an elevation of cells, the limbus spiralis (LS).
