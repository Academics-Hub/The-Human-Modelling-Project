This capsule does not send septa into the kidney. Underlying the capsule is the cortex, which is characterized by the presence of the many renal corpuscles (encircled) Also present in the cortex are the tubules of the “roughly straight” medullary rays (MR) MR MR Cortex Medulla The cortex of the kidney (right) is characterized by the presence of the rounded renal corpuscels. The medulla (left) is devoid of these structures. PC PR This photomicrograph shows the pars convoluta (PC) and the pars radiata (PR) of the cortec of the kidney In addition to a collecting duct, the medullary rays consist of the straight parts of the proximal (P) and distal (D) tubules. P D The renal corpuscle consists of a glomeuruls (G), which is lined by the Bowmans capsule. The Bowman’s capsule consists of visceral (VL) and parietal (PL) layers. Between the two layers of the Bowman’s capsule is the urinary space (US). G US PL VL This photomicrograph shows the presence of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (encircled) at the vascular pole of the renal corpuscle. This photomicrograph shows the juxtaglomerular cells (arrow) of the afferent arteriole P US M PL This photomicrograph shows the different cell types found within the renal corpuscle. The podocytes (P) have pale stained nuclei. Other cells include the mesangial cells (M) and the endothelial cells (E) of the capillaries. (US-urinary space, PL- Parietal layer). E The renal corpuscle has a vascular and urinary poles. The vascular pole is where the afferent arteriole enters and the efferent arteriole (Art) leaves. The urinary pole is the beginning of the proximal convoluted tubule (P).
