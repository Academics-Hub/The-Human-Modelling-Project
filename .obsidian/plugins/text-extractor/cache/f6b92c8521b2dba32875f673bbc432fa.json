Respiratory epithelium lining lumen of trachea Trachealis muscle within the submucosa; No muscularis mucosa in trachea! Cartilage Adventitia between trachea and oesophagus Identify the adventitia and study its structural features as shown in the photomicrographs Based on its location, what is the function of the trachealis muscle? Study notes & exercisesIntrapulmonary bronchus - pattern • Mucosa: • Respiratory mucosa • Lamina propria smaller • Circular layer of smooth muscle= muscularis mucosa • Submucosa: • Relatively loose CT • Glands • Adipose tissue • Discontinuous cartilage plates • Adventitia: • Dense CT continuous with adjacent structures www.kumc.edu/instruction/medicine/anatomy/histoweb B A C Identify the layers labelled A, B, and C on the photomicrograph Study notes & exercises Study the photomicrograph shown at low magnification. At LP you will not be able to see all the specific structural features for each layer; however, you can use unique structural features which are prominent at LP such as plates of hyaline cartilage to ID the structure you are looking at. Identify the structures encircled with yellow and red The bronchiole - pattern • Mucosa: • Epithelium transitions from pseudostratified ciliated columnar to ciliated columnar with goblet cells • Thin lamina propria • Relatively thick circular muscularis mucosa • Submucosa: • Relative thick CT • no glands or cartilage • Adventitia: • Thin loose CT www. medplexus.blogspot.com Study notes & exercises Notice the star-shaped lumen. This is characteristic of the bronchiole. Identify A and B. A B The terminal bronchiole - pattern • Mucosa: • Ciliated simple cuboidal epithelium interspersed with Clara cells (no goblet cells) • Clara cells are non-ciliated cells that secrete a surface- active agent that prevents luminal adhesion • Relatively thick circular muscularis mucosa and elastic fibres • Submucosa: • Relatively dense CT • no glands or cartilage • Adventitia: • Thin loose CT Revision of conducting portion www.histology.medicine.umich.edu/resources/respiratory-system Respiratory bronchiole - pattern • Mucosa: • Proximally lined by Simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium interspersed with Clara cells • Distally the Clara cells predominate the epithelia • Supported by SM and Elastic fibres in lamina propria • Alveoli scattered along length • Branch into alveolar duct (AD) www.ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/vethisto/chapter/10-air-conduction- respiratory-and-terminal-bronchioles-and-alveolar-ducts/ Inter-alveolar septum • Lies between adjacent alveoli • Thin lamina propria containing CT fibres and capillaries • Contain different cell types; • Type I pneumocytes small squamous cells which line the alveolar lumen and facilitate gaseous exchange. • Type II pneumocytes large cuboidal cells interspersed among type I pneumocytes and secrete surfactant. • Irregular-shaped macrophages (dust cells) which remove foreign materials from alveoli and small air passageways. • Site for the blood-air barrier http://legacy.owensboro.kctcs.edu/gcaplan/anat2/n otes/APIINotes4%20respiratory%20anatomy.htm Dust cellThe Alveolus • Site of gaseous exchange • Sac like pocket lined by simple squamous epithelium • Thin CT between alveoli (inter- alveoli septum) • Associated with lots of capillaries to facilitate gaseous exchange • Type I pneumocytes small squamous cells which line the alveolar lumen and facilitate gaseous exchange http://legacy.owensboro.kctcs.edu/gcaplan/anat2/n otes/APIINotes4%20respiratory%20anatomy.htm step1.medbullets.com/respiratory/117002/microanatomy-of-the-lung Study the features of the alveoli and inter- alveolar septum at low power.
