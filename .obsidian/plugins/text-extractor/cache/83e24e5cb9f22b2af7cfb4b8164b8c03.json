These functions depend on the effect of substances that originate from sites distant from their actions. For example, to maintain normal metabolic function, you would have learned of the effect of insulin and glucagon derived from the pancreas on carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. As these substances are so important in metabolism they are critical to our growth, development and survival. As another example, when engaging in the topics of “fluid balance”, “cardiovascular regulation” and “kidney function”, you would have studied the control of plasma osmolarity, fluid balance and blood pressure through the effects of antidiuretic hormone and plasma aldosterone released from the pituitary and adrenal glands respectively. Without the appropriate control of these substances, our capacity to maintain body fluid balance, cell hydration or blood pressure would quickly become compromised and our survival would be at stake. Moreover, you would have studied the effect of adrenalin and to some extent noradrenalin, released from the adrenal medulla, on the “autonomic nervous system”, actions which play a critical role in survival in times of stress. Importantly however, these aforementioned hormonal systems constitute a fraction of the elegant hormonal systems that regulate our normal bodily function. What are the other hormonal systems that you will need to study during the course of the endocrine block and what is it that they influence? There are a number of general systemic bodily functions such as metabolism, growth, development and reproductive capacity that are tightly regulated by hormonal systems. These include hormone systems derived from the thyroid gland (e.g. thyroid hormone), the parathyroid glands (e.g. parathyroid hormone), the adrenal cortices (e.g. cortisol, androgens, aldosterone), the pituitary gland (e.g. growth hormone, prolactin, oxytocin, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, adrenocortocotrophic hormone, and thyroid stimulating hormone), and the ovaries or testes (oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone). Even small abnormalities in the function of the aforementioned hormonal systems can result in a host of clinical presentations. At this point in your careers, it is important that you fully grasp all of the knowledge that relates to the normal mechanisms of hormonal control. Much of this you have learned in prior years, but in this year you are required to gain a far more comprehensive understanding. Moreover, in this year you are required to begin to understand the clinical consequences of abnormalities of hormonal systems. In this regard, the present practical will provide you with an opportunity to strengthen your knowledge of the elegant nature of hormonal control systems; to engage in some of the common tests that are employed to assess hormonal function and dysfunction; to practice performing some of these tests that some of you will be required to perform as health practitioners; to understand how synthetic hormones can be used to our advantage (such as sex steroids for contraceptive purposes, thyroid hormones or insulin) and to begin to gain some understanding of the clinical consequences of disorders of hormonal balance. The present practical will provide the opportunity to interpret endocrine results and tests used to frequently diagnose endocrine disorders. Online practical session Part 1: Thyroid function and dysfunction Part 2a: Female sex hormones. Part 2b: Disorders of insulin i) Urinalysis in patients with endocrine disease ii) The glucose tolerance test in health and disease Part 1 Thyroid function and dysfunction Next to diabetes mellitus, diseases of thyroid function constitute the second most common endocrine disorders and, if left untreated, either hyperthyroidism (increased thyroid hormone production) or hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid hormone production) may rapidly progress to heart failure. The availability of both the synthetic thyroid hormone (eltroxine) and the number of approaches that target the thyroid gland to reduce thyroid hormone production makes the endocrine manifestations of diseases of thyroid function readily manageable. As future health care professionals you should all become fully aware of the symptoms and signs of thyroid disease and understand the mechanisms that underlie these symptoms and signs. In this regard, this practical demonstration will give you the opportunity to assess your knowledge of thyroid function and the manifestations of thyroid disorders. Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) have two major physiologic effects: (i) they increase protein synthesis in most tissues in the body; and (ii) they increase metabolic rate and sympathetic nervous system activity. Knowledge of the synthesis and control of release of T3 and T4 will assist you in identifying the causes of thyroid dysfunction. In this regard, the formation of T3 and T4 requires iodide, and iodide ingested in food and water is concentrated by the thyroid gland, and combines with tyrosine in thyroglobulin molecules within the thyroid follicles. The reactions resulting in the formation of T3 and T4 are influenced and controlled by the pituitary hormone thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is in turn regulated by the hypothalamic releasing factor, thyroid releasing factor or hormone (TRH). The release of TRH from the hypothalamus and of TSH from the pituitary gland is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism modulated by circulating T4 and T3. Thus, measurements of TSH and T3 and T4 provide invaluable data as to the cause of thyroid dysfunction. The following practical demonstration will thus also test your knowledge of the control of thyroid hormone synthesis and release. Part 2A Female sex hormones Sex hormones are critical to the normal development of primary and secondary sex characteristics and the capacity to reproduce, a function that ensures survival of the species. In females, sex hormones contribute toward the control of the different phases of the menstrual cycle, and changes that occur at puberty, menarche, menopause (the climacteric), pregnancy, and parturition. In this regard, normal menstruation is a key determinant of a sense of well-being and it is only with an understanding of the major physiological changes to the menstrual cycle that occur at menarche, the climacteric and during pregnancy, that you will be empowered, as future health professionals, to advise patients on these physiological changes and hence contribute toward their sense of well-being. Furthermore, as future health professionals, it is an understanding of the normal menstrual cycle that will support your grasp of the value of synthetic sex hormones or alternative agents that modify sex hormones, for contraceptive use, to regulate an abnormal menstrual cycle, to treat infertility, or to treat disorders of ovarian or hypothalamic-pituitary function, all of which are important health considerations. In the present practical you will therefore be given the opportunity to assess your own knowledge of the hormonal control of the menstrual cycle and the potential effects of synthetic sex hormones on this cycle. Importantly, as with many other hormonal systems, the female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone are under the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) produced in the hypothalamus, controls the release of the gonadotropes, leutinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. The gonadotropes, LH and FSH are in turn responsible for controlling the development of ovarian follicles and the corpus luteum, from which oestrogen and progesterone are derived. To understand normal menstruation and ovulation, both of which are important in creating the conditions for fertilisation and implantation, it is important that you are able to understand the effects of the aforementioned hormones on each other and on the ovary and uterus. With this understanding you will therefore also understand the effect of synthetic sex hormones or alternative agents that modify sex hormones, on fertility (contraceptive use or to promote fertility), the regulation of abnormal menstrual cycles, and the treatment of disorders of ovarian or hypothalamic-pituitary function. Part 2B Disorders of insulin As you would have learned in other sections (sections on metabolism, the cardiovascular system and the kidney), a major cause of morbidity (“ill-health”) and mortality (“death”) in developing countries such as South Africa is diabetes mellitus. Indeed, the cardiovascular risk of a patient (risk of heart attacks, strokes, etc) with diabetes mellitus is similar to that of a patient who has previously had a cardiovascular event (heart attacks, strokes, etc) and by far the commonest cause of renal failure is uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. With South Africa having the highest prevalence rates of obesity in the world today, diabetes mellitus (type II) is likely to become one of the leading causes of death in our country in this century. Your ability to diagnose diabetes mellitus and subsequently provide appropriate management is essential to ensuring that these morbidity and mortality rates are managed at appropriate levels. i) Urinalysis in endocrine disease Despite the availability of synthetic insulin and highly effective oral hypoglycaemic agents, diseases that affect insulin release or its actions all too often present in the advanced stages. As future health care professionals it is important that you are able to quickly recognise the advanced stages of impaired metabolic control in patients with diabetes mellitus. Testing blood glucose concentrations obtained from a finger-prick allows for a quick and effective diagnosis of advanced metabolic disturbances in diabetes mellitus. Sometimes however, there is no access to even these simple tests in resource-limited settings occurs. In these situations, urine dipsticks tests are very useful tests for assessing metabolic disturbances in patients with diabetes mellitus. In this regard, you have already encountered the utility of urine dipsticks in the “kidney” practical. The following practical will give you further insights into the value of urinalysis using urine dipsticks. ii) The glucose tolerance test in health and disease Normally the plasma glucose concentration is maintained between 3.1-6.4 mmol/l despite intermittent glucose loads entering the body from the gastrointestinal tract after a carbohydrate containing meal. The blood glucose concentration after an overnight fast is frequently used to diagnose diabetes mellitus. In normal adults, the fasting concentrations of glucose vary between 3.1 and 6.4 mmol/l. Fasting concentrations greater than 7.0 mmol/l are diagnostic of diabetes mellitus and no further tests are necessary. A high fasting glucose concentration could indicate either inadequate insulin output (type I diabetes mellitus) or ineffective insulin actions (type II diabetes mellitus) with later destruction of pancreatic β-cells also occurring in type II diabetes mellitus (and hence inadequate insulin output as well). To avoid complications, diabetes mellitus should be managed at the earliest possible stage. Hence, the diagnosis has to be made well in advance of obvious clinical symptoms. In this regard, patients with mild diabetes mellitus or diabetes mellitus that may be controlled by dietary means (which is commonly the case in type II diabetes mellitus), may have fasting blood glucose concentrations within the normal range, but they may be unable to produce sufficient insulin, or the insulin effect may be inadequate for prompt metabolism of ingested carbohydrate. As a result, plasma glucose concentrations rise to abnormally high concentrations and the return to normal is delayed. In such cases a glucose tolerance test (GTT) is helpful in establishing the diagnosis. The term glucose tolerance refers to the ability of the body to respond appropriately to an oral glucose load. As insulin and glucagon are the hormones which maintain extracellular homeostasis, the oral GTT assesses the activity of these hormones. In particular, the oral GTT tests whether sufficient insulin is present, or whether the insulin that is present is effective at increasing the cellular uptake of glucose and hence maintaining normal plasma glucose concentrations after a meal. How is the oral GTT performed? The individual first undergoes a period of starvation (8-16 hours) so as to establish the basal or fasting plasma glucose concentration. Thereafter, a recommended oral glucose dose of 75 g (for adults) and 1.75 g/kg body (for children) is consumed by the patient. As a solution of 75 g of glucose may cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, the glucose load is best administered as a mixture of glucose and oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharides are hydrolysed at the brush border to glucose and absorbed. Thereafter, the plasma glucose concentration is measured at half-hourly intervals for a period of 2 to 2½ hours. The plasma glucose concentration is then plotted as a function of time and this is known as the glucose tolerance curve. The results from the glucose and insulin concentrations are used to interpret the endocrine responses of the patient. School of Physiology, 2018","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
