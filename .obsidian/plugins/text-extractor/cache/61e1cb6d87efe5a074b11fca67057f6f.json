The initial conditions are assumed to be zero. Draw the response curves. T is the time constant of the system. 2.1. Unit-step response of first-order systems !

The slope of the tangent line at t = 0 is 1/T. ! Pole location in the s plane: s = -1/T. ! At t = T, y(T) = 1 – e -1 = 0.632. T is called the time constant, and it is the time it takes for the step response to rise to 63.2% of its final value. ! y(2T) = 0.865; y(3T) = 0.95; y(4T) = 0.982; y(5T) = 0.993 ... It can be seen that for t ≥ 4T, the response y(t) remains within 2% of the final value; this time is known as the settling time, T s . 1.

The transient response is defined as the part of the time response which goes from the initial state to the final state and reduces to zero as time becomes very large. The steady-state response is defined as the behaviour of the system as t approaches infinity after the transients have died out. Thus the system response y(t) may be written as: y(t) = y t (t) + y ss (t) where y t (t) denotes the transient response, and y ss (t) denotes the steady-state response. 2. Response Analysis of First-Order Systems Many systems are approximately first-order. The important feature is that the storage of mass, momentum and energy can be captured by one parameter. Examples of first-order systems are velocity of a car on the road, control of the velocity of a rotating system, electric systems where energy storage is essentially in one capacitor or one inductor, incompressible fluid flow in a pipe, level control of a tank, pressure control in a gas tank, temperature in a body with essentially uniform temperature distribution (e.g. steam filled vessel). Next we will present several examples to show how to obtain the dynamic equations of first-order systems. Example 1: Mechanical system m is the mass, u(t) is the external force, y(t) is the velocity and b is the friction coefficient. By Newton’s law, we have the following differential equation: )t(u)t(by dt )t(dy m =+ Example 2: Electrical system R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, u(t) is the input voltage and y(t) is the output voltage. By Kirchhoff’s law: u(t) = Ri(t) + y(t) and i(t) = Cdy(t)/dt Thus )t(u)t(y dt )t(dy RC =+ A general form of a first-order system can be represented by the block diagram. 1/Ts Y(s) + _ R(s) = 1Ts 1 + Y(s)R(s) m u(t) y(t) by(t) u(t) y(t) R C ECM2105 - Control Engineering Dr Mustafa M Aziz (2013) ________________________________________________________________________________ 4 ! The rise time, T r , is defined as the time for the waveform to go from 10% to 90% of its final value. ! The steady-state error is the error after the transient response has decayed leaving only the continuous response. The error signal: e(t) = r(t) - y(t) = 1 - 1 + e -t/T = e -t/T As t approaches infinity, e -t/T approaches zero and the steady-state error is: [ ] )t(y)t(rlim)(ee t ss −=∞= ∞→ = 0 ! The larger the time constant T is, the slower the system response is. ! It is noted that the transient response dominates the response of the system at times ‘immediately’ after the input is applied and can make significant contribution to the system response when the time constant is large. Exercise: A RC circuit has the following transfer function: 4s10 2 )s(R )s(Y + = For a step input r(t) = 2V, what is the time taken for the output of the RC circuit to reach 95% of its steady-state response? Exercise: A system has transfer function: 50s 50 )s(R )s(Y + = Find the time constant, T, the settling time, T s , and the rise time, T r for a unit-step input. 23 ECM2105 - Control Engineering Dr Mustafa M Aziz (2013) ________________________________________________________________________________ 6 3.
