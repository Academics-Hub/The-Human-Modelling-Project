of the pancreatic duct system ▪ Pancreas innervation, blood supply, venous and lymphatic drainage ▪ Spleen general anatomy ▪ Spleen relations ▪ Spleen functions ▪ Spleen innervation, blood supply, venous and lymphatic drainage ▪ Clinically relevant concepts 3 ▪ Retroperitoneally ▪ Posterior to stomach and transverse mesocolon ▪ Between duodenum and spleen ▪ Accessory digestive gland (exocrine – pancreatic juice) and endocrine organ (glucagon & insulin) ▪ Consists of: ▪ Head ▪ Neck ▪ Body ▪ Tail 4 ▪ Expanded part within C-shaped duodenum ▪ Right of superior mesenteric vessels ▪ Uncinate process – inferior projection, extends medially, posterior to SMA ▪ Posterior relations: ▪ IVC ▪ Right renal vessels ▪ Left renal vein ▪ Bile duct lies in groove on posterosuperior surface on or embedded in head 5 ▪ Short ▪ Over superior mesenteric vessels (form groove in posterior surface) ▪ Pyloris of stomach lies anterior ▪ Portal vein forms posterior to neck (SMV and splenic unite) 6 ▪ Left of superior mesenteric vessels ▪ Anterior to: ▪ Aorta ▪ Left suprarenal gland, kidney & renal vessels ▪ Posterior to omental bursa (part of the bed of the stomach) 7 ▪ Related closely to hilum of spleen ▪ With splenic vessels, in splenorenal ligament ▪ Lies anterior to left kidney 89 ▪ Main pancreatic duct: ▪ Begins in tail ▪ Turns inferiorly (head) → bile duct → form hepatopancreatic ampulla → opens major duodenal papilla ▪ Main pancreatic duct may open into duodenum separately ▪ Sphincters of ducts control flow of bile and pancreatic juice ▪ Accessory pancreatic duct – opens into descending duodenum at minor duodenal papilla ▪ Usually two ducts communicate 10 ▪ Mainly branches of splenic artery – body and tail ▪ Pancreaticoduodenal arteries supply head: ▪ Anterior & posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries  gastroduodenal a.  common hepatic a.  coeliac trunk (foregut) ▪ Anterior & posterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries  superior mesenteric arteries (midgut) 11 ▪ Venous drainage: ▪ Corresponding veins drain into splenic vein or superior mesenteric vein ▪ Lymphatic drainage ▪ Pancreaticosplenic lymph nodes, along splenic artery & pyloric lymph nodes → superior mesenteric lymph nodes → hepatic lymph nodes (some) → coeliac lymph nodes 12 ▪ Coeliac & superior mesenteric plexus ▪ Sympathetic –abdominopelvic splanchnic nerves ▪ Parasympathetic – vagus nerve (secretomotor, but again mainly through secretin and colecytokinin) 1314 ▪ Pancreatic head most commonly affected ▪ Head growths can obstruct biliary ducts/hepatopancreatic ampulla ▪ Bile pigment retained → enlargement of gallbladder → jaundice (obstructive) ▪ Often strong back pain ▪ Cancer of the neck may cause IVC or portal vein obstruction ▪ Deep lymphatic drainage + early metastasis to liver (portal vein) = hard to detect early and difficult to resect ▪ Pancreatoduodenectomy often the surgical treatment https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Filip-Bednar-

size, weight, & shape (~12 cm long & ~7 cm wide) ▪ Soft, vascular & delicate – most vulnerable abdominal organ (Not vital) ▪ Delicate fibroelastic capsule entirely surrounded by peritoneum except at hilum ▪ Located in left upper abdominal quadrant or hypochondrium ▪ Receives protection of lower thoracic cage ▪ Mobile organ although it normally does not descend inferior to costal region ▪ Surfaces: ▪ Diaphragmatic surface convex curved to fit concavity of diaphragm ▪ Hilum concave & often in contact with tail of pancreas ▪ Borders: ▪ Anterior & superior borders of spleen are sharp ▪ Superior border notched ▪ Posterior (medial) end & inferior border are rounded 16 ▪ Relations: ▪ Anteriorly – stomach ▪ Posteriorly – left part of diaphragm, which separates it from pleura, lung, & ribs 9-11 ▪ Inferiorly – left colic flexure ▪ Medially – left kidney ▪ Connected to greater curvature of stomach by gastrosplenic lig. ▪ Connected to left kidney by splenorenal lig. 17 ▪ Function: ▪ Largest lymphatic organ – lymphocyte proliferation, immune surveillance & response ▪ Prenatally – hematopoietic organ ▪ After birth – involved in identifying, removing, destroying old RBCs & platelets ▪ Recycling iron & globin ▪ Serves as a blood reservoir (RBCs & platelets) ▪ Capable of marked expansion & some relatively rapid contraction ▪ Normally contains large quantity of blood that is expelled by smooth muscle in capsule & trabeculae 18 ▪ Coeliac trunk → splenic a. → runs posterior to omental bursa, anterior to left kidney & along superior border of pancreas ▪ Divides into ~5 branches enter hilum ▪ Avascular planes between 2-3 splenic segments (↓ arterial anastomosis) allows for subtotal splenectomy 19 Venous drainage ▪ Tributaries from hilum → splenic v. ▪ Meet IMV → splenic v. ▪ Splenic v. runs posterior to body & tail of pancreas ▪ Splenic v. unites with SMV to form portal v. (posterior to neck of pancreas) Lymphatic drainage ▪ Nodes in splenic hilum → Splenic vessels → pancreaticosplenic nodes → coeliac nodes 20 ▪ From coeliac nerve plexus ▪ Sympathetic – Adbominopelvic splanchnic ▪ Parasympathetic – vagus (posterior trunk) ▪ Distributed along branches of splenic artery ▪ Vasomotor function 2122 ▪ Most commonly injured abdominal organ (ribs protect, but easy to damage) ▪ Blunt force trauma can cause rupture of the capsule and peritoneum ▪ Leads to intraperitoneal haemorrhage → shock ▪ Repair very difficult → splenectomy usual treatment to prevent bleeding to death ▪ Subtotal splenectomy can be alternative → rapid regeneration ▪ No serious side effects of removal in adults (decrease resistance to some bacteria) ▪ Spleen not normally palpable in the abdomen unless 3x size (common in pathology of the spleen) https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/cms/attachment/d1b5ba7c-5071-4d38-83cc- 0c0b26bfa358/gr1_lrg.jpg https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336900794/figure/fig2/AS:819754570883073@1572456128472/Rupt ured-spleen-after-splenectomy-measuring-643-grams.ppm http://www.svuhradiology.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SplenicLac1-450x343.jpg","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
