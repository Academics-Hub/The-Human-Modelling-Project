Dermatoglyphics • Creases: where skin is held down to underlying fibrous sheaths. – 3 in palm – 2 transverse & 1 horizontal. • In fingers – Proximal middle & distal transverse creases at metacarpophalangeal & interphalangeal joints. Loop whorl Arch Palmar aponeurosis & compartments Extends from flexor retinaculum to base of 2-5 fingers. Compartments: Thenar, Middle & Hypothenar, Adductor & Interosseous Thickest in middle Functions of Palmar aponeurosis • Channelling of tendons & neurovascular bundles – via longitudinal fibres • Transmission of loads - shock absorber system: – fat within fibrous bands – larger fibrous compartments between skin & skeleton containing muscles, tendons & neurovascular structures allow for grasping, interpretation of sensation & better grip. • Anchorage of skin by ligaments allowing hand to flex with skin in position. Functions of Palmar aponeurosis… • Binding role for deep transverse metacarpal ligaments of metacarpophalangeal joints • Limiting role of joint motion (thumb) • Lubrication of flexor tendon sheaths • Vascular protection & pumping action for return of venous blood • Muscular attachments Thenar muscles • Abductor Pollicis Brevis (AbPB) - Median nerve • Flexor Pollicis Brevis (FPB) - Superficial head (median nerve) - Deep head (ulnar nerve) • Opponens pollicis - Median nerve • *Adductor pollicis - Ulnar nerve * AbPB FPB OP Hypothenar muscles • Abductor Digiti Minimi (Abdm) • Flexor Digiti Minimi Brevis (Fdmb) • Opponens digiti minimi (Odm) • Nerve supply – Ulnar nerve Abdm Fdmb Odm • Lumbricals (4) • Lat to med: 1, 2, 3 & 4 • Nerve supply – 1 & 2 (median nerve) – 3 & 4 (ulnar nerve) • Action: – Assist flexor digitorum profundus • At the Extensor Expansion Tendon of FDP 1 4 23 Tendon of FDS Intrinsic Muscles: LumbricalsIntrinsic Muscles: Interossei Interossei • *4 Palmar Interossei: Adduct fingers [PAD] • 4 Dorsal Interossei: Abduct fingers [DAB] • Nerve supply: Ulnar nerve * 3 according to Clinical Anatomy textbook Vessels in Hand – Superficial palmar arch • By ulnar artery deep to palmar aponeurosis • completed by superficial palmar branch (radial artery) • Branches: • 3 common palmar digital arteries • proper palmar digital arteries (2nd-4th) Vessels in Hand – Deep palmar arch • Continuation of deep palmar branch of radial artery; • completed by deep palmar branch (ulnar artery). • Branches: – 3 palmar metacarpal arteries – princeps pollicis & radial indicis Nerves of Hand: Ulnar, Median & RadialImportant Spaces 6 on flexor aspect • Superficial pulp spaces of fingers • Synovial tendon sheaths of carpal flexor tendons (2nd, 3rd & 4th fingers) • Ulnar Bursa } • Radial Bursa } Forearm space of Parona • Mid-palmar space • Thenar space Superficial pulp spaces of fingers • Location: tip of fingers • Front of distal phalanx is covered with subcutaneous fat • Dense fibrous processes bind skin to periosteum & divide fat into compartments. • Infection of pulp space is called a Felon or Whitlow & are very painful as it cannot expand. Can cause necrosis of distal four-fifth of distal phalanx Midpalmar & thenar spaces Midpalmar space : - occupies the central mid palm. - Posterior to the common synovial sheaths of FDS & FDP • Infected in infections of synovial sheaths and wounds of palm Thenar space: - occupies the space btw the thenar eminence and 3rd metacarpal bone. Radial and Ulnar bursae Thumb & little finger infections • Radial bursa: continuation of FPL tendon sheath at MCP joint • Ulnar bursa: continuation of flexor tendon sheath of little finger – Ulnar bursa is wider • Space of Parona: – Located anterior to pronator quadratus & deep to FDS & FDP. – Communication of radial and ulnar bursae • Common in about 70% population • Infections of thumb and little fingers are dangerous L T Pathology of palmar spaces Suppurative infection of thenar space; thumb held in abduction. Suppurative infection of tendon sheath with characteristic perforation at proximal end of tendon sheath. (b) Same patient showing a pillow-like collateral dorsal oedema. (c) Tendon sheath partly resected and all debris excised Suppurative subcutaneous infection of middle phalanx with perforation along path of entry Infection of nail wall or paronychia or run-around whitlow. Dorsal carpal synovial sheaths • 6 Synovial sheaths of extensor tendons, deep to extensor reticulum. • Terminate in proximal third of hand • Not found in fingers. • Lateral to medial 1.
