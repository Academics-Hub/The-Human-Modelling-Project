Calcaneum • It is the largest bone of the foot and forms the prominence of the heel. • It articulates above with the talus and in front with the cuboid and it has six surfaces. • The anterior surface • It is small and forms the articular facet that articulates with the cuboid bone. • The posterior surface • It forms the prominence of the heel and gives attachment to the tendo calcaneus (Achilles tendon). • The superior surface • It is dominated by two articular facets for the talus, separated by a roughened groove, the sulcus calcanei. Calcaneum • The inferior surface • It has an anterior tubercle in the midline and a large medial and a smaller lateral tubercle at the junction of the inferior and posterior surfaces. • The medial surface • It possesses the sustentaculum tali, which assists in the support of the talus. • The lateral surface • It is almost flat and its anterior part has a small elevation called the peroneal tubercle. • This tubercle separates the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis muscles. Talus • The talus possesses a head, neck, and body and articulates • above at the ankle joint with the tibia and fibula, • below with the calcaneum, and • in front with the navicular bone. • The head • It is of directed distally and has an oval convex articular surface for articulation with the navicular bone. • This articular surface is continued on its inferior surface • Here it rests on the sustentaculum tali behind and the calcaneonavicular ligament in front. https://www.theskeletalsystem.net/leg-bone/talus.html Talus • The neck • It lies posterior to the head and is slightly narrowed. • Its upper surface is roughened and gives attachment to ligaments, and its lower surface shows a deep groove, the sulcus tali. • The body • It is cuboidal and its superior surface articulates with the distal end of the tibia • It is convex from before backward and slightly concave from side to side. https://www.theskeletalsystem.net/leg-bone/talus.html Talus • Lateral surface • It presents a triangular articular facet for articulation with the lateral malleolus of the fibula. • Its medial surface has a small, comma-shaped articular facet for articulation with the medial malleolus of the tibia. • Posterior surface • It is marked by two small tubercles, separated by a groove for the flexor hallucis longus tendon. https://orthofixar.com/anatomy/ankle-anatomy/ Navicular, Cuboid and Cuneiform • Navicular Bone • It has tuberosity which is seen and felt on the medial border of the foot 2.5 cm in front of and below the medial malleolus; • • it gives attachment to the main part of the tibialis posterior tendon. • Cuboid Bone • It has a deep groove on its inferior aspect which houses the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle. • Cuneiform Bones • Three in number; lateral, intermediate and medial cuneiforms. • They articulate proximally with the navicular bone and distally with the first three metatarsal bones. • Their wedge shape contributes greatly to the formation and maintenance of the transverse arch of the foot. Ossification of the Tarsal Bones • The tarsal bones, unlike those of the carpus, start to ossify before birth. • Centres of ossification for the calcaneum and the talus, and often for the cuboid, are present at birth. • By the fifth year, ossification is taking place in all the tarsal bones. Metatarsal Bones and Phalanges • The metatarsal bones and phalanges resemble the metacarpals and phalanges of the hand. • Each possesses a head distally, a shaft, and a base proximally. • The five metatarsals are numbered from the medial to the lateral side. • The first metatarsal • It is large and strong and plays an important role in supporting the weight of the body. • The head is grooved on its inferior aspect by the medial and lateral sesamoid bones in the tendons of the flexor hallucis brevis. • The fifth metatarsal • It has a prominent tubercle on its base that can be easily palpated along the lateral border of the foot. • The tubercle gives attachment to the peroneus brevis tendon. • Each toe has three phalanges except the big toe, which possesses only two. Metatarsal Bones and PhalangesOssification of Metatarsals • Each metatarsal ossifies from two centres • Primary centre: • It appears in the 9th week of IUL for all shafts except for the shaft of first metatarsal which appears during 10th week of IUL. • Secondary centre • It appears during 3rd to 4th year in the heads of all the metatarsals except in the first metatarsal where it appears in the base. • Fusing of ossification centres occur between age 17–20. Phalanges • They are 14 in number and form the bones of the toes. • The great toe has 2 phallanges; proximal and distal. • The 2nd to 5th toes possess both proximal, middle and distal phalanges. • Each phalanx has • a base (proximally) • a shaft and • a head (distally).
