Histologically Note: Chapter 3 (The cell nucleus) of prescribed text explains detail between euchromatin and heterochromatin /Euchromatic HistologicallyNeurons • Structural classification: – Multipolar: which have one axon and two or more dendrites – Bipolar: with one dendrite and one axon – Pseudounipolar: which have a single process that bifurcates close to the soma, with the peripheral branch extending to the periphery and the central branch other toward the CNS. Found in retina, olfactory mucosa, and the cochlear and vestibular ganglia Found in the spinal ganglia (the sensory ganglia found with the spinal nerves) and in most cranial ganglia Mescher, Anthony L. Junqueira's basic histology: text and atlas. New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2013. Neurons • Functional classification: – Afferent: Sensory (generally unipolar/pseudounipolar) – Efferent: Motor (mostly multipolar) – Interneurons: establish relationships among other neurons, forming complex functional networks (generally multipolar) Support cells (Glia) • CNS – Oligodendrocytes – Astrocytes – Ependymal cells – Microglia https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-biology2/chapter/glial-cells/ Histologically NEURON A NEURON B NEURON C Oligodendrocytes • Small cells with rounded, condensed nuclei and unstained cytoplasm • Produce myelin sheath in CNS – Processes of one cell wraps around parts of several axons Mescher, Anthony L. Junqueira's basic histology: text and atlas. New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2013. Astrocytes • Most numerous • Functions: – Control of signal propagation and synapse formation – Maintenance of ionic and transmitter metabolism – Component of blood- brain barrier – Involved in brain repair Mescher, Anthony L. Junqueira's basic histology: text and atlas. New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2013. Ependymal cells • Low columnar or cuboidal cells • Lines ventricles of brain and central canal of spinal cord • Function: CSF production and secretion • Surface specializations: – Cilia – Facilitates movement of CSF – Microvilli – Absorption Microglia • They have short irregular processes and rod shaped nuclei • Evenly distributed throughout the white and grey matter • Capable of migrating • Specialized phagocytes – Monocyte derived, antigen-presenting cells of the CNS • Function: – Immune effector cells – Phagocytic Mescher, Anthony L. Junqueira's basic histology: text and atlas. New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2013. Support cells (Glia) • PNS – Schwann cells: myelination • One Schwann cell myelinates one part of axon (compare with oligodendrocytes) – Satellite cells: exert a trophic or supportive effect on these neurons, insulating, nourishing, and regulating their microenvironments. https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-biology2/chapter/glial-cells/ Histologically Note: Satellite cells surrounding neuron cell body Schwann cell myelination Mescher, Anthony L.

New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2013. http://medcell.med.yale.edu/histology/nervous_system_lab/unmyelinated_axons_em.php How can I tell the difference between a neuron and a support (glial) cell? • Histologically: – Neuronal nuclei are larger than those of support cells Practice Question With regard to the support cells of the nervous system: – Oligodendrocytes are found in the median nerve (T/F) – Satellite cells are found in the cerebral cortex (T/F) – Ependymal cells form the blood-brain barrier (T/F) – Microglia are found in the of the spinal cord (T/F) – Astrocytes secrete cerebrospinal fluid (T/F) All these questions are basically asking is the specific cell type given found in the PNS or CNS so its important to know what structures make up the CNS and PNS. Practice Question C B A Identify A Identify B Identify C The organisation of the spinal cord and spinal nerves is a good illustration of how the different cells of the NS organise to perform their function – example from test Q from 2019 Hogan, Q.

Macroscopic Microscopic Anterior Horn Cell • Functional classification? • Structural classification? • Functional classification? • Structural classification? SPINAL GANGLION CELLSpinal Ganglion/DRG Cell Where are we so far: Peripheral Nerve • Mixed peripheral nerves carry the axons from neurons • Associated with connective tissue coverings that allow distinguishing from: – Nerve fibres – Nerve fascicles – A nerve Peripheral Nerve • Peripheral nerves are associated with various connective tissue coverings that form the nerve. • Identification of these coverings allows us to distinguish between: • A nerve • A nerve fascicle • A nerve fibre • Connective tissue coverings: – Endoneurium – Perineurium – Epineurium • Support cells: – Schwann cells Peripheral NervePeripheral Nerve • Endoneurium: – includes loose connective tissue surrounding each individual nerve fibre • Perineurium: – includes specialized connective tissue surrounding each nerve fascicle • Epineurium: – includes dense irregular connective tissue that surrounds a peripheral nerve and fills the spaces between nerve fascicles.
