Fick’s principle: Oxygen consumption = blood flow x oxygen extraction VO2 = CO x (a-v) O2diff CO: cardiac output (a-v) O2 diff: arterio-venous oxygen difference Blood flow = pressure gradient / resistance of conduit Flow (F)= Pressure gradient (P1-P2) Resistance (R) Blood flow = pressure gradient / resistance of conduit Flow (F)= Pressure gradient (P1-P2) Resistance (R)Determinants of resistance Poiseuille’s Law: Resistance (R) = 8ηL R ≈ 1/r4 πr4 η= viscosity L= length of system r=diameter of vessel Blood flow (F)= Pressure gradient (P1-P2) Resistance (R) 1) Strong pump (good contractility and appropriate Frank-Starling effect) Flow (compared to 1) P1 P2Low R 2) Weak pump (poor contractility or less of a Frank- Starling effect) P1 Low R P2 Pump Pressure gradient and R 3) Strong pump (good contractility and appropriate Frank-Starling effect) P1 P2R Determinants of blood flow “Normal” • Cardiac output from right side of heart = Pressure gradient across pulmonary circulation Cardiac output • Cardiac output from left side of heart = Pressure gradient across systemic circulation (P1-P2) CO = P in aorta – P in right atrium TPR CO = P in pulmonary artery – P in left atrium PVR Total peripheral resistance Pulmonary vascular resistance where difference in P is estimated from mean pulmonary arterial pressure where difference in P is estimated from mean systemic arterial pressure 120/80 mm Hg (mean arterial pressure 95 mm Hg) ~0 mm Hg ~8 mm Hg ~8 mm Hg ~25/12 mm Hg (mean arterial pressure 16 mm Hg) ~0 mm Hg Right ventricle Left ventricle Aorta Aorta Systemic veins Pulmonary capillaries Pulmonary veins Pulmonary artery 120/80 mm Hg ~25/0 mm Hg 120/80 mm Hg Superior vena cava Inferior vena cava Deoxygenated blood Oxygenated blood Right atrium Left atrium Pressure gradient across the systemic circulation Pressure gradient across the pulmonary circulation Systemic circulation Pulmonary circulation Pressure gradients across the circulatory system Systemic capillaries ~0 mm Hg Systemic pressure gradient = 95 mm Hg (divided by high resistance) Left circulation: P1 = the pressure in the aorta as the blood leaves the left ventricle. P2 = the pressure in the right atrium, as the blood returns to the heart. Right circulation: P1 = the pressure in the pulmonary artery as the blood leaves the right ventricle. P2 = the pressure in the left atrium, as the blood returns to the heart. Pulmonary pressure gradient = approx. 8 mmHg (divided by low resistance) • Cardiac output (CO) = stroke volume (SV) x heart rate (HR) • SV= amount of blood ejected by ventricle with each beat • HR= number of heart beats per minute Cardiac output (blood flow) • The heart’s performance • Measured by the ability to deliver blood to the system. • Ventricle only generates sufficient force during intermittent periods of contraction to produce flow. CO = SV x HR • Whole body blood flow= amount of blood ejected from the heart each minute (litres/minute) or cardiac output. • Cardiac output = Amount of blood heart pumps through each minute. START 5 4 1 2 3 1. Late diastole: both sets of chambers are relaxed and ventricles fill passively. 2. Atrial systole: atrial contraction forces a small amount of additional blood into ventricles. 3. Isovolumic ventricular contraction: first phase of ventricular contraction pushes AV valves closed but does not create enough pressure to open semilunar valves. 5. Isovolumic ventricular relaxation: as ventricles relax, pressure in ventricles falls, blood flows back into cups of semilunar valves and snaps them closed. 4. Ventricular ejection: as ventricular pressure rises and exceeds pressure in the arteries, the semilunar valves open and blood is ejected.

Heart sounds • Cause: vibrations set up within the walls of the ventricles & major arteries during valve closure. 1st sound • Caused by vibrations set by the closure of the AV valves. • Low in pitch, soft and relatively long • “Lub” • Beginning of ejection phase (ventricular systole) 2nd sound • Caused by vibrations set by the closure of the semilunar valves. • High in pitch, sharper and relatively short • “Dub” • End of ejection phase (ventricular diastole) Valve abnormalitiesStenosis P1 >P2 Flow occurs P1 P2 P1 >>> P2 Flow occurs through narrow opening Stenosis Normal Normal mitral valve from above Mitral valve stenosis Incompetence P1 P2 P2 > P1 Reverse flow occurs through narrow opening Incompetence which results in regurgitation P1 P2 P2 > P1 No flow occurs Normal Contraction of the heart muscle • Cardiomyocytes – cardiac muscle cells • Joined by intercalated discs • Spread action potential • Contract as a functional syncytium • All or none • Specialized conduction system to ensure synchronization • No junction between atria and ventricles What would happen if the atria andventricles contracted at the same time?

Increased permeability of membrane to Na+ & Ca2+. Increased SA node rate of depolarization. This mechanism also reduces AV nodal delay. Increased spread of action potential through conduction pathway. Increased K+ channel closure, to allow for faster depolarization. Contractile cells: Increased rate and force of contraction. Supply atria & ventricles. Increased Ca2+ permeability (slow channels). PNS activation Autorhythmic cells : • Acetylcholine (ACh) bind Muscarinic receptor (M) • → slowing K+ channel closure (allow K+ leakage) • Makes tissue less excitable (hyperpolarization) • → SA node decreased rate of depolarization. • →AV node increased AV nodal delay. *PNS activation reduces atrial contraction, but does not affect ventricular contraction. = Inherent SA node pacemaker activity = SA node on parasympathetic stimulation • Initiated by autorhythmic cells • Electrical charge difference produced by the depolarization and repolarization of cardiomyocyte cell membranes • Current spreads through the heart and conducted through body fluids • Detected in the skin surface using electrodes • Measured by a voltmeter (ECG) Different parts of ECG correlate to specific electrical events in the heart Electrocardiogram (ECG)The electrocardiograph • Where do things go wrong? • Rate abnormalities • Tachycardia vs bradycardia • Conduction abnormalities • Rhythm abnormalities • Cardiomyopathies The electrocardiogram (ECG): Obtaining a measure that reflects electrical events in the heart + + + + + - - - - - - - - - - - + + + + ++ - - - - - - - - - - - - -- -- ---- - - - - + + ++ ++ +++ + ++ + - - - --- --- - - -- - - --- -- - - - - +++ + ++ +++ ++ + + + + + + + + + + + + + ++ + + + + + +++ ++ + ++ ++ ++ ++ + + + + + + + +++ + + + + - - - - -- - -- - - - - -- - - ----- ---- --- - - - - ---- - - - -- --- - - -- - - - - - --- --- - - -- - - --- -- - - - - +++ + ++ +++ ++ + + + + + + + + +++ + + +++ ++ + - - --- - - - - - - - -- P wave P-R interval QRS complex S-T segment T wave A B C D E Important parameters • LV End Diastolic volume (EDV) = volume of blood found in the ventricle at the end of diastole (~ 135 mL at rest). • LV End Systolic volume (ESV) = volume of blood found in the ventricle at the end of the systole (~ 65 mL at rest) • Stroke volume (SV) = volume of blood pumped by one ventricle in one stroke SV= EDV – ESV = 135 – 65 = 70 mL • LV Ejection fraction (EF) = the proportion of blood expelled from the ventricles during systole • EF (%) = (EDV – ESV) / EDV x 100 = (135 – 65) / 135 x 100 = 52% • Cardiac output (CO) = the volume of blood pumped by the ventricle per minute CO = HR x SV = 72 bpm x 0.07L = 5.04 L.min-1 • Does CO need to change?

This is dependent on the severity of the blockage and the amount of cardiac tissue affected. Netter's Internal Medicine Wang, Tracy Y.; Ohman, E. Magnus. Published January 1, 2009.

Causes of heart failure • Heart failure can occur for a variety of reasons but the two most common are: 1. Damage to the heart muscle as a result of a heart attack or impaired circulation to the cardiac muscle. 2. Prolonged pumping against chronically increased afterload.

Postural influences on HF • Postural changes influence LV filling volume. • Standing reduces venous return due to gravity. • Reduced filling volume and pressure. • Reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure. • Reduced pulmonary oedema when standing. • When lying flat – increased venous return – increased pulmonary oedema. • Orthopnoea. • Relieved by sitting up / more pillows. • Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. • Relieved by getting up and going to open window.

CVS blood vessels Large Arteries • Endothelial wall. • Thick muscular wall. • Connective tissue. • Collagen. • Elastin. • Effect of aging. Arteries - pressure reservoir • Large radius, thus little resistance to blood flow. • Temporarily expand and hold blood ejected during systole. • When the heart relaxes, the stretched arteries passively recoil. This pushes the excess blood toward the tissues. • This ensures a continuous flow of blood to the tissues. Arterioles • Variable resistance (radius). • Distribution of CO among organs depending on momentary needs. • Help regulate arterial BP. • Changing arteriolar radius. • Vasodilation. • Vasoconstriction. • Little elastic fibers. • Thick layer of SMC. • Innervated by sympathetic nerve fibers. Capillaries • Serve as exchange of nutrients and waste products (a-v)O2diff. • One cell layer thick for easy diffusion. • BF through capillaries is slow: tremendous cross- sectional area of all capillaries in an area. This enhances the opportunity for diffusion (nutrients & metabolic end products). Veins • Large radii (lumen). • The closure of valves inside veins ensures that blood does not flow backward. (Valves activated by movement). • Veins are capacitance vessels. • serving as a large blood reservoir. • highly distensible - accommodate large volumes of blood. • hold 60% of the blood volume of the body at rest. Factors that enhance venous return • Increased sympathetic activity within the veins result in contraction of the smooth muscle cell in the wall of the veins. • This is termed “veno-constriction”. This squeezes blood back to the heart. Veno-constriction does not lead to any significant increase in resistance but rather increase venous return. • Other factors that enhance venous return • Increased skeletal muscle activity. This compresses veins and increases venous pressure. This drives blood toward the heart. • The respiratory pump creates a pressure gradient in the chest cavity, drawing blood upwards toward the heart. • Postural orientation. Lying flat reduces the effect of gravity on venous return. • Incompetent venous valves. • Varicose veins. • Veins overstretched by excess venous pressure. • Veins stretch (increased cross sectional area) but valves don’t. • Pregnancy. • Long standing hours. • Increased pressure in veins. • Form large bulbous protrusion. Veins Summary - Blood Vessels Different structures = Different functions Structure Feature Function Large arteries (very low resistance) Conductance Distribute and deliver blood to distal vessels. Arterioles (smooth muscle walls) Resistance Regulate local blood flow by vasodilation (↑ flow) or vasoconstriction (↓ flow) Capillaries (very thin walls) Exchange system Transfer of materials between blood and tissue Venules and veins (thin-walled, low- resistance) Capacitance Collection and storage (reservoir) of blood and can increase blood to the heart when required. 100% Lungs Left side of heartRight side of heart Digestive system (Hepatic portal system) 21% 6% Liver 20% Kidneys Skin 9% Brain 13% Heart muscle 3% Skeletal muscle 15% Other Bone 8% 5% Blood flow through the system (Renal portal system) What drives the blood to flow through circulation and heart Flow (F)= Pressure gradient (P1-P2) Resistance(R) Pressure gradient = Flow x resistance • Ohm’s law • Flow (Q)= Pressure gradient (P1-P2) Resistance (R) • Hagen-Poisseuille equation: → Q = ΔP x π.r4 / 8ηL Radius of the arterioles can be regulated • Most NB factor in controlling resistance to flow The dynamics of blood flow Vasoconstriction Vasodilation R = 8ηL R ≈ 1/r4 πr4 η= viscosity L= length of system r=radius of vessel Changes in resistance (TPR) R = 8ηL R ≈ 1/r4 πr4 r=2 then R ≈ 1/r4 ie.

R ≈ 1/1 R ≈ 1 by decreasing r by half R is increased by 16 Vasoconstriction Vasodilation • Very small changes in radius of arterioles result in large changes in resistance • That is why arterioles = taps • Switch off blood flow to areas to maintain flow to other area e.g. ↑ BP → SNS → vasoconstriction →↓ Blood flow to periphery but maintain to vital organ (brain, heart).

Consequences of hypertensionTherapy for hypertension • Main objective = BP < 140/90 mm Hg. • Non-pharmacological. • 6 – 12 months. • Depending on other risk factors. • Pharmacological. • Only after lifestyle adjustments. • Or with hypertensive urgency / emergency. • BP > 160/100 mm Hg. • With additional lifestyle interventions. Pharmacological interventions • Diuretics. • Thiazide, Loop & aldosterone antagonist. • Decrease vascular volume & CO. • β-adrenergic blockers. • Decrease HR and CO. • Decrease renin release - ↓RAAS activation. • ACE inhibitors. • Prevent conversion of angiotensin I → angiotensin II. • Angiotensin II receptor blockers. • Calcium channel receptor blockers. • Inhibit movement of Ca2+ into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. • ↓SMC tone in arterioles - ↓ TPR. • ↓contractility and HR. • Influence venous vasomotor tone - ↓ venous return - ↓CO. • α-adrenergic receptor antagonists. • Reduce effect of SNS on SMC. • Centrally acting adrenergic antagonists. • Direct acting smooth muscle vasodilators. Shock (circulatory failure) • Not a specific disease but a syndrome. • Occurs with many life-threatening conditions or disease states. • Acute failure of circulatory system to supply tissues and organs with adequate blood resulting in cellular hypoxia. • Can occur due to • Alteration in cardiac function (cardiogenic shock). • Decreased blood volume (hypovolemic shock). • Excessive vasodilation with misdistribution of blood (vasogenic shock). Cardiogenic shock • Heart fails to pump blood in order to meet the body’s demands. • Acute – MI, arrhythmias, surgery. • Chronic – end stage cardiomyopathy, CAD. • Decreased CO & SV • SNS & Angiotensin II effects? • Increased preload and afterload even further. • Eventually ↓cardiac function due to poor coronary perfusion. Hypovolemic shock • Diminished blood volume (15-20%). • External loss hemorrhage. • Plasma (severe burns). • ECF (dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea). • Blood donation? • 10 – 25% blood loss. • Arterial pressure maintained. • 35-45% blood loss. • CO & BP = decreased. Vasogenic shock • Capacity of vasculature expands. • Normal blood volume does not fill the circulatory system. Three patterns of vasogenic shock: 1. Neurogenic shock (decreased sympathetic control). 2. Anaphylactic shock (severe systemic allergic reaction). 3. Sepsis and septic shock (severe infection and/or systemic inflammation). ShockStroke volume (mls) Filling volumes (mls) Cardiogenic shock Hypovolaemic shock Vasogenic/Neurogenic/Septic shock Decreased cardiac output BP = CO x TPR Low blood pressure Explanation: Decreased CO that is not adequately compensated for. High pulse rate Explanation: Sympathetic effects mediated by baroreceptor and CNS ischaemic response. Pale, cold to the touch and sweating Explanation: Sympathetic effects mediated by baroreceptor and CNS ischaemic response. Plethoric, warm to the touch and sweating Explanation: Septic shock. Low urine output Explanation: Sympathetic effects mediated by baroreceptor and CNS ischaemic response, decreased renal perfusion, and effects of the RAAS and ADH. Signs of shock and it’s causes Circulatory shock • Hypoperfusion of tissue. • Inflammatory mediators released. • Cellular metabolism impaired. • Excessive lactic acid production (as cells have to rely on anaerobic metabolism). • Increased hydrogen (acid base) (deranges enzymatic systems responsible for energy production, limiting the capability of the heart and other tissues to produce ATP). • Reduced ATP production. • ATP needed for most cellular processes. • Cellular destruction. • Need to be reversed. Complications of shock • Acute respiratory distress syndrome. • Reduced gas exchange, hypoxemia, alveolar collapse. • Acute renal failure. • Impaired renal perfusion – tubular necrosis. • GIT complications. • Disseminated intravascular coagulation. • Activation of coagulation. • Increased risk of bleeding (depleted platelets). • Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. • Homeostasis cannot be maintained in organs.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
