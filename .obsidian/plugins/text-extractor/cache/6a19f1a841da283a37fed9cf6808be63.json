SUMMARY .................................................................... 185 1. INTRODUCTION The first biomaterials as we know them today were applied in medicine in the late 1940s and 1950s. These materials were off-the-shelf, originally developed for other applications and applied to medicine by pioneering physicians (1, 2). For example, a 1958 textbook on vascular surgery described the construction of vascular prostheses as follows: The Terylene, Orlon or nylon cloth is bought from a draper’s shop and cut with pinking shears to the required shape. It is then sewn with thread of similar material into a tube and sterilized by autoclaving before use. (3, p. 179) In 1960, a seminal paper (4) proposed properties that might be desirable for a biomaterial and then described the chemical design of such a biomaterial, incidentally launching the field of hydrogels as we know them today. There has been much progress since that groundbreaking publication. Biomaterials and medical devices fabricated from them have evolved to a $300-billion- plus worldwide endeavor that saves lives and improves the quality of life for millions. There are 172 RatnerAnnu.

BE21CH07_Ratner ARjats.cls May 6, 2019 10:38 hundreds of commercially available and custom-synthesized biomaterials. The objective of this review article is to highlight the newer themes that are taking biomaterials into the future, as well as to address the intellectual, technical, and regulatory barriers that must be transcended for progress. A hallmark of the biomaterials field has been its multidisciplinarity. In 2011, Sharp & Langer (5, p. 527) proposed that a third revolution in biomedical science is approaching, “where multidis- ciplinary thinking and analysis will permit the emergence of new scientific principles and where engineers and physical scientists are equal partners with biologists and clinicians in addressing many of the new medical challenges.” They referred to this revolution as “convergence.” The field of biomaterials started with physicians, then embraced engineers, and was energized and le- gitimized by the molecular biology revolution. Many of the practitioners of biomaterials science and engineering today can best be defined by convergence. This is a great strength of the field. Figure 1 illustrates the facile integration of many disciplines into the field we refer to today as biomaterials. Fifteen years ago, Ratner & Bryant (2) published an article in the Annual Review of Biomed- ical Engineering titled “Biomaterials: Where We Have Been and Where We Are Going.” The review traced the roots of modern-day biomaterials, addressed the state of the art in 2004, and explored then-emerging trends that might influence the field. Twelve years after that review was published, the 2016 World Biomaterials Congress, held in Montreal, attracted more than 4,000 participants and had nearly 3,000 presentations and posters. In contrast, the first World Bioma- terials Congress, held in Vienna in 1980, had some 200 participants. The growth of the field has been exceptional and parallels growth in biomaterials applications in medical devices, biosensors, microfluidics, drug delivery, cell culture, and so forth. It is an appropriate time to reexamine the field of biomaterials and highlight developments that seem likely to transition from the research community to medicine and commercialization in the next decade.

BE21CH07_Ratner ARjats.cls May 6, 2019 10:38 Section 2 of this review describes biomaterials as of 2018 and some of the barriers that must be addressed. Sections 3 and 4 highlight exciting trends that will continue to strongly influence biomaterial and medical device development. These sections are necessarily brief because so much is happening in the field that a comprehensive review would require a thick biomaterials textbook [to which this author has already contributed (1)]. Section 5 discusses key trends, particularly those of interest to this author. Other developments are mentioned, though not expanded upon. This article concludes in Section 6 with comments on real medical needs and transition to the clinic. 2. BEEN THERE, DONE THAT As described above, biomaterials have evolved from improvised medical adjuncts exploiting com- mercially available materials to a formalized, multidisciplinary field represented by thousands of researchers and scientific societies, a multitude of journals, a thriving industry, and numerous ap- plications. Table 1 presents a partial list of important applications. The growth and success of the biomaterials field are apparent (hence the “been there, done that”). Yet to continue its growth, and reinforce its significance for medicine and biology, several issues must be addressed, some of which are described in the following subsections. Where exciting and potentially game-changing developments are described in later sections of this review article, consider them in light of these barriers and concerns. 2.1. The Meaning of “Biocompatibility” Understanding the term “biocompatibility” is crucial for appreciating the difference between “ma- terials” and “biomaterials.” Biomaterials should, of course, be biocompatible. The term first ap- peared in the literature around 1970, when Homsy (6) demonstrated that the quantity of low- molecular-weight substances extracted from various materials correlated with in vitro cell death. The implication was that materials that were free of extractables would be biocompatible. This publication and many subsequent studies led up to the ASTM International and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards for biocompatibility, which describe many tests involving extracts from materials that are assessed for bioreaction both in vitro and in vivo (e.g., ISO 10993). Biocompatibility is also examined via in vivo implantation, typically subdermally or intramus- cularly. The expected outcome for a biocompatible implant is as follows: After 1 month, the implant is completely surrounded by a thin (50–200-μm), avascular, collagenous sac. The sac is nonadherent to the implant, and the reaction site is relatively quiescent. This in vivo reaction to biocompatible biomaterials is referred to as the foreign-body reaction (FBR) (Figure 2), and this reaction is observed with most all “biocompatible” implants, be they hard, soft, metallic, ceramic, polymeric, hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and so forth. Biocompatibility has been defined as the “abil- ity of a material to perform with an appropriate host response in a specific application” (7). This definition, though accurate, offers no insights into biocompatibility mechanisms, no instruction for how to test biocompatibility, and no path to optimization or enhancing biocompatibility. The problem with this definition is that it seems irrelevant for some new biomaterials concepts that drive a different in vivo reaction from the FBR. For example, poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) hydrogel, fabricated either as a solid slab or as a porous material with 40-μm-diameter interconnected pores, is implanted subcutaneously (8). The solid slab heals via the classic FBR. By contrast, the 40-μm porous pHEMA heals with no capsular sac and a highly vascularized tis- sue reconstruction. On the basis of the above definition, we have the same material (pHEMA) in the same application (subcutaneous implantation), but with two dramatically different healing 174 RatnerAnnu. Rev. Biomed.

Are both reactions biocompatible? Can a reaction where a material is walled off from the body be called biocompatible? Several strategies are being explored to generate healing re- sponses different from the FBR, which has dominated the biomaterials literature since the 1940s (see Section 3.7 for a description of these new strategies). 2.2. Lack of Progress in Clinical Performance for Many Biomaterials-Based Devices A crude, though conservative, estimate of the number of new biomaterials papers published each year is 10,000. One would suppose, based on so much research activity, that there should be huge advances in medicine driven by biomaterials. In fact, progress has been agonizingly slow. Table 1 shows that the majority of the biomaterials used in today’s medical devices would be familiar to www.annualreviews.org • Biomaterials: Evolving into the Future 175Annu. Rev. Biomed.

After 2–3 weeks, the implant will be completely surrounded and walled off from the body by a dense collagen capsule. a scientist working in this field in 1970. All these new developments, described in thousands of papers, have had limited impact on clinical medicine. In many areas of medicine, the lack of progress in biomaterials-driven medical devices has had serious consequences for patients. Consider the small-diameter vascular prosthesis. The fea- sibility of such a prosthesis was demonstrated more than 70 years ago (9). Today, there are no commercially available small-diameter vascular grafts. More than a million leg amputations glob- ally per year might be prevented if such a device existed, and coronary artery surgery might be greatly simplified for millions more patients. The small-diameter vascular graft, a device typi- cally composed of biomaterials, has been described in roughly 2,500 papers, according to Google Scholar. Most of these papers demonstrate good to excellent results in animal trials. So why have none of them made it to human application? This is not a simple question, and a detailed an- swer is beyond the scope of this article. However, some factors to consider are how we define biocompatibility, our understanding of blood compatibility, the appropriateness of the animal models used, surgical issues, the complex regulatory environment, and commercialization market analysis. The previous paragraph mentions blood compatibility as a factor in vascular graft success. The first papers to seriously study blood interaction with materials were published in the 1940s. A Google Scholar search for the term “blood compatibility” yields some 32,000 papers on this subject. To this day, we have no materials that function long term without systemic anticoagulation in many complex environments. We have no precise definition for “blood compatible” and no standardized, generally accepted tests for blood compatibility. Some of the reasons for this lack of progress have been addressed in the literature (10–12). There are many other areas where the lack of clinical progress in biomaterials-based medical devices is of concern. Examples include device-centered infection, longevity of implanted record- ing electrodes, hip implant longevity, and pelvic mesh complications. 176 RatnerAnnu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2019.21:171-191.

In Vitro Versus In Vivo Versus in Animals or in Humans In 2018, meaningful testing of biomaterials and devices for biocompatibility, durability, and func- tionality often remains a concern. There are many applications for biomaterials that do not re- quire in vivo application. Testing is simplified for these materials and applications (e.g., cell culture surfaces and in vitro diagnostic devices). However, biomaterials make the greatest impact when directly applied in vivo to address human health needs. Performance testing is rarely done in hu- mans without preclinical animal trials. How we assess performance to ensure safety and efficacy in humans is complex and largely in need of significant rethinking. Typically, the first in vivo assessments of implanted biomaterials are in rodents (rats and mice). Such in vivo tests are relatively inexpensive, engender lower ethical expectations, and are done in a mammalian species with some phylogenic connection to the human species. Healing in soft tissue and in skin has shown parallels between humans and mice. However, many promising outcomes in rodents have not been replicated in clinical trials in human populations. First, rodents are not humans—evolution has separated the species with many significant differences. Second, anatomic biomechanics often differs significantly between humans and animals, particularly rodents. For example, mechanical loading of the hip joint in humans has no direct parallel in the animal world. Third, the small size of rodents compared with humans requires development of specialized implants that can be substantially different from those scaled to human use. For example, in testing of cardiovascular stents in rat, a 1-mm-diameter stent is often needed; no stent with such dimensions exists for use in humans. Finally, testing is typically done in young rodents, yet most medical implants are placed in older humans, who have greatly compromised healing abilities compared with young animals. The complexities of testing relevant in vivo performance parameters for medical devices remain an obstacle with challenging physiologic, anatomical, and ethical issues that must be addressed. 3. EVOLVING INTO THE FUTURE The previous section highlights some of the challenges biomedical engineers face in developing the next generation of improved biomaterials-based medical devices. Still, the creativity of bioma- terials scientists in conceiving solutions to complex medical and biological problems is strikingly evident from a casual scan of the literature. This section describes technologies that can advance the performance and functionality of biomaterials. These developments must be examined in light of some of the complexities described in Section 2, but still have great potential to improve the way the research and development community interfaces synthetic materials with living systems and addresses significant medical problems. 3.1. Biomaterials That Are Biodegradable, Smart (Responsive), and Nonfouling In the 1960s and 1970s, biomaterials were largely inert and “nonresponsive.” Also, they were typ- ically designed to be biostable. Polyethylenes, silicones, polyurethanes, fluoropolymers, and inert metals and ceramics dominated the biomaterials literature. Beginning in the 1980s, there was an outpouring of creative materials design from biomaterials scientists integrating engineered func- tionality into biomaterials. In particular, degradability, environmental responsiveness, and con- trolled biointeraction with cells and proteins were added to the tool chest of biomaterials design. The following subsections consider these visionary advances in biomaterials, transitioning de- sign possibilities into the twenty-first century. Note that many of the advances in biomaterials described here interface with those in other sections of this review. For example, biodegradable www.annualreviews.org • Biomaterials: Evolving into the Future 177Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2019.21:171-191. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by University of the Witwatersrand on 07/24/23. For personal use only. BE21CH07_Ratner ARjats.cls May 6, 2019 10:38 polymers (see Section 3.2) can be polymerized with controlled radical polymerization methods, allowing unparalleled control of molecular weights and chain heterogeneity (Section 3.6). Such precision-controlled polymers have also become integral to engineered scaffolds in tissue engi- neering (Section 3.7). Another example is biodegradable gelatins (Section 3.2), which have been modified with methacrylate groups and used in tissue engineering (Section 3.7) and bioprinting (Section 3.5). 3.2. Biodegradable Biomaterials In the late 1960s and 1970s, researchers began to understand the potential of designing biomate- rials so that they perform their intended function and are then resorbed into the body. An early ex- ample of a clinical application of a biodegradable polymer was the DexonTM suture, a poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) polyester, which has been in use since about 1970. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) was syn- thesized as early as 1944, and PGA was first studied around 1954, although medical applications were not considered in this early era. Lactic acid–glycolic acid copolymers developed specifically for medical use may trace their origin to a 1979 paper by Gilding & Reed (13). Polycaprolac- tone (PCL), although first synthesized in the 1930s, was also introduced early in the history of medical biodegradable polymers and was used in clinical trials of a contraceptive device in the 1980s. All these polymers degrade to small, nontoxic molecules by hydrolysis of ester bonds. Be- cause water is essential for their breakdown, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) units were incorporated into the polyester chain backbone to permit water penetration and speed up the degradation rate. Useful reviews describing these polymers, degradation mechanisms, and applications are avail- able elsewhere (14–16). The terms “degradation,” “biodegradation,” “bioabsorption,” “bioresorp- tion,” “erosion,” “bioerosion,” “surface erosion,” and “bulk erosion” were defined and introduced to the community to clarify different classes of degradable polymers (15). Investigators quickly realized that many natural polymers could be employed as biodegradable biomaterials. Combina- tions of synthetic polymers and natural polymers are readily synthesized, for example, methacry- lated gelatins (17). Also, synthetic creativity led to many new classes of biodegradable polymers. Table 2 lists a number of the biodegradable polymer classes used in medicine today. There have been numerous applications of biodegradable polymers in the clinic, including bone screws, other orthopedic devices, sutures, adhesion prevention devices, and drug delivery systems. A biodegradable device that has garnered much interest is the degradable endovascular (coronary) stent. Synthesizing and fabricating such stents with appropriate strength, flexibility, and degradation rates have exploited advances in polymer chemistry and physics. Although problems with first-generation devices have been observed (18), the possibility of restoring normal vasomo- tion and elasticity to the coronary artery after the stent fully degrades is an exciting possibility.

BE21CH07_Ratner ARjats.cls May 6, 2019 10:38 Though polymers dominate the literature on biodegradables, biodegradable and bioresorbable metals have been increasingly explored in recent years and translated to clinical practice. Metals used in applications requiring biodegradability may be magnesium based (fast degradation rates), iron based (slow degradation rates), or zinc based (intermediate degradation rates). Numerous alloys have been explored to address issues of mechanical properties, degradation rates, and cor- rosion properties. Along with magnesium, iron, and zinc components, alloys may contain calcium, strontium, silicon, tin, manganese, and silver. Predominant applications include cardiovascular stents and orthopedic applications. Reviews of degradable metals for biomedical applications are available elsewhere (19, 20). Biodegradable ceramic biomaterials are also used in medicine. Predominant classes of bio- ceramics include hydroxyapatite [HAP; Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] and tricalcium phosphate [TCP; Ca3(PO4)2]. HAP breaks down very slowly in vivo, whereas β-TCP is resorbed faster. Of par- ticular note in bioresorbable ceramics is Bioglass 45S5 (45 wt% SiO2, 24.5 wt% CaO, 24.5 wt% Na2O, 6.0 wt% P2O5), although many other bioactive glass formulations have been developed. Bioglass 45S5 has been used in as many as a million dental and orthopedic procedures and in repair of the bones in the ear (ossicles). Bioglass and other bioactive ceramics are slowly re- sorbed into the body and, in bone, show direct bone-bonding and regenerative potential (21). Many blends of synthetic, biodegradable polymers and degradable ceramics have also been explored. 3.3. Smart, Environmentally Responsive Biomaterials The first “smart” (i.e., environmentally responsive) polymeric material was probably a pH- sensitive, artificial muscle–like, swelling–deswelling hydrogel developed in 1950 by Kuhn et al. (22). Hydrogels showing pH sensitivity were later used in an enzyme-driven, glucose-responsive drug delivery system, an early example of a smart engineered system that responded to its envi- ronment in a medically relevant manner (23). However, it was a 1987 paper by Dong & Hoffman (24) demonstrating the temperature responsiveness of poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM) hydrogels that truly launched the field of smart polymers. The study and uses of smart polymers have recently accelerated, with hundreds of articles and many applications (25). Smart responsiveness can be triggered by temperature, pH, light, magnetic fields, ultrasonic energy, chemical gradients, enzymatic sensitivity, humidity, hypoxia, mechanical force, and ionic strength. Drug and molecule delivery applications have dominated the field, with the drug payload delivered via an external stimulus to the delivery system (26). Some examples include the use of focused ultrasound to deliver antibiotics or insulin (26), pNIPAM for thermoregulated biotin binding and release (27), and magnetic fields to deliver drugs on demand (28, 29). An important application of smart polymers has been in thermally responsive surfaces for cell attachment and detachment (30, 31). This smart-surface concept launched the field of cell sheet engineering (32) and found clinical application in cornea surgery (33). As the field of smart biomaterials continues to evolve, “smarter” materials are being de- veloped. A recent publication (34) introduced a modular synthetic strategy to create hydro- gels that degrade in response to user-defined combinations of environmental inputs following Boolean YES/OR/AND logic. A YES response is engineered through the incorporation of a sin- gle stimulus-labile moiety within the material cross-linker; an OR response is obtained when two orthogonal scissile functionalities are included in series within the cross-linker; and an AND re- sponse is obtained when two degradable functionalities are included in parallel. Logic gates can be hierarchically combined to generate higher-order logic responses. www.annualreviews.org • Biomaterials: Evolving into the Future 179Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2019.21:171-191.

Nonfouling Biomaterials Although hydrogels were first observed to show relatively low protein and cell adhesion in the 1970s (35), the field of nonfouling biomedical polymers may have been launched by a perspec- tive by Merrill & Salzman (36) and a study on platelet resistance by Nagaoka et al. (37), both in 1983. These studies highlighted PEG structures for nonfouling applications. The field of non- fouling surfaces for biomedical applications has blossomed, and there are now thousands of papers on this subject (for useful insights into nonfouling behavior, see References 38–42). A few appli- cations include blood-contacting devices, surfaces resistant to bacterial colonization, inhibition of membrane fouling, inhibition of protein drug adsorption to storage containers, prevention of nonspecific adsorption to biosensors, and low-adhesion cell culture dishes. Exceptional fouling resistance has been observed with zwitterionic polymer compositions (43). Zwitterionic polymeric systems based on 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine demonstrate outstanding fouling resistance as well as penetration through biological membranes and excellent lubricious qualities (44). Polymeric slabs of cross-linked carboxybetaine methacrylate have been implanted subcutaneously for periods as long as 3 months with no evidence of a collagen capsule or FBR (45). Other types of zwitterionic polymers that have exhibited good nonfouling properties include polysulfobetaines (43) and alternating polypeptides of glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K) (i.e., EKEKEK-type molecules) (46). 3.5. Novel Biomaterial Fabrication Methods Biomaterials created in the 1970s and 1980s were compositionally consistent and homogeneous in the surface (x,y) plane. Such uniformity was thought to be important for reproducible, practical biomaterials. However, in the late 1980s and 1990s, researchers began to understand that biology uses gradients and spatially distributed chemistries that could be useful in biomaterials (47–49). Another important insight was that three-dimensional (3D) structures are important for cell phenotype and tissue recapitulation (50–52). Tissue-engineering scaffolds and so-called cells in gels benefit from the 3D effect. More recently, patterned two-dimensional (2D) and 3D organs on a chip (53) and 3D organoids (52) have assumed increased importance, and both make use of biomaterials. Templating of biomaterials to create 3D porous scaffolds can be readily performed with salt leaching (54) or, for increased precision in fabrication, by sphere templating (8). However, the ability to fabricate precision structures for medical implants, tissue engineering, and in vitro cell culture has been revolutionized by the advent of additive manufacturing, often called 3D print- ing. This technology originated in the 1980s by pioneers such as Hideo Kodama and Chuck Hull. Biomaterials scientists were quick to embrace the power of this technology—in the field of bio- materials, chemistry has always been strong, but fabrication methods, particularly for complex shapes, lagged far behind. Many modalities for 3D printing have been developed, including UV polymerization of monomers (stereolithography), laser sintering (metals and plastics), and extru- sion (fused deposition). High-spatial-resolution 3D printing methods have also been developed (55). High-speed 3D printing could lead to applications of this mode of fabrication to the large- scale manufacture of medical devices (56). Boland and colleagues (57) were some of the earliest pioneers in a subcategory of this field now known as bioprinting; they first demonstrated 3D printing with biomaterials-relevant molecules and living cells. Many review articles discuss possible uses of 3D printing in biomaterials (58, 59). The potential to control biomechanics with 3D-printed structures to match tissue properties is excellent (60). 180 RatnerAnnu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2019.21:171-191.

New Polymerization and Synthetic Strategies A significant amount of biomaterials research for application in medicine is focused on polymers, but polymers have intrinsic limitations. On one hand, synthetic polymers have lacked the molec- ular weight control and chain sequence distribution control observed in natural polymers. On the other hand, natural polymers suffer from seasonal variations in chemistry resulting from the liv- ing organisms that produce them and from the “bioburden” of the natural environments in which they are isolated. Living free radical polymerization methods were first developed in the 1970s, permitting improved control of molecular weights and sequence distributions. In 1995, Wang & Matyjaszewski (61) developed atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), which enabled sim- pler and more robust controlled polymerization. Reversible addition–fragmentation chain trans- fer (RAFT) polymerization was developed in 1998 (62). ARGET (activators regenerated by elec- tron transfer) polymerization, which permits controlled radical polymerization in the presence of oxygen and with very low copper ion concentrations, was developed in 2007 (62). These meth- ods revolutionize the ability to synthesize precision polymers well suited for biomedical appli- cations. For example, Hong et al. (63) readily immobilized nonfouling carboxybetaine brushes to silicone rubber surfaces by using ARGET. In another study, Atzet et al. (64) prepared a biodegrad- able pHEMA by generating pHEMA blocks with a molecular weight of 6,000 Da (water-soluble pHEMA units) polymerized from a dibromoisobutyryl-terminated PCL by using ATRP. Das et al. (65) used RAFT polymerization to incorporate a ciprofloxacin unit linked to a methacrylate group into copolymer and diblock copolymer designs suitable for antibiotic delivery. Another synthetic strategy that has had a great impact on our ability to synthesize precision bio- materials is click chemistry. Click chemistry, a term coined by K. Barry Sharpless, is characterized by a so-called one-pot reaction, insensitivity to water, absence of by-products, rapidity, irreversibly high yield of a single reaction product, and high end-product specificity (66). The best-known click reaction is the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of terminal acetylenes with azides; other well-known reactions include Michael addition, Diels–Alder reactions, thiol-ene chemistry, and oxime condensation (67). In 2010, Bertozzi and colleagues (68) developed a copper ion–free click reaction based on cyclooctyne reagents. This reaction could be used to induce click reactions in living cells and living animals. 3.7. Regenerative Medicine and Tissue Engineering Biomaterials developed during the period 1960–1980 attracted much interest due to their po- tential to replace damaged or missing anatomical structures with an inert synthetic. As described above, a problem with such inert materials is that they trigger the FBR. Beginning in the 1980s, researchers began to envision biomaterials, especially scaffolds, as means of assisting the regenera- tion of damaged or missing tissues. The idea of regenerating rather than replacing was a paradigm shift led by intellectual pioneers such as Ioannis Yannas, Joseph Vacanti, Charles Vacanti, Robert Langer, and Stephen Badylak and their colleagues (69–72). The subject of tissue engineering is too diverse and complex to review in an article of this length. However, a recent, significant volume reviewing much of the subject has just been published (73). Hundreds of books on the subject and many review articles offering an overview of tissue engineering are available (a Google Scholar search for “tissue engineering review articles” since 2014 suggests an astonishing 46,500 articles). Relevant for the purposes of this review is that tissue engineering makes extensive use of bioma- terials. Many of the biomaterials and fabrication methods used to prepare scaffolds are described above. This section discusses decellularized tissues, the role of macrophages and other immune cells, and biomaterials that heal and integrate. www.annualreviews.org • Biomaterials: Evolving into the Future 181Annu.

BE21CH07_Ratner ARjats.cls May 6, 2019 10:38 Synthetic polymeric and ceramic scaffolds have been widely investigated in the context of tissue engineering. The decellularization process creates scaffolds from natural biomaterials (predomi- nantly extracellular matrix components) (74) that nature intended to come into contact with tissues and organs, with void spaces ideally suited to cells, blood vessels, and nerves. Decellularized tis- sues have been used in millions of human surgeries and often lead to regenerative reconstruction of tissues. Interestingly, these implants act more like degradable biomaterials and, in the process of in vivo degradation, release peptides and other components that seem highly proregenerative. Several excellent review and technical articles on decellularized tissues and their use in medicine are available (75–78). Researchers studying tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and healing of implanted bio- materials have come to appreciate the role of macrophages and other immune cells in these pro- cesses. The biomaterials research community was alerted to the role of the macrophage following the publication of a seminal 1984 review by Anderson & Miller (79). Concerning the FBR, can we develop biomaterials that heal and integrate without the foreign- body capsule? Such biomaterials, free of a collagen shell, would lead to better implant electrodes, longer-lasting implanted biosensors, consistent release for implanted drug delivery systems, im- proved vascular prostheses, capsular contraction–free breast implants, hydrocephalous shunts and glaucoma drainage shunts that do not fail fibrotically, and many other advances for the millions of devices implanted in humans each year. Fortunately, a community of researchers is now working on creating biomaterials that show improved healing and integration, rather than encapsulation. Table 3 summarizes many of these developments. 4. A POTPOURRI OF ADDITIONAL, EXCITING THEMES IN BIOMATERIALS Due to length constraints, it is not possible to appropriately address all of the exciting develop- ments in biomaterials. This section briefly presents some of the most interesting topics, in no special order, with relevant references.

BE21CH07_Ratner ARjats.cls May 6, 2019 10:38 4.1. Mechanotransduction The understanding that mechanics and mechanotransduction play a key role in biological reac- tions to biomaterials in vitro and in vivo is relatively recent. Important developments have taken place in theorizing on the subject of mechanical forces on cells (89), documenting the importance of this mechanical response (90), measuring the response (91), and understanding the basic biology driving it (92, 93). 4.2. The Innate and Adaptive Immune Systems The role of the innate and adaptive immune systems in the in vivo performance of implanted materials has garnered much attention over the past 10 years. The term “immunoengineering” is now used to designate this subfield, although this term had a somewhat different meaning when originally coined (94). The special role of the macrophage in this process was demonstrated in 1984 (79). Recently, it has become clear that the macrophage can have many polarizations; some macrophages drive a healing reaction (these are often referred to as M2 macrophages), and oth- ers contribute to ongoing inflammation (M1 macrophages) (8, 95–97). The role of T cells and neutrophils in biomaterial healing has also been studied (98–100). 4.3. Nanotechnology Nanotechnology has had a huge impact on biomaterials. Of particular interest is the use of nanoparticles in drug delivery and imaging (101–103) and electrospinning of nanodimensioned fibers (104). Notably, nanoparticles may be able to penetrate the blood–brain barrier (103, 105). Of course, proteins and intracellular components are nanoscaled, so almost all protein-based research on and intracellular delivery with biomaterials might be referred to as “nano.” 4.4. Peptidomimetics, Peptide Amphiphiles, and Molecular Self-Assembly The ability to design novel materials and molecular structures has been greatly enhanced by advances in molecular design using peptidomimetics (peptide-like structural units) (106, 107), peptide amphiphiles (108), and the general rules of molecular self-assembly (109). Some self- assembled nanomaterials based on peptide amphiphiles are approaching clinical translation for regenerative medicine (110). 4.5. Layer-by-Layer Approaches Layer-by-layer approaches to the creation of biomaterials and surfaces originated in research by Decher and colleagues (111) in the 1980s. In recent years, other research groups have embraced this flexible, robust synthetic method, which involves reaction of alternate layers of oppositely charged large and small molecules to create improved biomaterials and surfaces (112–114). 4.6. Cell Encapsulation Microcapsules for artificial cells were conceived around 1964 (115). Early concepts of cell encap- sulation in biomaterials date to the 1980s (116). The possibility of using biomaterials to surround cells so as to allow metabolic transport but also to isolate the implanted, encapsulated cells from the immune system continues to inspire biomaterials researchers (117–120). Some concepts involving cell encapsulation have already been translated to the clinic; an example is the use of encapsulated pig islet cells to treat diabetes in humans (121). www.annualreviews.org • Biomaterials: Evolving into the Future 183Annu.

BE21CH07_Ratner ARjats.cls May 6, 2019 10:38 4.7. Neuroelectrodes and the Brain–Computer Interface The potential of integrating recording electrodes into the brain and using those electrodes to control motor function or mechanical limbs in patients with impaired mobility has been clinically proven (122). Issues of biocompatibility associated with the FBR and with electrode movement present barriers to widespread application of this exciting technology (123, 124). 4.8. Disease Modeling (Organs on a Chip and Scaffolds) Organs on a chip and the whole body on a chip are exciting concepts that may permit the early evaluation of drugs and physiological conditions without the need for animals or humans (125, 126). Such microphysiological platforms make extensive use of biomaterials (127). Biomaterial scaffolds are also being applied to cancer research and models of tumor formation (128). 4.9. Carbons (Graphene, Carbon Nanotubes) Throughout much of modern history, carbon was thought to exist in only three forms, or al- lotropes: amorphous carbon, graphite, and diamond. Following the discovery of Buckminster- fullerene (which led to the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its discoverers), other forms of carbon (e.g., graphene, carbon nanotubes) have been isolated and explored. The long his- tory of the use of carbon in medicine (129), its inertness, and the unique properties of other forms of carbon have stimulated much contemporary research into carbon for biomedical ap- plications. In particular, there have been numerous papers on applications of carbon nanotubes (130) and on the potential use of graphene in medicine (131). 4.10. Microneedle Arrays Microneedle arrays are ingenious applications that combine modern fabrication technologies, en- gineered materials, and medical applications. The contemporary interest in these multispiked ar- rays can be traced to a 1998 paper by Prausnitz and colleagues (132), which led to an avalanche of publications exploiting this idea (133). Microneedle arrays have been fabricated from poly(methyl methacrylate), PLA, PGA, polycarbonate, polystyrene, poly(vinyl alcohol), silicon, and metals and have been explored for drug delivery, biosensing, adhesive applications, and cosmetic applications. 5. TOWARD THE CLINIC In recent years, there has been strong interest in translating biomedical concepts and devel- opments from the lab bench to the clinic. New devices are reaching patients, as shown in ad- vertisements in many medical specialty publications, for example, Endovascular Today (https:// evtoday.com). The ingenuity of the devices, their careful engineering, and their focus on meet- ing patient needs are impressive. However, with relevance to this review, the biomaterials that make up most of these devices could have been found in an article on biomaterials written 50 years ago. Companies prefer to use well-established biomaterials that are familiar to the reg- ulatory authorities and are documented in materials’ master files. But consider the complica- tion rates of many existing biomaterials and devices associated with fibrosis, thrombosis, loos- ening, infection, or mechanical failure. In the future, such problems could be minimized with improved, engineered biomaterials. New materials will make it to market if biomedical engineers take the following steps: (a) Master (or at least appreciate) the commercialization points shown in 184 RatnerAnnu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2019.21:171-191. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by University of the Witwatersrand on 07/24/23. For personal use only.

Exit strategies Table 4;(b) meet early in the development phase with the relevant regulatory agency (e.g., the US Food and Drug Administration), which is poised to partner with device developers to provide the requirements and tests needed to get to market; (c) work closely with clinicians to understand needs, hospital work flow, and concerns; and (d) consider economics early on—the device or mate- rial might be more expensive than the alternatives on the market now, but are there extrapolations that will justify that expense with significantly reduced hospitalization costs later on? Areas likely to have clinical impact in the near future include but are not limited to cardiovascu- lar disease, kidney disease and dialysis, diabetes, cancer, and brain disorders.

SUMMARY The quotation given in Section 1 from an early (1958) text on cardiovascular surgery on how to make a vascular graft is repeated here: The Terylene, Orlon or nylon cloth is bought from a draper’s shop and cut with pinking shears to the required shape. It is then sewn with thread of similar material into a tube and sterilized by autoclaving before use. (3, p. 179) Indeed, we have been there, done that, and are charging into the future with biomaterials. The creativity and talent seen in the biomaterials field have been stunning and continue unabated. The central issue will be bringing this outpouring of creativity and innovation to the patient. Some of the points elaborated in Section 4 of this review may help.
