Specific receptor - mediated endocytosis 2. Pinocytosis Non - specific engulfment of cytosolic droplets containing extracellular fluid 3. Phagocytosis 4. Autophagy Micro and macro Intracellular proteins and organelles Autophagy: Destruction of large cytoplasmic contents Functions: Destroys organelles That are no longer needed or don’t function properly Destroys large protein aggregates Proteins that are: Abnormal No longer requir ed by the cell Foreign proteins Mutant proteins Oxidised/denatured proteins Incorrectly folded proteins Activated in starvation To produce nutrients for the cell Protein folding: An incorrectly/incompletely folded protein is inserted into hsp60 - like protein complex (protein chaperone) The hydrophobic binding sites are exposed for a cap ATP is used and a GroES cap, caps the complex The protein is folded properly ATP is used and the cap is removed and the protein is released S imran Patel Determination of the levels of normal proteins in the cell: Production = loss or destruction of proteins Need for destruction of normal proteins: This depends on the requirement s or response of the cell Concentration and timing are important Eg of proteins that are regulated by level and time Transcription factors Cell cycle control proteins Inducible proteins DNA repair proteins NFkB signalling Proteasome: Substance that destroys a protein Fond in the nucleus and cytoplasm Components: Core particle Contains a catalytic (proteolytic) site Regulatory caps On each end Made of a base and lid Recognise which proteins need to be destroyed They unfold the protein and feed it into the core part icle Protect the entrance to the catalytic sites Ubiquitin (Ub) : Protein that is found everywhere Chain is attached to a target protein = polyubiquitin chain This signals that the protein needs to be destructed through proteasome action Polyubiquitin tagging: E1 (ubiquitin activating enzyme) primes the ubiquitin Requires ATP = energy Ubiquitin is activated by E1 Ub is then transferred to E2 (Ub ligase/Ub con jugating enzyme) The E1 acts as an escort and leaves after the Ub is delivered to E2 The E2 binds the Ub which is in contact with E3 S imran Patel E3 ligases: Catalyses transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine in the substrate protein The process is repeated so that a poly ubiquitin chain is formed on the protein Specificity of the polyUb tagging: a specific combination of E1, E2 and E3 will target a specific protein there are different types of E2 (±60) and E3(±600) and different combinations allows for different proteins to be targeted this allows the pathway to be specific and controlled Destruction of the protein: The target protein w/ the polyUb chain finds the proteasome It is fed into the cap and the polyUb chain is removed and released This is done in the cap The cap unfolds the protein Requires ATP The protein is fed into the proteasome so it enters the core p article with multiple catalytic sites The protein is digested completely and the digested material emerges from the other end of the proteasome (Cap) S imran Patel Changing the pathway: Done so that the pathway can be more specific and controlled Protein modification s: Phosphorylation: By protein kinase Unmasking: By protein dissociation Creation of destabalising N - terminus Changes to the E3 Ub ligase: Phosphorylation: By protein kinase Allosteric transition: Caused by ligand binding OR By protein subunit addition S imran Patel Role in the immune system: Proteasome is modified By using a different cap and proteolytic enzyme When a bacteria or virus is present The peptides are cut to a specific length and presented and this is done by proteasome Malfunction of the pathway: Can be associated with: Neurodegenerative conditions Eg: parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s Intracellular accumulation of misfolded proteins Mani pulation of the pathway: Bortezomib: Anticancer drug Block the proteasome and causes increase in apoptosis Decreases proliferation of some types of cancer cells Blocks NFkB signalling","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
