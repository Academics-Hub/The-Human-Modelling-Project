Lymphatic drainage: ▪ Lymphatic vessels in mesentery → Juxta-intestinal nodes → Mesenteric nodes → Superior central nodes → Superior mesenteric nodes ▪ Vessels from terminal ileum → ileocolic lymph nodes 8 ▪ Superior mesenteric nerve plexus → periarterial plexus ▪ Sympathetic ▪ Abdominopelvic splanchnic nerves (T8-10) ▪ Reduces motility of intestine & secretion ▪ Vasoconstrictor – reduce or stop digestion & making blood available for fight-or-flight response ▪ Parasympathetic ▪ Vagus (posterior trunk) ▪ Increases motility of intestine & secretion ▪ Sensory (visceral afferent) ▪ Insensitive to most pain stimuli ▪ Sensitive to distension 9 ▪ Consists of: ▪ Caecum ▪ Appendix ▪ Ascending, transverse, descending, & sigmoid colon ▪ Rectum ▪ Anal canal ▪ Large intestine can be distinguished from small intestine by: ▪ Omental appendices: small, fatty, omentum-like projections. ▪ A much greater internal diameter (caliber) 10 ▪ Teniae coli ▪ Thickened bands of smooth muscle ▪ Begin at base of appendix ▪ Run length of large intestine ▪ Splits to form three bands: ▪ Mesocolic – transverse & sigmoid mesocolons attached ▪ Omental – omental appendices attached ▪ Free – nothing attached ▪ Merge at rectosigmoid junction into a continuous longitudinal layer around rectum ▪ Haustra – sacculations of wall of colon between teniae (teniae shorter) 11 ▪ Blind intestinal pouch continuous with ascending colon (1st part) ▪ ≈7.5 cm in length & breadth ▪ Located in right lower quadrant in iliac fossa inferior to ileocaecal junction ▪ Usually lies within 2.5 cm of inguinal ligament ▪ Almost entirely enveloped by peritoneum (intraperitoneal) ▪ No mesentery (may be displaced from iliac fossa), but commonly bound to lateral abdominal wall by caecal folds of peritoneum 12 ▪ Ileum protrudes into caecum forming superior & inferior ileocolic lips ▪ Lips meet laterally to form frenula ▪ In living persons (endoscopically) it appears as an ileal papilla when closed ▪ Little support for sphincteric action as circular muscle around orifice poorly developed 13 ▪ Blind intestinal diverticulum (6-10cm long) ▪ Contains masses of lymphoid tissue ▪ Arises from posteromedial aspect of caecum inferior to ileocaecal junction ▪ Mesoappendix attaches to caecum & proximal appendix ▪ Position is variable, but usually retrocaecal 1415 ▪ Acute inflammation of the appendix ▪ Common cause of acute abdominal pain ▪ Tenderness over McBurney point ▪ Causes vary by age: ▪ Young: lymphatic follicles overgrown ▪ Older: faecolith ▪ Obstruction causes swelling and inflammation ▪ Pain: peri-umbilical → severe over right lower quadrant ▪ Treatment = appendectomy https://radiologyassistant.nl/img/containers/main/40-laparoscopic-appendectomy-1280x720.jpg/b52a9a177bb04fb9956ebfb1c451f80d.jpg

▪ Has 4 parts: ▪ Ascending ▪ Transverse ▪ Descending ▪ Sigmoid ▪ Arch around small intestine 16 ▪ Passes superiorly from caecum on right side of abdominal cavity ▪ Bends left at right colic (hepatic) flexure ▪ Narrower than caecum ▪ Secondarily retroperitoneal ▪ Covered by peritoneum anteriorly & on sides ▪ Separated from anterolateral abdominal wall by greater omentum ▪ Right paracolic gutter lies laterally 17 ▪ ≈ 45 cm long ▪ Most mobile part – usually hangs at level of umbilicus (L3) ▪ May extend into pelvis in tall thin people ▪ Crosses abdomen from right (hepatic) to left (splenic) colic flexure ▪ Transverse mesocolon ▪ Mesentery of transverse colon ▪ Root runs along inferior border of pancreas continuous with parietal peritoneum posteriorly 18 ▪ Secondarily retroperitoneal ▪ Between left colic flexure & left iliac fossa ▪ Becomes continuous with sigmoid colon ▪ Peritoneum covers colon anteriorly & laterally ▪ 33% of people have short mesentery, esp. in iliac fossa ▪ Has left paracolic gutter laterally 19 ▪ S-shaped ▪ Variable length (≈ 40 cm) ▪ Between descending colon (iliac fossa) & rectum (≈S3) ▪ Rectosigmoid junction indicated by end of teniae coli & omental appendices ▪ Long mesentery – freedom of movement ▪ Root of sigmoid mesocolon – inverted V- shape ▪ Extends 1st superomedially along external iliac vessels ▪ Then inferiomedially from common iliac bifurcation to anterior sacrum ▪ Omental (epiploic) appendices of sigmoid colon are long 20 ▪ Fixed ending of large intestine ▪ Subperitoneal (primarily retroperitoneal) ▪ Continuous with sigmoid colon at S3 ▪ Junction at lower end of mesentery ▪ Continuous inferior with anal canal 2122 ▪ Severe chronic inflammation (e.g. ulcerative colitis) or cancer ▪ Colectomy performed as treatment ▪ Ileostomy constructed ▪ Stoma = artificial opening ▪ Ileum passed through and sutured ▪ Allows exit of contents ▪ Colostomy equivalent but at colon ▪ Permanent vs temporary https://www.drnikhilagrawal.com/assets/images/ostomy-1.png ▪ SMA → ileocolic a. (caecum) → appendicular a. (appendix) ▪ SMA → ileocolic & right colic a. → ascending colon ▪ SMA → middle colic a. (mainly), Right & left colic a. (minor via marginal a.) → transverse colon ▪ IMA → left colic a. (descending colon) & sigmoid a. (sigmoid colon) ▪ Anastomose along colic margin forming continuous arterial channel – marginal a. (juxtacolic a.) 23 ▪ Caecum & appendix → Ileocolic v. → SMV → portal v. ▪ Ascending colon → Ileocolic & right colic veins → SMV → portal v. ▪ Transverse colon → Middle colic v. → SMV → portal v. ▪ Descending & sigmoid colon → Left colic v. & sigmoid v. → IMV → splenic v. → portal v. 24 ▪ Caecum & appendix → appendicular & ileocolic nodes → superior mesenteric nodes ▪ Ascending colon → epicolic & paracolic nodes → right colic nodes → superior mesenteric nodes ▪ Transverse colon → epicolic & paracolic nodes → middle colic nodes → superior mesenteric nodes ▪ Descending & sigmoid colon → epicolic & paracolic nodes → left colic nodes → inferior mesenteric nodes 25 ▪ Caecum, appendix, ascending & transverse colon: ▪ Sympathetic & parasympathetic in superior mesenteric plexus via periarterial plexuses ▪ Sympathetic – Abdominopelvic splanchnic nerves (T8-T12) ▪ Parasympathetic – vagus (posterior trunk) ▪ Descending & sigmoid colon: ▪ Sympathetic & parasympathetic fibers aborad to splenic flexure follow separate routes ▪ Sympathetic: ▪ Lumbar abdominopelvic splanchnic nerves (L1-2) → Inferior mesenteric plexus and ganglia → periarterial plexuses along IMA ▪ Parasympathetic: ▪ Pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2-4) NOT VAGUS!! → inferior hypogastric (pelvic) plexus 26","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
