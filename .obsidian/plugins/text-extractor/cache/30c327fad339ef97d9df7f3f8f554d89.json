Ending of 1st wk Blcle = blastocele Second week of development (1) Development of trophoblast • About 8ds after fertilization, blastocyst becomes buried in endometrium and inner 1/3 of myometrium • Trophoblast develops into 2 layers in region of contact between blastocyst and endometrium. • Cytotrophoblast: stem cell population • Syncytiotrophoblast: invasive fused cells (syncytium) derived from cytotrophoblast Secretes human chorionic gondadotropin (hCG) → maintains corpus luteum →continues to secrete estrogens and progesterone » Maintains uterine lining Second week of development (cont.) (2) Development of bilaminar embryo – Cells of embryoblast also differentiate into 2 layers around 8d after fertilizat. • Epiblast (col) (primitive ectoderm), • Hypoblast (primitive endoderm) *Bilaminar embryo formed. (3) Development of amnion - fluid filled cavities dev. embryonic pole→ amniotic cavity – lined by amniotic ectoderm epiblast forms floor • Amnion eventually surrounds entire embryo – Amniotic cavity filled with amniotic fluid – Fluid derived from maternal blood and later fetal urine Principal events in the second week of developmentSecond week of development (cont.) (4)Development of 10 yolk sac • Also on 8thd after fertilization, cells at edge of hypoblast migrate to cover inner surface of blastocyst wall – Form exocoelomic (Heuser's) membrane →10 yolk sac – Relatively small and empty, nutrition still derived from endometrium – Several important functions – supplies early nutrients, source of blood cells, contains primordial germ cells that migrate to gonads to form gametes, forms part of gut, functions as shock absorber, prevents desiccation Primitive yolk sac Second week of development (cont.) (5)Development of sinusoids – 9thd after fertilization, blastocyst completely embedded in endometrium – Syncytiotrophoblast expands →and spaces (lacunae) develop – 12thd – lacunae fuse to form lacunar networks – Endometrial capillaries dilate to form maternal sinusoids – The syncytial lacunae become continuous with the maternal sinusoids, – and maternal blood enters the lacunar system (Trophoblast cont. to erode into mat. endomet.)- uteroplacental circulation (6) Development of extraembryonic mesoderm (EEM) & coleom - about 12th day after fertilization – new population of cells appears between the inner surface of the cytotrophoblast and the outer surface of the exocoelomic cavity (1o yolk sac) →EEM – Small cavities appear within EEM – Fuse to form single large cavity → extraembryonic cavity • Splits the EEM →2 layers *EESPM, *EESM (Extraembryonic cavity) • Extraembryonic somatic mesoderm (somatopleuric mesoderm)(EESM) lines the cytotrophoblast, forms the connecting stalk, and covers the amnion • • The conceptus (bilaminar embryo) is suspended by the connecting stalk (future umbilical cord) within the chorionic cavity. • The wall of the chorionic cavity is called the chorion – and consists of three components: extraembryonic somatic mesoderm, cytotrophoblast, and syncytiotrophoblast. • Extraembryonic visceral mesoderm (splanchnopleuric mesoderm) covers the yolk The hypoblast forms the roof of the definitive (20)yolk sac. The chorion • Formed by extraembryonic mesoderm and 2 layers of trophoblast • Becomes principal embryonic part of placenta • Protect embryo from immune responses of mother • hCG produced by syncytiotrophoblast- stimulates production of progesterone by corpus luteum-→(i.e., maintain corpus luteum function) →maintain pregnancy until week 8. – hCG can be assayed in maternal blood at day 8 or maternal urine at day 10 and is the basis of pregnancy testing Chorion: forms fetal part of the placenta Decidua: forms maternal part of the placentaChorion • The buccopharyngeal membrane appears as – a thickening in the cephalic region of the – hypoblast that is firmly attached to the epiblast. • Thank you: • Enjoy the rest of your day. Third week of development • Further development =Two layer germ disc • Primitive streak forms • Gastrulation= forms tri-laminar embryo • Neural induction • Left-right asymmetry • 3rd wk of deve. = 1st missed mensural period, i.e. 5 wks after the onset of last mensural period. Third week of development • Begins 6 weeks period of rapid development and differentiation • Gastrulation • 1st major event of 3rd week – about 15 days • Bilaminar embryonic disc → into trilaminar embryonic disc Gastrulation – Ectoderm: outside, surrounds other layers later in development, generates skin and nervous tissue – Mesoderm: middle layer, generates most of the muscle, blood and connective tissues of the body and placenta – Endoderm: eventually most interior of embryo, generates the epithelial lining and associated glands of the gut, lung, and urogenital tracts • Involves rearrangement and migration of epiblast cells • Primitive streak establishes head (primitive node) and tail ends Gastrulation Gastrulation begins → formation of the primitive streak on epiblast *Heaping up of cells- grows forward - a narrow groove with slightly bulging regions on either side→ p- groove. - Elongation of PS –due to addition of cells from caudal end- -The cephalic end of the streak →the primitive node, →a slightly elevated area surrounding the small primitive pit https://www.studyblue.com/notes/note/n/reproduction/deck/11119849 -The p-grove and pit result from invagination of detached epiblast cells. -Shortly after, cells from the deep surf PS migrate –to the underlying – form a loose network of embryonic CT- mesenchyme *Some cell from PS -displace the hypoblast – form IE- endoderm *Some mesenchymal tissue form a layer – IE-M (& trilaminar layered embryo is formed), b/w epiblast and newly formed endoderm *At this time – remaining epiblast cells -is now- IE- ectoderm PS- later degenerative and disappears Migration and formation of membranesFORMATION OF THE NOTOCHORD The process of formation of notochord involve the following 6 steps: 1.Prechordal plate 2. Notochordal process 3. Notochordal canal 4. Neurenteric canal 5. Notochordal plate 6. Definitive notochord 1. The prechordal plate It is derived from some of the first cells (from primitive streak) *that migrate through the primitive node in the midline, *move cranially, and fuse → allowing a direct contact b/w the endo. and ectod. → oropharyngeal membrane *It forms b/w → tip of notochord and the oropharyngeal membrane and lies caudal to the oropharyngeal membrane. https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neural-plate Notochordal process and Notochord (NC) 2-3) From P-node -some mesenchymal cells – migrate cranially- (b/w ectod & endoderm) - Notochordal process (NCP) (17th d) • Primitive pit extends into NCP- NC-canal • NCP – reach the prechordal plate – (Fused point→ endoderm & ecto) - Oropharayngeal membrane Caudal PS- a circular area – cloacal membrane (future site, Anus) Columnar endo Formation of Notochord STAGE OF THE NOTOCHORDAL PROCESS (entire area cephalic to the primitive streak): about day 17 • The floor of the notochordal process fuses with the underlying endoderm as it undergoes preferential growth. – Hensen's node/knot, seems to recede toward the caudal end PROCHORDAL STAGE: about day 19 – Degeneration of the fused region takes place, and – openings appear in the floor of the notochordal process (resorption of the floor), – opening a communication between the yolk sac and the notochordal canal, (a lumen which is formed as the primitive pit extends into the notochordal process during its development) • The openings become confluent, and the floor of the notochordal canal disappears. • A small passage, the neurenteric canal, temporarily connects the yolk sac and the amniotic cavity 4. NOTOCHORD STAGE: about day 20 – The notochord process →forms a grooved, flattened plate, the notochordal plate, – This plate infolds from cranial end → notochord. – The embryonic endoderm again forms a continuous layer below the notochord – The NC is thus the primary skeleton of the 3-layer embryo Fate of NC: Nucleus pulposus • https://slideplayer.com/slide/12117179/ https://slideplayer.com/slide/12117179/ https://discovery.lifemapsc.com/library/review-of-medical- embryology/chapter-19-week-3-of-development-the-notochord- neural-tube-and-allantois Notochordal Plate Third week of development :summary Gastrulation • 16 days after fertilization notochord forms – induces tissue to become vertebral bodies – 2 depressions form – Oropharyngeal membrane will later break down to connect mouth to pharynx and GI tract. – Cloacal membrane will later degenerate to form openings of anus, urinary and reproductive tracts – When cloacal membrane appears, wall of yolk sac forms allantois • Extends into connecting stalk • In most other mammals used for gas exchange and waste removal – human placenta does this instead • Does function in early formation of blood and blood vessels and urinary bladder Third week of development (cont.) Neurulation – Notochord → induces formation of neural plate – Edges of plate elevate to form neural fold – Neural folds fuse to form neural tube – Develop into brain and spinal cord • Head end of neural tube develops into 3 primary brain vesicles • Prosencephalon (forebrain), • mesencephalon (midbrain), and • rhombencephalon (hindbrain) Derivate of neural crest cellsThird week of development (cont.) • Development of somites (intraembyomic mesoderm) – Segmentation of the mesoderm • Mesoderm adjacent to notochord and neural tube forms paired longitudinal columns (paraxial mesoderm) • Segment into paired, cube-shaped – somites • Number of somites can be correlated to age of embryo • Each somite has 3 regions (42 – 44, 5wk) – Myotome – develops into skeletal muscles of neck, trunk and limbs – Dermatome – develops into connective tissue – Sclerotome - develops into vertebrae and ribs Development of intraembryonic coelom: • Splits lateral plate mesoderm into: – Splanchnic mesoderm – forms heart, blood vessels, SM and CT of respiratory and digestive systems – Somatic mesoderm – gives rise to bones, ligaments, dermis of skin Third week of development (cont.) • Development of cardiovascular system – Angiogenesis – blood vessels formation (EEM over yolk sac, connecting stalk, chorion) • Spaces develop in blood islands to form lumens of blood vessels • Pluripotent stem cells form blood cells • By end of 3rd week, heart forms and begins to beat Angiogenesis 1. Angioblast aggregate → blood islands, cavities 2. Angioblasts flatten → endothelial cells, around, cavities → vessels (primitive endothelium) 3. Fusion of endoth. lined cavities →network of endoth cannels. 4. Extension of vessel to adjacent one – budding and fusion 5. B/d develop from endothelial cells as vessels devel on the yolk sac and allantois , end 3rd wk. *Muscular & CT of vessels – from mesenchymal cells Chorionic villi • Development of chorionic villi and placenta *Chorionic villi – fingerlike projections of chorion projecting into endometrium – Primary villi – end week 2, first stage of chorionic villi development, trophoblastic cells (syncitiotrophoblasts ,cytotrophoblasts) form finger-like extensions into maternal decidua. – Secondary villi – early week 3, 2nd stage of chorionic villi development, • Mesenchymal cells grows into villi, → fms core of LCT, Villi covers entire surface of chorionic sac. – Tertiary/stem villi, 3rd stage of chorionic villi development: mesenchyme differentiates → bld vv and cells. • forms arteriocapillary network, →fuse with placental vessels, developing in connecting stalk stem villi - or anchoring villi, and chorion – Blood vessels in chorionic villi connect to embryonic heart through body stalk (becomes umbilical cord) – Maternal and fetal blood do not mix – diffusion only. Cytotrophoblastic shall – cytotrophoblast cells (chorionic villi) proliferate thro syncytiotrop and attached to maternal tissue →cytotrophoblastic shall. – Stem/anchoring villi: attached the maternal tissue via cytotrophoblast. – Branch or terminal villi: grow from sides of stem villi, region of main exchange, surrounded by maternal blood in intervillous spaces Development of chorionic villiPlacentation • Process of forming placenta – By beginning of 12th week, derived from 2 parts • Fetal portion formed by chorionic villi of chorion • Maternal portion formed by decidua basalis of endometrium – Functionally allows oxygen and nutrients to diffuse from maternal to fetal blood while carbon dioxide and wastes diffuse from fetal to maternal blood – Not a protective barrier – allows microorganisms, drugs, alcohol to pass – Connection between embryo and placenta through umbilical cord • 2 umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated fetal blood to placenta • 1 umbilical vein carries oxygenated blood away from placenta – Afterbirth – placenta detaches from uterus Placenta and umbilical cord • End of lecture of lecture • Thank you and enjoy the rest of your day","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
