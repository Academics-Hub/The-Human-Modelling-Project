The gastrointestinal tract (GI tract), is a vital organ system responsible for the digestion, absorption, and elimination of food and waste products. It consists of a series of interconnected organs that work together to break down food into its fundamental components and extract nutrients for energy production and overall bodily functions. Here is an overview of the Digestive system (~5 minutes) (gastrointestinal tract). Let's explore the physiology of the gastrointestinal tract in more detail: General layers of the gastrointestinal tract Segments of the gastrointestinal tract are separated by sphincter Mouth (~8 minues): The digestive process begins in the mouth where food is ingested and mechanically broken down through chewing and mixing with saliva. Saliva, produced by the salivary glands, contains mostly water and some enzymes (such as amylase) that initiate the breakdown of carbohydrates. Salivary glands (~6 minutes) Oesophagus: Once food is chewed and formed into a bolus, it is swallowed and travels down the oesophagus—a muscular tube connecting the mouth to the stomach. The coordinated contractions of the oesophageal muscles, known as peristalsis, propel the food toward the stomach. Swallowing (~3 minutes) - Phases of swallowing. Peristalsis (~2minutes) Stomach and gastric activity: The stomach is a hollow, muscular organ that receives food from the oesophagus. It secretes gastric juice, which contains hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes (such as pepsin) to break down proteins. The stomach also mixes the food with gastric secretions, forming a semi-liquid mixture called chyme. Phases of gastric secretion (~9 minutes) – a review of the gastric juices and the phases of gastric secretion Production and secretion of HCL (~4 minutes) Small Intestine: The small intestine is the longest section of the GI tract and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. In the duodenum, bile (produced 2 by the liver) and pancreatic enzymes (produced by the pancreas) are released to further break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. There are 3 videos here as listed below. Small intestine (~7 minutes) – Discussing the parts of the small intestine and the structure Small intestine 2 (~7 minutes) – Discussing digestion enzymes Small intestine 3_ (~5 minutes) - Absorption of nutrients Accessory organs involved in digestion include the liver, Pancreas (~5 minutes) This video review digestion also. The liver (~ 7 minutes) and Bile (~6 minutes) Large Intestine (Colon): The large intestine is responsible for reabsorbing water and electrolytes from undigested food residues, forming semi-solid waste material called feaces. It also houses a large number of bacteria, known as gut microbiota, which play a crucial role in digestion and produce certain vitamins (such as vitamin K). Rectum and Anus: Faeces are stored in the rectum until elimination occurs through the anus during defecations The activities of the gastrointestinal tract is regulated by hormones as discussed in this video - Control of the GI Tract by hormones Finally Defecation reflex Gastrointestinal secretions (~24 minutes) – more details and more hormones that control the gastrointestinal tract. The coordinated regulation of these processes is controlled by neural, hormonal, and local factors, ensuring the effective digestion and absorption of nutrients while maintaining homeostasis within the body. In summary, the gastrointestinal tract is a highly specialized and intricate system responsible for the digestion, absorption, and elimination of food. Its various organs and processes work together to extract nutrients, provide energy, and support overall bodily functions. 3 General Anatomy of the Gastrointestinal Tract Layers of the GIT The GI tract is composed of four layers also known as Tunics. Each layer has different tissues and functions. From the inside out they are called: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis (muscular layer), and serosa. Mucosa: The mucosa is the absorptive and secretory layer. It is composed of simple epithelium cells and a thin connective tissue. There are specialized cells that secrete mucus throughout the GI tract located within the mucosa. On the mucosa layer there are Villi and Micro Villi (these facilitates absorption of nutrients). Submucosa: The submucosa is relatively thick, highly vascularized, and serves the mucosa. The absorbed elements that pass through the mucosa are picked up from the blood vessels of the submucosa. The submucosa also has glands and nerve plexuses. Muscularis: The muscularis is responsible for segmental contractions and peristaltic movement in the GI tract. The muscularis is composed of two layers of muscle: an inner circular and outer longitudinal layer of smooth muscle. These muscles cause food to move and churn with digestive enzymes down the GI tract. Serosa: The last layer is a protective layer. It is composed of a vascular connective tissue and simple squamous epithelium. It secretes lubricating serous fluid. This is the visible layer on the outside of the organs. The muscle layers of the GI tract consist almost entirely of smooth muscle, which move food efficiently along as it is broken down into absorbable atoms and molecules. During absorption, the nutrients that come from food (proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals) pass 4 through the wall of the small intestine and into the bloodstream and lymph. In this way, nutrients can be distributed throughout the rest of the body. The two smooth-muscle layers are arranged as an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal layer. In the longitudinal muscle layer, the bundles extend longitudinally down the intestinal tract; in the circular muscle layer, they extend around the gut. Within each bundle, the muscle fibers are electrically connected with one another through large numbers of gap junctions that allow low-resistance movement of ions from one muscle cell to the next. Therefore, electrical signals that initiate muscle contractions can travel readily from one fiber to the next within each bundle but more rapidly along the length of the bundle than sideways. SEGMENTS OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT Before looking at the activities and regulation of the GIT, let us briefly describe the segments. The segments of the GI tract through which food products pass are hollow, low-pressure organs that are separated by specialized circular muscles or sphincters. These sphincters function as barriers to flow by maintaining a positive resting pressure that serves to separate the two adjacent organs, in which lower pressures prevail. 5 Sphincters thus regulate both antegrade (forward) and retrograde (reverse) movement These sphincters include 1. the upper and lower oesophageal sphincters, 2. the pylorus that retards emptying of the stomach, 3. the ileocecal valve that retains colonic contents (including large numbers of bacteria) in the large intestine, and 4. the inner and outer anal sphincters. After toilet training, the outer sphincter permits delaying the elimination of waste until a time when it is socially convenient. Generally, stimuli proximal to a sphincter cause sphincteric relaxation, whereas stimuli distal to a sphincter induce a contraction. Changes in sphincter pressure are coordinated with the smooth-muscle contractions in the organs on either side. This coordination depends on both the intrinsic properties of sphincteric smooth muscle and neuro-humoral stimuli. For example, the resting pressure of the pyloric sphincter controls, in part, the emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. On the opposite end of the stomach, the resting pressure of the lower oesophageal sphincter prevents gastric contents from refluxing back into the oesophagus and causing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 6 Sphincters effectively serve as one-way valves. Thus, the act of deglutition (or swallowing) induces relaxation of the upper oesophageal sphincter, whereas the lower oesophageal sphincter remains contracted. Only when the upper oesophageal sphincter returns to its initial pressure does the lower oesophageal sphincter begin to relax. Disturbances in sphincter activity are often associated with alterations in one or more of these regulatory processes. Location of a sphincter determines its function Six sphincters are present in the GI tract, each with a different resting pressure and different response to various stimuli. An additional sphincter, the sphincter of Oddi, regulates movement of the contents of the common bile duct into the duodenum. 1a. Upper Oesophageal Sphincter Separating the pharynx and the upper part of the oesophagus is the upper oesophageal sphincter, which consists of striated muscle and has the highest resting pressure of all the GI sphincters. The swallowing mechanism, which involves the oropharynx and the upper oesophageal sphincter, is largely under the control of the swallowing centre in the medulla. Respiration and deglutition are closely integrated. The upper oesophageal sphincter is closed during inspiration, thereby diverting atmospheric air to the glottis and away from the oesophagus. During swallowing, the situation reverses, with closure of the glottis and inhibition of respiration, but with relaxation of the upper oesophageal sphincter. These changes permit the entry of food contents into the oesophagus and not into the airways of the respiratory tract. 1b. Lower Oesophageal Sphincter The oesophagus is separated from the stomach by the lower oesophageal sphincter. The primary functions of the lower oesophageal sphincter are (1) to permit coordinated movement of ingested food into the stomach from the oesophagus after swallowing or deglutition, and (2) to prevent reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus. Either deglutition or distention of the oesophagus results in a reduction in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, thereby permitting entry of food into the stomach. Relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter occurs after the upper oesophageal sphincter has already returned to its resting pressure. The lower oesophageal sphincter maintains a resting tone mediated by both intrinsic myogenic properties of the sphincter muscle and cholinergic regulation. Relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter is mediated both by the vagus nerve and by intrinsic properties of the smooth muscle, including the inhibitory effects by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and by Nitric oxide (NO). Abnormalities of both resting lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and its relaxation in response to deglutition are often associated with significant symptoms. Thus, a reduced resting lower oesophageal sphincter pressure often results in gastroesophageal reflux, which may cause oesophagitis (i.e., inflammation of the oesophageal mucosa). A defect in lower 7 oesophageal sphincter relaxation is a major component of a condition called achalasia, which often results in dilation of the oesophagus and is associated with difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia). Swallowing and the function of the upper and lower oesophageal sphincters are closely integrated into the function of the oesophagus. Under normal circumstances, oesophageal muscle contractions are almost exclusively peristaltic and are initiated by swallowing. Deglutition initiates relaxation of the upper oesophageal sphincter and propagated contractions, first of the upper oesophageal sphincter and then of the muscle of the lower oesophageal sphincter along the oesophagus. In the meantime, the lower oesophageal sphincter has already relaxed. Distention of the oesophagus (in the absence of swallowing) also initiates propulsive oesophageal contractions distal to the site of distention, as well as relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. Reflux of gastric contents into the lower part of the oesophagus also produces such a local distention, without a swallow, and elicits the same response: peristaltic contractions that clear the oesophagus of refluxed gastric material. Peristalsis that is initiated by swallowing is called primary peristalsis, whereas that elicited by distention of the oesophagus is referred to as secondary peristalsis. Oesophageal contractions after a swallow are regulated by the medullary swallowing centre, intramural oesophageal plexuses, the vagus nerve, and intrinsic myogenic processes. 2. Pyloric Sphincter The pylorus is the sphincter that separates the stomach from the duodenum. The pressure of the pyloric sphincter regulates, in part, gastric emptying and prevents duodenal-gastric reflux. However, although a specific pyloric sphincter is present, it is quite short and is a relatively poor barrier (i.e., it can resist only a small pressure gradient). 3. Ileocecal Sphincter The valve-like structure that separates the ileum and cecum is called the ileocecal sphincter. Similar to other GI sphincters, the ileocecal sphincter maintains a positive resting pressure and is under the control of the vagus nerve, sympathetic nerves, and the Enteric Nervous System (ENS). Distention of the ileum results in relaxation of the sphincter, whereas distention of the proximal (ascending) colon causes contraction of the ileocecal sphincter. As a consequence, ileal flow into the colon is regulated by luminal contents and pressure, both proximal and distal to the ileocecal sphincter. 4. Internal and External Anal Sphincters The “anal sphincter” consists of both an internal and an external sphincter. The internal sphincter has both circular and longitudinal smooth muscle and is under involuntary control. The external sphincter, contains only striated muscle but is controlled by both voluntary and involuntary mechanisms. The high resting pressure of the overall anal sphincter predominantly reflects the resting tone of the internal anal sphincter. Distention of the rectum, either by colonic contents (i.e., stool) or experimentally by balloon inflation, initiates the recto-sphincteric reflex by relaxing the internal sphincter. If defecation is not desired, continence is maintained by an involuntary reflex—orchestrated by the sacral spinal cord—that contracts the external anal sphincter. If defecation is desired, a 8 series of both voluntary and involuntary events occurs that includes relaxation of the external anal sphincter, contraction of abdominal wall muscles, and relaxation of pelvic wall muscles. Flexure of the hips and descent of the pelvic floor then facilitate defecation by minimizing the angle between the rectum and anus. In contrast, if a delay in defecation is needed or desired, voluntary contraction of the external anal sphincter is usually sufficient to override the series of reflexes initiated by rectal distention. The gastrointestinal tract serves as a portal whereby nutrients and water can be absorbed into the body. For this happen, the meal is mixed with a variety of secretions that arise from the gastrointestinal tract itself and accessory organs that drain into it, Such as the pancreas, gallbladder, and salivary glands. Each of these organs plays a specific role in the digestive system. The processes of digestion include six activities: ingestion, propulsion, mechanical or physical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, and defecation. Digestive organs and accessory organ Ingestion Ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the alimentary canal through the mouth. There, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates in the food plus some lipid digestion via lingual lipase. Chewing increases the surface area of the food and allows an appropriately sized bolus to be produced. 9 Digestion begins in the mouth. The Oral Cavity Functions to Provide - sensory analysis of food material before swallowing A brain reflex triggers the flow of saliva when we see or even think about food. Saliva moistens the food, while the teeth chew it up and make it easier to swallow. Amylase, which is the digestive enzyme found in saliva, starts to break down starch into simple sugars before the food even leaves the mouth. 10 - mechanical processing via the action of the teeth, tongue, and palatal surfaces - lubrication by mixing food material with mucus and salivary gland secretion - limited digestion of carbohydrates and lipids Salivary glands Salivary glands (~6 minutes) The glands responsible for the production of saliva include the parotid gland, the largest of the salivary glands, the submandibular glands, and the sublingual glands. 1. The parotid salivary glands, which produce serous secretions containing a large amount of salivary amylase, which breaks down carbohydrate complexes. 2. The sublingual salivary glands which produce mucous secretions that serves as both a buffer and lubricant. 3. The submandibular salivary glands, which function by secreting a mixture of buffers, glycoproteins called mucins, and salivary amylase. Altogether, these glands produce 1.0 to 1.5 litres of saliva each day. Close to 99.4% of the saliva produced is water, and the remaining 0.6% consists of electrolytes, buffers, glycoproteins (mucins), antibodies, enzymes, and waste products. These function to lubricate the mouth to prevent friction between the mucosa of the oral cavity and the food material; moisten the food material for easy swallowing process; and initiation of lipid and carbohydrate complex digestion. The salivary glands are under autonomic control by both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Stimulation of either parasympathetic or sympathetic nervous systems stimulates salivary gland secretion, but the effects of parasympathetic stimulation are stronger and longer lasting. The teeth provide a mechanical breakdown of food materials; for instance, the connective tissue of meat and plant fibres in vegetables. This process also saturates the salivary secretions and enzymes within the food material for better digestion. 11 MECHANISM OF SALIVA SECRETION The nervous pathway involved in salivary excretion requires stimulation of receptors in the mouth, sensory impulses to the brain stem and parasympathetic impulses to salivary glands. The mechanism of salivary gland secretion involves primarily cholinergic signaling by the parasympathetic nerves and signaling by neuropeptides like substance P, but also adrenergic signaling by sympathetic nerves. Parasympathetic stimulation activates acetylcholine receptors to activate protein kinase C (PKC), releasing diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) which stimulates increased intracellular calcium levels. The rise in calcium mediates the increased volume of saliva and amylase output. Substance P activates the neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor to similarly stimulate PKC to increase the formation of IP3 and DAG, which subsequently increase amylase output and volume flow. Sympathetic stimulation increases alpha receptor stimulation by norepinephrine which causes smooth muscle contraction and increases volume flow and amylase output. Norepinephrine also act on beta receptors and activate the cyclic adenosine monophosphate cascade, increasing protein kinase A (PKA) activity, amylase output, and transient saliva volume flow. There are two main stages to the secretion of saliva. First, once stimulated, acinar cells secrete primary saliva which is isotonic and contains amylase, mucus, and extracellular fluid. This isotonic form of saliva is made by secreting sodium chloride. In the second stage, the primary saliva gets modified as it passes down the ductal tree. The sodium gets actively reabsorbed, potassium is actively secreted, chloride is passively absorbed, and bicarbonate secreted. Of note, the ductal epithelium has poor water permeability making the final saliva product hypotonic. 12 Functions of Saliva Saliva functions to protect the oral cavity by several mechanisms, including flushing away pathogens like bacteria, with the help of proteins that have antimicrobial activity like lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase, and small peptides like alpha-defensins and beta-defensins which disrupt the integrity of the micro-organisms cellular and mitochondrial functions. Saliva also protects the mucosae of the oral cavity from adhering to each other with the help of the mucinous secretions which provide a lubricating barrier, protecting the mucosa from toxins, trauma, and noxious stimuli. Saliva also acts as a buffer, increasing pH with the help of bicarbonate, phosphate, and other ions. Biologically active proteins and growth factors are found in saliva and work to regenerate tissue and promote wound healing. Digestion begins in the mouth; saliva contains the enzyme amylase which breaks down starches into maltose and dextrin. This function in itself also reduces the number of sugars available to microorganisms and helps inhibit their growth. Saliva assists with the sensation of taste by solubilizing food so that the taste receptors can interact with the molecules that cause receptor activation. Functions of the tongue include mechanical processing by compression, abrasion, and distortion; manipulation to assist in chewing and prepare material for swallowing; sensory analysis by touch, temperature, and taste receptors; and secretion of mucins and lingual lipase. 13 The lingual lipase has a broad pH and breaks down lipids (mainly triglyceride). The pH of 3.5 to 6 allows lingual lipase to work even in the acid environment of the stomach. Swallowing Food leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel it into the oesophagus. This act of swallowing, which is the last voluntary act until defecation, is an example of propulsion, which refers to the movement of food through the gastro-intestinal tract. It includes both the voluntary process of swallowing and the involuntary process of peristalsis. Swallowing your food happens when the muscles in your tongue and mouth move the food into your pharynx. Phases of Swallowing Voluntary Phase Mastication leads to a bolus of food being produced, during this stage the back of the tongue is elevated and the soft palate pulled anteriorly against it. This keeps the food within the oral cavity and allows the airway to remain open. The duration of this stage varies. Following this, inspiration is inhibited and the bolus of food is moved to the pharynx by the tongue. This leads to the stimulation of the swallowing reflex. Pharyngeal Phase The pharynx serves as a passageway of food material to the oesophagus although it also has a respiratory function for air movement into the lung. During swallowing, closure of the nasopharynx and larynx occurs to maintain the proper direction of food. Once the bolus has been moved to the pharynx, pressure receptors are activated in the palate and anterior pharynx. This signals the swallowing centre in the brain stem which: • Inhibits respiration • Raises the larynx • Closes the glottis • Opens the upper oesophageal sphincter The soft palate is elevated to close the nasopharynx to allow passage of food. In addition to this, the true vocal cords close to prevent aspiration. After this, the bolus is moved towards the oesophagus via peristalsis of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles. Gravity makes very little contribution to this process and the main factors affecting the speed of this are the viscosity and volume of the bolus. From the pharynx, food material goes to the oesophagus. Oesophageal Phase The oesophagus is continuous with the laryngeal part of the pharynx at the level of the C6 vertebra. It connects the pharynx, which is the body cavity that is common to both the digestive and respiratory systems behind the mouth, with the stomach, where the second stage of 14 digestion is initiated (the first stage is in the mouth with teeth and tongue masticating food and mixing it with saliva). The upper one-third of the oesophagus is predominantly skeletal muscle. The middle one-third is a mixture of both the skeletal muscle and smooth muscle. The lower one-third is mainly smooth muscle. At the beginning of this phase, the larynx lowers, returning to its normal position. The cricopharyngeus muscle then contracts to prevent reflux and respiration begins again. After passing through the throat, the food moves into the oesophagus and is pushed down into the stomach by the process of peristalsis (involuntary wavelike muscle contractions along the G.I. tract). At the end of the oesophagus there is a sphincter (lower oesophageal sphincter) that allows food into the stomach then closes back up so the food cannot reflux back up into the oesophagus. The bolus is moved down the oesophagus via peristalsis, which is coordinated by extrinsic nerves. Each area of muscle systematically relaxes to allow food through and contracts afterwards to propel it further. The oesophagus's primary function is to empty food materials into the stomach via waves of contraction of its longitudinal and circular muscle known as peristalsis. The skeletal muscles found in the pharynx and upper oesophagus are all under the control of the swallow reflex; hence the pharyngeal and oesophageal phases of swallowing are under involuntary control of afferent and efferent fibres of glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The stomach The stomach has four regions; fundus, cardia, body, and pylorus. The inner surface of the stomach is rugated to increase the surface area of the gastric mucosa allowing for gastric expansion with food ingestion. The wall of the stomach consists of four different tissue layers; mucosal layer, submucosa, muscularis externa, and adventitia/serosa. The contraction and relaxation of these 3 muscular layers of the stomach assist in the mixing and churning activities essential in the formation of chime (mechanical digestion). Once the food material arrives in the stomach, it can be temporarily stored and mechanically and chemically broken down by the actions of stomach acids and enzymes. The ability of the stomach to store food stems from its compliance and ability to change size. Once the bolus is near the pylorus, the antrum functions to grind the material by forceful peristaltic contractions that force the bolus against a tightly constricted pylorus. The churning by the antrum serves to reduce the size of the food particles and is called grinding. Only particles smaller than 2mm in diameter can pass through the contracted pylorus into the duodenum. The rest of the bolus is pushed back towards the body of the stomach for further mechanical and chemical digestion. This backward movement of the bolus from the pylorus to the body is termed retropulsion and also serves to aid in mechanical digestion. This sequence of propulsion, grinding, and retropulsion repeats until the food particles are small enough to pass through the pylorus into 15 the duodenum. All chyme not pushed through the pylorus during the active digestion process is eventually swept into the duodenum through a relaxed pylorus by a series of strong peristaltic contractions in the stomach. This activity occurs during the inter-digestive phase called migrating motor complexes (MMCs) that function to move the bolus in an aboral fashion to prevent stagnation and bacterial accumulation. There is significant chemical digestion in the stomach. Two types of glands exist in the gastric mucosa that aid in chemical digestion: oxyntic glands and pyloric glands. Oxyntic glands are located in the body of the stomach and contain parietal cells and chief cells. Parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid, concentrated to approximately 160 mmol/L and a pH of 0.8. Hydrochloric acid secreted by the parietal cells serves three main functions: 1) to create a hostile environment for pathogenic microorganisms taken in through the mouth, 2) to denature proteins and make them more accessible for enzymatic degradation by pepsin, and 3) to activate the zymogen pepsinogen to its active form, pepsin. Parietal cells also secrete a substance called intrinsic factor, necessary for the absorption of Vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum. Oxyntic glands also contain chief cells that secrete the zymogen pepsinogen. Pepsinogen is the precursor to the proteolytic enzyme pepsin and must be activated to pepsin by the acidic pH of the stomach (below 3.5) or from auto-activation by pepsin itself. Pepsin will then act on the internal peptide bonds of proteins at the optimal pH of 2 to 3. The pyloric glands are found in the antrum of the stomach and contain mucous cells and G-cells. Mucous cells secrete a bicarbonate-rich mucous onto the surface of the gastric mucosa to protect it from the acidic contents of the stomach. The G-cells secrete gastrin, a hormone that acts in an endocrine fashion to stimulate the secretion of hydrochloric acid by parietal cells. Production of hydrochloric acid Water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) combine within the parietal cell cytoplasm to produce carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is catalysed by carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic acid then spontaneously dissociates into a hydrogen ion (H+) and a bicarbonate ion (HCO3–). The hydrogen ion that is formed is transported into the stomach lumen via the H+– K + ATPase ion pump. This pump uses ATP as an energy source to exchange potassium ions into the parietal cells of the stomach with H+ ions. The bicarbonate ion is transported out of the cell into the blood via a transporter protein called anion exchanger which transports the bicarbonate ion out the cell in exchange for a chloride ion (Cl–). This chloride ion is then transported into the stomach lumen via a chloride channel. This results in both hydrogen and chloride ions being present within the stomach lumen. Their opposing charges leads to them associating with each other to form hydrochloric acid (HCl). In addition to secreting HCl, the parietal cells secrete a protein called intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum of the small intestines. Three regulating molecules control these cells: Acetylcholine (enteric nervous innervation) via muscarinic receptors, Histamine (neuroendocrine cells) to histamine receptors, and 16 Gastrin (neuroendocrine cells) to gastrin receptors. All receptors are present on the basal side of the parietal cells, and they control the H+/K + ATPase on the lumenal side of the parietal cell. Control of gastric acid production At rest, the number of H+– K + ATPases present within the parietal cell membrane is minimal. The rest are sequestered within tubule-vesicles in the parietal cell. Upon stimulation, the vesicles fuse with the cell membrane which leads to the increased insertion of H+– K + ATPase into the membrane, hence allowing for the increased movement of hydrogen ions into the stomach thus increasing acid production. Chief cells secrete the zymogen pepsinogen. Pepsinogen is the inactive form of a proteolytic enzyme called pepsin, which is needed to digest proteins into small units called polypeptides. The zymogen pepsinogen only becomes activated by the gastric acid produced by the parietal cells. This mechanism acts as a safety measure to ensure the proteins found outside of the gastric lumen are not digested inappropriately. Chief cells are stimulated by cholinergic activity from the parasympathetic and by the hormone Gastrin. Neuroendocrine cells (i.e., enterochromaffin-like cells, or G-cells) are also found in the gastric glands on the gastric mucosa that secretes various molecules that aid in the production of gastric acid. The ECL-like cells produce and secrete Histamine when stimulated by a hormone called gastrin, which indirectly increases the HCl production by way of histamines' direct actions on the parietal cells. ECL-like cells are primarily located in the fundus of the stomach. G-cells are located in the pylorus region of the stomach, and they produce the neuroendocrine hormone called gastrin. Gastrin is capable of indirectly and directly increasing HCl production by two mechanisms. The first is by stimulation of the ECL-like cells to release Histamine, which then potentiates Parietal cells. The second is by direct stimulation of the Parietal cells themselves. Both mechanisms increase the H+/K+ ATPase activity. D-cells are located in the pylorus of the stomach, and they secrete an inhibitory molecule called Somatostatin. D cells are activated when the stomach lumen reaches a certain level of acidity. Somatostatin then acts to suppress the release of gastrin, reducing the overall production of gastric acid. Phases of gastric secretions The process of gastric secretion can be divided into three phases (cephalic, gastric, and intestinal) that depend upon the primary mechanisms that cause the gastric mucosa to secrete gastric juice. The phases of gastric secretion overlap, and there is an interrelation and some interdependence between the neural and humoral pathways. The cephalic phase of gastric secretion occurs in response to stimuli received by the senses— that is, taste, smell, sight, and sound. Action potentials are sent along parasympathetic axons within the vagus nerves to the stomach. 17 Within the stomach wall, the preganglionic neurons stimulate postganglionic neurons in the enteric plexus. The postganglionic neurons stimulate secretory activity in the cells of the stomach mucosa, causing the release of hydrochloric acid, pepsin, mucus, and intrinsic factor. The neurons also stimulate the release of gastrin and histamine from endocrine cells. This phase of gastric secretion is entirely reflex in origin and is mediated by the vagus nerve. In essence, Gastric juice is secreted in response to vagal stimulation, either directly by electrical impulses or indirectly by stimuli received through the senses. Histamine is both a paracrine chemical signal that acts locally and a hormone that enters the blood to stimulate gastric gland secretory activity. Histamine is the most potent stimulator of hydrochloric acid secretion. The gastric phase is the period during which the greatest volume of gastric secretion occurs. The gastric phase is activated by the presence of food in the stomach and mediated by the vagus nerve and by the release of gastrin. . During this phase, the food in the stomach is mixed with gastric secretions. Distention of the stomach stimulates stretch receptors thus generating action potentials that activate CNS reflexes and local reflexes, resulting in the cascade of events that increases secretion, as in the cephalic phase. Peptides, produced by the action of pepsin on proteins, stimulate the secretion of gastrin, which in turn stimulates additional hydrochloric acid secretion. The acidity of the gastric contents after a meal is buffered by proteins so that overall, it remains around pH3 (acidic) for approximately 90 minutes. Acid continues to be secreted during the gastric phase in response to distension and to the peptides and amino acids that are liberated/broken down from protein as digestion proceeds. This phase continues until the food has left the stomach. The intestinal phase of gastric secretion primarily inhibits gastric secretions. It is controlled by the entrance of acidic chyme into the duodenum, which initiates both neural and hormonal mechanisms. When the pH of the chyme entering the duodenum drops to 2.0 or below, the 18 inhibitory influence of the intestinal phase is greatest. The hormone secretin which inhibits gastric secretions, is released from the duodenum in response to low pH. Fatty acids and peptides in the duodenum initiate the release of the hormone cholecystokinin), which also inhibits gastric secretions. Acidic chyme (pH < 2.0) in the duodenum also inhibits CNS stimulation and initiates local reflexes that inhibit gastric secretion. Stomach emptying The rate of emptying of the stomach depends upon the physical and chemical composition of the meal. Fluids empty more rapidly than solids, carbohydrates more rapidly than proteins, and proteins more rapidly than fats. The pH of the gastric contents determines whether some substances are absorbed. At a low pH, for example, the environment is acidic and aspirin is absorbed from the stomach almost as rapidly as water, but, as the pH of the stomach rises and the environment becomes more basic, aspirin is absorbed more slowly. Also, the absorption of water and alcohol can be slowed if the stomach contains foodstuffs and especially fats, probably because gastric emptying is delayed by fats, and most water in any situation is absorbed from the small intestine. When food particles are sufficiently reduced in size and are nearly soluble and when receptors in the duodenal bulb (the area of attachment between the duodenum and the stomach) have a fluidity and a hydrogen ion concentration of a certain level, the duodenal bulb and the second part of the duodenum relax, allowing emptying of the stomach to start. During a duodenal contraction, the pressure in the duodenal bulb rises higher than that in the antrum. The pylorus prevents reflux into the stomach by shutting. The vagus nerve has an important role in the control of emptying, but there is some indication that the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is also involved. Types of Movement in the GIT Two types of movements occur in the gastrointestinal tract: (1) propulsive movements, which cause food to move forward along the tract at an appropriate rate to accommodate digestion and absorption, and (2) mixing movements, which keep the intestinal contents thoroughly mixed at all times. The basic propulsive movement of the gastrointestinal tract is peristalsis. A contractile ring appears around the gut and then moves forward; this is analogous to putting one’s fingers around a thin distended tube, then constricting the fingers and sliding them forward along the tube. Any material in front of the contractile ring is moved forward. 19 Peristalsis is an inherent property of many syncytial smooth muscle tubes; stimulation at any point in the gut can cause a contractile ring to appear in the circular muscle, and this ring then spreads along the gut tube. (Peristalsis also occurs in the bile ducts, glandular ducts, ureters, and many other smooth muscle tubes of the body.) The usual stimulus for intestinal peristalsis is distention of the gut. That is, if a large amount of food collects at any point in the gut, the stretching of the gut wall stimulates the enteric nervous system to contract the gut wall 2 to 3 centimetres behind this point, and a contractile ring appears that initiates a peristaltic movement. Other stimuli that can initiate peristalsis include chemical or physical irritation of the epithelial lining in the gut. Also, strong parasympathetic nervous signals to the gut will elicit strong peristalsis. Mixing movements differ in different parts of the alimentary tract. In some areas, the peristaltic contractions themselves cause most of the mixing. This is especially true when forward progression of the intestinal contents is blocked by a sphincter so that a peristaltic wave can then only churn the intestinal contents, rather than propelling them forward. At other times, local intermittent constrictive contractions occur every few centimetres in the gut wall. These constrictions usually last only 5 to 30 seconds; then new constrictions occur at other points in the gut, thus “chopping” and “shearing” the contents here and there. These peristaltic and constrictive movements are modified in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract for proper propulsion and mixing. Peristalsis, theoretically, can occur in either direction from a stimulated point, but it normally dies out rapidly in the orad (toward the mouth) direction while continuing for a considerable distance toward the anus. Peristaltic Reflex and the “Law of the Gut”. 20 When a segment of the intestinal tract is excited by distention and thereby initiates peristalsis, the contractile ring causing the peristalsis normally begins on the orad side of the distended segment and moves toward the distended segment, pushing the intestinal contents in the anal direction for 5 to 10 centimetres before dying out. At the same time, the gut sometimes relaxes several centimetres downstream toward the anus, which is called “receptive relaxation,” thus allowing the food to be propelled more easily toward the anus than toward the mouth. This complex pattern does not occur in the absence of the myenteric plexus. Therefore, the complex is called the myenteric reflex or the peristaltic reflex. The peristaltic reflex plus the anal direction of movement of the peristalsis is called the “law of the gut.” The Small intestine The small intestine is the next location where digestion takes place. But unlike the stomach, which has minor absorptive property, 90% of food absorption occurs in the small intestine. The small intestine has three segments: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The duodenum receives chyme from the stomach as well as digestive material from the pancreas and the liver. Despite being the shortest section, the duodenum is the principal region of digestion. Digestion here is regulated by several hormones secreted by endocrine cells that are present in the small intestine. The jejunum is where the bulk of chemical digestion and absorption occur. The ileum also has digestion and absorption functions. The ileum is the last segment of the small intestine and has the ileocecal valve, a sphincter that controls the flow of material from the ileum to the cecum of the large intestine Histology of the small intestine The mucosal layers, which are in contact with the food being digested, contain cells that secrete hormones, mucus and digestive enzymes. Here, mucus again provides protection (particularly for the duodenum) from acidic chyme arriving from the stomach. To increase the surface area and give the small intestine elasticity, the mucosa is highly folded into structures known as plicae circulares, or circular folds. The mucosal layer also comprises additional folds forming the finger-like projections of the villi, which greatly increase surface area for more effective nutrient absorption. Chemical digestion in the small intestine Digested chyme from the stomach passes through the pylorus and into the duodenum. Here, chyme will mix with secretions from both the pancreas and the duodenum. Mechanical digestion will still occur to a minor extent as well. The pancreas produces many digestive enzymes, including pancreatic amylase, pancreatic lipase, trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidase, and proelastase. These enzymes 21 are separated from the acidic environment of the stomach and function optimally in the more basic environment of the small intestine where the pH ranges from 6 to 7 due to bicarbonate secreted by the pancreas. Pancreatic amylase, like salivary amylase, functions to digest starch into maltose and maltotriose. Pancreatic lipase, secreted by the pancreas with an important coenzyme called colipase, functions to hydrolyze the ester bonds in triglycerides to form diacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols. Trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidase, and proelastase are all precursors to active peptidases. The pancreas does not secrete the active form of the peptidases; otherwise, autodigestion could occur, as is the case in pancreatitis. Instead, trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidase, and proelastase convert to trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase, and elastase, respectively. This conversion occurs as enterokinase, a duodenal enzyme, converts trypsinogen to trypsin. Trypsin can then convert chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidase, and proelastase to their active forms. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase are all endopeptidases that hydrolyze internal peptide bonds of proteins, while the carboxypeptidases are exopeptidases that hydrolyze terminal peptide bonds on proteins. These pancreatic zymogens leave the pancreas through the main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung) and join the common bile duct forming the ampulla of Vater and empty into the descending portion of the duodenum via the major duodenal papilla. The common bile duct carries bile that was made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile contains a mixture of bile salts, cholesterol, fatty acids, bilirubin, and electrolytes that help emulsify hydrophobic lipids in the small intestine, which is necessary for access and action by pancreatic lipase, which is hydrophilic. Once in the duodenum, there will be an activation cascade beginning with enterokinase produced by the duodenum to activate trypsinogen to trypsin, and trypsin will activate the other pancreatic peptidases. Importantly, the duodenum also contributes several digestive enzymes such as disaccharidases and dipeptidase. The disaccharidases include maltase, lactase, and sucrase. Maltase cleaves the glycosidic bond in maltose, producing two glucose monomers, lactase cleaves the glycosidic bond in lactose, producing glucose and galactose, and sucrase cleaves the glycosidic bond in sucrose, producing glucose and fructose. Dipeptidase cleaves the peptide bond in dipeptides. At this point, the mouth, stomach, and small intestine have broken down fat in the form of triglycerides to fatty acids and monoacylglycerol, carbohydrate in the form of starch and disaccharides to monosaccharides, and large proteins into amino acids and oligopeptides. Thus, the digestive process has converted macronutrients into forms that are absorbable into the bloodstream for bodily use. Intestinal hormones Found primarily in the crypts, the entero-endocrine cells of the mucosa secrete several hormones including secretin, cholecystokinin (CCK) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). The small intestine mucosa has villi, and each villus has multiple microvilli; thereby increasing the surface area exponentially for optimal absorption. There are extensive networks of 22 capillaries within the villi that carry absorbed nutrients to the hepatic portal circulation. Also, a vast quantity of lymphatic capillaries called lacteals aid in chylomicron transportation to the venous circulation. The intestine has both endocrine and exocrine glands that produce hormones, enzymes, and alkaline mucinous material. The hormones released by the small intestine include: Gastrin produced by G-cells in the upper small intestine (but mostly found in the stomach) Cholecystokinin (CCK) produced by I-cells in the upper small intestine; secretin produced by the S-cells in the upper small intestine in response to decreased upper intestine pH; Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) produced by K-cells in the upper small intestine in response to fat, amino acids, and glucose Pro-glucagon produced by the L-cells in the distal ileum and colon in response to glucose and fat Somatostatin produced by D-cells in the small intestine, including the stomach and pancreas Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) produced by parasympathetic ganglia in the small intestine in response to distention Motilin produced by M-cells in the upper small intestine Contractions and motility The primary purposes of the movements of the small intestine are to provide mixing and transport of intraluminal contents. A characteristic of small intestine motility is the inherent ability of the smooth muscle constituting the wall of the intestine to contract spontaneously and rhythmically. This phenomenon is independent of any extrinsic nerve supply to the small intestine. In the myenteric plexus (a network of nerve fibres in the wall of the intestine), there are several other messenger substances and receptors capable of modulating smooth muscle activity, including somatostatin, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), and the enkephalins. With at least seven such substances in and around the smooth muscle, there is some confusion as to their respective roles. The contractions of the small intestine create pressure gradients from one adjacent segment of the organ to another. The pressure gradients, in turn, are primarily responsible for transport within the small intestine. Two types of motor activity have been recognized: segmenting contractions and peristaltic contractions. The predominant motor action of the small intestine is the segmenting contract The Large Intestine The large intestine is responsible for processing indigestible food material (chyme) after most nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine. The large intestine is composed of 4 parts. It includes the cecum and ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid 23 colon. The large intestine performs an essential role by absorbing water, vitamins, and electrolytes from waste material The large intestine has 3 primary functions: absorbing water and electrolytes, producing and absorbing vitamins, and forming and propelling faeces toward the rectum for elimination. The colon also plays a role in providing required vitamins through an environment that is conducive for bacterial cultivation. The colon houses trillions of bacteria that protect our gut and produce vitamins. The bacteria in the colon produce substantial amounts of vitamins by fermentation. Vitamin K and B vitamins, including biotin, are produced by the colonic bacteria. These vitamins are then absorbed into the blood. When dietary intake of these vitamins is low in an individual, the colon plays a significant role in minimizing vitamin disparity. By the time indigestible materials have reached the colon, most nutrients and up to 90% of the water has been absorbed by the small intestine. The role of the ascending colon is to absorb the remaining water and other key nutrients from the indigestible material, solidifying it to form stool. The descending colon stores faeces that will eventually be emptied into the rectum. The sigmoid colon contracts to increase the pressure inside the colon, causing the stool to move into the rectum. The rectum holds the faeces awaiting elimination by defecation. Absorption The stomach is a poor absorptive area of the gastrointestinal tract because it lacks the typical villus type of absorptive membrane, and also because the junctions between the epithelial cells are tight junctions. Only a few highly lipid-soluble substances, such as alcohol and some drugs like aspirin, can be absorbed in small quantities. Folds of Kerckring, Villi, and Microvilli Increase the Mucosal Absorptive Area by Nearly 1000Fold. The small intestine has a huge absorptive surface with many folds called valvulae conniventes (or folds of Kerckring), which increase the surface area of the absorptive mucosa about threefold. 24 Water is transported through the intestinal membrane entirely by diffusion. Therefore, when the chyme is dilute enough, water is absorbed through the intestinal mucosa into the blood of the villi almost entirely by osmosis. Conversely, water can also be transported in the opposite direction—from plasma into the chyme. This occurs especially when hyperosmotic solutions are discharged from the stomach into the duodenum. Within minutes, sufficient water usually will be transferred by osmosis to make the chyme isosmotic with the plasma. 25 Absorption of Ions Sodium is actively transported through the intestinal membrane. Normally, less than 0.5 percent of the intestinal sodium is lost in the faeces each day because it is rapidly absorbed through the intestinal mucosa. Sodium also plays an important role in helping to absorb sugars and amino acids. Absorption of Chloride Ions in the Small Intestine. In the upper part of the small intestine, chloride ion absorption is rapid and occurs mainly by diffusion (i.e., absorption of sodium ions through the epithelium creates electronegativity in the chyme and electropositivity in the paracellular spaces between the epithelial cells). Then chloride ions move along this electrical gradient to “follow” the sodium ions. Chloride is also absorbed across the brush border membrane of parts of the ileum and large intestine by a brush border membrane chloride bicarbonate exchanger; chloride exits the cell on the basolateral membrane through chloride channels. Absorption of Bicarbonate Ions in the Duodenum and Jejunum. Often large quantities of bicarbonate ions must be reabsorbed from the upper small intestine because large amounts of bicarbonate ions have been secreted into the duodenum in both pancreatic secretion and bile. The bicarbonate ion is absorbed in an indirect way as follows: When sodium ions are absorbed, moderate amounts of hydrogen ions are secreted into the lumen of the gut in exchange for some of the sodium. These hydrogen ions in turn combine with the bicarbonate ions to form carbonic acid (H2CO3 ), which then dissociates to form water and carbon dioxide. The water remains as part of the chyme in the intestines, but the carbon dioxide is readily absorbed into the blood and subsequently expired through the lungs. Thus, this is so-called “active absorption of bicarbonate ions.” It is the same mechanism that occurs in the tubules of the kidneys. Secretion of Bicarbonate Ions in the Ileum and Calcium ions are actively absorbed into the blood, especially from the duodenum, and the amount of calcium ion absorption is exactly controlled to supply the daily need of the body for calcium. One important factor controlling calcium absorption is parathyroid hormone secreted by the parathyroid glands, and another is vitamin D. Parathyroid hormone activates vitamin D, and the activated vitamin D in turn greatly enhances calcium absorption. Iron ions are also actively absorbed from the small intestine. The absorption and regulation of iron absorption is in proportion to the body’s need for iron, especially for the formation of haemoglobin. Vitamins and minerals are also absorbed by the small intestine. Folate goes through hydrolysis, is absorbed in the duodenum and upper part of the jejunum, and is actively transported into portal circulation. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble and may be passively absorbed in the small bowel. Approximately 9 litres of water travels to the gastrointestinal tract per day, and the small intestine absorbs 7 to 8 litres, while the colon absorbs the remaining 1 to 2 litres. 26 Rectum, terminal segment of the digestive system in which faeces accumulate just prior to discharge. The rectum is continuous with the sigmoid colon and extends 13 to 15 cm (5 to 6 inches) to the anus. Food wastes remain in the sigmoid colon until they are ready to be excreted from the body. As the faecal material enters the rectum, the walls distend to accommodate the material. When sufficient pressure builds up within the distended rectal cavity, the urge to eliminate wastes occurs. When receptors of the nervous system within the rectal wall are stimulated by its stretching, they send impulses to the anal canal, chest and abdominal-wall muscles, and the medulla oblongata of the brain, which makes the individual conscious of the need to defecate. Defecation, also called bowel movement, the act of eliminating solid or semisolid waste materials (faeces) from the digestive tract. In human beings, wastes are usually removed once or twice daily, but the frequency can vary from several times daily to three times weekly and remain within normal limits. Muscular contractions (peristaltic waves) in the walls of the colon move faecal material through the digestive tract to the rectum. The rectum is a distensible muscular tube that acts as a temporary reservoir for the waste material. As the rectal walls expand with filling, stretch receptors from the nervous system, located in the rectal walls, stimulate the desire to defecate. The urge passes within one to two minutes if not relieved, and the material in the rectum is then often returned to the colon where more water is absorbed. If defecation is continuously delayed, constipation and hardened faeces result. When the rectum is filled, pressure within it is increased. This increased intra-rectal pressure initially forces the walls of the anal canal apart and allows the faecal material to enter the canal; as material is entering, muscles attached to the pelvic floor help further to pull the anal canal walls apart. The rectum shortens as it expels material into the anal canal, and peristaltic waves propel the faeces out of the rectum. In the anus there are two muscular constrictors, the internal and external sphincters that allow the faeces to be passed or retained. As faeces exit, the anus is drawn up over the passing mass by muscles of the pelvic diaphragm to prevent prolapse (pushing out of the body) of the anal canal. While defecation is occurring, the excretion of urine is usually stimulated. The chest muscles, diaphragm, abdominal-wall muscles, and pelvic diaphragm all exert pressure on the digestive tract. Respiration temporarily ceases as the filled lungs push the diaphragm down to exert pressure. Blood pressure rises in the body, and the amount of blood pumped by the heart decreases (Valsalva manoeuvre). Defecation can be totally involuntary, or it may be under voluntary control. Incontinence—the loss of control over the evacuative process—can develop with age; it may also result from surgical, obstetric, spinal, or other bodily injuries or with neurological impairment resulting from diabetes, stroke, or multiple sclerosis. Defecation may also be influenced by pain, fear, temperature elevation, and psychological or neurological complications. Diarrhoea, or abnormally frequent defecation, is a characteristic symptom of many diseases and disorders—most strikingly in such diseases as cholera and dysentery. 27 Accessory organs in digestion Mechanical digestion in the oral cavity consists of grinding of food into smaller pieces by the teeth, a process called mastication. Chemical digestion in the mouth is minor but consists of salivary amylase and lingual lipase, both contained in the saliva. Salivary amylase is chemically identical to pancreatic amylase and digests starch into maltose and maltotriose, working at a pH optimum of 6.7 to 7.0. Lingual lipase, also contained in the saliva, hydrolyses the ester bonds in triglycerides to form diacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols. After sufficient digestion in the oral cavity, the partially digested foodstuff, or bolus, is swallowed into the ooesophagus. After passage through the oesophagus, the bolus will enter the stomach and undergo mechanical and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion in the stomach occurs via peristaltic contractions of the smooth muscle from the fundus towards the contracted pylorus, termed propulsion. Within the duodenum, accessory digestive organs such as the liver and the pancreas release digestive secretions. The liver is the largest internal organ and the largest gland in the human body. It has numerous functions, but as an accessory organ of the digestive system, it produces bile which emulsifies fats and various lipids for optimal digestion. The liver cells synthesize about 6 grams of bile salts daily. The precursor of the bile salts is cholesterol, which is either present in the diet or synthesized in the liver cells during the course of fat metabolism. Bile produced in the liver is stored in the gallbladder. The gallbladder contracts to release bile into the duodenum when fat- containing food is present. Bile serves two important functions. First, bile plays an important role in fat digestion and absorption, not because of any enzymes in the bile that cause fat digestion, but because bile acids in the bile do two things: (1) They help to emulsify the large fat particles of the food into many minute particles, they act as a detergent action on the fat particles in the food. This decreases the surface tension of the particles and allows agitation in the intestinal tract to break the fat globules into minute sizes. Tthe surface of which can then be attacked by lipase enzymes secreted in pancreatic juice, and (2) They aid in absorption of the digested fat end products through the intestinal mucosal membrane. They do this by forming small physical complexes with these lipids; the complexes are called micelles, and they are semi-soluble in the chyme. Without the presence of bile salts in the intestinal tract, up to 40 percent of the ingested fats are lost into the faeces and the person often develops a metabolic deficit because of this nutrient loss. 28 Second, bile serves as a means for excretion of several important waste products from the blood. These include especially bilirubin, an end product of haemoglobin destruction, and excesses of cholesterol. Emptying of the Gallbladder—Stimulatory Role of Cholecystokinin. When food begins to be digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract, the gallbladder begins to empty, especially when fatty foods reach the duodenum about 30 minutes after a meal. The mechanism of gallbladder emptying is rhythmical contractions of the wall of the gallbladder, but effective emptying also requires simultaneous relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi, which guards the exit of the common bile duct into the duodenum. By far the most potent stimulus for causing the gallbladder contractions is the hormone CCK. The stimulus for CCK entry into the blood from the duodenal mucosa is mainly the presence of fatty foods in the duodenum. The gallbladder is also stimulated less strongly by acetylcholine-secreting nerve fibres from both the vagi and the intestinal enteric nervous system. They are the same nerves that promote motility and secretion in other parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The pancreas The pancreas, which lies parallel to and beneath the stomach is a large compound gland with most of its internal structure similar to that of the salivary glands. The pancreatic digestive enzymes are secreted by pancreatic acini, and large volumes of sodium bicarbonate solution are secreted by the small ductile and larger ducts leading from the acini. The combined product of enzymes and sodium bicarbonate then flows through a long pancreatic duct that normally joins the hepatic duct immediately before it empties into the duodenum through the papilla of Vater, surrounded by the sphincter of Oddi. Pancreatic juice is secreted most abundantly in response to the presence of chyme, and the characteristics of the pancreatic juice are determined to some extent by the types of food in the chyme. (The pancreas also secretes insulin, but this is not secreted by the same pancreatic tissue 29 that secretes intestinal pancreatic juice. Instead, insulin is secreted directly into the blood—not into the intestine— by the islets of Langerhans that occur in islet patches throughout the pancreas. Pancreatic Digestive Enzymes Pancreatic secretion contains multiple enzymes for digesting all of the three major types of food: proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. It also contains large quantities of bicarbonate ions, which play an important role in neutralizing the acidity of the chyme emptied from the stomach into the duodenum. The most important of the pancreatic enzymes for digesting proteins are trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypolypeptidase. Trypsin and chymotrypsin split whole and partially digested proteins into peptides of various sizes but do not cause release of individual amino acids. However, carboxypolypeptidase splits some peptides into individual amino acids, thus completing digestion of some proteins all the way to the amino acid state. When first synthesized in the pancreatic cells, the proteolytic digestive enzymes are in the inactive forms trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and procarboxypolypeptidase, which are all inactive enzymatically. They become activated only after they are secreted into the intestinal 30 tract. Trypsinogen is activated by an enzyme called enterokinase, which is secreted by the intestinal mucosa, when chyme comes in contact with the mucosa. Also, trypsinogen can be auto-catalytically activated by trypsin that has already been formed from previously secreted trypsinogen. Chymotrypsinogen is activated by trypsin to form chymotrypsin, and procarboxypolypeptidase is activated in a similar manner. Secretion of Trypsin Inhibitor Prevents Digestion of the Pancreas Itself. It is important that the proteolytic enzymes of the pancreatic juice do not become activated until after they have been secreted into the intestine because the trypsin and the other enzymes would digest the pancreas itself. Fortunately, the same cells that secrete proteolytic enzymes into the acini of the pancreas secrete simultaneously another substance called trypsin inhibitor. This substance is formed in the cytoplasm of the glandular cells, and it prevents activation of trypsin both inside the secretory cells and in the acini and ducts of the pancreas. And, because it is trypsin that activates the other pancreatic proteolytic enzymes, trypsin inhibitor prevents activation of the others as well. When the pancreas becomes severely damaged or when a duct becomes blocked, large quantities of pancreatic secretion sometimes become pooled in the damaged areas of the pancreas. Under these conditions, the effect of trypsin inhibitor is often overwhelmed, in which case the pancreatic secretions rapidly become activated and can literally digest the entire pancreas within a few hours, giving rise to the condition called acute pancreatitis. 31 The pancreatic enzyme for digesting carbohydrates is pancreatic amylase, which hydrolyses starches, glycogen, and most other carbohydrates (except cellulose) to form mostly disaccharides and a few trisaccharides. The main enzymes for fat digestion are (1) pancreatic lipase, which is capable of hydrolysing neutral fat into fatty acids and monoglycerides; (2) cholesterol esterase, which causes hydrolysis of cholesterol esters; and (3) phospholipase, which splits fatty acids from phospholipids. 32 Regulation of Pancreatic Secretion Three basic stimuli are important in causing pancreatic secretion: 1. Acetylcholine, which is released from the parasympathetic vagus nerve endings and from other cholinergic nerves in the enteric nervous system 2. Cholecystokinin, which is secreted by the duodenal and upper jejunal mucosa when food enters the small intestine 3. Secretin, which is also secreted by the duodenal and jejunal mucosa when highly acidic food enters the small intestine Acetylcholine and cholecystokinin, stimulate the acinar cells of the pancreas, causing production of large quantities of pancreatic digestive enzymes but relatively small quantities of water and electrolytes to go with the enzymes. Without the water, most of the enzymes remain temporarily stored in the acini and ducts until more fluid secretion comes along to wash them into the duodenum. Secretin, in contrast to the first two basic stimuli, stimulates secretion of large quantities of water solution of sodium bicarbonate by the pancreatic ductal epithelium. 33 Gastrointestinal Hormones The GI hormones are classified as endocrines, paracrine, or neurocrine based on the method by which the molecule gets delivered to its target cell(s). Endocrine hormones are secreted from enteroendocrine cells directly into the bloodstream, passing from the portal circulation to the systemic circulation, before being delivered to target cells with receptor-specificity for the hormone. The five GI hormones that qualify as endocrines are gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), secretin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), and motilin. Enteroendocrine cells also secrete paracrine hormones, but they diffuse through the extracellular space to act locally on target tissues and do not enter the systemic circulation. Two examples of paracrine hormones are somatostatin and histamine. Neurocrine hormones get secreted by postganglionic non-cholinergic neurons of the enteric nervous system. Three neurocrine hormones with significant physiologic functions in the gut are vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastrin release peptide (GRP), and enkephalins. Gastrointestinal hormones undergo synthesis in specialized cells of the GI tract mucosa known as enteroendocrine cells. Gastrin (G) is secreted by the G cells of the gastric pylorus, antrum and duodenum. Gastrin is secreted in response to the presence of protein and gastric distention. Its major action is to increase gastric acid secretion. Gastrin binds to the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor (also called the CCK-B (2) receptor), a G-protein coupled receptor, with an affinity similar to CCK. This binding results in stimulation of gastric acid secretion and hyperplasia of the Enterochromaffin like cells (ECL). Increased plasma levels of gastrin, independent of food or increased gastric acidity, can be used as a diagnostic tool for cases of pernicious anaemia or gastrinoma (a tumor that secretes gastrin). In addition, gastrin increases acid secretion indirectly by stimulation of histamine release from the ECL, which can activate histamine-2 (H2) receptors on acid secreting gastric parietal cells. Therefore, one of the ways that the inhibition of gastric acid secretion can be affected is through drugs that block the H2 receptor, such as cimetidine. Actions of gastrin 1. Stimulation of gastric acid and pepsin secretion. 2. Stimulation of growth of mucosa of the stomach, and small and large intestines (trophic action). 3. Stimulates growth of gastric mucosa by stimulating the synthesis of RNA and new protein. Patients with gastrin-secreting tumors have hypertrophy (size of cells) and hyperplasia (number of cells) of the gastric mucosa. 3. Stimulation of gastric motility. 34 Secretin is secreted by the S-cells of the duodenum and upper jejunum in response to fat and protein, gastric acid, and bile acids. Functionally, secretin stimulates exocrine pancreatic and biliary secretions of water and bicarbonate, gastric mucus and pepsinogen, endocrine pancreatic secretions of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin and pancreatic growth. In addition, secretin inhibits gastric acid secretion (functioning as a sort of nature’s anti-acid), as well as motility of the intestine and gastric mucosal growth. The regulation of secretin functions is controlled by the action of hormones such as CCK or by hormonal-neuronal interaction, such as CCK and the vagus nerve. Pathologically, hyper-secretinemia can be found in cases of duodenal ulcer, renal failure, chronic pancreatitis and oesophageal small cell carcinoma. a. Actions of secretin are coordinated to reduce the amount of H+ in the lumen of the small intestine. (1) Secretin increase secretion of bicarbonate by the duct cells of the pancreas and biliary tract. Secretin thus causes the secretion of watery, alkaline pancreatic juice. Pancreatic HCO3- neutralizes H+ in the intestinal lumen. (2) Secretin Stimulates HCO3- and H2O secretion by the liver, and increases bile production. (3) Secretin Inhibits H+ secretion by gastric parietal cells. (4) Secretin increases growth of the exocrine pancreas. (5) Secretin augments the action of CCK in producing pancreatic secretion of digestive enzyme. (6) Secretin has a mild effect on motility of the gastrointestinal tract b. Stimuli for the release of secretin Secretin is released by the S cells of the duodenum in response to: (1) H + in the lumen of the duodenum (2) Protein in the lumen of the duodenum Cholecystokinin (CCK) CCK, which is a hormone that is secreted by the endocrine I cells and the enteric neurons of the duodenum and jejunum in response to fat and protein. Its major action is to stimulate gallbladder emptying and the secretion of pancreatic enzymes. Cholecystokinin controls many gastrointestinal functions by activating two G-protein coupled receptors: CCK1, formerly known as CCK-A (alimentary) receptor, which is distributed mainly in the alimentary tract, and CCK2, formerly known as CCK-B (brain) receptor, which is distributed mainly in the central nervous system. Physiologically, CCK controls many gastrointestinal-related functions. For example, CCK causes gallbladder and smooth muscle contraction while increasing pancreatic secretion. It also inhibits gastric emptying. Along with gastrin releasing peptide, CCK is one of the classical peptides that reduce food intake. 35 CCK is secreted from I cells in duodenum and jejunum. CCK In the brain, especially the cerebral cortex, may be involved in regulation of food intake Actions of CCK 1. Stimulates contraction of the gallbladder and simultaneously causes relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi for secretion of bile. 2. Stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion. 3. Potentiates secretin-induced stimulation of pancreatic HCO3- secretion. 4. Stimulates growth (trophic effect) of the exocrine pancreas. 5. Inhibits gastric emptying. Thus, meals containing fat stimulate the secretion of CCK, which slows gastric emptying to allow more time for intestinal digestion and absorption. 6. Increase the secretion of entero-kinase. 7. Enhance the motility of the small intestine and colon. 8. CCK and secretin augments the contraction of the pyloric sphincter. 9. Gastrin and CCK stimulate glucagon secretion after protein meal. 10. Inhibits appetite to prevent overeating during meals by stimulating sensory afferent nerve fibres in the duodenum; these fibres, in turn, send signals by way of the vagus nerve to inhibit feeding centres in the brain Stimuli for the release of CCK 1. Small peptides and amino acids 2. Fatty acids containing more than 10 carbon atoms and mono-glycerides • 3. Triglycerides do not stimulate the release of CCK because they cannot cross intestinal cell membranes. Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) is referred to as an enterogastrone because of its ability to reduce the rate of stomach emptying. Enterogastrone is a collective term that refers to any hormone or regulatory substance that slows the movement of ingesta, particularly from the stomach to intestine. The name glucose- dependent insulinotropic peptide is also given to GIP because its secretion is stimulated by the presence of glucose in the duodenum and one of its actions is to stimulate the secretion of insulin from the endocrine pancreas. GIP is produced by K cells in the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum. Actions of GIP 36 Stimulates insulin release. In the presence of an oral glucose load, GIP causes the release of insulin from the pancreas. Thus, oral glucose is more effective than intravenous glucose in causing insulin release and, therefore, glucose utilization. Stimuli for the release of GIP GIP is the only GI hormone that is released in response to fat, protein, but to a lower extent in response carbohydrate. Motilin Motilin is secreted by the stomach and upper duodenum during fasting, and known to increase gastrointestinal motility. Motilin secretion is inhibited after ingestion of food by mechanisms that are not fully understood. Motilin is secreted by the M or Mo cells of the duodenum and, to a lower extent, by the jejunum. Motilin works on both muscles and nerves to regulate the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC), the basic pattern of intestinal motility present during the period between meals that is interrupted by feeding.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
