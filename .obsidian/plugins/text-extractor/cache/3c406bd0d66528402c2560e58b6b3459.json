His mother told the staff that the child does not play outside. The child’s diet consisted mostly of maize meal, bananas and carbonated soft drink, Coca-Cola. After examining the child, the doctor took a blood sample and requested x-rays of the child’s legs. The results of the blood analysis are shown in the table below. Plasma Child Normal Values Ionised calcium concentration (mmol/l) 0.75 1.16 - 1.32 Calcitriol (mmol/l) 1.05 2.05 - 2.56 Parathyroid hormone (PTH) (ng/l) 130 7 – 53 The child was diagnosed as having rickets. 1. Provide a full physiological explanation for the child’s plasma a) Calcium concentration (3) b) Parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration (3) 2. Giving full physiological explanations for your answers decide whether the following statements are correct or incorrect. a) The child will have an increased bone density (bone mineralization) (3) b) The child is likely to develop skeletal muscle tetany (spontaneous contractions). (3) c) The child will have a higher than normal plasma calcitonin concentration. (3) d) The child will have a higher than normal plasma phosphate concentration .
