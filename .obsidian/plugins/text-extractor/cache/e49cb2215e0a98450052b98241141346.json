(http://www.samed.org.za/DynamicData/LibraryDownloads/245. pdf)  Point of care diagnostics ( POC) devices - also referred to as near- patient testing; are medical tools defined as investigation taken at the time of consultation providing instant availability of results to make immediate and informed decision about patient care. Thereby allowing patient access to earlier diagnosis and save lives, and patient money (travelling ) to under-served populations. 4 Types of POC technology They include both low-tech and high-tech methods and devices are portable, fast and low cost. These include but not limited to the following; 1. Nanomaterial membrane-based test strips, this type of POC can be enclosed by a plastic test cassette (http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2018/CS/C7CS00837F ) 2. And or a simple Chromatography Paper base test strips, these type of POC or concept design works well, often realized in test systems for detecting pathogens and other chronic inflammatory diseases (https://academic.oup.com/labmed/article pdf/31/2/92/24957760/labmed31-0092.pdf) 5 Types of POC technology 3. Microfluidic POC devices, This type of POC consists of a set of micro-channels moulded into a material with glass, silicon or polymer such as PDMS, forming a microfluidic chip. The micro-fluidic device consist of micro- channels forming the microfluidic chip, connected together in order to achieve the desired function (such functions, includes but are not limited to mixing, pump, sorting, or control of the biochemical environment).

These legislative frameworks have been set out such that they achieve greater uniformity between national and international medical device regulatory systems. The standards cover topics such as;  clinical evidence,  Risk management- classification  Medical devices required to be sterile,  Quality management systems 7 Regulatory framework in S.A The Medicines Control Council, is a statutory body which has been appointed by the Minister of Health, to ensure that all medical devices are regulated, with the main purpose of safe guarding and protecting the public by ensuring that all medical diagnostics sold in SA are safe, therapeutic effective and meet acceptable standards of quality.  Medicines and Related Substances Control Act No. 101 of 1965 (Medical Device Regulation 12 of Act 101 of 1965) (http://www.hpcsa.co.za/Uploads/editor/UserFiles/downloads/legislations/acts/med icines_and_related_sub_act_101_of_1965.pdf) 8 Classification of devices As stated in the regulatory frameworks, the classifications of devices are based on the risk posed by a device and it is important to understand how they are classified since the development processes differs depending on the classification. By law all medical devices are to registered with the Council before they can be sold or for public use in S.A. Device discovery- Classification Source: Contribution to Europe’s Health, Innovation and Economy, MedTech Europe, 2013 10 Control practices for the Classification of devices Class 1- General controls practices These pose no risk to the intended users or consumer and therefore general controls ensures the safety and effectiveness of devices a) Good manufacturing processes b) Record keeping c) Standards and reporting adverse events to FDA d) Registration Class 2- General & Special Controls Pose more risk to consumer and are subjected to special controls, such as; a) Labelling b) Device performance standards c) Device testing requirements 11 Control practices for the Classification of devices Class 3- General controls and Premarket Approval This is where scientific data is presented as part of registration of medical device application. a) Support or sustain life, are implanted in the body, or have the potential for unreasonable risk of illness or injury and if so must obtain premarket approval. b) To be pre-approved for market, the manufacture must prove that a device is safe and effective. 12 Example of the different Commercial point of care technologies Point of care devices are not new, currently there exist a vast number of these devices in market and some have been implemented in clinical care settings, however limitation do exist and thus a need to continuously develop new innovative, low cost, easy to use and highly integrated POC technologies. Example of a POC device with different functions Hemocue: WBC tool and WBC diff tool Hemocue: Hb and anaemia screening • Test: WBC, and WBC and diff • WBC- 3mins, • WBC Diff- 5 mins • Imaging system • Screen and printer • Test: Hb • Depending on the tool - seconds to minutes • Depending on the tool - absorbance, dual wavelengths • Display of results- Screen • Easy to use • Portable • Measurements ContentsAutomated P.O.C Blood Analyzer: Cellnostics: Develop a low cost point of care device to automatically prepare and analyze blood sample. By Zandile Nxumalo 15 CSIR- Health 16 Summary- Device development 17 Development / concept Conceptualisation of a medical device is a well established path, which scientist invent, refine and test. These concept or ideas often begin with the following; 1) Understanding of an unmet medical need 2) Market analysis 3) Concept/ idea for a new device 4) Prototype development- This stage often involves laboratory testing in a controlled environment, a document outlining whether or not the concept can be done understanding the risk to people 18 The need Currently, patients in the public healthcare sector located in rural and low-resource areas receive medical care predominantly at primary healthcare facilities, such as clinics and community healthcare centres. The services rendered at those facilities include the ordering of in-vitro diagnostics (IVD), i.e. haematology (blood) tests, as these results are a critical part of diagnoses and treatment for many conditions and illnesses. 19 The need Turnaround time (TAT) for these tests is an important indicator of laboratory performance and directly impacts the quality of patient care. Though it is often difficult to achieve fast TAT for blood tests conducted at community healthcare centres (CHC) and clinics because these facilities are often far away from a centralized laboratory, and transporting blood samples and test results between the two locations creates significant delay. Our efforts with the Cellnostics project seek to mitigate this problem by point-of-care testing in order to reduce TAT and deliver actionable results. 20 Overview of SA medical device industry Market size is R16.9 billion Base on the health care expenditure 94.2% of products imported 0.33% of the global market ~30 multinational companies ~26 local manufacturers ~Employs less than 50 people Employs over 20 000 21 Aim- Proposed solution  Provide patients accessibility to comprehensive blood analysis in remote and low-resource areas, thereby enabling primary healthcare workers with access to real-time, lab-quality results within minutes, rather than days.  Having results available while the patient is still at the medical facility enabling quicker initiation of treatment and thus leading to increased efficiency, quick turn around times to treatment and above all, results in improved patient care. CSIR Point of Care Device –Proposed Solution Rural Clinic Portable Point-of-Care (POC) device Disposable simple-to-use finger-stick cartridges Collecting clinical data Mobile 3G connectivity Designed for use in low-resource (rural) public health care facilities Modular Design Device development- Design... In order to implement a full blood count at the point of care, we used a microfluidic device ( which we conceptualized in house). Microfluidic devices, consists of micro-scale channels, which can be manipulated and process small volumes of fluids, such as blood and are thus ideal for our product. In our medical device the aim was to use a small desirable drop of blood so that we can perform a panel of tests at the point of care site. Testing prototype... To automate the sample preparation for each test into a microfluidic cartridge format, the generic components required each time are the same: 1) blood sample introduction, 2) reagent introduction, 3) mixing of blood and reagent, and 4) dispensing and visualization of sample for blood cell counting to be implemented successfully. Testing Device functionality UK NEQAS (10%; 7.16) UK NEQAS (10%; 5.85) Hemocue article Osei-Bimpong et al., 2009) used two ranges to determine the Usefulness of the Hemocue results. These ranges were based on: UK NEQAS (United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service ) 8-10% range CLIA-88 (Clinical laboratory improvements amendments) 15% range OUR RESULTS: The WBC cartridge results are approximately around the both references ranges. The haemocytometer results are out of range. CLIA-88 ( 15%; 7.48) CLIA-88 (15%; 5.53) Path ref 9.88 Path ref 3.92 Results were analysed for 1 manual test and 11 automated tests. The controls and cartridge results are within the pathology reference range. Results from cartridge 13 and 16 of the automated results were closest in range to the path Reference. The RBC international reference ranges were based on: CLIA-88 (Clinical laboratory improvements amendments) 6% range OUR RESULTS: The pathology control and the RBC automated cartridge results are within the acceptable CLIA-88 reference range. The haemocytometer and manual results are out of range. CLIA-88 ( 6%; 4.47) CLIA-88 ( 15%; 3.97 ) Path ref 5.67 Path ref 4.13 Results were analysed for 1 manual test and 10 automated tests. OUT of focus tests were analysed ONLY! All the cartridge results EXCEPT the manual result are within the pathology reference range.The haemocytometer result falls out of the pathology reference range. Summary of our Results: •WBC •All analysed results are within the pathology reference range •All WBC cartridge results are approximately around the both the UK NEQAS and CLIA-88 references ranges. •The UK NEQAS and CLIA-88 ranges were used to evaluate the Hemocue for WBC tests •The haemocytometer results are out of the UK NEQAS and CLIA- 88 reference range. •RBC •Except for the manual test, ALL results, including the standard deviation are within the pathology reference range What is our main differentiator? The Cellnostics POC device addresses the current need in the South African Primary health care sector and it is designed such that it will be low cost, user friendly, robust, provides connectivity and addresses the shortage of qualified healthcare workers. The main differentiator of the Cellnostics POC device includes the fanalysis in order to obtain a total full blood cell count. The Cellnostics POC device can perform multiple tests on different platforms that can be integrated such as the Cartridge and the CD base microfluidics contributing to the quantification of the FBC and anaemia. The use holography and image processing tools allows for the automated quantification of total WBC, RBC, PLT and haematocrit. The device is designed such that abnormal results can be flagged and stored in the backend database. This information accessed remotely by clinicians thus reducing the following; The Cellnostics device incorporates the use of microfluidics technology, which requires a small volume of blood sample for an turnaround time for patient results and thus improving rapid treatment. The Cellnostics device allows for patient data information (demographic and clinical history) entry which can be stored in a secured and encrypted backend database, allowing for patient confidentiality. 32 Lesson learned • Importance of testing your prototype • Testing of the device prototype is in a controlled laboratory setting • Refine device prototypes • Identify the risk posed by the device for use in humans Thank you (Contact: ZNxumalo@csir.co.za)","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
