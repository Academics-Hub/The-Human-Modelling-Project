HUTCHINSON 2B09 SCHOOL OF ANATOMICAL SCIENCES OBJECTIVES • Describe the surface anatomy of the neck and identify important surface landmarks • Demonstrate the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the hyoid bone, the thyroid cartilage and trachea on a living subject • Describe the arrangement of the layers of the deep fascia of the neck • Describe the subdivisions of the triangles of the neck as well as the contents of each of the subdivisions • Describe the arrangement of the lymph nodes of the neck in superficial and deep layers • Describe the structure, relations, blood supply, lymphatic drainage and innervation of the thyroid gland • Describe the origin and distribution of the laryngeal nerves and vessels • LAYERS OF THE NECK FROM SUPERFICIAL TO DEEP • Platysma muscle • Superficial/investing layer of deep cervical fascia • Infrahyoid fascia • Pretracheal/visceral fascia • Carotid sheath • Buccopharyngeal/visceral fascia • Prevertebral layer of deep cervical fascia • Deep investing layer • Pretracheal fascia • Prevertebral fascia • Carotid sheath • Investing layer of deep cervical fascia • Posteriorly: blends with the ligamentum nuchae (attached to the spines of the cervical vertebrae) • Anteriorly: it is attached to the hyoid bone • Superiorly: it’s attached to the inferior border of the mandible, runs posteriorly to attach to the mastoid process, superior nuchal line and the external occipital protuberance • Postero-inferiorly: • Attached to the spine and acromion of the scapula and clavicle with trapezius muscle. • Antero-inferiorly: • It takes it’s inferior attachment to the clavicle and the manubrium of the sternum with the sternocleidomastoid muscle being the involved muscle. • In the intervals between the muscles, it’s attached to both clavicles and the jugular notch of the sternum by two layers into which it splits a short distance above them • These layers are attached to the anterior and posterior surfaces of the jugular notch of the sternum, thus enclosing between them the suprasternal space which contains the lower part of the anterior jugular veins, an anastomotic arch between them, the sternal heads of sternocleidomastoid and sometimes a lymph node • Of the two layers that adhere to the middle third of the clavicle, the deeper splits around the inferior belly of omohyoid, forming a fascial sling which keeps this muscle belly low down in the neck. The two layers are pierced by the external jugular vein • Between the angle of the mandible and tip of the mastoid process the investing layer is strong and split to enclose the parotid gland • The superficial layer of the split fascia extends superiorly as the parotidomasseteric fascia and extends as far up as the zygomatic arch • The deep layer of the fascia extends to the base of the skull; between the styloid process and the angle of the mandible it is known as the stylomandibular ligament • Thin fascia, lying deep to the infrahyoid strap muscles • Its superior attachment is limited by the respective attachments of the infrahyoid strap muscles (body of hyoid and oblique line of thyroid cartilage) • The pretracheal fascia splits to enclose the thyroid gland, to which it is not adherent with the exception of the isthmus and 2nd, 3rd and 4th tracheal rings • Laterally it fuses with the front of the carotid sheath on the deep surface of the sternocleidomastoid muscle • Inferiorly it passes behind the brachiocephalic veins to blend with the adventitia of the aortic arch and the fibrous pericardium • Firm, tough membrane that lies anterior to the prevertebral muscles • Extends from the base of the skull, anterior to longus capitis, rectus capitus lateralis and longus colli muscles, downwards to the anterior longitudinal ligament on the body of the t4 vertebra • It extends sideways across the scalenus anterior and medius as well as levator scapulae, getting thinner further out and fading under cover of the anterior border of trapezius • It covers the muscles forming the floor of the posterior triangle of the neck and the cervical nerve roots (thus the cervical plexus as well as the roots of the brachial plexus PREVERTEBRAL FASCIA RELATIONS • The lymph nodes of the posterior triangle and the accessory nerve lie superficial to it • The third part of the subclavian artery lies deep to the fascia which becomes prolonged over the artery and the brachial plexus below the clavicle as the axillary sheath to a varying extend in the axilla. • It does not invest the subclavian or the axillary vein, these lie in loose areolar tissue anterior to it, where they are free to dilate during times of increased venous return from the upper limb • The fascia is pierced by the four cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus (lesser occipital, greater auricular, transverse cervical and supraclavicular nerves) • ANTERIOR TRIANGLE: – SUBDIVISIONS: • SUBMENTAL TRIANGLE • DIGASTRIC TRIANGLE • MUSCULAR TRIANGLE • CAROTID TRIANGLE – BOUNDARIES: •

SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND •Lies along the body of the mandible, partly superior and partly inferior to the posterior half of the mandible within the submandibular triangle of the neck •It is also partly superficial and partly deep to the mylohyoid muscle •The submandibular duct approximately 5 cm in length arises from the portion of the gland that lies between the mylohyoid and the hyoglossus muscles •Passing from lateral to medial the lingual nerve loops under the duct that runs anteriorly, opening by one to three orifices on a small sublingual papilla beside the base of the lingual frenulum •The orifices of the submandibular ducts are visible and saliva can often be seen trickling from them SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND •The arterial supply of the gland is from the submental arteries and the veins accompany the arteries •Lymphatic vessels of the glands end in the deep cervical lymph nodes, particularly the jugulo- omohyoid node •Submandibular glands are supplied by presynaptic parasympathetic secretomotor fibers conveyed from the facial nerve to the lingual nerve via the chorda tympani nerve, which synapse with postsynaptic neurons in the submandibular ganglion •The latter fibers accompany arteries to reach the gland, along with vasoconstrictive postsynaptic sympathetic fibers from the deep cervical ganglion THYROID GLAND •Situated low down on the anterior surface of the neck •Consists of two symmetrical lobes united by an isthmus that lies in front of the second, to fourth tracheal rings •The lobes of the gland are located on either side of the larynx and trachea, extending from the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage to the sixth tracheal ring •In addition to its own capsule the gland is enclosed by an envelope of pretracheal fascia •Each lateral lobe is pear-shaped with a narrow upper pole and a broad lower pole, and appears approximately triangular on cross-section with lateral, medial and posterior surfaces THYROID GLAND •lateral/superficial surface: •us under cover of sternothyroid & sternohyoid •medial surface: • lies against the lateral side of the larynx and upper trachea, with the lower pharynx and upper oesophagus immediately behind •this surface is related to the cricothyroid muscle of the larynx and inferior constrictor of the pharynx, as well as the external and recurrent laryngeal nerves •posterior surface: •overlaps the medial part of the carotid sheath, if enlarged the lobe may extend across the more laterally placed internal jugular vein •the parathyroid glands usually lie in contact with this surface, between it and the fascial sheath THYROID GLAND •The isthmus joins the anterior surfaces or the lobes towards their lower poles •The posterior surface of the isthmus is firmly adherent to the second to fourth tracheal rings and the pretracheal fascia is here fixed between them •This fixation and investment of the whole gland by pretracheal fascia are responsible for the gland moving up and down with the larynx during swallowing •An anastomosis between the two superior thyroid arteries runs across the upper border of the isthmus and tributaries from the inferior thyroid veins emerge from its lower border •A small portion of the gland substance often projects superiorly from the isthmus, generally to the left of the midline as the pyramidal lobe and represents a development of glandular tissue from the caudal end of the thyroglossal duct SUPERIOR THYROID ARTERY •Anterior branch •Posterior branch INFERIOR THYROID ARTERY •Ascending cervical artery •Pharyngeal

NERVES FROM THE SUPERIOR MIDDLE AND INFERIOR CERVICAL GANGLIA THYROID GLAND PARATHYROID GLANDS •Normally lie behind the lobes of the thyroid gland •Usually four in number: 2 per lobe •The superior gland •Most constant in position •Usually within the thyroid’s pretracheal fascia capsule at the middle of the back of the thyroid lobe, level with the first tracheal ring and above the inferior thyroid artery •The inferior gland •Less constant in position •Usually within the pretracheal fascia sheath behind the lower pole, but it may be in the gland itself or outside the fascial sheath in a variable position in the neck or in the superior or posterior mediastinum •Both upper and lower glands are supplied by the inferior thyroid artery otherwise by anastomosis between the superior and inferior arteries •Their minute veins join thyroid veins •Sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibers enter with the arteries BRANCHES OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY •At the origin the ECA lies against the side wall of the pharynx, antero-medial to the ICA •It ascends anterior to the ICA deep to the posterior belly of digastric and stylohyoid muscles, above which it pierces the deep lamina of the parotid fascia and enters the parotid gland •It divides into its terminal branches namely the maxillary artery and superficial temporal artery within the substance of the parotid gland •At the origin of the artery the IJV lies lateral, but higher up the vein lies posterior and deep to the artery •The facial vein also crosses the artery with the hypoglossal nerve lying between. •Except at its origin the vessel lies in front of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle BRANCHES OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY Clinical perspectives: •The surface markings of the external carotid artery is along a line from the bifurcation of the common carotid artery passing up behind the angle of the mandible to a point immediately in front of the tragus of the ear •Surgical approach: •The vessel can be exposed in front of the upper part of sternocleidomastoid before entering the parotid gland by ligating the facial vein •Caution should be exercised as the hypoglossal nerve which crosses the external and internal carotids superficially must not be damaged •Branches of the ECA: •2 terminal branches (maxillary + superficial temporal artery) •3 anterior branches (superior thyroid artery + lingual + facial arteries) •2 posterior branches (Occipital artery + posterior auricular) •1 medial branch Ascending pharyngeal artery INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY •Arises at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery and continues superiorly within the carotid sheath •The carotid sinus is located at the origin of the ICA •Here the wall is thin and its contained baroreceptors are supplied by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves which mediate blood pressure to the medullary centers The carotid body is a small structure lying behind the bifurcation of the carotid arterial system or between its branches. The cells of the carotid body contain chemoreceptors with respiratory reflexes and they too are innervated by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN •Tributaries of the vein below the inferior petrosal sinus include: •Pharyngeal vein •Lingual vein •Facial vein •Superior & middle thyroid veins •The lingual vein and superior thyroid veins may join the facial vein although other variations are possible •At the commencement and termination the vein is slightly dilated to form superior and inferior bulbs. The inferior bulb does contain a pair of valves •Clinical perspectives: •Surface markings of the vein include along a line from the lobule of the ear to the sternal end of the clavicle, between the two heads of the SCM •The jugular venous pulse is a guide to the jugular venous pressure, which is the same as the right atrial or central venous pressure and is thus an indicator of cardiovascular function •With a patient reclining to 450, the JVP should be visible above the clavicle CATHETERIZATION OF THE INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN •The right jugular vein on a direct path to the right atrium can be cannulated for the insertion of a central venous line, for measurements of central venous pressure, or rapid administration of medication, when a peripheral approach is too slow •The vein is usually approached through the center of the triangle formed by the two heads of the scm and clavicle •The needle is directed caudally, parallel to the sagittal plane at a 300 posterior angle with the coronal plane at approximately 4-5cm depth •The most common complication is haematoma formation although others include: common carotid artery puncture, vagus nerve injury and pneumothorax due to pleural perforation 1.
