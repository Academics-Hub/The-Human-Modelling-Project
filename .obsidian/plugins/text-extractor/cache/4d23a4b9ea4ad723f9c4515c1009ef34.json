Each group will be tasked with coding (in Matlab) a simplified model of the glucose, insulin and oxygen uptake dynamics of one organ or system. Each group must also produce a write-up explaining the modelling decisions underpinning their respective code modules. The intention of the project is that these code modules can be combined into an overall dynamic model. The individual task will consist of testing the responses of your group’s module to a range of input conditions. The individual submission will consist of the code used to test the module along with a write-up explaining how the test conditions were selected and whether the module’s responses match expectations based on known physiology. Details of group modelling task Each module should be programmed as a Matlab function which receives the following input parameters: The blood flow-rate to the organ or system in question, along with the SpO2, PCO2, blood glucose, and blood insulin concentrations of the blood entering the organ or system in question. The function should return exiting concentrations for those components. Groups will have to conduct independent research and review scientific literature while developing a model. However, a high level of biological detail is not necessary – approximate chemical reaction kinetics based on values for glucose, oxygen and insulin will be sufficient. Generally, metabolic rate in tissues follows a class of reaction kinetics called Michaelis-Menten kinetics. For most tissue types, current reserves of oxygen can be approximated using Henry’s Law absorption of Oxygen in water. The models should be formulated using the conservation and transport phenomena equations studied in the course, incorporating reaction kinetic information from literature, and required parameters should be fit based on normal physiological conditions. Details of individual code-testing task Each student will select a range of test values for the input parameters to test their group’s module of code. The testing should evaluate the following points:  Does the model’s behaviour match expectations under normal physiological conditions?  Does the model’s behaviour match expectations under pathological conditions?  Does the model’s behaviour match expectations when stress-tested under extreme conditions?  Do the trends in model behaviour, with varying conditions, match expectations? Logistics All TBD and open to discussion – the one constraint is that marking a project as fiddly as this, with all the submissions different, will be excruciatingly time-consuming so I’ll need quite a buffer ahead of marks submission. I will open considerably expanded office hours for consultation during the project period. The optimistic hope for this project is that the results (once stitched together and with a process control module added to simulate diabetes treatment) may turn out to be publishable in a scientific journal and I will endeavour to do so. Hence, the formal issuing of the assignment will be accompanied with a waiver where you indicate whether or not you consent to your work potentially being published. Those students who, for whatever reason, opt out will be in a group (or groups) together to make it simple to separate ‘for publishing’ and ‘not for publishing’ submissions.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
