It serves as a conduit for air and in the mediastinum it bifurcates into paired main bronchi. • Paired main (primary) bronchi that enter root of the right or left lung • Bronchioles, which branch extensively into Terminal bronchioles • Respiratory bronchioles that are involve in both air conduction and gas exchange. • Alveolar ducts that are elongated airways formed from the confluence openings to alveoli. • Alveolar sacs that represent spaces surrounded by clusters of alveoli. • Alveoli that are the primary sites of gas exchange. Conditioning of the air occurs in the conducting portion of the respiratory system and includes warming, moistening, and removal of particulate materials. Mucous and serous secretions play a major role in the conditioning process. These secretions moisten the air and trap particles that have managed to slip past the special short thick hairs, called vibrissae, in the nasal cavities. Nasal cavities Nasal cavities are paired chambers divided into three regions: • Nasal vestibule, which is a dilated space of the nasal cavity just inside nostrils and lined by skin ➢ lined with stratified squamous epithelium, a continuation of the skin of the face, and contains a variable number of vibrissae that entrap large particulate matter before it is carried in the air stream to the rest of the cavity. ➢ Sebaceous glands are also present, and their secretions assist in the entrapment of particulate matter. Posteriorly, where the vestibule ends, the stratified squamous epithelium becomes thinner and undergoes a transition to the pseudostratified epithelium that characterizes the respiratory region. ➢ At this site, sebaceous glands are absent. • Respiratory region, which is the largest part (inferior two-thirds) of the nasal cavities and lined by respiratory mucosa • Olfactory region, which is located at the apex (upper one third) of each nasal cavity and lined by specialized olfactory mucosa Larynx and Pharynx ➢ The pharynx is a posterior continuation of the oral and nasal cavities, passing food into the oesophagus and air into the larynx (which connects the pharynx and trachea, and contains vocal folds that produce sound) ➢ The larynx is lined by respiratory mucosa, except for the vocal cords’ luminal surfaces which are lined by stratified squamous epithelium 1.Compare and contrast the identification and classification of the three layers of the olfactory and respiratory mucosa 2.Provide the main cell types of the olfactory and respiratory epithelium and their specific functions 3.Compare and contrast appearance of the basement membrane associated with olfactory and respiratory epithelium 4.Compare and contrast the main structural constituents of the lamina propria associated with the olfactory and respiratory mucosae and link these with their specific functions Z Jhetam (2020) Olfactory Mucosa Respiratory Mucosa 1 Olfactory epithelium + very indistinct basement membrane (because it's pierced by bowman’s ducts and axons) 2 Lamina propria is continuous with underlying periosteum and is Very vascular with lymph vessels and nerves (unmyelinated olfactory + myelinated) and 3 Olfactory/ Bowmans glands (serous in nature) ➢ Cuboidal epithelial cells line SEPs; ducts pierce epithelium and basement membrane to secrete watery serous secretions at the surface ➢ Branches tubuloalveolar serous classification ➢ Have lipfuscin granules (yellow-brown) ➢ Proteinaceous serous secretion serves as a trap + solvent for odiferous substances Cell types in olfactory epithelium: • Olfactory receptor cells are bipolar neurons that span the thickness of the epithelium and enter the central nerve system. ➢ Dendritic processes which project above epithelial surface as knob like olfactory vesicles with cilia that extend radially, parallel to surface of the epithelium ➢ Axons pierce basement membrane and join together to form CN I • Supporting or sustentacular cells are columnar cells that are similar to neuroglia cells and provide mechanical and metabolic support to the olfactory receptor cells. They synthesize and secrete odorant-binding proteins. • Basal cells are stem cells from which new olfactory receptor cells and supporting cells differentiate. • Brush cells are the same cell type that occurs in the respiratory epithelium. 1 Respiratory epithelium (pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium) + very prominent basement membrane that stains eosinophilia 2 Lamina propria is firmly attached to adjacent periosteum/perichondrium and is Very vascular, containing mucous glands with serous demilunes ➢ Ducts lined by 2-layered stratified cuboidal epithelium LP also has elastic fibers 3 Muscularis mucosa (MM) and/or submucosa Cell types in ciliated, pseudostratified columnar epithelium of the respiratory mucosa: • Ciliated cells (most abundant), tall columnar cells with cilia that project into the mucus covering the surface of the epithelium • Goblet cells that synthesize and secrete mucus • Brush cells, a general name for those cells in the respiratory tract that bear short, blunt microvilli. They represent chemosensory receptor cells connected to sensory nerve fibres • Small granule cells (Kulchitsky cells) that resemble basal cells but contain secretory granules. These are (entero)endocrine cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system system • Basal cells, stem cells from which the other cell types arise, and which are cuboidal in shape and lie on the basement membrane and have no contact with the epithelial surface • Mucosal immunity cells: mainly gamma/delta T lymphocytes Z Jhetam (2020) 5.Compare and contrast the identification and classification of the main layers of the tracheal and bronchial mucosa 6. Provide the main function of each 7.What type of connective tissue is the main constituent of the tracheal and bronchial submucosa 8.Identify the main structures found in the tracheal and bronchial submucosa and provide their functions 9.Identify and classify the glands found in these regions and provide their function 10.Provide the main function of trachea and bronchus Trachea Bronchi The wall of the trachea consists of four definable layers: 1. Mucosa ➢ ciliated, pseudostratified epithelium (respiratory epithelium) interspersed with mucous secreting goblet cells ➢ elastic, fiber-rich lamina propria ➢ A thick basement membrane is characteristic of the tracheal epithelium ➢ No muscularis mucosa present! ➢ The boundary between mucosa and submucosa is defined by a Fibroelastic membrane 2. Submucosa ➢ composed of a slightly denser connective tissue than the lamina propria ➢ Has compound tubuloalveolar glands 3. Cartilaginous layer (technically within submucosa) ➢ composed of C-shaped hyaline cartilages ➢ Skeletal framework which maintains patency (prevents collapse) of tracheal lumen during expiration ➢ Trachealis muscle, fibroelastic tissue and smooth muscle connect the ends of the C posteriorly, adjacent to oesophagus 4. Adventitia, composed of connective tissue that binds the trachea to adjacent structures Bronchi (right wider and shorter than left) → lobar (secondary) bronchi →segmental (tertiary) bronchi Initially, bronchi have the same histologic structure as the trachea. When they enter the lungs (intrapulmonary bronchi), the structure of the bronchial wall changes and has the following identifying features: Cartilage plates • Distributed among entire circumference of wall circular shaped) • Disappear when bronchi become bronchioles Circular layer of smooth muscle • Increases as cartilage plates diminish Five layers: 1. Mucosa (composed of a pseudostratified epithelium with the same cellular composition as the trachea) The height of the cells decreases as the bronchi decrease in diameter. ➢ In H&E specimens the “basement membrane” is conspicuous in the primary bronchi but quickly diminishes in thickness and disappears as a discrete structure in the secondary bronchi. ➢ The lamina propria is similar to that of the trachea but is reduced in amount in proportion to the diameter of ➢ the bronchi. 2. Muscularis, a continuous layer of smooth muscle in the larger bronchi. It is more attenuated and loosely organized in smaller bronchi, where it may appear discontinuous because of its spiral course. Contraction of the muscle regulates the appropriate diameter of the airway. 3. Submucosa remains as a relatively loose connective tissue. ➢ Compound tubule-alveolar glands are present as well as adipose tissue in the larger bronchi. 4. Cartilage layer consists of discontinuous cartilage plates that become smaller as the bronchial diameter diminishes. 5. Adventitia is moderately dense connective tissue that is continuous with that of adjacent structures, such as pulmonary artery and lung parenchyma. Z Jhetam (2020) 11.Compare and contrast the identification and classification of the three main mucosal layers of the bronchiole, terminal bronchiole and respiratory bronchiole being the main constituents of the respiratory tree. 12.What is the main function of each? Bronchioles • The bronchopulmonary segments are further subdivided into pulmonary lobules • Each lobule is supplied by a bronchiole. Delicate connective tissue septa that partially separate adjacent lobules may be represented on the surface of the lung as faintly outlined polygonal areas. • Pulmonary acini are smaller units of structure that make up the lobules • Each acinus consists of a terminal bronchiole and the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli that it aerates. • The smallest functional unit of pulmonary structure is thus the respiratory bronchiolar unit., consisting of a single respiratory bronchiole and the alveoli that it supplies. Bronchioles are air-conducting ducts that measure 1 mm or less in diameter. The larger bronchioles represent branches of the segmental bronchi. These ducts branch repeatedly, giving rise to the smaller terminal bronchioles that also branch. The terminal bronchioles finally give rise to the respiratory bronchioles. Mucosa: ➢ The larger-diameter bronchioles initially have a ciliated, pseudostratified columnar epithelium that gradually transforms into a simple ciliated columnar epithelium as the duct narrows > folded, variable epithelium ➢ Goblet cells are still present in the largest bronchioles but are not present in the terminal bronchioles that follow. An exception is in smokers and others exposed to irritants in the air. ➢ A relatively thick layer of smooth muscle is present in the wall of all bronchioles. ➢ LP has no glands Submucosa: ➢ There are no subepithelial glands in bronchioles. Cartilage plates, characteristic of bronchi, are absent in bronchioles. Instead, small elements of cartilage may be present, particularly at branching points. ➢ Has dominant lymphatic nodules ➢ Has elastic fibres which maintain patency of lumen Terminal bronchioles • Thin LP • supported by thick layer of smooth muscle (MM) • No goblet cells, glands nor cartilage in CT • Elastic fibres • Small bronchioles have a simple cuboidal epithelium. The smallest conducting bronchioles, the terminal bronchioles, are lined with a simple cuboidal epithelium in which Clara cells are interspersed among the ciliated cells • Clara cells increase in number as the ciliated cells decrease along the length of the bronchiole. Occasional brush cells and small granule cells are also present. A small amount of connective tissue underlies the epithelium, and a circumferential layer of smooth muscle underlies the connective tissue in the conducting portions. • Clara cells: • nonciliated cells that have a characteristic rounded or dome-shaped apical surface projection • secrete a surface-active agent, a lipoprotein that prevents luminal adhesion should the wall of the airway collapse on itself, particularly during expiration. Z Jhetam (2020) 13.Identify and classify the three main layers of the alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs and provide their function 14. Identify and classify the three main layers of the alveolus and provide their function 15.Identify the main constituents of the inter-alveolar septum and provide their function 16.Provide the constituents of the blood-air barrier and explain through which layers does oxygen have to pass in order to oxygenate the venous blood and vice versa Alveoli Each alveolus is a thin walled polyhedral chamber approximately 0.2 mm in diameter that is confluent with an alveolar sac. • Alveolar ducts are elongated airways that have almost no walls, only alveoli, as their peripheral boundary. Rings of smooth muscle are present in the knoblike interalveolar septa • Alveolar sacs are spaces surrounded by clusters of alveoli. The surrounding alveoli open into these spaces. Alveolar sacs usually occur at the termination of an alveolar duct but may occur anywhere along its length. Alveoli are surrounded and separated from one another by an exceedingly thin connective tissue layer that contains blood capillaries. The tissue between adjacent alveolar air spaces is called the interalveolar septum or septal wall Alveola epithelium is composed of: 1. Type I alveolar cells, aka type I pneumocytes ➢ extremely thin squamous cells; they line most (95%) of the surface of the alveoli ➢ cells are joined to one another and to the other cells of the alveolar epithelium by occluding junctions ➢ The junctions form an effective barrier between the air space and the components of the septal wall. ➢ Type I alveolar cells arenot capable of cell division. 2. Type II alveolar cells/ type II pneumocytes/septal cells ➢ Cuboidal, secretory cells ➢ Interspersed among the type I cells but tend to congregate at septal junctions. ➢ Type II cells account for 60% of the alveolar lining cells, but because of their different shape they cover only about 5% of the alveolar air surface. ➢ Like Clara cells, type II cells tend to bulge into the air space ➢ Their apical cytoplasm is filled with lamellar bodies - granules that are resolved with the TEM as stacks of parallel membrane lamellae ➢ They are rich in a mixture of phospholipids, neutral lipids, and proteins, that is secreted by exocytosis to form an alveolar lining, surface-active agent called surfactant. o Surfactant decreases the alveolar surface tension and actively participates in the clearance of foreign materials o Surfactant proteins help organize the surfactant layer and modulate alveolar immune responses. ➢ are progenitor cells for type I alveolar cells. ➢ After lung injury, they proliferate and restore both types of alveolar cells within the alveolus. ➢ Hyperplasia of type II alveolar cells is an important markerof alveolar injury and repair of alveoli. 3. Brush cells are present but few. They may serve as receptors that monitor air quality in the lung. The alveolar septum = site of the air–blood barrier. The air–blood barrier refers to the cells and cell products across which gases must diffuse between the alveolar and capillary compartments. The thinnest air–blood barrier consists of: Respiratory epithelium • transitional zone in the respiratory system - involved in both air conduction and gas exchange • narrow diameter • lined by cuboidal epithelium • ciliated simple cuboidal cells and dominant Clara cells (esp distally) • Thin LP • supported by smooth muscle (MM) • Elastic fibres present • Occasional brush cells and dense-core granule cells are also present along the length of the respiratory bronchiole. • Scattered, thin-walled outpocketings, alveoli, extend from the lumen of the respiratory bronchioles Z Jhetam (2020) • a thin layer of surfactant • a type I pneumocyte cell and its basal lamina • fused basal lamina of pneumocyte and endothelial cell • a capillary endothelial cell Connective tissue cells and fibers that may be present between the two basal laminae widen the air–blood barrier. These two arrangements produce a thin and thick portion of the barrier Alveolar macrophages • remove inhaled particulate matter from the air spaces and red blood cells from the septum • function both in the connective tissue of the septum and in the air. They may be connected to the septum or free in the alveolar lumen NB: see p730-739 (Textbook) for Plates + Images from lecture slides + Roadmap Z Jhetam (2020)","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
