In testing the cable, a 20 V square-wave pulse is applied to the source end using a signal generator. Assume that all cable sections are lossless and that both source-end and load-end are impedance-matched. i) Using a reflection diagram, determine the magnitudes of the first and second pulses arriving at the load end. ii) The cable sections are made up of the same material of 𝜇=2𝜇0and ε=2.5𝜀0.If each of the 50 Ω sections of the cable are 20 m long and the 30 Ω cable section is 10 m long, calculate the time difference between the first and second pulses arriving at the load end.
