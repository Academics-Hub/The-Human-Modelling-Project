Preface to Third Edition The third edition of Text of Human Anatomy marks the tenth anniversary of the appearance of this manual. Over the first decade of its exposure to medical and allied medical students, Text of Human Anatomy has proved an i ndispensable aid to the understanding and absorption of anatomy. The clarity provided together with its ease of use has made this guide a great companion to students. The third edition of Text of Human Anatomy reveals progress son the previous editions in its accessibility and usefulness. The new edition includes clinically relevant information, which seeks to enliven the anatomy and make it relevant. As the objectives of present medical curricula change so too must this text change and accommodate. This was the impetus for a new edition, which has responded accordingly. The text has been made more user fri endly and the format allows for a sleeker, lighter manual without loss of any information from previ ous editions. These changes have been made after much consultation with students and it is hoped they and their colleagues will be rewarded for their diligence. To quote from the authors: 'The first (and second) edition of this text was well received by medical and all discipline students and we hope that this third edition will gain an even wider acceptance'. The Editors, 2004 Preface to Second Edition The second edition of Text of Human Anatomy differs from the first in a number of aspects. Firstly, the book has been divided into three parts (Par t 1 : Upper Limb, Thorax, Abdomen; Part II: Pelvis, Lower Limb, Back; Part Ill: Head, Neck, Ner vous System). This has been done mainly because a si ngle volume was getting too large to carry around. The typesetting of the book has also been completely revised in order to create a more user-friendly interface. The mistakes, which inevitably slip in with a book of this size, have been corrected. Certain sections, especially the Central nervous system, have been completely rewritten. Our intention with this second edition remains the same as the first i. e. to provide a comprehensive yet concise textbook of human anatomy. Great care was taken to make the text easy to read and easy to understand so that the student may acquire a thorough knowledge of gross anatomy as far as possible. The first edition of this text was well received by medical and all discipline students and we hope that this second edition will gain an even wider acceptance. The Authors, 1997 2 Preface to the First Edition This book is unique in that it is written from a student' s perspective. It attempts to provide a thorough, systematically organized and clear account of gross anatomy of the human body. We believe it allows the student to study gross anatomy in the shortest possible time without the omission of material. It remai ns the student' s prerogative to decide which sections to study and how much detail to include. \"Text of Human Anatomy\" is the book that the authors wished was available to them in their second year of study. We hope it will prove to be i nvaluable in your successes and we will welcome any comments, criticism or suggestions. The Authors, 1994 Acknowledgements As students of anatomy, we acknowledge the various reference works against which the accuracy of this text was checked. We can only claim originality in the presentation and organization of the material. We are grateful to our families for their support and encouragement, which made the writing of this book possible. In addition, we are indebted to Lidi a Upton for her tireless and enthusiastic proof reading of the manuscript as well as Hamish Herd for his lucid illustrations. Hennie Brits would like to express his appreciation and gratitude to his co- author, John Tilley, for the mammoth task of typing and typesetting the manuscript. Lastly, we would like to thank the second year medical class of 1995 who placed their trust in the book. Without their support and enthusiasm, this second year edition would never have seen the light of day. The Authors, 1997 We are beholden to Sue do Vale, Kabir Singh and Lindy Bolon for their help during the endless sessions of typing and typesetting. A great thank you to Beryl Morland and J Walter Thompson for aid in the publishing of this text.

The Editors 3 How to Use This Book For Illustration The small numerals in the subheadings refer to plate numbers in \"The Atlas of Human Anatomy\" by Frank Netter (published by Ciba Geigy). Presentation of Osteology The osteology is presented in such a way that the topography of the bones can be studied independently from the muscle attachments. This section is divided into two columns. In the left column is a description of the bone whilst attachments are discussed in the right column. Bold text in the left column refers to structures which provide attachment to the muscles or ligaments in the right column. - I TEXT OF HUMAN ANATOMY TABLE OF CONTENTS SECTION: ANATOMICAL TERMINOLOGY 4 A THE UPPER LIMB 6 B THORAX 71 c ABDOMEN 115 E PEL VIS AND PERINEUM 157 F BACK 180 G LOWER LIMB 191 H THE NECK 244 THE HEAD 276 J THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM 327 4 ANATOMICAL TERMINOLOGY The Anatomical Position • All structures in the human body are described in relation to the anatomical position • The anatomical position is that position in which the person is erect (or lying supine as if erect) with the head, eyes, palms and feet directed forward. • In addition the upper limbs are by the sides and the lower limbs are together The Anatomical Planes • The following imaginary planes form the basis of anatomical description: a) The median plane • This is a vertical plane connecting the anterior midline with the posterior midline thus dividing the body into identical left and right halves. b) The sagittal planes (or paramedian planes) • These are vertical planes parallel to the median plane. • The sagittal plane passing through the median plane is known as the midsagittal or median sagittal plane. c) The coronal planes • The coronal planes are vertical and perpendicular to the median plane thus dividing the body into anterior and posterior parts (not necessarily halves) d) The horizontal or transverse planes • These planes are perpendicular to both the sagittal and coronal planes and divide the body into cross-sections. Anatomical Terms of Relationship • These terms are arranged in pairs of opposites: a) Anterior (Ventral) is closer to the front. Posterior (Dorsal) is closer to the back. b) Medial is closer to the median plane. Lateral is away from the median plane. c) Superior (Cranial) is closer to the head. Inferior (Caudal) is closer to the feet. d) Proximal is closer to the trunk or origin of the specific structure. Distal is away from the trunk or origin of the specific structure. e) External is towards the exterior. Internal is towards the interior. f) Superficial is closer to the surface. Deep is away from the surface. g) Prone position is with the anterior surface facing down. Supine position is with the anterior surface facing up. h) Central is closer to the centre. Peripheral is away from the centre. Anatomical Terms of Movement • These terms are arranged in pairs of opposites: a) Flexion • Flexion decreases the angle between the body surfaces. • Plantar flexion is the downward flexion of the foot at the ankle joint • Dorsiflexion is the upward flexion of the foot at the ankle joint • Extension increases the angle between the body surfaces. b) Abduction is movement away from the median plane e.g. raising your arm to shoulder level) Adduction is movement towards the median plane e.g. bringing your arm down from shoulder level) c) Supination is the lateral rotation of the forearm so that the palm faces anteriorly. Pronation is the medial rotation of the forearm so that the palm faces posteriorly. 5 d) Inversion is the movement of the sole of the foot towards the median plane. Eversion is the movement of the sole of the foot away from the median plane. e) Medial rotation is the medial movement along the long axis of the structure. Lateral rotation is the lateral movement along the long axis of the structure. f) Circumduction is a combination of flexion and extension with abduction and adduction to produce circular movement. g) Protrusion is the movement of a structure in an anterior position. Retrusion is the movement of a structure in a posterior position.

The Upper Limb 3 THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS 413 A Overview and structure • The brachia! plexus is a network of nerves that lies in the posterior triangle of the neck and the axilla. • The plexus is formed by union of the five ventral rami of C5 to CB and the greater part of the ventral ramus of Tl. • The ventral rami form the roots of the brachia! plexus, which pass through the gap between the anterior and middle scalene muscles with the subclavius artery. • The ventral rami enter the posterior triangle of the neck and unite to form 3 trunks • Each of the trunks divides into anterior and posterior divisions. • The anter ior divisions supply the anterior flexors and adductors • The posterior divisions supply the extensors and abductors of the arm. • Certain of the divisions unite to form cords. • Each cord gives rise to a number of nerves and then terminates by dividing into two terminal nerves. • Almost all branches of the brachia! plexus arise in the ax illa (after it has crossed the 1 st rib). Roots-Trunks- Divisions- Chords Rami (roots) • Ventral rami from C5, 6, 7, 8 and Tl join to form the trunks. Trunks • The ventral rami enter the posterior triangle of the neck and certain of the rami unite: a) C5 and C6 unite to form the superior trunk. b) C7 continues as the middle trunk. c) C8 and Tl unite to form the inferior trunk. Divisions • Each of these trunks then divides into 3 anterior and posterior divisions as the plexus passes posterior to the clavicle. • The divisions unite to frorm chords Cords • All the posterior divisions unite to form the posterior cord. 23 -23- • The anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunks unite to for m the lateral cord. • The anterior division of the inferior cord continues as the medial cord. • The naming of the cords is in relation to the second part of the axillary artery, and thus the lateral, posterior and medial cords lie lateral, posterior and medial to that part of the artery. • Each cord divides into two terminal branches. B Branches • Nerves may arise from any of the components of the plexus i. e. from the rami, the trunks, the divisions or the cords. • On this basis, the plexus may be divided into two parts according to the origin of the branches in relation to the clavicle: a) Supraclavicular branches arising from the rami, trunks and divisions and are approachable by the neck. b) lnfraclavicular branches arising from the cords and are approachable through the axilla. Nerves arising from the rami Dorsal scapular nerve (CS) • This arises from the ventral ramus of C5, and runs deep to levator scapulae, which it supplies. • It then enters the deep surface of the rhomboid muscles, which it also supplies. Long thoracic nerve (C5, 6, 7) • This arises from the ventral rami of C5, 6, 7 and runs through the apex of the axilla to supply serratus anterior. Nerves arising from the trunks Suprascapular nerve (CS, 6) • This arises from the superior trunk and thus has contributions from the ventral rami of C5, 6. • It runs to the suprascapular notch with the suprascapular artery. • The artery then passes over the superior transverse ligament and the nerve passes beneath it. • It supplies the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus muscles as well as the glenohumeral joint. Subclavian nerve (C5, 6) • This arises from the superior trunk and descends posterior to the clavicle and The Upper Limb anterior to brachia! plexus to supply subclavius. Nerves arising from the cords Lateral cord (CS, 6, 7) • This cord has contributions from the anterior divisions of C5, 6, 7 . There is a single branch off the cord, the lateral pectoral nerve (C5, 6, 7), which supplies pectoralis major muscle. It also supplies pectoralis minor by sending a banch to the medial pectoral nerve. The terminal branches of the lateral cord are: a) The lateral root of the median nerve (C5, 6,7). • This combines with the medial root of the medial cord to form the median nerve. • The median nerve suppli es the flexor muscles in the anterior compartment of the arm (except flexor carpi ulnaris and the ulnar half of flexor digitorum profundus) • In the hand it supplies cutaneous innervation to the first 3 1/2 fingers and 5 muscles: i) Lumbricals (1st &2nd ) i i) Opponens pollicis iii) Abductor pollicus brevis. iv) Flexor pollicus brevis b) The musculocutaneous nerve (C5, 6,7). • This supplies the muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm. • • Medial cord (CS, Tl) • This cord has contributions from the anterior divisions of CS, T 1 . The branches off the cord are: a) The medial cutaneous nerve of the arm (CS, Tl) • Is joined by the intercostobrachial nerve from T2, and supplies the skin on the medial side of the arm and superior part of the forearm. b) The medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm (CS, Tl) • This runs between the axillary artery and the axillary vein, and then in the arm between the brachia! artery and the brachia! vein. • It supplies the skin on the medial side of the forearm. c) The medial pectoral nerve (CS, Tl) • Pierces pectoralis minor (and supplies it) to supply pectoralis major. • Although called the medial pectoral nerve (as it arises from the medial cord), it lies lateral to the lateral pectoral nerve. The terminal branches of the cord are: a) The medial root of the median nerve (CS, Tl) which forms part of the median nerve. • • 24 -24- b) The ulnar nerve (CS, Tl) which supplies most of the muscles and the medial cutaneous innervation in the hand, as well as 1 1/2 muscles in the anterior compartment of the forearm (flexor carpi ulnaris and the ulnar half of flexor digitorum profundus). Posterior cord (C5-Tl) • This cord has contributions from the posterior divisions of C5 to Tl . • The branches off the cord are: a) Upper subscapular nerve (C5, 6) • This supplies subscapularis . b) Lower subscapular nerve (C6, 7), • This supplies subscapularis and teres major muscles. c) Thoracodorsal nerve (C6, 7, S) • This supplies the latissimus dorsi muscle. • The terminal branches of the cord are: a) The axillary nerve(C5, 6) • This passes through the quadrangular space to reach the posterior aspect of the arm. • When it emerges from the space it divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. • The anterior branch supplies the deltoid muscle and wraps around the surgical neck of the humerus, accompanied by the posterior circumflex humeral artery. • The posterior branch supplies deltoid and teres minor, and then pierces the deep fascia to become the superior lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm, which supplies the skin over the deltoid. b) The radial nerve • Which supplies the extensor muscles in the posterior compartment of the arm and forearm. This is the largest branch of the brachia! plexus. Clinical • Erb's Paralysis: is a brachia! plexus injury to the upper roots, often an obstetric injury during a difficult delivery when traction is applied to the baby's head when it is in lateral flexion and the shou lder of the opposite side is pulled downwards. • Klumpke's Paralysi: is a brachia! plexus lesion most commonly due to an abduction strain at the time of childbirth causing injury to CS and Tl nerve roots, resulting in a claw hand deformity due to paralysis of the intrinsic muscles of the hand. The Upper Limb 4 THE AXILLA 412 A Boundaries of the Axilla • The axilla is a pyramidal space inferior to the glenohumeral joint and superior to the axillary fascia at the junction of the arm and the thorax. • The shape and size of the axilla varies depending on the position of the arm. It provides a passageway for vessels and nerves to reach the upper limb. • The axil la has an apex, a base and four walls. Apex • The apex of the axilla is formed by the convergence of the clavicle anteriorly, the scapula posteriorly and the first rib medially. Base • The base of the axilla is formed by the skin of the armpit. Walls • The axilla has four walls. • Each wall is formed by a muscle, which is attached to a bone. a) Anterior wall • This is formed by pectoralis major and pectoralis minor and the pectoral and clavipectoral fascia associated with them. • The anterior axillary fold is formed by the lateral edge of pectoralis major. b) Posterior wall • This is formed by the scapula and subscapularis. • The posterior axillary fold is formed by teres major and latissimus dorsi. c) Medial wall • The medial wall is formed by the ribs and the intercostal muscles ( 1-4) and overlying serratus anterior. d) Lateral wall • The lateral wall is formed by the intertubercular groove in the humerus. Contents of the axilla • The axilla contains: a) Axillary blood vessels i.e. axillary artery and its branches and axillary vein and its tributaries. b) Lymphatic vessels. c) Several groups of axillary lymph nodes. d) Cords and branches of the brachia! plexus. 25 -25- B Lymphatics of the Upper Limb 466 • The lymphatics of the upper limb are grouped into a superficial system, superficial to the deep fascia, and a deep system, deep to the deep fascia. Superficial system • Superficial lymphatic vessels arise from the lymphatic plexuses in the digits, palm and dorsum of hand and ascend mostly with the superficial veins i. e. cephalic and basilica veins. • The superficial lymph nodes comprise the cubital nodes, which lie just proximal to the medial epicondyle of the humerus. • The superficial lymph vessels follow two main paths: a) The lymph of the medial half of the posterior surface of the hand and forearm and the medial surface of the arm is drained by lymphatics, which follow the basilic vein. b) The rest of the lymph is drained by lymphatics, which follow the cephalic vein. • The superficial lymph vessels pierce the clavipectoral fascia to drain into the apical axillary lymph nodes. Deep system • The two main groups of deep lymph nodes are the deltopectoral group and the axillary group. • The deep lymphatic vessels of the upper limb accompany the major deep veins and terminate in the humeral group of lymph nodes. • The lymphatics of the shoulder drain mainly into the subscapular group of axillary nodes. • Those of the pectoral region drain mainly into the pectoral and apical axillary nodes laterally, and the parasternal nodes medially. a) Deltopectoral group • This group is located next to the cephalic vein in the deltopectoral triangle. b) Axillary group • This group of nodes is found in the axilla and they are the main lymph nodes of the upper limb. • The group may be sub-divided into the following groups: i) Pectoral group • This group of nodes is located in the medial wall of the axilla. • The nodes lie along the lateral thoracic veins at the inferior border of pectoralis minor. ii) Lateral axillary group • This group of nodes is located in the lateral wall of the axilla. • T he nodes lie medial and posterior to the axillary vei n. iii) Subscapular group The Upper Limb • This group of nodes is located along the posterior axillary fold and the subscapular blood vessels. iv) Central axillary group • This group of nodes is located near the base of the axilla. • The nodes lie along the 2nd part of the axillary artery, deep to pectoralis minor. v) Apical axillary group • This group of nodes is located near the apex of the axilla. • The nodes lie medial to the proximal end of the axillary vein. 26 -26- 5 THE SHOULDER REGION • The shoulder region is comprised of the shoulder joint and some of the muscles that cause movement at the joint. • The shoulder joint has the widest range of movements of all the joints in the body. • However this mobility is achieved at the expense of stability and dislocations of the joint are common, especially in young people. A Muscles of the Shoulder Region • The muscles of the shoulder consist of two main groups: The extrinsic muscles of the back and the scapular muscles. Extrinsic Muscles Of The Back 407 • This group comprises trapezius, latissimus dorsi, levator scapulae and the rhomboid muscles (described in the table below). • These muscles attach the upper limb to the axial skeleton. • They are innervated by nerves, which arise from ventral rami because these muscles developed anterior to the coronal morphological plane and migrated posteriorly. Scapular Muscles 408 • This group comprises the deltoid, teres major, teres minor, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and subscapularis muscles. • They include the so-called rotator cuff or musculotendinous cuff muscles. • These are muscles, which attach to the greater and the lesser tubercles of the humerus: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis. • All the muscles of the rotator cuff, except supraspinatus, are involved in either lateral or medial rotation of the arm: hence, \" rotator muscles\". • The tendons of the muscles fuse with the capsule of the shoulder joint to form a musculotendinous cuff: hence, \"cuff muscles\". • The common function of the cuff is to provide stability to the shoulder joint by helping keep the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity.

The Upper Limb D The Shoulder Joint 406 Classification • This is a synovial joint of the ball and socket type. Articular surfaces • The head of the humerus articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. • Both articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage. • The glenoid cavity is deepened and enlarged by a fibrocartilagenous rim called the glenoid labrum. • The glenoid cavity accepts little more than a 1 /3 of the humeral head, which is held in the cavity by the tonus of the rotator cuff muscles. Articular Capsule • The joint has a loose outer fibrous capsule and an inner synovial membrane. Outer fibrous capsule • It is attached medially to the margin of the glenoid cavity, and laterally to the anatomical neck of the humerus and the transverse humeral ligament. • The medial attachment deviates superiorly to include the supraglenoid tubercle, and the distal attachment deviates medially where it attaches about 1 cm onto the shaft. • The fibrous capsule is thin and loose and thus allows for a wide range of movements. • The inferior part of the capsule is the only part not reinforced by rotator cuff muscles and is the weakest area. • The capsule is strengthened by: a) The rotator cuff or musculotendinous cuff • The capsule is strengthened anteriorly by the tendon of subscapularis, posteriorly by the tendon of infraspinatus, superiorly by the tendon of supraspinatus, and postero-inferiorly by the tendon of teres minor. b) The ligaments of the shoulder. Inner synovial membrane • The inner surface of the fibrous capsule is lined by a synovial membrane. • Numerous bursae exist around the shoulder joint, some communicating with the synovial cavity. • The subacromial bursa lies between the head of the humerus and the coraco- acromial arch. • The subtendinous bursa of the subscapularis lies under the tendon of the subscapularis and is continuous with the synovial cavity of the shoulder joint. 29 -29- Ligaments • The ligaments of the shoulder joint are the coracohumeral ligament, the coraco-acromial ligament, the transverse humeral ligament and the glenohumeral ligaments. a) Coracohumeral ligament • Intrinsic ligament. • This runs from the lateral edge of the coracoid process, deep to the coraco-acromial ligament, to the anterior aspect of the greater tubercle of the humerus. • It strengthens the fibrous capsule superiorly. b) Coraco-acromial ligament • Extrinsic ligament. • This runs from the apex of the acromion and the lateral border of the coracoid process. • This ligament, together with the coracoid and acromion, forms the coraco-acromial arch. • This arch serves a protective function as a secondary socket for the head of the humerus preventing upward dislocation. c) Transverse humeral ligament • This ligament runs between the greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus. • It converts the superior end of the intertubercular groove into a canal, which holds the synovial sheath and tendon of the long head of biceps brachii in place during movements of the glenohumeral joint. d) Gleno-humeral ligaments • There is a superior, middle and inferior glenohumeral ligament. • Intrinsic ligaments. • These ligaments connect the glenoid rim to the anatomical neck of the humerus. • They strengthen the fibrous capsule anterosuperiorly, anteriorly, and anteroinferiorly respectively. Blood Supply • This is by the anterior and posterior humeral circumflex arteries and branches of the suprascapular artery. Innervation • The suprascapular, axillary and lateral pectoral nerves. • These are the nerves innervating the muscles whose tendons fuse with the capsule. Movements • The shoulder joint has more freedom of movement than any other joint in the body. The Upper Limb • Stability is sacrificed at the expense of freedom of movement of the shoulder joint. • Stability is improved by the factors previously di scussed (rotator cuff muscles and ligaments of the shoulder joint).

Clinical • Dislocation of the humerus: at the shoulder joint is a relatively common injury and is in an inferior (no muscle support) or anterior (rotator cuff tear) direction, risking injury to the axillary nerve. • Axillarary nerve paralysis: often occurs after shoulder dislocations or fractures of the humeral neck. The sensory loss is over the lateral upper part of the arm and the motor loss of the deltoid muscle makes it difficult to abduct the arm. 30 -30- The Upper Limb 6 THE ARM 410 A The Fascia of the Arm • The arm is enclosed i n a strong deep fascial sheath called the brachia! sheath. • This sheath prevents ex cessive bulging of the muscles of the arm, and thus increases their mechanical effectiveness. • Two intermuscular septa are formed where the deep fascia connects to the humerus: a) The medial intermuscular septum extends from the medial lip of the bicipital groove to the medial supracondylar ridge. b) The lateral intermuscular septum extends from the lateral lip of the bi cipital groove to the lateral supracondylar ridge. Compartments of the Arm • The intermuscular septa divide the arm into an anterior and a posterior muscular compartment. a) Anterior brachia! compartment • This compartment lies anterior to the humerus and the intermuscular septa. • It contains three muscles: biceps brachii, coracobrachialis and brachialis. • All the muscles of the compartment are innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve. b) Posterior brachia! compartment • This compartment lies posterior to the humerus and intermuscular septa. • It contains one muscle, triceps brachii. • Anconeus is also usually discussed in this compartment as it is partially blended with triceps and can be considered as part of the medial head of triceps. • These muscles are innervated by the radial nerve. B The Muscles of the Arm • The compartments of the arm contain six muscles. The relations of these muscles are given below and the attachments and innervation of the muscles are summarised in the table. a) Biceps Brachii • Proximally it is overlapped by pectoralis major and the deltoid. • Posterior to the muscle in this region is the coracobrachialis muscle. • The tendon of the long head of the muscle passes in the bicipital groove and runs over the shoulder joint in a synovial sheath. 31 -31- • The tendon of the short head of the muscle passes anterior to the shoulder joint. • Distally, brachialis and the musculocutaneous nerve lie posterior to it. b) Coracobrachialis • It is found in the proximal 1 /3 of the arm. • Anteri or to it are biceps brachii and pectoralis major. • Posterior to i t are the tendons of subscapularis, lati ssimus dorsi and teres major. c) Brachialis • It is found in the distal 2/3 of the arm. • Anterior to it is biceps brachii and the musculocutaneous nerve. • Posterior to it is the humerus. • Lateral to it is extensor carpi radi alis longus and brachioradialis. d) Triceps Brachii. • The long head of triceps lies medial to the lateral head. • The medial head of triceps lies deep to the long and lateral heads. • Distally the fibres of all the heads merge into one common tendon. • The long head of triceps passes between teres major (below) and teres minor (above). • This creates two spaces: i) A quadrangular space • The superior border of the space is teres major; the inferior border, teres minor; the medial border, the long head of triceps; and the lateral border, the humerus. • The axillary nerve and posterior circumflex humeral artery (branch of the 3rd part of the axillary artery) pass through this space. ii) A triangular space • The superior border of the space is teres major, the inferior border teres minor and the lateral wall the long head of triceps. • The circumflex scapular artery (branch of the subscapular artery from the 3rd part of the axillary artery) passes through the space.

The Upper Limb THE ELBOW REGION • The elbow region consists of the elbow joint, the proximal radio- ulnar joint and the cubital fossa. The proximal radio-ulnar joint is discussed with the distal radio- ulnar joi nt in another chapter. C The Elbow Joint 421 Classification • The elbow joint is a synovial joint of the hinge type. Articular surfaces • Medially the trochlea of the humerus articulates with the trochlear notch of the ulna. • Laterally the capitulum of the humerus articulates with the concave superior aspect of the surface of the head of the radius. • Thus, there are humeroulnar and humeroradial articulations. • Articular surfaces are covered in hyaline cartilage and are most fully congruent when the forearm is in a position midway between pronation and supination and flexed to a right angle. Capsule • The capsule consists of a fibrous capsule lined by a synovial membrane. a) Fibrous capsule • Proximally the fibrous capsule is attached: i) Anteriorly to the proximal margins of the radial and coronoid fossae completely enclosing them. ii) Posteriorly so that most of the olecranon fossa is enclosed by the capsule. • Distally the fibrous capsule is attached: i) Anteriorly to the anterior edge of the coronoid process and the anular ligament. ii) Posteriorly to the olecranon and to the anular ligament. • The capsule is weak anteriorly and posterirly but is strengthened on each side by collateral ligaments. b) Synovial membrane • The synovial membrane is reflected onto the humerus, lining the coronoid and radial fossae anteriorly and the olecranon fossa posteriorly. • Fat pads occupy the fossae between the fibrous and synovial sheaths 33 -33- of the capsule. • It is continuous with the synovial membrane of the proximal radioulnar joint inferiorly. Ligaments • The ligaments of the elbow joint are the ulnar collateral l i gament, the radial collateral ligament and the anular ligament. a) Ulnar collateral ligament • This consists of three bands, arranged in a triangul ar shape: i) The posterior band passes between the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the olecranon process of the ulna. This band is the weakest. ii) The anterior band passes between the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the coronoid process of the ulna. This band is the strongest. iii) The transverse band passes between the olecranon process and coronoid process of the humerus. b) Radial collateral ligament • It is a triangul ar structure on the lateral aspect of the elbow joint. • The apex is attached to the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and the base to the anular ligament. c) Anular ligament • This encircles the circumference of the head and the neck of the radius and holds it in the radial notch of the ulna. It tus forms the proximal radioulnar joint, which permits pronaton and supination of the forearm. • It is attached to the anterior and posterior margins of the radial notch on the ulna. Bursae • There are numerous bursae related to the elbow joint. • Only the two olecranon bursae are clinically important: a) The subcutaneous olecranon bursa lies in the overlying subcutaneous connective tissue related to the olecranon process of the ulna. b) The subtendinous olecranon bursa lies between the tendon of triceps and the olecranon process of the ulna. c) lntratendinous olecranon bursa, whi ch is sometimes present in the tendon of triceps brachii. Movements • The long axis of the fully extended ulna makes an angle of about 170 degrees The Upper Limb . with the lone axis of the humerus, which is the corrvino ang e. Movement of Degrees of Muscles Producing Movement the Forearm Movement Flexion 150 Chiefly: Brachialis, Biceps Brachii and Brachioradialis. Assisted by: Pronator Teres when flexion is resisted. Extension Chiefly: Triceps Brachii., especially its medial head. Assisted by: Anconeus. Vasculature • This is derived from the arterial anastomoses around the elbow. Innervation • This is by the ulnar, median, radial, and musculocutaneous nerves. 34 -34- D The Cubital Fossa • The cubital fossa is the hollow tri angular area on the anterior aspect of the elbow. Boundaries • The roof is formed by the bicipital aponeurosis, subcutaneous tissue and skin. • The floor is formed by Supinator and Brachialis. • Proximally it is bound by an imaginary line between the two medial and lateral humeral epicondyles. • Medially it is bound by pronator teres. • Laterally it is bound by brachioradialis. Superficial Relations • The superficial relations, from medial to lateral, are: a) The basilic vein. b) The anterior branch of the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm. c) The median cubital vein. d) The lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm. e) The cephali c vein. Contents • The contents of the fossa, from medial to lateral, are: a) The median nerve. b) The brachia! artery and vein. c) The tendon of biceps brachii. d) The radial recurrent artery. e) The radial nerve. The Upper Limb 7 THE FOREARM A Overview The Fascia of the Forearm • The forearm is enclosed in a deep fascia! sheath, which is attached to the posterior margin of the ulna. • The flexor and extensor retinacula are speci al modifications of the deep fascia of the forearm. Compartments of the Forearm • The medial epicondyle and epicondylar ridge provide attachment for the forearm flexors. • The lateral epicondyle and epicondylar ridge provide attachment for the forearm extensors. • These muscles spiral across the forearm so that the compartments come to lie anterior and posterior from a medial and lateral position, respectively. B The Flexor Retinaculum 444 and 448 • The flexor retinaculum is a thickening of the deep fascia of the forearm between the hypothenar and the thenar eminences. • It prevents bow-stringing of the long tendons of the muscles in the flexor- pronator compartment of the arm as they pass to the hand. Attachments • On the medial side the retinaculum is attached to the pisiform bone proximally and the hook of the hamate bone distally. • On the lateral side the retinaculum is attached to the tubercle of the scaphoid bone proximally and the trapezium bone distally. • The lateral attachment of the retinaculum is in a bilaminar manner. • The superficial layer attaches to the tubercle of the trapezoid, and the deep layer attaches to the medial edge of the palmar surface of the trapezoid. • The tendon of flexor carpi radialis passes between these two membranes. • The palmar branch of the ulnar nerve, the ulnar artery and the ulnar nerve are covered by the superficial part of the retinaculum (a band of deep fascia which attaches to the pisiform bone). Structures passing superficial to the retinaculum • The structures which pass superficial to the retinaculum are, from medial to lateral: a) The ulnar nerve 35 -35- b) The ulnar artery c) The palmar branch of the ulnar nerve. d) The tendon of palmaris longus. e) The pal mar branch of the median nerve. f) The superficial palmar branch of the radial artery. Structures passing deep to the retinaculum • The structures which pass deep to the retinaculum are: a) The median nerve. b) The four tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis. c) The four tendons of flexor digitorum profundus. d) The tendon of flexor pollicis longus. • The tendons of the flexor muscles are each surrounded by a synovial membrane as they pass deep to the flexor retinaculum. C The Carpal Tunnel • This is a passageway deep to the flexor retinaculum for the flexor tendons and the median nerve to pass into the hand. • It lies beneath the flexor retinaculum and between the tubercles of the scaphoi d and trapezium bones (laterally) and the pisiform and hook of hamate (medially). • Its contents are the structures passing beneath the flexor retinaculum (described above). Clinical • Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - results from any lesion that significantly reduces the size of the carpal tunnel, such as wrist laceration or infection. • Here, the median nerve may be injured and patients suffer from loss of sensation in their lateral 3 1 /2 digits and dysfunstion of their thenar muscles and 1st and 2nd lumbricals. • See median nerve injury. The Upper Limb D The Extensor Retinaculum 427 • The e xtensor retinaculum i s a thickening of the deep fascia on the posterior aspect of the wrist. • It prevents bow stringing of the l ong tendons of the muscles in the ex tensor- s upi nator compartment of the arm as they pass to the hand. Attachments • On the lateral side the retinacul um is attached to the distal part of the anteri or margin of the radius. • It then passes distally and medially to attach on the medi al si de to t he pis iform and triquetral bones. Structures passing superficial to the retinaculum • The structures which pass s uperfici al to the retinaculum, from medial to lateral are: a) The dorsal branch of t h e ulnar nerve. b) The basilic vein. c) The pos terior cutaneous nerve of the forearm (a bran ch of the radial nerve). d) The cephalic vein. e) The super ficial branch of the radial nerve. Structures passing deep to the retinaculum • The retinaculum gives off fi v e septa, which pass to the posterior surfaces of the radius and the ulna. • These septa divide the space under the retinaculum into si x compartments, thus maintaining the tendons in their relative positi ons. • The positions of the tendons, from medial to lateral, are: a) The tendon of ex tensor carpi ulnaris. b) The tendon of ex tensor digiti minimi. c) The tendons of extensor digitorum and extensor indicis. d) The tendon of extensor pollici s longus. e) The tendons of extensor carpi radialis brevis and extensor carpi radialis longus. f) The tendons of abductor pollicis l ongus and extensor pollicis brevis. • A parietal synovial sheath lines the canal t hrough which the tendons pass and a vi sceral synovial sheath lines the tendons, thus facilitating movement of tendons in the canal. 36 - 36- The Upper Limb E Muscles of the Forearm • There are nineteen muscles in the forearm. • The majority of these muscles are concerned with movements of the wrist and the fingers. They are therefore called the ex trinsic muscles of the hand. • To fascili tate memory and understanding the muscles of the forearm can be divided into a flex or-pronator group and an extensor- supinator group. Flexor-Pronator Group of Forearm Muscles 429 - 431 • The muscles in this group may be divided anatomically and functionally in the f II o owmo way: Muscles Anatomical Division 1 st layer Pronator Teres, Flexor Carpi Radialis, Palmaris Longus, Flexor Carpi Ulnaris. 2nd layer Flexor Digitorum Superficialis. The 1 s t and 2nd layer muscles all attach (at least in part) by a common flexor tendon from the medial epicondyle of the humerus. 3rd layer Flexor Pollicis Longus, Flexor Digitorum Profundus. 4th layer Pronator Quadratus.

Flexion of Flexor Digitorum Profundus, Flexor Pollicis Longus, Flexor Digitorum digits. Superficialis. • The superficial muscles of the flexor-pronator group arise via a common flexor tendon from the medial epicondyle of the humerus. • The deep flexor muscles originate from the anterior aspect of the bodies of the ulna and radius. • All the muscles of this group, except flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus, are innervated by the median nerve. • Functionally, Brachioradialis musce is a flexor of the forearm, but located in the posterior compartment of the forearm. It is therefore supplied by the radial nerve - a major exception to the rule that the radial nerve only supplies extensor muscles and that all flexor muscles lie in the anterior compartment of the forearm. 37 - 37- Extensor- Supinator Group of Forearm Muscles • Like the flexor-pronator group of forearm muscles, this group may be divided t .

The deep extensor muscles originate from the posterior aspect of the bodies of the ulna and radius. All the muscles of this group are innervated by the radial nerve or its branches . The brachioradialis muscle, although it is a flexor of the forearm, is usually included in this group as the radial nerve also innervates it. • • • The Upper Limb 38 -38- Muscle Proximal Attachment Distal Attachment Actions Innervation Superficial Group Pronator Teres This is by two h eads: The midd le part of t he lateral surface a) Helps pron ator quadratus Median nerve C6 & -This i s a rounded muscle a) The humeral head is attached j ust of the radi us. pronate the forear m.

The Upper Limb F The Radio-Ulnar Joints • There is a proximal and a distal radio-ulnar joint. It is these joints which allow pronation and supination of the forearm. The Proximal Radio-Ulnar Joint 422 Classification • The proximal radio-ulnar joint is a synovial joint of the pivot type. Articular Surfaces • The head of the radius articulates wi th the radial notch of the ulna. • The radial head is held in position by the anular ligament. Capsule • The capsule is replaced by the anular ligament. • It is a strong, incomplete ring attached to the anterior and posterior edges of the radial notch and narrow inferiorly. • It is lined by a synovial membrane that is continuous with that of the elbow joint. Ligaments • All the ligaments connecting the radius and ulna are involved. • They are: a) The anular ligament. b) The quadrateligaments;quadrate ligament which connects the radial notch of the ulna to the neck of the radius. c) The oblique cordCord;oblique which passes from the ulnar tuberosity distally to attach distal to the radial tuberosity. d) The interosseous membrane of the forearm which spans between the interosseous borders of the radius and the ulna. e) The articular disc and capsule of the distal radio-ulnar joint. Movements • Refer to distal radio-ulnar joint. Vasculature • The arterial supply is by the anterior and posterior arteries. Innervation • Innervation is by the musculocutaneous, median and radial nerves. 40 -40- The Distal Radio-Ulnar Joint Classification 438 • The distal radi o-ulnar joint is a synovial joi nt of the pivot type. Articular surfaces • The ulnar notch of the radius articulates with the circumference of the ulnar head. Capsule • The capsule consists of an outer fibrous capsule and an inner synovial membrane. a) Outer fibrous capsule • Encloses the distal radio-ulnar joint but is deficient superiorly. b) Inner synovial membrane • This membrane lines the inner surface of the fibrous capsule. • It forms the sacciform recess proximally by evaginating the capsule. • This accommodates the twisting of the capsule that occurs when the distal end of the radius travels around the relatively fixed distal end of the ulna during pronation of theforearm. Ligaments • The ligaments of the joint are: a) The articular disc • The bones are connected by a fibrocartilaginous triangular articular disc. • The base of the disc is attached to the ulnar notch of the radius, and the apex is attached to the pit between the styloid process and the head of the ulna. • This separates the cavity of the distal radio-ulnar joint from the cavity of the wrist joint. b) The ligaments connecting the ulna and the radius. • These are relatively weak transverse bands extending from the radius to ulna across the anterior and posterior surfaces of the joint. They strengthen the fibrous capsule. Vasculature • The arterial supply is by the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries (branches of the common interosseous branch of the ulnar artery). Innervation • Innervation is by the anterior interossesous nerve (branch of the median nerve) and the posterior interosseous nerve (branch of the radial nerve). The Upper Limb Actions • The proximal and distal radio-ulnar joints act together and their movements are thus discussed together. • The principle movements are pronation and supination. Movement of Forearm Muscles producing Movement Pro nation Pri marily by pronator quadratus, secondarily by pronator teres. Assisted by flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus and brachioradialis. Supination Supinator and Biceps brachii. Assisted by extensor pollicis longus and brevis and extensor carpi radilis lonqus. 41 -41- G The Wrist Joint 437 and 438 Classification • It is a synovial joint of the condyloid type. • The position of the joint is indicated approximately by a line joining the styloid processes of the radius and ulna. Articular surfaces • The proximal concave surface is formed by the distal end of the radius laterally and the articular disc of the distal radio-ulnar joint medially. • The distal convex surface is formed, from medial to lateral, by the proximal articular surfaces of the triquetral, lunate and scaphoid bones. Articular Capsule • The fibrous capsule is attached to the margins of the respective articular surfaces. • It is strengthened by numerous ligaments. • It is lined on its inner surface by a synovial membrane that is separate from the synovial membrane of the distal radio-ulnar joint and the intercarpal joint. Ligaments • The ligaments which support the fibrous capsule are: a) The palmar radiocarpal ligaments, • This connects the anterior aspects of the proximal and distal articular aspects. • It is strong and directed so that the hand follows the radius during supination of the forearm. b) The pal mar ulnocarpal ligament • This extends from the ulnar styloid process and articular disc to the triquetral and lunate bones. c) The dorsal radiocarpal ligament • This ligament connects the posterior aspects of the proximal and distal articular surfaces. • These t ake the same direction so that the hand follows the radius during pronation of the forearm. d) The medial (ulnar) collateral ligament • It extends from the ulnar styloid process proximally via two slips to the triquetral and pisiform bones. e) The lateral (radial) collateral ligament • This extends from the radial styloid process proximally to the scaphoid bone distally. The Upper Limb Movements • The movements of the wrist joint are discussed with the movements of the mid carpal joint (See Joints of the Hand). Vasculature • Branches of dorsal and palmar carpal arches. Innervation • Branches of the anterior interosseous nerve (br anch of the median nerve) and branches of the posterior interosseous nerve (branch of the radial nerve). • Dorsal and deep branches of the ulnar nerve. Clinical • Calles' fracture: describes the fracture of the lower end of the radius with posterior displacement. It is commonly due to a fall onto an outstretched hand. Complications include: median nerve irritation, rupture of extensor pollicis longus tendon and subluxation of the distal radio-ulnar joint. • Scaphoid fracture: often occurs at the waist of the scaphoid and initially may be difficult to diagnose. There is acute tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox. Due to the proximal segment's loss of blood supply, avascular necrosis is a known complication of this fracture and osteoarthritis may be severe if not treated. 42 -42- 8 THE HAND • The hand is the most important part of the upper limb. • It has a very complex structure which allows it Qerform p recision movements. Some of this movement such as the ability to grasp structures between the thumb and little finger (opposition) can be perfomed by no other animal. • On the palmar aspect of the hand there are two masses of muscle. • The one overlies the base of the thumb and is called the thenar eminence and the other overlies the base of the little finger and medial border of the palm and is called the hy p othenar eminence. A Fascia of the Hand • The deep fascia overlying the palm is the distal continuation of the deep fascia of the forearm. • It is thin over the thenar and hypothenar eminences but thickened in the palm to form the Qalmar ap oneurosis. • The Q almaris brevis muscle is located subcutaneously, su p erficial to the h yp othenar eminence. • Because of the complex structure of the fascia of the hand a number of compartments and spaces are created. • The fascia also has a number of modifications such as the fibrous flexor sheaths and extensor expansions, which allow optimum function of the long tendons. Palmer aponeurosis 44 2 • The palmar aponeurosis is a triangular fibrous layer of deep fascia that overlies the tendons in the palm. - -- • Attachments of the pal mar aponeurosis: a) Proximal • It is attached to the tendon of palmaris longus tendon and flexor retinaculum and the thenar and hypothenar fasciae. b) Distal • It divides at the base of the medial four digits into four bands which attach to the base of the proximal phalanx and fuses with the fibrous flexor sheath. • A fifth digit may also be given to the thumb. c) Lateral • The lateral edge is attached in a bilaminar fashion to the first and third metacarpals. d) Medial • The medial edge is attached to the fifth metacarpal. • The palmar aponeurosis divides the palmar aspect of the hand into superficial compartments and deeper potential spaces. The Upper Limb Fascial compartments 445 • There are four fasci al compartments: the thenar, hypothenar central and adductor compartments. a) Thenar compartment • It is located laterally and superficially to the lateral attachment of the palmar aponeurosis. • It contains the thenar muscles. b) Hypothenar Compartment • It is located medially and superfici ally to the medial attachment of the palmer aponeurosis. • It contains the hypothenar muscles. c) Central or intermediate compartment • It is located between the thenar and hypothenar compartments. • It contains: i) The long flexor tendons and synovial sheaths of the extrinsic muscles of the hand. ii) Lumbricals. iii) The superficial palmar arch. iv) Branches of the median and ulnar nerves. d) Adductor Compartment • This is the deepest muscular plane of the palm. • It contains the adductor pollicis muscle. Potential spaces of the hand 435 • Between the flexor tendons and the fascia covering the deep muscles of the palm are three important potential spaces of the hand: the midpalmar space, the thenar space and the retro-adductor space. a) Midpalmar space • This is bounded: i) Laterally by the septum passing from the lateral edge of the palmar aponeurosis to the third metacarpal. ii) Medially by the attachment of the palmar aponeurosis to the fifth metacarpal. iii) Proximally by the fusion of the parietal layer of the common flexor synovial sheaths to the floor of the carpal tunnel. iv) Superiorly by the extrinsic flexor tendons of the third, fourth and fifth digits. • The medial three lumbricals extend from this space onto the lateral side of each of the medial three digits. • This causes an extension of the space into the three medial web spaces thus forming the lumbrical canals. 43 -43- b) Thenar space • This is bounded: i) Laterally by the septum passing from the lateral edge of the palmar aponeurosis to the first metacarpal. ii) Medially by the septum passing from the lateral side of the palmar aponeurosis to the thi rd metacarpal. iii) Superiorly by the flexor tendon of the second digit. iv) Pro x imally by the fusion of the pari etal layer of the common flexor sheaths to the floor of the carpal tunnel. • The most lateral lumbrical extends from this space onto the lateral side of the second digit. • This causes an extension of the space into the first web space thus forming a lumbrical canal. c) Retro-adductor space • It communicates with the thenar space around the distal edge of the adductor pollicis muscle. • The retro- adductor space lies between the adductor pollicis muscle superficially and the first dorsal interosseous muscle. Clinical • These potential spaces are important because they mal:'. become infected. • The fascia! spaces determine the extent and direction of spread of the pus formed by these infections. • An untreated infection may spread proximally through the carpal tunnel into the forearm and anterior to the pronator quadratus and its fascia. Fibrous Digital Sheaths 446 • On each digit, the deep fascia on the anterior, the medial and the lateral surfaces is thickened to form an elongated fibrous sheath for the superficial and deep flexor tendons and the tendon of flexor pollicis longus. • The sheathes are composed of 5 anular and 4 cruciform (cross-shaped) parts. • The edges of the sheaths are attached to the medial and lateral margins of the proximal and middle phalanges and the base of the distal phalanx. • In the thumb this attachment is only to the proximal and distal phalanx. • Over the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, the edges of the sheaths are attached to the margins of the joints by palmar ligaments. • These sheaths are thinner over the joints to allow free movement. • Between the palmar surface of the phalanges and the fibrous flexor sheath osseofibrous canals are formed. • Each of the canals is lined with a parietal layer of the synovial sheath and each of the enclosed tendons is surrounded by a visceral layer of the synovial sheath, thus facilitating movement of the tendons. • These are the so-called digital synovial sheaths. The Upper Limb • Vincula attach the superficial and deep flexor tendons to the middle and distal phalanges respectively. • The tendons obtain their blood supply from the blood vessels in the vincula. The Extensor Expansions Structure • On the posterior aspect of the proximal phalanx of each of the four medial digits, the extensor tendon broadens out into an extensor ex pansion which replaces or fuses with the deep fascia. • The edges of the expansion are attached anteriorly to the margins of the phalanges and the palmar ligaments. • At the head of the proximal phalanx, the expansion divides into three slips: a) A central slip which is attached to the base of the middle phalanx. b) Two collateral slips which join to the base of the distal phalanx. • The function of the expansion is to ex tend the fingers mainly at the metacarpophalangeal joints. Attachments to the extensor expansion • In the middle three digits, the expansion receives a slip from the tendon of the interosseous muscle on each side, as well as a slip from the lumbrical muscle on the lateral side. The slips from the interosseous and lumbrical muscles are called the \"wing tendons\". a) In the first digit: • On the medial side it does not receive a slip from the 1st palmar interosseous. • On the lateral side a slip from abductor pollicis brevis replaces the \"wing tendons\". b) In the fifth digit: • On the medial side a slip from abductor digiti minimi replaces the interosseous tendon. • On the lateral side a \"wing tendon\" is received from the palmar interosseous as well as the lumbrical. • Synovial Tendon Sheaths • The extrinsic muscles of the hand result in movement of the digits via long tendons. • Synovial sheaths and parateno ns are the two structures, which ensure that these tendons are able to glide smoothly. • Synovial sheaths are fluid filled sacs which surreound the tendons where they glide around a bend. • A paratenon is loose connective tissue, which surround the tendon in the regions where they move in a stright line. 44 -44- • Only flexor tendons have synovial sheaths, extensor tendons are completely devoid of them. Parts of the flexor tendons of the extrinsic muscles of the hand are enveloped by a endothelial-lined membrane, which moves inside a second endothelial- lined membrane. The two layers are joined at their extremities thus forming a sac, closed at both ends. The flexor tendons are lined by synovial sheaths in only two regions: a) The tendons are sur rounded by carpal synovial sheaths as they pass under the flexor retinaculum in the carpal tunnel. b) The tendons are surrounded by digital synovial sheaths as they pass through the osseofibrous tunnels of the digits. The synovial sheaths of some of the tendons are fused to form a common sheath or bursa. The two important bursae are the ulnar bursa and the radial bursa. • • • • • a) Ulnar bursa • The carpal synovial sheaths of flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus are fused to form the common synovial sheath of flexors. • This structure is continuous with the 5th digital synovial sheath to form the ulnar bursa. • The 4th, 3rd and 2nd digital sheaths are independant of each other and of the ulna bursa. b) Radial bursa • The carpal and digital synovial sheathes of flexor pollicis longus are fused to form the radial bursa. • The radial bursa may communicate with the ulnar bursa deep to the flexor retinaculum. The Upper Limb B Muscles of the Hand • The muscles of the hand can be divided into an extrinsic and an intrinsic group. Extrinsic muscles of the hand • These are the long tendons of the muscles of the forearm. Intrinsic muscles of the hand • These are located on the palmar aspect of the hand. • They are divided into: a) The thenar muscles, on the lateral palmar aspect, related to the thumb. • They are in the thenar compartment and form the thenar em ~e. b) The.J:J:ip othenar muscles, on the medial palmar aspect, related to the 5th digit. liH'e. ~n9u-. • They are found in the hypothenar compartment. c) Adductor pollicis muscle. This is found in the adductor compartment. d) The lumbrical muscles (four in number) are found in the central compartment. e ~ e) The interosseous muscles (seven in number) are found between the metacarpals. • The thenar muscles and the lateral two lumbricals are innervated by the recurrent or muscular branch of the median nerve. • The hypothenar and remaining muscles are innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. 45 -45- The Upper Limb 46 -46- Muscles Of the Hand Muscle Origin Insertion Action Innervation Thenar Muscles Abductor Pollicis a) The lateral edge of flexor retinaculum.

The Upper Limb NERVES OF THE UPPER LIMB A The Musculocutaneous Nerve 447 Origin • The musculocutaneous nerve (C5, 6, 7) is one of the terminal branches of the lateral cord of the brachia! plexus. • It arises at the inferior border of the pectoralis minor, just inferomedial to the coracoid process. Course in the arm • It supplies the coracobrachialis, and then pierces it from below to exit the axilla. • The nerve then crosses the arm obliquely between the biceps and brachialis muscles. • It supplies these muscles and thus supplies all the muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm. • The branch to the brachialis also supplies the elbow joint. • At the lateral border of the biceps brachii tendon it becomes the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm. • It passes deep to the cephalic vein and splits into anterior and posterior branches which supply the skin on the lateral side of the forearm as far distal as the thumb. B The Median Nerve 448 Origin • The median nerve (C[5],6,7, 8,Tl) is formed at the inferior border of pectoralis minor by the union of the lateral root of the median nerve (from the lateral cord of the brachia! plexus) and the medial root of the median nerve (from the medial cord of the brachia! plexus). The median nerve in the arm 408 Course • The median nerve runs sequentially on the lateral side of the Axillary and brachia! arteries until it reaches the middle of the arm, where the ulnar nerve leaves the medial side of the brachia! artery. • Here it crosses to the medial side of the artery and comes to lie on brachialis. • This enters the forearm and lies medial to the brachia! artery in the cubital fossa. Branches • The only branch that arises in the arm is a muscular branch to pronator Teres. 49 -49- The median nerve in the forearm 421-2 Course • It runs on the brachialis muscle, between the two heads of the pronator Teres muscle giving branches to them. • It then descends deep to flex or digitorum superficialis, lying on flexor digitorum profundus. • Near the wrist the nerve becomes superficial by passing around the radial border of flexor digitorum superficialis. • It thus lies between the tendons of flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus. • It passes deep to the flexor reti naculum lying superficial to the flexor tendons in the carpal tunnel. Branches • The branches that arise in the forearm are articular and muscular branches, the anterior interosseous nerve, the palmar cutaneous nerve and a communicating branch. Articular & muscular branches 422 • The median nerve gives r ise to articular branches to the elbow joint. • It gives muscular branches to all the muscles of the superficial and intermediate muscle groups of the forearm excluding flexor carpi ulnari s. • Anterior interosseous nerve • It arises from the median nerve in the distal part of the cubital fossa, between the two heads of pronator Teres. • It runs distally on the interosseous membrane accompanied by the anterior interosseous branch of the ulnar artery. • It runs between flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus towards the pronator quadratus muscle. • It thus supplies all the deep group muscles of the forearm, but only the lateral half of flexor digitorum profundus (the ulnar nerve supplies the medial half) . • Terminally, it passes deep to the pronator quadratus and ends by sending articular branches to the wrist. Palmar cutaneous branch/ Superficial branch of the Median nerve 432-3 • This starts just proximal to the flexor retinaculum. • It becomes cutaneous between the tendons of palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis. • It passes superficial to the flexor retinaculum to supply the skin of the lateral part of the palm (1st, 2nd, 3rd clefts and lateral side of the thumb). • A communicating branch may arise to join the ulnar nerve. The Upper Limb The median nerve in the hand 439 Course • As the nerve passes out of the carpal tunnel it enlarges and flattens before dividing into its terminal branches. • These enlargements are not ganglia, but thickened perineural connective tissue, that arises due to mechanical friction. Branches • The branches of the nerve in the hand are: a) The recurrent (muscular) Branch 448 • This is one of the terminal branches of the medi an nerve and arises on its lateral side. • It supplies the three muscles of the thenar eminence. b) Three common palmer digital nerves • Located posterior to the superficial palmar arch and its branches. • The most lateral common palmar digital nerve divides into three proper palmar digital branches, supplying respectively the medial and the lateral side of the thumb, and the lateral side of the 2nd digit. • The 2nd and 3rd common digital nerves supply the adjacent sides of the 2nd and 3rd cleft. 50 -50- C The Ulnar Nerve 408 Origin • The ulnar nerve (C[7],8, Tl) is one of the terminal branches of the medial cord of the brachia! plexus, originating at the lower border of pectoralis minor. The Ulnar nerve in the arm Course • The ulnar nerve runs sequentially on the medial side of the Axillary artery and the brachia! artery in the arm. • In the middle of the arm it pierces the medial intermuscular septum, accompanied by the superior ulnar collateral artery, and then descends into the posterior compartment of the arm. • In the posterior compartment of the arm it lies anterior to the medial head of triceps. • It runs in a groove on the posterior aspect of the medial epicondyle of the humerus and enters the forearm by passing between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. Branches • There are no branches in the arm. The Ulnar nerve in the forearm 422 Course • It descends deep to flexor carpi ulnaris lying on flexor digitorum profundus. • The ulnar artery joins it on the lateral side near the middle of the forearm. • In the distal part of the forearm the ulnar nerve lies lateral to flexor carpi ulnaris. • Near the distal wrist crease the nerve and artery pierce the deep fascia and pass deep to the superficial part of the flexor retinaculum. • On the retinaculum the nerve ends by dividing into a superficial and a deep branch. Branches a) Articular branches to the elbow joint. b) Muscular branches to flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus. c) Palmar cutaneous branch • This arises near the middle of the forearm and pierces the deep fascia in its distal third. • It passes superficial to flexor retinaculum to supply the skin on the medial side of the palm. d) Dorsal cutaneous nerves • This arises in the distal part of the forearm, just proximal to the wrist, and winds around the medial side of the forearm passing deep to flexor The Upper Limb carpi ulnaris. • On the dorsum of the hand it divides into two or three dorsal digital nerves. • It respectively supplies the medial side of the 5th digit, the adjacent sides of the 4th cleft, and sometimes the adjacent sides of the 3rd digital cleft. The Ulnar nerve in the hand 439,449 Course • Only the course of the deep branch of the ulnar nerve in the hand will be discussed. • The deep branch of the ulnar nerve, accompanied by the deep branch of the ulnar artery, passes deeply between abductor digiti minimi and flexor digiti minimi. • It then pierces opponens digiti minimi and runs laterally, posterior to the flexor tendons, lying on the prox imal part of the deep palmar arch. Branches • The su perficial branch supplies muscular branches to palmaris brevis and the skin on the medial side of the palm before terminating as: a) A proper palmar digital nerve to the medial side of the 5th digit. b) A common palmar digital nerve which sends a twig to the median nerve before dividing into two proper palmar digital nerves to either side of the 4th cleft. • The deep branch supplies muscular branches to the three muscles of the hypothenar eminence, all the interossei, the adductor pollicis and the two medial lumbricals. 51 -51- D The Radial Nerve Origin • The radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, [Tl ]) is one of the terminal branches of the posterior cord of the brachia! plexus, originating at the lower border of pectoralis minor. The radial nerve in the arm 407 Course • The radial nerve descends posteri or to the third part of the Axillary artery, and anterior to the three muscles of the posterior Axillary wall (latissimus dorsi, Teres major and subscapularis). It lies posterior to the proximal part of the brachia! artery, anterior to the long head of triceps and medial to the humerus. It then passes i nferolaterally, with the deep brachia! vessels, to form a neurovascular bundle around the body of the humerus in the spiral radial groove. It thus lies anterior to the long and lateral heads of triceps, but poster ior to the medial head of triceps. When it reaches the lateral border of the humerus, it pi erces the lateral i ntermuscular septum to enter the anterior compartment of the arm : at the same level on the medial side, the ulnar nerve pierces the intermuscular septum to enter the posterior compartment. It descends between the brachialis and brachioradialis to the anterior aspect of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus where i ts branches enter the forearm. • • • • • Branches • In the arm the radial nerve gives rise to cutaneous and muscular branches. Cutaneous branches a) The posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm • This nerve originates in the ax illa at the inferior border of subscapularis. • It pierces the deep fascia high up on the medial side of the arm to supply the skin on the posterior aspects of the arm. b) The posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm • This nerve originates under cover of the lateral head of triceps and pierces the deep fascia just distal to the deltoid tubercle. • It supplies the skin of the posterior aspect of the distal part of the arm and the whole forearm up to the wrist. \\ c) The lower lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm. • This supplies the skin on the lower lateral aspect of the forearm. The Upper Limb Muscular branches a) The branch to the anconeus descends vertically on the medial head of triceps to supply anconeus. b) The branch to the medial head of triceps • This branch descends parallel to the nerve to anconeus and supplies the medial head of triceps. • As it lies close to the ulnar nerve it is often called the ulnar collateral nerve. c) Muscular branches to the brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus (a sensory branch to brachialis is also present). • The nerve also gives rise to articular br anches to the elbow joint. The radial nerve in the forearm 421,451 • The radial nerve descends in the arm between brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus laterally, and brachialis medially. • It descends anterior to the lateral epicondyle of the humerus to enter the forearm where it divides into superficial and deep branches. • The superficial branch is purely sensory and the deep branch purely motor. a) Superficial branch • It descends on supinator under cover of brachioradialis. • In the middle of the forearm it accompanies the radial artery for a short distance. • It then leaves the artery by passing posterolaterally deep to the tendon of brachioradialis to enter the posterior compartment of the forearm, crossing, from proximal to distal, extensor carpi radialis longus, abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis. • Near the posterior aspect of the wrist it pierces the deep fascia and divides into dorsal digital nerves which lie deep to the superficial veins on the dorsum of the hand. • These nerves pass to each side of the thumb, the lateral side of the index finger and to either side of the 2nd and 3rd interdigital clefts to supply the skin on the dorsum of the wrist, the hand and the skin overlying the proximal phalanges of the related digits. b) Deep branch (posterior interosseous nerve) • It passes laterally between the superficial and deep layers of supinator, giving off branches to it, and extensor carpi radialis brevis. • It then pierces supinator and curves around the lateral side of the radius to enter the posterior compartment of the forearm. • It emerges from supinator posteriorly and is now called the posterior interosseous nerve. • This nerve lies between the superficial and deep muscle layers of the 52 -52- extensor-supinator group, accompanied by the posterior interosseous artery. • It leaves this artery and reaches the posterior aspect of the interosseous membrane by passing deep to extensor pollicis longus. • Here it is joined by the anterior interosseous artery. • The artery and the nerve pass deep to the extensor retinaculum and the tendons of extensor digitorum. • The posterior interosseous nerve ends as articular twigs to the radiocarpal and carpal joints. • The posterior interosseous nerve gives muscular branches to extensor digi torum, extensor digiti minimi, extensor indicis, extensor carpi ulnaris, abductor pollicis longus, and extensor pollicis brevis and longus. The Upper Limb 10 V asculature of the Upper Limb ARTERIES OF THE UPPER LIMB • The Axillary artery, which is the continuation of the subclavian artery as it passes the lateral border of the first rib, supplies the upper limb with blood. • In the arm it becomes the brachia! artery, at the elbow the brachia! artery divides into the ulnar artery and the radial artery. • The ulnar artery is the main artery of the forearm and the radial artery is the main artery of the hand. • The scapular anastomoses is a network of arteries arranged in relation to the scapula. • It can theoretically supply the upper limb with blood if a part of the Axillary artery becomes occluded. A The Axillary Artery 402,404 Origin • The Axillary artery is the continuation of the subclavian artery. • It begins at the lateral border of the first rib deep to the middle of the clavicle. Course • The surface marking of the Axillary artery is by a line drawn from the centre of the clavicle to the cubital fossa up to the posterior Axillary fold. • The artery traverses the apex of the axilla to end at the inferior border of Teres major where it passes into the arm and becomes the brachia! artery. • The Axillary artery passes posterior to pectoralis minor and is divided into three parts by this muscle. • The cords of the brachia! plexus are a constant relation of the brachia! artery throughout its course. The first part of the Axillary artery • The first part extends between the lateral border of the first rib and the superomedial border of pectoralis minor. • The first part of the Axillary artery, the Axillary vein and the brachia! plexus are enclosed by the fascial Axillary sheath.

D Lymphatic Drainage • The lymphatic drainage of the breast usually follows the blood supply: a) Most of the lymphatic drainage follows the lateral thoracic and thoracoacromial arteries and drain into the axillary lymph nodes, especially from the lateral quadrants. b) Some of the lymphatic drainage follows the perforating branches of the internal thoracic artery to drain into the parasternal nodes which lie along this artery, especially from the medial quadrants. c) Lymph from the lower quadrants drains into the inferior phrenic (abdominal) nodes. d) Some lymph may drain directly into the interpectoral, deltopectoral, supraclavicular or the inferior deep cervical nodes. e) Lymph from the axillary lymph nodes drains into the infraclavicular and supraclavicular nodes, and from there into the subclavian lymphatic trunk. f) The parasternal nodes drain into the bronchomediastinal trunk g) These trunks merge together with the jugular lymphatic trunk to drain on the right, into the right lymphatic duct and on the left into the thoracic duct. The skin over the breast drains centrifugally mainly into the axillary nodes but also into nodes of the upper abdomen, parasternal nodes and delta-pectoral nodes. • E Innervation • The breast is innervated by the lateral and anterior cutaneous branches of the 4th to 6th intercostal nerves. CLINICAL: Carcinoma of the breast: • Most commonly found in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. They tend to be adenocarcinomas that are derived from the glandular epithelium of the terminal ducts in the mammary gland lobules The skin of the breast can become leather like, thickened and puffy. They can also have an orange peel appearance. Retraction of the nipple may occur in subaerolar malignancy . A Masectomy, the excision of a breast, may be used for treatment of breast cancer. • • • Breast Quadrants: • The breast is divided into four quadrants for anatomical discription and location of tumours. 67 3. OVERVIEW OF THE THORAX A THE SKELETON OF THE THORAX 178,181 • The bony part of the thorax is formed: a) Anteriorly by the sternum and associated costal cartilages. b) Posteriorly by the thoracic vertebrae, related intervertebral discs and articulating ribs from their heads to their angles c) Laterally by the shafts of the ribs. In a superoinfer ior direction the thorax ex tends between the superior thoracic inlet and the inferior thoracic outlet. a) Thoracic inlet • The inlet of the thorax is kidney- shaped and is bounded: i) Anteriorly by the superior border of the manubrium sterni, the first costal cartilage and the first rib. ii) Posteriorly by the body of Tl. iii) Laterally by the first rib • Structures that pass through the inlet: i) Trachea ii) Eosophagus iii) Nerves and vessles that supply and drain the head, neck and upper limbs. • b) Thoracic outlet • The thoracic outlet slopes inferoposteriorly and is bounded: i) Anteriorly by the xiphisternal joint. ii) Posteriorly by the body of Tl 2. iii) Anterolaterally by the 11th and 12th pair of ribs and the costal cartilages of ribs 7-1 0 • The thoracic diaphragm lies at the thoracic outlet and separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. • Structures that pass through the outlet: i) Inferior Vena Cava (T8) ii) R Phrenic nerve (T8) iii) Oesophagus (Tl 0) iv) Anterior and posterior Vagal trunks (Tl 0) v) Abdominal Aorta (Tl 2) vi) Thoracic duct (Tl 2) vii) R&L Ascending lumbar vessels (Tl 2) CLINICAL: Thoracic Outlet Syndrome: • Neural or vascular complications in the upper limb. • It is caused by compression of subclavian vessels and/or nerve roots of The Thorax the brachia! plexus in the scalene tringle above the first rib. • Common causes are cervical ribs or constriction bands from cervical outgrowths. • Signs include cold hands, tingling or paralysis of the fourth and fifth digits or weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles. (Abrahams et al., 2003). B The Thoracic Cavity 178,181 • The thoracic cavity can be divided into two pleural cavities separated by the mediastinum. • The pleural cavities contain the lungs and pleurae and they are completely separate from each other. • The mediastinum extends from the inlet of the thorax above to the diaphragm below, lying between the sternum anteriorly and bodies of the thoracic vertebrae posteriorly. • The mediastinum contains all thoracic structures other than the lungs and pleurae. • The mediastinum may be divided into superior, and inferior parts. a) Superior mediastinum • This part of the mediastinum lies superior to the pericardium. • In the cadaver the superior border of the pericardium is indicated by the sternomanubrial plane. • This plane passes through the sternal angle anteriorly and the inferior border of the body of T 4 posteriorly. b) Inferior mediastinum • The inferior mediastinum lies inferior to the sternomanubrial plane in the cadaver. • It is divided by the pericardium into: i) The anterior mediastinum between the pericardium and the anterior chest wall. ii) The middle mediast inum containing the pericardium and its contents. iii) The posterior mediastinum between the vertebrae posteriorly, and the pericardium and the diaphragm anteriorly. • In the erect human being, the boundary between the superior and the inferior mediastinum drops to about the middle of the body of the sternum. 68 C The lntercostal Spaces 183-185 • The soft area between 2 ribs • Within the space you find the intercostal nerve, artery and vein • The nerves and vessels lie in the subcostal groove of the rib between the innermost(intimal) and the internal intercostal muscle layers • There are 12 pairs of ribs but only 11 intercostal nerves arteries and veins. • The 12th set is the subcostal nerve and vessels. CLINICAL • lntercostal Drainage a) A needle is inserted through the intercostal muscles into the pleural cavity to remove excess fluid. b) The needle is inserted along the top of the rib to avoid damage to the neurovascular bundle lying in the subcostal groove (Abrahams et al). The Thorax D The lntercostal Muscles 183-185 General arrangement • There are eleven pairs of external and internal intercostal muscles which occupy the intercostal spaces. • The muscles are attached to the inferior part of the costal groove of the rib above them, and the superior border of the rib below them • The intercostal mucles are arranged in a characteri stic trilaminar fashion: a) The external intercostal muscles form the outermost layer. b) The internal intercostal muscles form the middle layer. c) The intimal intercostal and transversus thoracis muscles form the innermost layer. External intercostal muscles • The fibres of these muscles run downwards and forwards (lnferoanteriorly) • These muscles span from the tubercles of the ribs posteriorly, to the costochondral junction anteriorly. • Anteriorly, medial to the costochondral junction, the muscle fibres are replaced by the external intercostal membrane. • They are continous inferiorly with external oblique Attachments • The muscles attach to the inferior border of the rib above them and the outer lip of the superior border of the rib below them. Action • The action of the muscles is to elevate the rib below it during inspiration. Innervation • The respective intercostal nerves Tl to Tl 1 . Internal intercostal muscles • The fibres of these muscles run downwards and backwards (lnferoposteriorly) • These muscles span from the angle of the ribs posteriorly, to the attachment of the costal cartilages to the sternum anteriorly. • Posteriorly, medial to the angle of the rib, the muscles are replaced by the internal intercostal membranes. • They are continous inferiorly with internal oblique Attachments • The muscles attach to the costal groove of the rib above them and the inner lip of the superior border of the rib below them. Action • The action of the muscles is to depress the rib above it during expiration. Innervation • The respective intercostal nerves Tl to Tl 1 . 69 Intimal intercostal muscles • They are variable in number, and are more common in the lower intercostal spaces. • They may be considered as deep portions of the internal intercostal muscles, and their fibres thus run in the same direction as those of the internal intercostal muscles. • The muscles span the intermediate 2/4 of the intercostal space. • The muscles may skip a rib in their inferior attachment i.e. stretch over two ribs. Attachments • The muscles attach to the internal surface (just above the costal groove) of the rib above them and the inner lip of the superior border of the rib below them. Action • To depress the rib above them during expirationn. Innervation • The adjacent intercostal nerves. Transversus thoracis muscles • These are five thin slips of muscle which attach inferiorly to the posterior surface of the xiphoid process and the adjacent costal cartilages. • The slips pass superolaterally and attach to the posterior surfaces of the 2nd to 6th costal cartilages, where the intimal intercostal muscles are absent. • Inferiorly this muscle is continuous with the transverse abdominal muscle. Action • To draw the upper costal cartilages down in forced expiration. Innervation • The adjacent intercostal nerves. The Thorax E The lntercostal Nerves 183-184 Origin of the intercostal nerves • In the thoracic region, the spinal cord gives ri se to twelve pairs of dorsal and ventral roots. • The dorsal and ventral roots unite to form twelve pairs of thoracic nerves. • Each nerve passes through the intervertebral foramen and divides into a dorsal and a ventral ramus. • The ventral rami of T 1 to T 11 enter the intercostal space and become the intercostal nerves. • The ventral ram us of Tl 2 lies inferior to the twelfth rib and is called the subcostal nerve. • The dorsal rami pass posteriorly and supply the bones, joints, skin and muscles of the back in the thoracic region. Typical intercostal nerves (Jrd.6t11) • The intercostal nerve enters the intercostal space to lie between the internal intercostal membrane and the pleura. • At the angle of the rib the intercostal nerve passes between the internal intercostal muscle and the intimal intercostal muscle to lie in the neurovascular plane of the thorax. • It runs forwards in the costal groove, accompanied by the posterior intercostal artery and vein. • The structures in the costal groove, from superior to inferior are : posterior intercostal vein, posterior intercostal artery and intercostal nerve. • Just before the angle of the rib two branches are given off: a) A collateral branch - supplies the intercostal muscles • This runs forwards in the lower part of the intercostal space. • It either rejoins the main nerve or it forms an additional anterior cutaneous nerve. • Supplies the intercostal muscles b) A lateral cutaneous branch • Divides into anterior and posterior branches. • These branches supply the skin on the lateral side of the thorax and part of the abdomen. • The superior six intercostal nerves reach the sternum and turn anteriorly to pierce the internal intercostal muscle , the external intercostal membrane and the pectoralis major muscle and its epimycium to enter the tela subcutanea. • Here it is known as the anterior cutaneous nerve. • The 7th to 11th intercostal nerves leave their intercostal spaces and emerge in the anterior abdominal wall. 70 Atypical intercostal nerves • There are two important atypical intercostal nerves: a) The first intercostal nerve • This nerve has no lateral or anterior cutaneous branches but rather divides into a large superior and a small inferior branch. • The superior branch joins the brachia! plexus while the inferior branch serves the first i ntercostal space to become the first intercostal nerve. b) The second intercostal nerve • usally the larger of the 2 branches of the ventral rami • The smaller branch joins the brachialplexus • The lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve is called the intercostobrachial nerve and emerges from 2nd intercostal space @ the MA6. • This nerve runs across the floor of the axilla to join the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm. Clinical: • Clicking-rib syndrome: Type of chondritis along the costal margin due to the sublaxion of a rib causing irratation of the intercostal nerves. • lntercostal nerve block: Usig an anesthetic agent this may be performed along the course of an intercostal nerve in the subcostal groove, just below each rib. The Thorax F The lntercostal Vessels 183-184 • Each intercostal space is supplied by three arteries: a large posterior intercostal artery and two small anterior intercostal arteries. The Anterior lntercostal Arteries • There are nine sets of anterior intercostal arteries. • The anterior intercostal arteries supplying the superior six intercostal spaces arise from the internal thoracic artery (branch of the 1st part of the subclavian artery). • The anterior intercostal arteries supplying the seventh to ninth intercostal spaces arise from the musculophrenic arteries (branches of the internal thoracic arteries). • For each intercostal space there are two anterior intercostal arteries; the one artery runs in the superior part of the intercostal space and the other in the inferior part of the intercostal space. • These arteries anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries. • The arteries supply the intercostal muscles and send branches through them to supply the pectoral muscles, breasts & skin. • There are no anterior i ntercostal arteries in the inferior 2 intercostal spaces. These are supplied by the posterior intercostal arteries and thei r collateral branches. Posterior lntercostal Vessels a) The Posterior lntercostal Arteries • The first and second posterior intercostal arteries arise from the superior intercostal artery (branch of the costocervical trunk of the subclavian artery). • The subsequent nine posterior intercostal arteries and the subcostal arteries arise from the descending aorta. • The distribution of the posterior intercostal artery is very similar to that of the intercostal nerve. • Anteriorly the posterior intercostal artery anastomoses with the anterior intercostal arteries. b) The Posterior lntercostal Veins • Accompany the intercostal arteries and nerves and the most superior intercostal grooves. • Certain posterior intercostal veins unite to form: i) The supreme intercostal vein • On each side this vein is formed by the 1st posterior intercostal vein. • It drains into the corresponding brachiocephalic vein. 71 • ii) b) The superior intercostal vein • On each side this vein is formed by the union of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th posterior intercostal veins. • On the right it drains into the vena azygos. • On the left it drains into the left brachiocephalic vein. The 5th to 11th right posterior intercostal veins and the right subcostal vein drain directly into the azygos vein. The 5th to 8th left posterior intercostal veins drain directly into the superior or accessory hemiazygos vein. The 9th to 11th left posterior intercostal veins and the left subcostal vein drain directly into the (inferior) hemiazygos vein. Anteri or intercostal veins - anastomose with the post intercostal veins Drains the internal thorasic veins. • • • • The Thorax G The Internal Thoracic Artery (Internal Mammory artery). 183-184 • The internal thoracic artery is strictly speaking not an intercostal structure, but it will be discussed here because it gives rise to a large number of intercostal vessels. Origin • The internal thoracic artery arises from the first part of the subclavian artery. • The cervical part has no branches. Course • The artery runs inferiorly and enters the thoracic cavity lying posterior to the 1st cost al cartilage and clavicale. • In the thorax it descends parallel to the sternum (approximately 1 cm from its edge) to reach the 6th intercostal space where it divides into its terminal branches, the musculophrenic and superior epigastrica's. Relations Relations in the neck Anterior: The formation of the brachiocephalic vein, the phrenic nerve. Posterior: The apical pleura. Relations in the thorax Anterior: The intercostal nerves, the superior six costal cartilages and the internal intercostal muscles. Transversus thoracis in spaces 2 to 6 and the pleura elsewhere. Posterior: Branches • The artery has the following branches: a) The pericardiophrenic artery • This runs with the phrenic nerve supplying the pericardium, the mediastinal pleura and the diaphragm. b) The anterior intercostal arteries • Anterior intercostal arteries are supplied to the superior six intercostal spaces. c) The perforating branches (of internal thoracic) • These pierce the internal intercostal muscle, the external intercostal membrane and the pectoralis major muscle with the anterior cutaneous nerve to become subcutaneous. • The 2nd, 3rd and 4th perforating branches supply the mammary gland. d) The musculophrenic artery • This is one of the terminal branches of the internal thoracic artery. • It supplies anterior intercostal arteries to the 7th, 8th and 9th intercostal spaces. 72 • It pierces the diaphragm between its attachments to the 7th and 8th or 8th and 9th ribs. e) The superior epigastric arteryArteries;epigastric, superior • This is the other terminal branch of the internal thoracic artery. • It pierces the diaphragm between its attachment to the xiphoid process and the 7th costal cartilage. • It supplies the rectus abdominis muscle. f) Mediastinal branches g) Thymic branches h) Bronchial branches i) Sternal branches The Thorax 4. THE LUNGS • The lungs are the paired structures of respiration located in the pleural cavities of the thoracic cage. A The Pleura 192-194 Introduction • Each of the the lungs is surrounded by a pleural sac which consists of two layers: a) An outer parietal layer which lines the wall of the thoracic cage. Pleura ;visceral b) b) An inner visceral layer which lines the surface of the lung including the surface within the horizontal and oblique fissues. • Between the two layers is a potential space (called the Pleural cavity) containing a capillary layer of serous pleural fluid which is secreted by the pleurae. • This fluid lubricates the movement of the visceral layer on the parietal layer during respiration and thus reduces friction between the two layers. Development of the Pleurae • During embryological development two pleural sacs develop from the coelomic cavity. • The primordia of the lungs are two lateral outpocketings called the lung buds. • Each lung bud pushes into a pleural sac invaginati ng it on its medial side. • With the growth of the lungs this invagination enlarges until the part of the sac pushed in by the lungs touches the opposite side of the sac. • The part of the sac lining the lung is called the visceral pleura and the outer part of the sac is called the parietal pleura. • The two layers are continuous at what is called the root of the lung. The Parietal Pleura • The Parietal Pleura lines the pulmonary cavities and ther efore adheres 2 the thoracic wall, mediastinum and diaphram. • The parietal pleura is described according to the part of the thorax it lines. • There are four parts of the parietal pleura: Costal, mediastinal, diaphragmatic and cervical parts of the parietal pleura are recognised. Costal pleura • This is the parietal pleura which lines the internal surface of the sternum, the costal cartilages, the ribs and intercostal muscles, and the thoracic vertebrae. • It is seperated from the thoracic wall by endothoracic fascia. • This forms a natural cleavage plane for the surgical separation of the costal pleura from the thoracic wall. Allows surgeons to move inside the thoracic wall, yet remain outside. Therefore prevents potential infection from entering pleural 73 cavities or sacs. • The endothoracic fascia also forms a thin layer of connective tissue between the diaphragm and the diaphragmatic pleura. The Mediastinal Pleural • The mediastinal Pleural covers the lateral aspects of the media stinum. • This is the parietal pleura which is associated with the mediastinum. • Superior to the root of the lung, the mediastinal pleura spans between the sternum anteriorly and the vertebrae posteri orly. • At the root of the l ung the pleura becomes continu ous with the visceral pleura lining the lungs as it ensheathes the structures in the root of the lung. • Inferior to the root of the lung, the mediastinal pleura passes laterally as a double layer to become continuous with the visceral pleura. • This double layer of pleura is called the pulmonary ligament and is continuous superiorly with the root of the lung but forms a free border inferiorly. • It is continuous at the lines of reflection with: a) The Costal pleura anterior and posterior b) The Diaphragmatic pleura inferior c) The Cervical pleura The Diaphragmatic pleura • This is the parietal pleura which lines the superior surface of the diaphragm. • The phreni copleural fascia, connects the diaphragmatic pleura with the muscular fibres of the diaphragm. The Cervical Pleura (pleura cupula) • This is the pleura associated with the apex of the lung. • It extends superiorly, passing posterior to the clavicle to reach a level 3cm superior to the medial third of the clavicle. • Each cupula is strengthened by a fascial condensation called the suprapleural membrane. • The suprapleural membrane is attached to the internal border of the first rib and the anterior border of the transverse process of Cl. The Pleural Reflections • A pleural reflection is a line along which the parietal pleura abruptly changes direction, such as when it folds back on itself or when it changes direction from one wall to another. • The two important reflections are the anterior and the inferior reflections. a) Anterior pleural reflection • This reflection is formed posterior to the sternum when the costal pleura folds abruptly to become the mediastinal pleura. • The surface markings of the left and right anterior reflections are indicated by a line that passes inferomedially from the sternoclavicular joint to the median line at the level of the sternal angle (T2). • Between the cost al cartilages of T2 to T 4 the left and right pleural The Thorax membranes touch each other and may even overlap. • Below the level of T 4, the right anterior reflection continues inferiorly in the median plane to the xiphisternal joint where it passes laterally as the inferior reflection. • At the level of T 4 the left anterior reflection turns laterally and passes behind the left margin of the sternum to the xiphisternal joint, where it passes laterally as the inferior reflection. b) Inferior pleural reflection • The inferior reflection is formed where the costal pleura folds abruptly to become the diaphragmatic pleura. • The surface markings of the inferior reflection are: i) The 8th costochondral junction. ii) The 10th rib in the midaxillary line. iii) The 12th rib in the midscapular line. The Pleural Recess • During deep inspiration, the lung expands fully and fills the entire pleural cavity. • During normal inspi ration, the expansion of the lung is less pronounced, and the parts of the pleural cavity at the pleural reflections are not occupied by the lung. • At these parts of the pleural cavity the two layers of parietal pleura come into contact to form a pleural recess. • A pleural recess is thus a potential space which is created by a pleural reflection. • The most important recesses are: a) The costo-dia phragmatic recess • This recess is created at the inferior reflection between the costal and the diaphragmatic pleurae. b) The costo-mediastinal recess • This recess is created at the anterior reflection between the costal and mediastinal pleurae. • The left recess is larger at the level of T4 and TS due to the cardiac notch in the left lung. • The lingula of the left lung slides in and out of the left costo-mediastinal recess during respiration. The Blood Supply: • Parietal - Internal thoracic (Musculophenic intercostal) arteries • Azygous and hemiazygous veins • Visceral bronchial arteries and veins Lymphatics of the Pleura: • Parietal • intercostal, • parastemal, • posterior mediastinal, • diaphragmatic, 74 • axillary. • Visceral - Hilar Lymph Nodes: Clinical: • Chylothorax: The accumulation of lymph within the pleural cavity • Pericardia! effusion: Accumulation of fluid within the pericardia! sac. It may lead to cardiac tamponade • Pleural effusion: Accumulation of fluid within the pleural cavity. • Pleurisy: Inflammation of the pleurs. The pain is refferred from the parietal pleura to the cutaneous distribution of the intercostal nerve. • Pneumo thorax: The introduction of air between the visceral and parietal pleurae. Innervation: a) Parietal Pleural Layer: • Phrenic nerves supplies the mediastinum & central diaphragmatic part. • lntercotsal nerves supply the rest. b) Visceral Parietal Layer: • Autonomic nerves • Vogus nerves • Sympathetic nerves of superior six segments The Thorax B The Divisions of the Lung 194 The apex and base the lung • Each lung is conical in shape and thus has an apex and a base. • The apex of the lung is rounded and extends superiorly, posterior to the clavicle. • It is surrounded by the cervical pleura or pleura copula. • The base of the lung is concave in shape and fits onto the superior convex surface of the diaphragm. • The hilum of the lung is the region on the medial side of the lung where the root of the lung is attached. The root of the lung • The root of the lung connects the medial surface of the lung to the heart and the trachea. • It is surrounded by the pleura and marks the region where the pari etal pleura becomes continuous with the visceral pleura and pleural sleeve. • The contents of the root of the lung are: a) The superior and inferior pulmonary veins. b) The pulmonary artery. c) The main bronchus. d) Lymphatic vessels e) Nerves f) Bronchial vessels • The pulmonary artery lies superior to the main bronchus. • The superior and inferior pulmonary veins lie anterior and antero-inferior to the main bronchus respectively. • The right lung has an additional bronchus, which lies superior, but still posterior to the pulmonary artery. The lobes and fissures • The lungs are divided into lobes by the oblique fissure; the right lung is further sub- divided by the horizontal fissure. • The surface marking of the oblique fissure is the same for both lungs and is indicated by a line that runs from the spine of T2 vertebra around the thorax to the 6th costochondral junction. • In both lungs, the region inferior to the oblique fissure is called the lower lobe and lies almost entirely posterior. • The region above the oblique fissure: a) In the left lung is called the upper lobe and l i es almost entirely anterior. b) In the ri ght lung is sub-divided by the horizontal fissure into the upper and middle lobes. • The middle lobe lies entirely anteriorly, while the upper lobe lies almost entirely anteriorly. 75 • The surface marking of the horizontal fissure is by a line running from the anterior border of the lung along the 4th costal cartilage to bisect the oblique fissure in the mid-axillary line. Clinical: • Pancoasts Tumour: Tumour of the apex of the lung, usually a bronchogenic carcinoma, which compresses the brachia! plexus and the sympathtic trunk. The Thorax C The Surfaces of the Lung 194-195 • The lung has three surfaces namely the costal surface, the diaphragmatic surface and the mediastinal surface. Costal surface • The costal surface is smooth and convex in shape. • It is related to the costal pleura which separates it from the costal cartilages, the ribs and the intercostal muscles, and the vertebrae posteriorly. Diaphragmatic surface • The diaphragmatic surface (also called the base of the lung) is related to the convex, superior surface of the diaphragm. • The surface is concave in shape and is bound laterally and posteriorly by a thin sharp margin that projects into the costo-diaphragmatic recess. • The concavity is deeper in the right lung, because of the higher position the right diaphragmatic dome, which overlies the liver. Mediastinal surface • The mediastinal surface is related to the middle mediastinum containing the pericardium and its contents. • The surface has a concavity, the pericardia! impression, due to the presence of the heart. • The pericardia! impression is more pronounced on the left lung as the heart is situated more to the left. • The hilus of the lung, where the root is attached, is situated posterosuperiorly to the pericardia! impression. • The pulmonary ligament hangs inferiorly from the pleural sleeve around the lung root. Mediastinal surface of the right lung • The impression created by the superior vena cava runs vertically, anterior to the hilus, to become continuous with the pericardia! impression inferiorly. • The impression created by the vena azygos runs posterior to the hilus and then arches over it to join the impression of the vena cava anteriorly. • Superior to the angle created by this junction is an impression for the trachea (anteriorly) and the oesophagus (posteriorly). • The trachea bifurcates at this level but the oesophagus continues inferiorly. • It thus creates an impression between the hilus and the vena azygos superiorly, and an impression posterior to the pulmonary ligament inferiorly. • Cordie impression for the heart. Mediastinal surface of the left lung • The impression created by the ascending aorta lies anterior to the hilus and it is 76 continuous with the pericardia! impression inferiorly. The arch of the aorta creates an impression superior to the hilus, and the descending aorta creates an impression posterior to the hilus and the pulmonary ligament. Superior to the aortic arch are impressions for (from anterior to posterior): a) The left subclavian artery. b) The trachea. c) The oesophagus. Inferiorly, between the pulmonary ligament and the impression of the descending aorta, is a small impression for the oesophagus as it passes to the left. • Cardiac impression for the heart is larger than that on the right side. • • • The Thorax D The Borders of the Lung 194-195 • The lung has three borders namely anterior border, posterior border, and inferior border. Anterior border • This is a thin border which lies anteriorly between the costal surface and the mediasti nal surface. • During respiration this border moves i n and out of the costo-mediastinal recess. • The surface marking of the anterior border is indicated by a line drawn in the median plane between T2 and T 4. • Inferior to the level of T 4 the anterior border of the right lung gradually passes laterally from this plane and passes posterior to the 6th costal cartilage. • At the level of T 4, the anterior border of the left lung deviates laterally to a point about 2,5 cm lateral to the left edge of the sternum. • It then turns inferiorly and slightly medially to pass posterior to the 6th costal cartilage. • This notch created in the anterior border is called the cardiac notch. Posterior border • This is a broad, rounded border which lies posterior between the costal surface and the mediastinal surface. • This border occupies the deep concavity at the side of the thoracic vertebrae. Inferior border • This border lies between the costal and mediastinal surfaces and the diaphragmatic surface. • Medially, between the diaphragmatic and mediastinal surfaces, it is rounded. • Between the costal and mediastinal surfaces it is thin and sharp and moves in and out of the costo-diaphragmatic recess. • The surface marking of the inferior border of the lung is indicated by a line drawn: a) Crossing the 6th costal cartilage in the midclavicular line. b) Crossing the 8th rib in the mid-axillary line. c) Crossing the 1 Oth rib in the midscapular line. 77 The External Differences Between The Lungs RiQht lune Left lung The lunq has three lobes The lino has two lobes The lung is larger and heavier than the The lung is smaller and lighter than the left lung.

The Thorax E The Bronc hi 198-201 Origin of the Bronchi • The trachea bifurcates at the level of the sternomanubrial plane to produce the left and the right main bronchi. • The right bronchus is more vertical and wider than the left main bronchus and passes directly to the hilum of the lung. The Relations of the main bronchi are: a) Anterior relations: • On the right the pulmonary artery passes between the upper lobe bronchus and the main bronchus. • On the left the pulmonary artery passes superior to the main bronchus. • On both sides the superior pulmonary vein lies anterior, and the inferior pulmonary vein lies antero-inferior. b) Special relations: • On the right, the vena azygos arches over the right main bronchus. • On the left, the aorta arches over the left main bronchus. The Bronchial Tree • The right bronchus is relatively short and enters the right lung at the level of the disc below T 4. • The left bronchus is longer and enters the left lung at the level of the body of T 6. • The bronchi divide in a specific pattern in the lung and the main bronchus and its branches form the bronchial tree. • Each main bronchus divides into secondary or lobar bronchi, each of which supplies a lobe of the respective lung. • Thus on the left there are two lobar bronchi, and on the right there are three lobar bronchi. • Each lobar bronchus divides into tertiary or segmental bronchi, each of which supplies a specific segment of the lung called a bronchopulmonary segment. • There are ten segmental bronchi on the right, and eight segmental bronchi on the left (they are listed on the next page). • Within each bronchopulmonary segment there is further branching of the segmental bronchi. • An artery, which originates from the pulmonary artery after it has divided repeatedly, lies posterior to the segmental bronchus. • A vein, which eventually drains into the pulmonary vein, lies anterior to the segmental bronchus. • Thus each bronchopulmonary segment has its own segmental bronchus, artery and vein. C!inkai: • Branchoscopy: A technique used to examine the internal structure of the 78 • trachea and main bronchi. Pheumoni a: An Infection of the lung by either bacteria, fungi or viruses . Brochopulmonary Segments It may seem ridiculous learning the names of these segments, but it will stand you in good stead during your clinical years. Examiners are infinitely more impressed if you can localise an infection to a brochopulmonary segment, rather than just to a lobe. Furthermore it is possible to accurately estimate the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEVl) by auscultating the intesnsity of breath sounds in two specific bronchopulmonary segments of each lung. • • The Thorax F The Vasculature of the Lungs 195,202 Arterial Supply of the Lung The pulmonary arteries • The pulmonary arteries arise from the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk in the arch of the aorta and carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs. • The arteries run laterally, lying superiorly in the root of the lung. • Each artery gives off a branch to the upper lobe before entering the hilus. • Within the lung the artery lies posterior to the main bronchus and divides in a manner simi lar to the bronchus into lobar and segmental arteries. Relations of the right pulmonary artery Anteriorly: The ascending aorta and then the superior vena cava. Posteriorly: The oesophagus and then the right bronchus. Superiorly: The aortic arch and then the right bronchus. Inferiorly: The transverse pericardia! sinus which separates it from the left and the right atria.

The bronchial arteries • The bronchial arteries supply the connective tissue of the lung. • The origins of the left and the right bronchial arteries differ: a) On the left, two bronchial arteries arise from the superior part of the descending thoracic aorta, superior and inferior to the left main bronchus respectively. b) On the right, a single bronchial artery may arise from a common trunk from the thoracic aorta with the third posterior intercostal artery, or from the superior left bronchial artery or a superior or posterior intercostal artery. The Venous Drainage of the Lung The pulmonary veins 79 • The pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart . A vein originates from each bronchopulmonary segment, lyi ng anterior to the segmental bronchus. The veins unite to form the superior and inferior pulmonary veins. The superior right pulmonary vein drains the superior and middle lobes of the right lung. The superior left pulmonary vein drains the superior lobe of the left lung . The left and right inferior pulmonary veins drain the inferior lobes of the respective lung. The right superior pulmonary vein passes posterior to the superior vena cava and superior to the right atrium to reach the right side of the left atrium. T he right inferior vein passes posterior to the right atrium to reach the left atrium . The left superior and inferior pulmonary veins pass anterior to the descending aorta to reach the left side of the left atr ium. • • • • • • • • The bronchial veins • The bronchial veins drain the regions supplied by the bronchial arteries . The right bronchial veins drain into the vena azygos . The left bronchial veins drain into the accessory hemiazygos or into the left superior intercostal vein. Bronchial veins also receive some blood from esophageal veins . • • • Clinical: • P~lmonary Thromboembolism: A condition caused by blood clots. They usually anse from the deep veins of the leg of pelvis. The blood cits get dislodge and travel to the heart. It blocks the pulmonary trunk and its branches. Lymph: • The superficial lymphaticplexus draining the lung parenchyma and visceral pluera drains into the bronchopulmonary nodes. • The deep lymphatic plexus located in the submucosao of the bronchi, drains the root of the lung and from there drains into the pulmonary lymphnodes. G Lymphatic Vessels of the Lungs 204 • The pulmonary lymphatics drain into the pulmonary nodes which are located along the smaller bronchi. The lymph passes from these nodes to the bronchopulmonary nodes which are located in the hilus of the lung. The lymph passes from these nodes into the superior and inferior tracheobronchial nodes which lie above and below the bifurcation of the trachea respectively. On the right side, these nodes are drained by the right bronchomediastinal trunk • • • The Thorax into the right lymphatic duct and the deep cervical nodes. • On the left side, these nodes are drained by the left bronchomediastinal trunk into the thoracic duct and the deep cervical nodes. H Innervation of the Lung 206 Innervation of the lungs and visceral pleura • The lungs and visceral pleura are innervated by the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses which lie anterior and posterior to the root of the lung respectively. (CNX) • They are mixed plexuses, receiving parasympathetic fibres from the vagus nerves and sympathetic fibres from the sympathetic trunks. (CNX) • The motor fibres of the parasympathetic system cause: a) Vasodilation of the pulmonary vessels. b) Increased secretion of the glands of the bronchial tree. c) Constriction of the bronchi (bronchoconstriction). • The motor fibres of the sympathetic system cause: a) Vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vessels. b) Decreased secretion of the glands of the bronchial tree. c) Dilation of the bronchi (bronchodilation). • Sensory fibres of the vagus detect pain and touch in the respiratory epithelium and the degree of stretch in the bronchial tree. • Sensory fibres of the sympathetic trunks are present but the function of these is unknown. Innervation of the parietal pleura • The costal pleura and the peripheral part of the diaphragmatic pleura are innervated by the intercostal nerves. • The mediastinal pleura and the central part of the diaphragmatic pleura are innervated by the phrenic nerves. 80 I The Mechanics of Respiration 191 Introduction Types of breathing • Ventilation of the lungs can be divided into two types: a) Costal or thoracic ventilation which occurs under the action of the intercostal muscles. b) Diaphragmatic ventilation which occurs under the action of the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles. • Normal ventilation is usually a combination of the above. Costal ventilation Normal inspiration • During normal inspiration the volume of the thorax is increased by two mechanisms: a) The bucket-handle effect • Contraction of the intercostal muscles causes the ribs to ascend and swing out like bucket handles which are being lifted. • This increases the transverse diameter of the thorax. b) The pump-handle effect • The posterior extremities of the ribs are relatively fixed to the vertebral column. • The anterior extremities of the ribs, being attached to the fairly mobile sternum, can move with respect to the posterior extremities of the ribs. • Contraction of the interocostal muscles moves the sternum forwards and upwards resulting in the anterior extremities of the ribs being like the handle of a water pump which is being lifted. • This increases the anteroposterior diameter of the thorax. Forced inspiration • A number of additional muscles assist in forced inspiration: a) The scalenes and sternocleidomastoids raise the 1st rib and manubrium sterni respectively. b) Pectoralis major and pectoralis minor assist in raising the ribs. Normal expiration • This involves no muscular action and is achieved by the elastic recoil of the muscles of the thoracic cavity and the lungs. Forced expiration • This is achieved by forceful contraction of the abdominal vasculature (See diaphragmatic ventilation). The Thorax Diaphragmatic ventilation Inspiration • The diaphragm has two dome- shaped halves, which descend when the muscle contracts. • This results in an increase in the vertical diameter of the thorax and a decrease in intrathoracic pressure. • The central tendi nous half of the diaphragm moves l i ttle during normal inspiration. • As the descent of the di aphragm reduces the volume of t he abdominal cavity, the abdominal muscles have to relax to accommodate the abdominal viscera. • Thus, in this respect, the diaphragm and the anterior abdominal muscles may be considered as antagonistic muscles. Expiration • The abdominal muscles contract which forces the abdominal viscera against the diaphragm. • The diaphr agm moves into the thoracic cavity thus decreasing the vertical diameter of the thorax and increasing the intrathoracic pressure. • Forced expiration involves forceful contraction of the abdominal muscles. 81 5. THE HEART A PERICARDIUM 207,211 Location • The pericardia! sac is conical in shape and is located in the middle mediastinum, posterior to the body of the sternum and the 2nd to 6th costal cartilages. • It lies anterior to vertebrae T5 to TB. Structure • The pericardia! sac is a serous cavity consi sting of: a) A dense, outer fibrous connective tissue layer which forms the pericardium. b) A serous membrane which forms the serous pericardium. fibrous YI The fibrous pericardium • This is a tough outer layer that prevents overdistention of the heo rt. • The sac is continuous with the t unica adventitia of the superior and inferior venae cavae, the aorta and the pulmonary trunk and veins. • Anteriorly, the sac is attached by sternopericardial ligaments,to the periosteum of the sternum. • Inferiorly, the base of the fibrous pericardia! sac is attached to the central t ~ndon of the diophroq pj. by the pericardiophrenic ligament. The serous pericardium • The serous pericardium is composed of simple squamous epithelium called mesothelium. • It consists of two components: a) The outer or parietal serous pericardium • This is the mesothelial layer lining the per icardia! cavity. • It is fused with the internal surface of the fibrous pericardium. b) The inner or visceral serous pericardium • This is called the epicardium and forms the outermost layer of the wall of the heart. • The visceral serous pericardium is continuous with the parietal serous pericardium over the great vessels of the thorax. The Pericardial Cavity • The pericardia! cavity is the potential space between the two layers of the serous pericardium. • It is filled with a capillary layer of pericardia! fluid secreted by the mesothelium. • The fluid has two main functions: a) It reduces friction when the heart moves in the pericardia! cavity. b) It establishes a surface tension between the two layers of serous The Thorax pericardium. • During inspiration, the fibrous pericardium expands due to its attachment to the sternum and the diaphragm and, as a result, the parietal serous pericardium is pulled outwards. • Due to the surface tension between the two layers of the serous pericardium, the visceral serous pericardium, and thus the heart are pulled outwards. • This results in the lower thoracic pressure being transmitted to the heart, and the venous return to the heart thus increases during inspirotion.

Lateral: Superior: Inferior: The Pericardial Sinus • The heart, which is lined by visceral serous pericardium, lies in the fibrous pericardia! sac which is lined on its inner surface by the parietal serous pericardium. • The only connection between the heart and the fibrous pericardia! sac is by the aorta and pulmonary trunk, and the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. • The visceral serous pericardium thus reflects off the heart at these connections to become continuous with the parietal serous pericardium lining the fibrous pericardium. • The reflection of the visceral serous pericardium around the great vessels to form the parietal serous pericardium results in the formation of the pericardia! sinuses. • The sinuses are the transverse pericardia! sinus and the oblique pericardia! sinus. a) Transverse pericardia! sinus • This lies posterior to the aorta and pulmonary trunk, and anterior to the superior vena cava. • The aorta and the pulmonary trunk develop from the same part of the embryological heart (the truncus arteriosus) and they are thus enclosed in a common sheath of visceral pericardium. • The transverse pericardia! sinus is continuous with the main pericardia! cavity at its left and right ends. b) Oblique pericardia I sinus • This is an inverted, horse-shoe shaped sinus which lies posterior to the heart. • It is formed by the reflection of the parietal pericardium around the inferior vena cava, right pulmonary veins, superior vena cava and left pulmonary veins. • This reflection effectivel y suspends the heart in the fibrous pericardia! 82 sac. • The oblique pericardia! sinus is separated from the transverse pericardia! sinus by the reflection of serous pericardium between the left and right pulmonary veins. Pericardial vasculature Arterial supply • The pericardium receives its blood mainly from the musculophrenic and pericardiophrenic arteries which are branches of the internal thoracic artery. • It also recieves blood from the bronchial, oesophageal and the superior phrenic arteries, which are branches of the Thoracic Aorta. • The visceral serous pericardium is supplied mainly by the coronary arteries.

The Right Ventricle • The right ventricle forms part of the anterior surface, a small part of the inferior surface, and a large part of the inferior border of the heart. • It may be divided into two parts: a) The right ventricle proper. b) The infundi bulum or conus arteriosus • The right ventricle proper is separated from the infundibulum by a ridge called the supraventricular crest. The right ventricle proper • This has muscular walls with muscular elevations called trabeculae carneae. • A thick muscular band, the septomarginal trabecula, passes from the anterior wall of the ventricle to the interventricular septum. • The septomarginal trabeculae is a curved muscular bundle that runs from the inferior part of the interventricular septum to the ase of the anterior papillary muscle. • It carries part of the right branch of the AV bundle. • It plays an important role in the conducting system of the heart. • The right ventricle proper also has three conical-shaped papillary muscles, of right ventricle. • Fibrous strands, called chordae tendinaeChordae tendinae, extend from the apices of these muscles to the cusps of the tricuspid valve. • During ventricular systole the papillary muscles contract and via the chordae tendinae prevent eversion of the cusps of the tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve • The tricuspid valve guards the right atrioventricular orifice. • The valve prevents regurgitation of blood into the right atrium during ventricular systole. • The tricuspid valve has an anterior, a posterior and a septal cusp. • Each cusp is directed into the ventricle and has chordae tendinae running from its free edge to two papill ary muscles. • Chordae tendinae prevent seperation of cusps as well as their inversion, when tension is applied through ventricular contraction during systole.

It lis guarded by the pulmonary valve • The pulmonary (semilunar) valve which consists of three semilunar cusps or demilunes, guards the pulmonary orifice. • The cusps, which are named left, r ight and anterior, project into the artery and are concave when viewed from above. • Opposite each cusp in the wall of the pulmonary trunk is slight dilatation called a sinus. • Blood fills these pulmonary sinusesSinus; pulmonary which prevents the cusps from sticking to the wall of the pulmonary artery and failing to close. Blood Flow Through the Right Side of the Heart • Due to the anatomical position of the heart, blood flows in a horixontal plane forwards and to the left from the right atrium to the right ventricle. • Blood flows out of the right ventricle via the pulmonary trunk which is situated superoanteriorly. • The blood flow through the right side of the heart thus follows a U-shaped course. The Left Atrium • The left atrium forms the posterior aspect or base of the heart. • This chamber has a slightly thicker wall than the right atrium because of the increased effort required during atrial systole to overcome the elasticity of the ventricular wall. • Two left and two right pulmonary veins open into the posterior wall of the atrium. • The inner wall of the atrium is smooth and is derived from the pulmonary veins, as the atrium expands in the foetus it absorbes the pulmonary veins. • The left auricle, which projects from the left atrium, forms part of the superior border of the heart. • The internal surface of the auricle is roughened by pectinate muscles derived from the primitive atrial chamber • The four Pulmonary veins open into the atrium. 85 The Left Ventricle • The left ventricle forms the apex of the heart, most of its left border and surface and most of its inferior surface. • The ventr icle also contributes a small part to the anterior surface of the heart. • The left ventricle is divided into: a) The left ventricle proper. b) The aortic vestibule. The left ventricle proper • The wall of the left ventricle proper is much thicker than that of the right ventricle proper. • This allows it to overcome the large vascular resistance of the systemic circuit. • The left ventricle proper also has larger trabeculae carneae and a greater number of chordae tendinae than the right ventricle proper. • About 50% of hearts have left ventricular bands which cross the ventricle. • These bands, which resemble trabeculae carnae, correspond to the septomarginal trabecula of the right ventricle and form part of the conducting system of the heart. • The left ventricle proper has two papillary muscles, of left ventricle. The mitral valve • The mitral or bicuspid valve guards the left atrioventricular orifice. • The valve prevents regurgitation of blood into the left atrium during ventricular systole. • The mitral valve has a large anterior and a small posterior cusp (strictly speaking the valve has leaflets rather than cusps). • The chordae tendinae run from the free end of the cusps to a large anterior papillary muscle and a small posterior papillary muscle. The aortic vestibule • The aortic vestibule, which is located superior and to the right of the mitral valve, leads into the ascending aorta. • The aortic valveValve;aortic, which consists of three semilunar cusps or demilunes, guards the aortic orifice. • The cusps, which are named left, right and posterior, project into the artery and are concave when viewed from above. • Opposite each cusp in the wall of the ascending aorta is a slight dilation called a sinus. • The aortic sinuseSinus;aortics are named after their corresponding cusp: a) The right aortic sinus in which the mouth of the right coronary artery opens. b) The left aortic sinus in which the mouth of the left coronary artery opens. c) The posterior aortic or noncoronary sinus (no artery arises from this sinus). The Thorax The Semilunar Valves Structure • The aortic and pulmonary valves are semilunar valves as they each consist of three semilunar cusps. • Peripherally these cusps are attached to the annulus fibrosus, a dense connective tissue ring which surrounds and supports the valvular openings. • Each cusp has in the centre of its free edge a nodule which ensures that the lumen of the valve closes completely at the end of ventricular systole. • On each side of the nodule the edge of the cusp has a thickening called the lunule. Naming of the cusps • The naming of the cusps of the pulmonary and aortic valves is according to their embryological origin rather tho n according to their anatomical position. • The valves develop from the truncus arteriosus which has four cusps: an anterior, a posterior, a left and a right cusp. • The truncus arteriosus splits to form the pulmonary trunk and the ascending aorta. The pulmonary valve develops from the anterior cusp and parts of the left and right cusps of the truncus arteriosus. The aortic valve develops from the posterior cusp and parts of the left and right cusps of the truncus arteriosus. The heart then undergoes partial rotation to the left to produce the arrangment of cusps observed in the adult heart. • • • The Septae of the Heart lnteratrial septum • The septum is sloped obliquely so that the right atrium lies anterior to a part of the left atrium. • The fossa ovalis is a shallow depression in the atrial septal wall and it has a sharp, incomplete border called the limbus of the fossa ovalis. • The fossa ovalis is the remnant of the foetal foramen ovale. lnterventricular septum • The interventricular septum is composed of muscular and membranous parts. • The sept um slopes posteriorly and to t he right. • The muscular and membranous parts have different embryological derivations. • Defects of the interventricular septum usually involve only the membranous part. 86 D VASCULATURE OF THE HEART 212-215 The Arterial Supply • The myocardium and epicardium are supplied by the left and the right coronary arteries (branches of the ascending aorta). • The arteries commonly form anastomoses which allow blood to reach an area via a different artery if the normal arterial supply becomes obstructed.

THE ABDOMEN 3 THE PERITONEUM 260-266 A Introduction • In the early embryo, the peritoneum is a large sac which lines the walls of the abdomi nal cavi ty. • The pr imordia of the vi scera lie outside this sac, between it and the abdominal walls. • As the viscera develop and grow, they project to varying degrees into the peritoneal sac. • Some viscera e.g. the small intestine, projects completely into the sac, and is thus completely surrounded by it. • Other viscera e.g. the kidneys, only project partially into the sac and are thus partially lined by it. • However, there are no organs or structures within the sac. • In addition to organs, there are also nerves and vessels to the organs and extraperitoneal fatty tissue outside the peritoneal sac. • The extraperitoneal fat is separated from the muscles of the abdominal wall by a layer of fascia called the transversalis fascia. • In summary abdominal wall consists, from external to internal, of: a) Skin and tela subcutanea (superficial fascia). b) Deep Fascia. c) Muscles. d) Transversalis fascia. e) Extraperitoneal fat. B Definitions Peritoneum • The peritoneum is a mesothelial lining. • It may be divided into the parietal and the visceral peritoneum. • The visceral peritoneum is the part of the peri toneum in contact with the viscera of the abdomen and pelvis. • The parietal peritoneum is the part of the peritoneum in contact with the walls of the abdomen and the pelvic cavity. C Mesenteries • Some organs are not completely surrounded by peritoneum. • These are called retroperitoneal organs. • Examples of retroperitoneal organs are the kidney, the pancreas, the ascending and descending colon and parts of the duodednum. • Other organs like the small intesti ne are completely surrounded by peritoneum. 103 • The parietal peritoneum reflects off the body wall to form a double- layered membrane called a mesentery or a ligament. • When the mesentery reaches the organ (e.g. the small intestine) it splits again to surround the organ. • As stated above this peritoneum lining the organ is called the visceral peritoneum. • The space between the two layers of peritoneum of the mesentery is still outside the peritoneal cavity. • It provides a pathway for vessels and nerves to pass to the viscus. • A working definition of a mesentery is a double layered fold of peritoneum running between the parietal and visceral peritoneum in organs that are not retroperitoneal. The Ventral Mesentery • The ventral mesentery degenerates except for its proximal and distal portions. The Proximal Ventral Mesentery • The liver develops in the proximal part of the ventral mesentery dividing it two parts: a) The lesser omentum running between the liver and the stomach and duodenum. b) The falciform ligament running between the anterior abdominal wall and the liver. a) The lesser omentum • The lesser omentum consists of the following parts: a) The hepatoduodenal ligament • This runs between the superior part of the duodenum and the right edge of the porta hepatis of the liver. • Between the two layers of the ligament, at its free edge, are the bile duct, the hepatic artery and the portal vein. • The ligament also contains lymphatics and a nerve plexus. b) The hepatogastric ligament • This ligament runs between the porta hepatis of the liver and the lesser curvature of the stomach. b) The falciform ligament • This ligament runs between the liver and the ventral body wall as far inferiorly as the umbilicus. • In its free edge is the ligamentum teres which is the remnant of the left umbilical vein. ( >- ound \"'(:; ...........,_,-,t;:) • The coronary ligament • As the liver enlarges a part of its cranial surface comes into contact with the central tendon of the diaphragm. • Here the peritoneum reflects off the liver onto the inferior surface of the THE ABDOMEN diaphragm. • This reflection results in a region of the liver, called the bare area of the liver, being devoid of peritoneum. • The reflection of the peritoneum from the liver onto the diaphragm forms the coronary ligament. The Distal Ventral Mesentery • The distal portion of the ventral mesentery forms the median umbilical fold. • This fold extends from the apex of the urinary bladder to the umbilicus. • It contains the urachus which is the remnant of the alllantois. The Dorsal Mesentery • The dorsal mesentery can be divided into six parts depending on which part of the GIT it suspends. a) Dorsal mesogastrium • The dorsal mesogastrium runs between the greater curvature of the stomach and the dorsal body wall. • It is divided into several parts: a) The greater omentum (details on next page). b) The gastrophrenic ligament which runs between the greater curvature of the stomach and the diaphragm. c) The gastrosplenic ligament which runs between the greater curvature of the stomach and the spleen (the splenorenal ligament continues between the spleen and the dorsal body wall above the spleen). b) Mesentery proper • This supports most of the small intestine. • It is fan-shaped and runs between the dorsal body wall to the jejunum and the ileum. c) Ascending mesocolon • This is only an embryonic structure which, except for the small portion along the caecum, becomes opposed and fused to the dorsal body wall (this makes the ascending colon secondarily retroperitoneal). d) Transverse mesocolon • This supports the transverse colon. • It initially runs between the dorsal body wall and the transverse colon but then becomes fused to the greater omentum to form the gastrocolic ligament. e) Descending mesocolon • This is only an embryonic structure which becomes apposed and fused to the dorsal body wall (this makes the descending colon secondarily retroperitoneal). 104 f) Sigmoid mesocolon • This runs between the dorsal body wall and the sigmoid colon. D The Peritoneal Sacs • Note: The student should consult a embryology book on the formation of the greater and lesser sacs. The Lesser Sac • This sac lies mainly posterior to the stomach but extends beyond i ts limits. • It thus forms a serous bursa which allows for movement between the stomach and the stomach bed. • The lesser sac communicates with the rest of the peritoneal cavity (called the greater sac) through a narrow passage called the epiploic foramen. • The epiploic/ omental fora men (of Winslow) is bounded by: a) The caudate lobe of the liver superiorly. b) The parietal peritoneum covering the superi or vena cava posteriorly. c) The superior duodenum inferiorly. d) The hepatoduodenal ligament (part of the lesser omentum) anteriorly. The Greater Omentum • The dorsal mesogastrium expands to form a voluminous fold, the greater omentum, which drapes over the ventral surface of the transverse colon and small intestine. • The space inside the greater omental fold is called the inferior recess of the lesser sac and the space behind the stomach is called the upper recess of the greater sac. • The lower recess is obliterated by the fusion of the two walls of the greater omentum thus forming a four layered apron-like structure. THE ABDOMEN E The Peritoneal Folds of the Anterior Abdominal Wall Origin • The internal surface of the anterior abdomi nal wall is lined with peritoneum. • Structures like arteri es and veins which traverse the internal surface of the anterior abdominal wall raise a peritoneal fold (an elevation of peritoneum) which has a free edge. • The most important peri toneal folds and their contents are lists in the table below. Name of fold Position of fold Contents of fold Median Runs from the apex The urachus (remnant of the umbilical of the urinary allantois) bladder to the umbilicus Medial Run obli quely on The obliterated part of the umbilical umbili cal either side, from the artery, also called the medi al side wall of the umbilical ligament. pelvis minor to the umbilicus Lateral These folds run It contains the inferior epigastric umbilical obliquely on either artery side, from the external iliac artery to about the level of the arcurate line Falciform This fold runs from Ligamentum teres, which is the ligament the deep surface of remnant of the left umbilical vein. the superior half of the anterior abdominal wall to the liver. 105 4 THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL A Muscles of the Anterior Abdominal Wall Arrangement • The arrangement of the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall is similar to that of the intercostal muscles: a) The superior oblique muscle is outermost. b) The internal oblique muscle is inter mediate. c) The transversus abdominis muscle is innermost. • These three muscles are called the flat muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. • Additionally there are rectus abdominis and pyramidalis. • The muscles are detailed in the table below.

THE ABDOMEN B Fascia of the Anterior Abdominal Wall 241 Superficial Fascia abdominal wall • Over most of the anterior abdominal wall the superficial fascia, or tela subcut anea, consists of a si ngle layer which contains a variable amount of fat. • In the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall the superficial fascia consists of two layers: a) The fatty superficial layer • This contains a variable amount of fat. • Inferiorly it is continuous with the superficial fascia of the thigh and the superficial layer of the superficial perinea! fascia. b) The membranous deep layer • This contains little fat and is mainly fibrous. • Superiorly it is continuous with the tela subcutanea of the thorax. • Inferiorly it fuses with the deep fascia (fascia Iota) of the thigh and is continuous with the deep layer of superficial perinea! fascia. Deep Fascia • The deep fascia consists of the rectus sheath and the linea alba. • The rectus sheath encloses the rectus abdominis muscle. • The linea alba is a tendinous seorn which lies in the sagittal plane between the two rectus abdominis muscles. C The Rectus Sheath and The Linea Alba 241-244 Redus Sheath • The rectus sheath is an incomplete fascial compartment enclosing the rectus abdominis muscle. • It is formed by the fusion of the oponeuroses of the internal oblique, external oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. • It consists of an anterior layer, which lies anterior to rectus abdominis, and a posterior layer, which lies posterior to rectus abdominis. • The anterior layer of the rectus sheath consists of, from external to internal: a) Above the costal margin • The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. b) Above the umbilicus • The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle and the anterior lamina of the internal oblique aponeurosis. • Above the umbilicus the aponeurosis of the internal oblique muscle splits into an anterior and a posterior lamina. c) Above the pubis • The aponeuroses of the external oblique, internal oblique and transversus abdominis. 107 • If pyrimidalis is present, it lies between the rectus abdominis posteriorly and this part of the rectus sheath anteriorly. • Inferiorly the sheath is attached to the superior border of the body of the pubis. • The posterior layer of the rectus sheath is: a) Deficient above the costal margin and thus the superior part of rectus abdominis lies on the costal cartilages. b) Present above the umbilicus, where it is formed by the fusion of the aponeurosis of transversus abdominis and the posterior lamina of the internal oblique aponeurosis. c) Deficient below the arcuate line and thus the inferior part of rectus abdominis is in contact with the transversalis fascia. • The arcuate line lies about midway between the umbilicus and the pubis and is the line below which all the aponeuroses of t he muscles pass anterior to rectus abdominis. Linea Alba • The linea alba is a strong tendinous raphe (seam) which l i es between the two rectus abdominis muscles. • It is formed by the interdigi tating fibers from the anterior and posterior layers of the rectus sheath. Tendinous Intersections of Redus Abdominis • The anterior layer of the rectus sheath is firmly attached to the rectus abdominis muscle (not to the posterior layer of the rectus sheath) at three tendinous intersections. • The levels of these intersections are normally: a) At the level of the tip of the xiphoid process. b) At the level of the umbilicus. c) Midway between the above two levels. • These intersections allow the superior and inferior epigastric arteries to anastomose in the substance of the rectus abdominis muscle. The Transversalis fascia • The transversalis fascia is a fascial layer that separates the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall from the extraperitoneal fat. • Anteriorly the fascia lines the posterior layer of the rectus sheath up to the arcuate line, and then the bare posterior surface of the rectus abdominis below that. • Posteriorly the fascia disappears over the aponeurosis of transversus abdomi nis muscle. • Laterally the fascia lines the inner surface of transversus abdominis muscle. • Superi orly the fascia is continuous with the fascia on the inferior surface of the diaphragm. • Inferiorly the fascia is attached to: a) The internal lip of the iliac crest where it is continuous with the iliac fascia. b) The inguinal ligament as far medial as the external iliac vessels. THE ABDOMEN • Medial to this, the fascia exten ds downwards on the femoral vessels as the anterior wall of the femoral sheath. • The fascia also evaginates at the deep inguinal ring to form a layer around the spermatic cord, or round l i gament of the uterus. 108 D Vessels of the Anterior Abdominal Wall 247-248 The Epigastric Arteries Superior Epigastric Artery Origin • The superior epigastric artery arises from the bifurcation of the internal thoracic artery in the 6th intercostal space. Course & relations • The artery pierces the diaphragm between the 7th costal cartilage and the xiphoid process. • It pierces the posterior layer of the rectus sheath and runs posterior to the rectus abdominis muscle in the sheath. • It then enters the muscle where it anastomoses with the inferior epigastric artery Inferior Epigastric Artery Origin • The inferior epigastric artery arises from the external iliac artery, medial to the deep inguinal ring. Course & relations • It ascends in the extraperitoneal plane to the level of the arcuate line of the rectus sheath in the lateral umbilical fold. • At the arcuate line it enters the rectus abdominis muscle where it anastomoses with the superior epigastric artery (branch of the internal thoracic artery). Branches a) The cremasteric artery. • This supplies the cremaster muscle of the spermatic cord in the male and anastomoses with the testicular artery. • In the female, it is called the artery of the round ligament of the uterus and it supplies this structure. b) The pubic branch • The pubic branch runs posterior to the inguinal ligament to reach the body of the pubis. • Here it anastomoses with the pubic branch of the obturator artery (branch of the internal iliac artery). • The pubic branch may enlarge to replace the obturator artery, in which case it is called the accessory obturator artery. c) Cutaneous branches THE ABDOMEN E Nerves of the Anterior Abdominal Wall 249 Origin • Most of the skin and muscles of the anterior abdominal wall are supplied by the ventral rami of the inferior six thoracic nerves (T7 to Tl 1) and the subcostal nerve. • The ventral ram us of L 1 splits into two branches, the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves, which supply the lower region of the abdominal wall. The Positions of the Nerves Supplying the Anterior Abdominal Wall • The main trunks of the intercostol nerves run forwards from the intercostal spaces into the neurovascular plane of the abdomen accompanied by branches of the lower intercostal, subcostal and lumbar arteries. This neurovascular plane is located between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles. In this neurovascular plane: a) Tl and T8 run upwards towards the xiphoid process. b) T9 runs horizontally. . . c) Tl O runs downwards to supply the region around the umbilicus. . d) Tl 1 , the subcostal nerve and the iliohypogastric nerve supply the anterior abdominal wall below the umbilicus, in that order, from above downwards. e) The ilioinguinal nerve emerges through the superficial inguinal ring. • • 109 5 THE INGUINAL REGION A The Inguinal Ligaments 251-254 Formation of the Inguinal Ligament • The inguinal ligament is a ligament which runs between the pubic tubercle and the anterior superior iliac spine. • It is formed by the aponeurosis of the ex ternal oblique muscle as it folds back on itself. • At the point where the aponeurosis inserts onto the pubic tubercle, some of its fibers reflect onto the superior pubic ramus to form the lacunar ligament. • The pectineal ligament is an extension of the lacunar ligament along the pectineal line of the superior pubic ramus. • Some of the fibers of the inguinal ligament cross the linea alba and attach to the contralateral pubic crest to form the reflex inguinal ligament . B The Inguinal Canal 251-254 Formation of the inguinal canal • The testes develop in the lumbar region between the transversalis fascia and the peritoneum. • From the inferior poles of each testis a fibrous cord, the gubernaculum, passes through the anterior abdominal wall to the internal surface of the scrotum. • An evaginotion of peritoneum, called the processus vaginalis, develops on each side of the gubernaculum. • The processus vaginalis evaginates through the anterior abdominal wall along a path formed by the gubernaculum. • This results in the evagination of the layers of the anterior abdominal wall and the formation of the inguinal canal. • In males, each testis and its spermatic cord is covered by the layers of the anterior abdominal wall that evaginated. • Once the testis has reached the scrotum the neck of the processus vaginalis is obliterated. • The remnant of the processus vaginalis forms the tunica vaginalis. Structure of the inguinal canal • The inguinal canal is an inferomedially directed passage through the inferior part of the anterior abdominal wall. • It runs superior and parallel to the medial half of the inguinal ligament, connecting the extraperitoneal and subcutaneous parts of the anterior abdominal wall. • The medial opening of the inguinal canal is called the superficial inguinal ring, THE ABDOMEN and the lateral opening is called the deep inguinal ring. • The canal has an anterior and a posterior wall, a floor and a roof. Anterior wall • The anterior wall is formed mainly by aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle and is assisted laterally by the fibers of internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. Posterior wall • The posterior wall is formed by the transversalis fascia, assisted medially by the conjoint tendon. Roof • The roof of the canal is formed by the arching fibers of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. Floor • The floor of the canal is formed by the superior aspects of the inguinal ligament and the lacunar ligament medially. Contents of the inguinal canal • The inguinal canal contains: a) The spermatic cord in the male and the round ligament of the uterus in the female. b) The ilioinguinal nerve. Integrity of the Inguinal Canal • The structure of the inguinal canal prevents the abdominal contents from being pushed through the gap in the anterior abdominal wall when the intra- abdominal pressure increases i.e. it prevents herniation. • As the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall contract to increase the intra- abdominal pressure, a pre-requisite for herniation, the posterior wall of the canal is forced onto the anterior wall t hus constricting the passage. • In addition, as a result of the contractions of its constituent muscles, the roof of the canal descends and constricts the passage. The External (superficial) Inguinal Ring • This is a triangular opening in the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, 1 cm superolateral to the pubic tubercle. • The apex of the triangle points superolaterally and the base of the triangle is formed by the pubic crest. • The two limbs of the triangle are formed by the medial and the lateral crura of the superfici al inguinal ring: a) The medial crus is formed by the part of the external oblique aponeurosis which att aches to the pubic symphysis. b) The lateral cru is formed by the part of the external oblique aponeurosis which attaches to the pubic tubercle. • lntercrural fibers stretch across the superficial inguinal ring superomedially and prevent the two crura from spreading apart. • The contents of the inguinal canal emerge from the superficial i nguinal ri ng. 110 The Internal (deep) Inguinal Ring • The deep inguinal ring is located just superi or to the midpoint of the inguinal ligament, lateral to the inferior epigastric artery. • It is formed by an opening in the transversalis fascia. • Note : There is not a hole in the transversalis fascia, but rather an evagination of the fascia which surrounds the spermatic cord in the male and the round ligament of the uterus in the female. C Inguinal Hernias 254 • A hernia is a protrusion of the whole or part of a viscus from its normal position through an opening in the wall of its cavity. • An external hernia is a protrusion of a viscus from the peritoneal cavity into an abnormal position. • The most common site for this to occur is the inguinal region. • Inguinal hernias may be classified as being either indirect or direct. a) Indirect inguinal hernias • An indirect inguinal hernia is the herniation of the abdominal contents along the inguinal canal. • Thus the hernia occurs lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels through the deep inguinal ring. • This is also called an oblique hernia as the inguinal canal runs obliquely. b) Direct inguinal hernia • A direct inguinal hernia occurs medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. • The hernia passes through the so-called inguinal triangle (of Hesselbach), and then pushes through the superficial inguinal ring. • The inguinal triangle is bound: i) Medially by the linea alba. ii) lnferolaterally by the inguinal ligament. iii) Laterally by the inferior epigastric artery. THE ABDOMEN F THE POSTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL A Vasculature of the Posterior Abdominal Wall 256 - 257 The Abdominal Aorta Origin & Course • The abdominal aorta is the midline continuation of the thoracic aorta at the level of Tl 2. • In the abdomen the aorta descends to bifurcate at the intercristal plane (T4) into the left and right common iliac arteries. Relations Anterior: (from superior to inferior) a) The coeliac plexus b) The posterior surface of the pancreas and the embedded splenic vein c) The left renal vein d) The horizontal or third part of the duodenum.

(Refer to arteries of the gastrointestinal tract) d) The median sacral artery. • This artery arises from the posterior aspect of the aorta just before its bifurcation. • The artery then runs over L4, 5 and the sacrum towards the coccyx. • As it passes anterior to the body of LS it gives off the 5th pair of lumbar arteries, which lie in ser ies with the four pairs of lumbar arteries which arise directly from the aorta. • On the sacrum it anastomoses with the lumbar branch of the iliolumbar artery and the lateral sacral arteries on either side (branches of the internal iliac artery). • Thi s artery helps to supply the rectum. Paired Branches (from superior to inferior) a) The inferior phrenic arteries • Each of these arteries passes superolaterally on the corresponding crus of the diaphragm to supply the posterior part of the diaphragm. • The left artery is crossed by the oesophagus and the right artery by the inferior vena cava. • Each inferior phrenic artery gives rise to a superior suprarenal artery which runs to the correspondi ng suprarenal gland. b) The middle suprarenal arteries • Each of these arteries runs laterally across its respective crus of the diaphragm to reach the suprarenal gland on that side. • The left artery runs with the splenic artery along the superior border of the pancreas and the right artery is crossed by the inferior vena cava. c) The renal arteries (See \"Vasculature of the Kidney\". d) The gonadal arteries • These arteries descend on psoas major crossing the ureter and the genitofemoral nerve on that side. • In addition the left artery crosses superficial to the inferior vena cava. • In the male the testicular artery the deep inguinal ring and passes into the inguinal canal. • In the female the ovarian artery turns medially, crosses the external iliac vessels to descend on the wall of the pelvis, and then enters the suspensory ligament of the ovary. THE ABDOMEN e) The lumbar arteries • Four pairs of lumbar arteries arise from the abdominal aorta. • These arteries pass through the fibrous arches formed by the attachment of psoas major to the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae and then pass deep to this muscle and quadratus lumborum. • The fourth lumbar artery usually passes posterior to psoas major, but anterior to quadratus lumborum. • Each lumbar artery gives rise to a dorsal branch which supplies the skin and the muscles of the back. • A spinal branch arises from the dorsal branch and this supplies the contents of the vertebral canal. f) The common i liac arteries • The abdominal aorta terminates by bifurcating into the left and right common iliac arteries. The Common Iliac Arteries Origin • These arteries arise from the bifurcation of the aorta at the level of the intercristal plane. Course • The course of each common iliac artery corresponds to the proximal 1 /3 of a line drawn from the bifurcation of the aorta to the femoral point. • The femoral point is the midline of the line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the pubic symphysis. • Each common iliac artery terminates anterior to the sacra-iliac joint by bifurcating into its terminal branches, the internal and external iliac arteries. Branches a) The external iliac artery (Discussed below). b) The internal iliac artery (Refer to vasculature of the pelvis).

The Inferior Vena Cava Origin • The i nferior vena cava is formed by the union of the common iliac veins. • This union lies about 2,5 cm to the right of the midline in the intertubercular plane (L5). Course • The inferior vena cava ascends on the right of the aorta lying on the psoas major muscle. • It pierces the diaphragm at the vena caval foramen located at the level of TB. • It enters the fibrous pericardium and terminates in the right atrium of the heart. Relations Anterior (from inferior to superior) a) The superior mesenteric vessels in the root of the mesentery b) The 3rd or horizontal part of the duodenum c) The head of the pancreas with the portal vein and bile duct intervening d) The omental foramen.

Paired tributries (from inferior to superior) a) The common iliac veins b) The 3rd and 4th lumbar veins • The 1st and 2nd lumbar veins join to form the ascending lumbar vein. • This vei n drains into the azygos system of veins. c) The renal veins d) The inferior phrenic veins, inferior • The left inferior phrenic vein ends in the inferior vena cava. • The right inferior phrenic vein usually has two branches. • One branch ends in the inferior vena cava and the other ends in the left renal vein. The Common Iliac Veins Origin • Each of the common iliac veins is formed by the union of the external and internal iliac veins anterior to the sacra-iliac joint. Course • The left common iliac vein, which is the longer of the common iliac veins, ascends first medial and posterior to the right common iliac artery. • The right common iliac vein ascends first posterior and then lateral to the right common iliac artery. The External Iliac Vein Origin • The external iliac vein is the continuation of the femoral vein deep to the inguinal ligament. 113 Course • Each vein ascends medial to its artery to reach the anterior aspect of the sacro- iliac joint. • Here the vein unites with the internal iliac vein deep to the internal iliac artery to form the common iliac vein. Tributaries • These correspond to the branches of the external iliac artery. THE ABDOMEN B THE LUMBAR PLEXUS 259 • The somatic nerves of the posterior abdominal wall arise from the lumbar plexus. Structure • The lumbar plexus is formed in the substance of psoas major muscle by the ventral rami of spinal nerves L 1 t o L3 and the superior branch of L4. • The inferior branch of L4 and spi nal nerve L5 combine to form the lumbosacral trunk. • This trunk descends medial to psoas major muscle to join the sacral plexus. • The roots of the lumbar plexus split into anterior and posterior divisions. Branches • The branches of the lumbar plexus may arise from either the anterior or the posterior divisions. Branches of the Anterior Divisions a) lliohypogastric & ilioinguinal nerves • These nerves arise from the anterior division of L 1 . • They both emerge from the lateral border of the psoas major muscle. • The ilioinguinal nerve runs parallel but inferior to the iliohypogastric nerve. • Both nerves first pierce the transversus abdominis muscle to lie in the neurovascular plane of the abdomen and then pierce the internal oblique muscle. • The ilioinguinal nerve emerges from the superficial inguinal ring to supply the ski n of the groin and scrotum (in the male) and labi a majora (in the female). • The iliohypogastric nerve pierces the external oblique muscle to supply the skin of the gluteal region. b) Genitofemoral nerve • The genitofemoral nerve arises from the anterior divisions of L 1 and L2. • This nerve emerges from the anterior aspect of the psoas major muscle at the level of L3. • It runs towards the femoral point where it divides into a genital and femoral branch. i) Genital branch • This runs with the spermatic cord (in the male) or round ligament of the uterus (in the female) through the inguinal canal. • In the male it supplies the cremaster muscle and the skin of the scrotum. • In the female it supplies the skin of the mans pubis and the labia majora. 114 ii) Femoral branch • This nerve runs with the femoral artery to supply the skin overlying the femoral triangle. c) Obturator nerve • This nerve arises from the anterior divisions of L2 to L4. • This nerve emerges from the medial border of the psoas major muscle and runs along the side wall of the pelvis towards the obturator foramen. • It leaves the pelvis via the obturator foramen to supply the adductor muscles of the thigh. Branches of the Posterior Divisions a) Accessory obturator nerve • This nerve arises from the posterior divisions of L3 and L4. • This ~erve, which is present in only about 30% of people, runs along the medial border of the psoas major muscle. • When present it gives a branch to the hip-joint and then innervates the pectineus muscle. • As the nerve is formed by posterior divisions of rcrni. it is accessory to the femoral nerve rather than to the obturator nerve. b) Femoral nerve • This nerve arises from the posterior divisions of L2 to L4. • This nerve emerges from the lateral border of the psoas major muscle. • It passes with the tendon of this muscle posterior to the inguinal ligament to supply the extensor muscles of the thigh. c) Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh • This nerve arises from the posterior divisions of L2 to L3 • This nerve emerges from the lateral border of the psoas major muscle. • It passes posterior to the inguinal ligament near its attachment to the anterior superior iliac spine to supply the skin on the lateral side of the thigh.

The Lymph Nodes of the Abdomen Cont ..... THE ABDOMEN D THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM OF THE ABDOMEN 258 Introduction • The lymphatic system of the abdomen consists of lymph nodes and lymph vessels (just like anywhere else in the body). • There are three main groups of nodes in the abdomen: a) The coeliac nodes • The coeliac nodes drain lymph from the stomach, the liver, the pancreas and the spleen. • It also receives lymph vessels from the inferior mesenteric nodes (see below). • The coeliac nodes drain into the cysterna chyli via the intestinal lymph trunk. b) The superior and inferior mesenteric nodes • These nodes receive lymph from the small and large intestine. • The superi or mesenteric nodes can drain into the coeliac nodes and via the into the intestinal lymph trunk into the cysterna chyli. • The inferior mesenteric nodes drain into the superior mesenteric and the coeliac nodes. The Cisterna Chyli • This is a dilated sac which is located anterior to the right side bodies of L 1,2, partly under cover of the right crus of the diaphragm, bet ween the aorta and azygos vein (it is often absent). • Its tributries are: a) Two lumbar lymph trunks • Which drain lymph from the lower limbs and pelvic and abdominal walls. • They also drain lymph from the viscera of the abdomen and pelvis, but not from the digestive organs and spleen. b) One or two intestinal trunks • Whi ch drain lymph from the digestive organs and the spleen via the mesenteric and coeliac nodes. c) Two descending intercostal lymph trunks • They traverse the aortic hiatus to enter the upper end of cisterna chyli. • The cisterna chyli drains via the thoracic duct into the left subclavian vein. 118 7 THE ANS IN THE ABDOMEN • The innervation of all the structures in the abdominal cavity is discussed below as a group because it is easier to understand and remember the nerves this way. • All the structures in the abdomen are innervated by the autonomic nervous system. • This includes the vi sceral peritoneum. • The parietal peri toneum is innervated by somatic nerves. A Sympathetic Nervous System in the Abdomen 259 The Lumbar Sympathetic Trunk General features • The lumbar sympathetic t runk usually consists of four lumbar ganglia. • The trunk is retroperitoneal. • Superiorly it is continuous with the thoracic sympathetic trunk, which passes posterior to the medial arcuate ligament. • Inferi orly the lumbar sympathetic trunk passes posterior to the common iliac artery to become continuous with the pelvic sympathetic trunk. Branches • The following branches are given off: a) White rami communicates b) Grey rami communicantes pass from all the lumbar sympathetic ganglia to spinal nerves L 1 to L5. c) Four lumbar splanchnic nerves join the coeliac, intermesenteric (aortic) and superior hypogastric plexuses. d) Vascular branches from all the lumbar ganglia join the intermesenteric (aortic) plexus. B The Parasympathetic Nervous System in the Abdomen The Cranial Division Origin • The fibers from the left and right vagus nerves traverse the oesophageal hiatus as the anterior and posterior vagal trunks. Anterior Vagal Trunk • The fibers from the anterior vagal trunk are mainly derived from the left vagus nerve. • The branches of the anterior vagal trunk are: a) Anterior gastric branches. THE ABDOMEN b) Hepatic branches. PoderiorVagalhunk • The fibers of the posterior vagal trunk are mainly derived from the right vagus nerve. • The branches of the posterior vagal trunk are: a) Posterior gastric branches. b) Coeliac branches. c) Renal branches. Function • The vagal trunks indirectly supply parasympathetic innervation to the foregut and midgut as far as distal as the junction between the middle and distal third of the transverse colon. The Sacral Division Origin • The pelvic splanchnic nerves arise from S2,3,4. • Some fibers are distributed in a retroperitoneal fashion to the parts of midgut and hindgut. • Other fibers join the hypogastric plexus and are distributed to the abdominal and pelvic viscera. • Function • The pelvic splanchnic nerves supply parasympathetic innervation to the GIT from the distal third of the transverse colon to the pectinate line of the anal canal. • In addition the urinary bladder and the genital viscera are also supplied with parasympathetic innervation by the pelvic splanchnic nerves. C The Abdominal Autonomic Nerve Plexuses • The major abdominal autonomic nerve plexuses are: a) The coeliac plexus. b) The hypogastric plexuses. The Coeliac Plexus Features • It is the largest A NS plexus and is located at the level of Tl 2/L 1 . • It consists of two large, coeliac ganglia located on either side of the coeliac artery. • These ganglia are connected across the midline. Roots • The coeliac plexus contain sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. • It receives its sympathetic fibers from the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves. • It receives its parasympathetic fibers from a branch of the posterior vagal trunk. 119 Distribution • Numerous secondary plexuses arise from or are connected to the coeliac plexus. • These plexuses include the phrenic, splenic, hepatic, intermesenteric (aortic), suprarenal, renal, testicular or ovarian, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric plexuses. • Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers are distributed from the coeliac plexus to the foregut and midgut and their derivati ves via the respective secondary plexus. The Hypogastric Plexus • There is a superior and an inferior hypogastric plexus. Superior hypogastric plexus Features • It is located anterior to the sacral promontory. Roots • It is a mixed plexus. • It receives fibers from the intermesenteric (aortic) plexus and branches from the lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic trunk on each side. Distribution • This plexus divides to form the left and right hypogastric nerves, which pass inferiorly to form the inferior hypogastric plexus. Inferior hypogastric plexus Features • It is located on either side of the rectum. Roots • In addition to the left and right hypogastric nerves it receives fibers from the sacral sympathetic trunk and branches from the pelvic splanchnic nerves. Distribution • This plexus supplies the bladder, the rectum as well as the internal and external genitalia. • It is distributed along the branches of the internal iliac artery. THE ABDOMEN 8 THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT A VESSELS OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT 256,290-298 • The vessels that are discussed in this section are the coeliac artery (there is no coeliac vein), the superior mesenteric artery and vein, and the inferior mesenteric artery and vein. Introduction • In the embryo the gut can be divided into three regions: the foregut, the mi dgut and the hindgut; each supplied by a different artery. • The structures which are derived from each of these regions share its blood supply. • As can be seen in the table below, the duodenum is derived partly from the foregut and partly from the midgut. • It thus receives its arterial supply from both the coeliac and the superior mesenteric arteries. • Similarly the transverse colon, having developed partly from the midgut and partly from the hindgut, receives its arterial supply partly from the superior mesenteric artery and partly from the inferior mesenteric artery. B The Coeliac Artery Origin & Course • The coeliac artery, the first unpaired artery of the aorta, arises at about the level of Tl 2. • It runs anteriorly, and divides aft er a very short course into its three terminal branches. • The coeliac artery is the artery of the foregut, and thus the names of its branches reflect the structures which developed from the foregut. Branches • The branches of the coeliac artery are the left gastric artery, the common hepatic artery and the splenic artery. a) Left gastric artery • This artery runs in the lesser omentum forwards, superiorly and to the left towards the cardiac orifice of the stomach. • It gives off oesophageal branches before descending along the lesser curvature of the stomach. • Here it anastomoses wit h the right gastric artery. • It supplies: i) The cardiac part of the stomach ii) The lesser curvature of the stomach 120 b) Common hepatic artery • This artery runs to the right along the superior border of the pancreas. • It crosses anterior to the inferior vena cava and then divides into its terminal branches: i) The right gastric artery which ascends along the lesser curvature of the stomach. ii) The gastroduodenal artery which passes posteri or to the superior duodennum and then divides into: • The right gastro-omentalArteries; • The superior pancreaticoduodenal iii) The hepatic artery proper which runs in the lesser omentum and gives rise to the left and right hepatic arteries. c) Splenic artery • This runs to the left along the superior border of the pancreas. • It then enters the splenorenal ligament and reaches the hilum of the spleen. • The branches of this artery are: i) Pancreatic branches to the pancreas. ii) Short gastric branches to the fundus of the stomach. iii) The left gastro-omental artery which reaches the stomach via the gastrosplenic ligament. • Although the splenic artery is a branch of the foregut artery, the spleen is not a derivative of the foregut THE ABDOMEN Superior Mesenteric Vessels The Superior Mesenteric Artery Origin • The j ejunum and ileum are derivatives of the midgut and are thus supplied by the superior mesenteric artery. • This artery arises from the aorta at the level of L 1 just below the origin of the coeliac trunk. Course & relations • At first it lies posterior to the head of the pancreas and splenic vein, but then passes anterior to the left renal vein, the uncinate process of the pancreas, and the horizontal part of the duodenum to enter the root of the mesentery. • In the mesentery it runs towards the right iliac flank where it anastomoses with its own iliocolic branch. Branches • The only branches given off on the left side of the superior mesenteric artery are: a) The jejuna! and the ileal arteries. • These arteries branch to form arterial arcades in the mesentry • Vasa recto or straight arteries arise from the arterial arcades and run to the walls of the jejnum and ileum • The branches that arise from the right side of the artery are (from superior to inferior): a) Inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery • It gives rise to anterior and posterior branches which anastomose with the corresponding branches of the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. b) Middle colic artery • This artery enters the root of the transverse mesocolon and descends to reach the upper border of the transverse colon. • Here it divides into left and right branches. • The right branch anastomoses with the ascending branch of the right colic artery. • The left branch anastomoses with the ascending branch of the left colic artery (branch of the inferior mesenteric artery). c) Right colic artery • This runs to the ascending colon proper and then divides into ascending and descending branches. • The ascending branch anastomoses with the right branch of the middle colic artery. • The descending branch anastomoses with the ascending branch of the 121 iliocolic artery. d) lleocolic artery • This artery runs towards the ileocolic junction and then divides into ascending and descending branches. • The ascending branch anastomoses with the descending branch of the right colic artery. • The descending branch divides at the superior border of the iliocaecal junction into an ascending colic branch, anterior and posterior caecal branches, an appendicular branch and an ileal branch. • The ileal branch anastomoses with the terminal part of the superior mesenteric artery. The Superior Mesenteric Vein Origin • The venous drainage of the small instestine is by the superior mesenteric vein. • The superior mesenteric vein is formed in the right iliac fossa by the union of the veins from the ileum, appendix and caecum. Course & relations • It runs in the mesentery of the small intestine, lying to the right of the superior mesenteric artery, and then passes over the horizontal part of the duodenum and the uncinate process of the pancreas. • It passes posterior to the neck of the pancreas where it joins the splenic vein to form the portal vein. Tributaries • The tributaries of the superior mesenteric vein are: • The right gastro-omental vein. • The pancreatic and pancreaticoduodenal veins. • Venae comitans of the jejuna!, lleol. middle and right colic arteries. THE ABDOMEN Inferior Mesenteric Vessels The Inferior Mesenteric Artery Origin • The inferior mesenteric artery arises from the anterior aspect of the abdominal aorta distal to the gonadal arteries, in the subcostal plane (L3). Course • This artery passes from its orgin, posterior to the third (horizontal) part of the duodenum and descends obliquely to reach the middle of the left common iliac artery. Branches • All the branches of the inferior mesenteric artery arise from its left side. • From superior to inferior they are the left colic artery, the sigmoid arteries and the superior rectal artery. a) Left colic artery • This runs to the left crossing anterior to the left psoas major, the l eft ureter and the left gonadal vessels. • When it reaches the descending colon it divides into ascending and descending branches. • The ascending branch anastomoses with the left branch of the middle colic artery. • The descending branch anastomoses with the ascending branch of the first sigmoid artery. b) Sigmoid arteries • Two or three sigmoid arteries arise from the inferior mesenteric artery and run obliquely to the left, each dividing into ascending and descending branches. • The ascending branch of the first sigmoid artery anastomoses with the descending branch of the left colic artery. c) Superior rectal artery • The superior rectal artery is the continuation of the inferior mesenteric artery below the middle of the left common iliac artery. • It enters and descends in the sigmoid mesocolon. • At the level of the L5 vertebra it divides into left and right branches which descend on either side of the rectum. • These branches communicate with the middle rectal artery (branch of the internal iliac artery) and the inferior rectal artery (branch of the internal pudenda! artery). 122 The Inferior Mesenteric Vein Origin • The inferior mesenteric vein is the continuation of the superior rectal vein over the left common iliac artery. Course & relations • At the common iliac artery the inferior mesenteric vein lies between the inferior mesenteric artery medially and the left ureter laterally. The vein ascends to the left of the duodenojejunal flexure . In its course it crosses anterior to the following structures (from inferior to superior): a) The left ureter. b) The left gonadal vessels. c) The left colic artery. The vein terminates posterior to the body of the pancreas by draining into the splenic vein. • • • Tributaries • The tributaries of the inferior mesenteric vein correspond to the branches of the inferior mesenteric artery. Marginal artery • The marginal artery is formed by the anastomoses of the branches of the left colic artery and the sigmoid arteries. • It is continuous proximally with a similar structure formed by the branches of the superior mesenteric artery. • The marginal artery lies in the mesentery close to the border of the large intestine. • The entire structure thus extends from the iliocaecal valve to the rectosigmoid junction. Clinical: • Superior Mesenteric Artery syndrome: by reducing the lumen of this vein as it is ~andwiched between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery it causes increased pressure in the left renal vein and potentially renal disease. THE ABDOMEN B THE STOMACH 264-269 • It is situated in the left hypochondriac and epigastric regions of the abdomen. • It has a greater and a lesser curvatures and tan anterior and a posterior surface. Structure • The stomach is the expanded part of the alimentary canal located between the oesophagus and the small intestine Curvatures of the Stomach • The greater curvature is the convex, left margin of the stomach. • It is attached, from superior to inferior, to: a) The diaphragm via the gastrophrenic ligament. b) The spleen via the gastrosplenic ligament. c) The transverse colon via the gastrocolic ligament. • The lesser curvature is the concave, right margin of the stomach. • It is connected to the liver via the hepatogastric ligament, which is a part of the lesser omentum. Surfaces of the Stomach • The stomach is completely covered with peritoneum except: a) Along the greater and lesser curvatures where the greater and lesser omenta are attached respectively. b) A bare area behind the cardia where the stomach lies on the diaphragm. • The stomach has two surfaces. a) The Anterior surface • This surface is directed anterosuperiorly. • The peritoneum on the anterior surface is in contact, from superior to inferior, with: i) The visceral surface of the left lobe of the liver. ii) The diaphragm. iii) The anterior abdominal wall. b) The Posterior surface • This surface is directed postero-inferiorly. • It faces the so-called stomach bed which is made up, from superior to inferior, by: i) The left dome of the diaphragm. ii) The spleen. iii) The left suprarenal gland and the kidney. iv) The body and tail of the pancreas. v) The transverse mesocolon and the transverse colon. Divisions of the Stomach 123 • The oesophagus enters the stomach at the cardiac opening which lies at the junction of the greater and the lesser curvatures. The cardiac notch is the deep incisure between the oesophagus and the fundus of the stomach. The stomach may be divided into four regions namely the cardia, fundus, the body or corpus and the pylorus. a) The cardia • This is the region surrounding the cordial orifice. • • b) The fund us • This is the region of the stomach that lies superior to a horizontal line passing through the cardiac orifice. • The fundus often contains air which makes it an important landmark on X-rays. • The superior part reaches the level of the 5th intercostal space c) The Body • The body or corpus lie between the fundus and pylorus d) The pylorus • This lies about 2 cm to the right of the midline in the transpyloric plane. • The pylorus may be subdivided into: i) The pyloric antrum • This begins as a slight dilatation which produces the angular notch on the lesser curvature. ii) The pyloric canal • This inclines upwards, backwards and to the right. • The pyloric antrum and the pyloric canal are separated by a slight constriction called the sulcus intermedi us. iii) The pyloric sphincter • This is a thick muscular ring. • Controls the movement of chyme through the pyloric orifice into the duodenum Relations: Anterior: a) Diaphragm b) Left lobe of the liver c) Anterior abdominal wall Posterior: a) Omental bursa b) Pancreas Peritoneal Relations • The stomach is completely covered with peritoneum except: a) Along the greater and lesser curvatures where the greater and lesser omenta are attached respectively. THE ABDOMEN b) A bare area behind the cardia where the stomach lies on the diaphragm. Vasculature Arterial supply • Each curvature of the stomach has two arteries running along it. • They anastomose where they meet along the curvature. • The arteries that supply the stomach need to pass from their origin behind the lesser sac to their distribution in front of it. • In doing this they raise the left and right sickle-shaped gastropancreatic folds. • These folds constrict the lesser sac into a superior recess and an inferior recess. • The superior recess lies posterior to the liver and the inferior recess lies posterior to the stomach and greater omentum. • The folds are: a) The left gastropancreatic fold • This fold is raised by the left gastric artery and extends from the pancreas to the cardiac end of the lesser curvature of the stomach. b) The right gastropancreatic fold • This fold is raised by the common hepatic artery and extends from the pancreas to the pyloric region of the stomach. • It lies very close to the free margin of the lesser omentum so that the hepatic artery can pass into the lesser omentum from this fold. Arteries of the lesser curvature • The arteries which run along the lesser curvature are the left gastric artery, left(from the coeliac artery) and right gastric artery (from the common hepatic artery). • They anastomose at the angular notch to form an arterial arcade (arch). • From this arterial arcade branches are given off to the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach. • It is common for the left and right gastric arteries to be double trunks. Arteries of the greater curvature • The arteries which run along the greater curvature are the left gastro-omental artery (from the splenic artery) and right gastro-omental (from the gastroduodenal artery). • They anastomose to form an arterial arcade, similar to the one found on the lesser curvature. • From this arterial arcade branches are given off to the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach, as well as to the greater omentum. • In addition to the above arterial supply, the splenic artery gives off short gastric arteries which supply the greater curvature in the region of the fundus. Venous Drainage • The left and right gastric veins drain into the portal vein. 124 • The left gastro-omental vein drains into the splenic vein. • The right gastro-omental Vein drains into the superior mesenteric vein. THE ABDOMEN C THE SMALL INTESTINE 261-263,270-272 Overview • The small intestine consists of three ports: a) The duoden um • The duodenum is the first port of the small intestine and extends from the pylorus for about 25 cm. • It is C- shaped and it wraps around the head and neck of the pancreas to become continuous with the jejunum. b) The jejunum and the ileum • The jejunum and ileum constitute the second and third ports of the small intestine. • Together they are about 6 to 7m in length. • The coils of the jejunum and ileum lie in the infracolic compartment and they ore covered to a varying degree by the apron-like greater omentum. The Duodenum Divisions • The duodenum is divided into four ports aptly named the first, second, third and fourth parts of the duodenum. First/ Superior Part • The first (or superior) part of the duodenum lies anterolateral to the body of L 1 . • From the pylorus of the stomach it runs to the right, and slightly posterosuperiorly towards the area just above the hilus of the right kidney. • The proximal half of this port of the duodenum has a mesentery and i s mobile. • The hepatoduodenal ligament (port of the lesser omentum) and the greater omentum ore also attached to it. • The distal half is retroperitoneal and fixed to the posterior abdominal wall.

Inferior: a) The bifurcation of the gastroduodenal artery b) The head of the pancreas. 125 Superior: a) The neck of the gallbladder, b) Hepatic artery. Second/ Descending Part • descends on the right of the bodies of L 1, L2 and L3. • It has no mesentery and is retroperitoneal. • The bile duct and the main pancreatic duct unite to form the hepatopancreatic Ampulla (of Voter) • The ampulla of Voter opens on the summit of the greater duodenal papilla, about 1 Ocm distal to the pylorus, and is guarded by a sphincter regulating the flow of bile and pancreatic juices into the duodenum. • The accessory pancreatic duct also opens into this part of the duodenum on the summit of the lesser duodenal papilla. • This papilla is located anterosuperior to the greater papilla. Relations Anterior: a) (superior to inferior) The right l obe of the liver, b) the body of the gallbladder, c) the transverse colon d) some coils of the small intestine. Posterior: a) The hilus of the right kidney b) The right ureter and renal vessels. Medially: a) The head of the pancreas b) the pancreatic ducts c) the bile duct d) anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. Third/ Horizontal Part • The third (or horizontal) part of the duodenum runs from right to left at the level of the body of L3. • This part, like the second part, is retroperitoneal. Relations Anterior: a) The coils of the small intestine b) The superior mesenteric artery. Posterior: (right to left) a) Right psoas major b) The inferior vena cava c) The abdominal aorta d) The origin of the inferior mesenteric artery.

THE ABDOMEN 126 d) Fourth I Ascending Part The Jejunum and the Ileum • The fourth (or ascending) part of the duodenum ascends on the left side of the aorta to reach the body of the pancreas at the level of L2. Macroscopic Differences Between the Jejunum and the Ileum • Here it turns forwards forming the duodenojejunal flexure which is supported by a fibromuscular band, the suspensory muscle of the duodenum (ligament of Treitz). The suspensory muscle of the duodenum Superior attachments: The right crus of the diaphragm and the connective t issue around the coeliac trunk. Inferior attachments: The third and fourth parts of the duodenum and the duodenaljejunal flexure. Actions: Supports the duodenojejunal flexure. Innervation: The phrenic nerves and fibers from the coeliac and super ior mesenteric plexuses. Relations Anterior: a) The origin of the root of the mesentery. Posterior: a) The left margin of the aorta and the left psoas major. Medially: a) The head of the pancreas. Superior: a) The body of the pancreas. Vasculature Arterial supply • The duodenum lies at the junction between the foregut and the midgut and is thus supplied by branches of both foregut and midgut arteries. • The branch of the foregut artery supplying the duodenum is the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery (a branch of the gastroduodenal artery). • The branch of the midgut artery supplying the duodenum is the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery (a branch of the superior mesenteric artery). • Both the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries divide into anterior and posterior branches. • These branches pass anterior and posterior to the head of the pancreas respectively, where they anastomose with the corresponding branch of the other artery. Venous drainage • The pancreaticoduodenal veins drain into the portal vein.

Lobulation of the Liver • The liver may be divided into lobes on either an anatomical basis (as defined by the fissures) or a functional basis. Anatomical Lobulation • Anatomically, the liver can be divided into the right lobe, the quadrate lobe, the caudate lobe and the left lobe. THE ABDOMEN a) Right lobe • This is the largest of the lobes. • On the visceral surface it lies to the right of the fossae for the inferior vena cava superiorly, and the gall bladder inferiorly. • On the diaphragmatic surface it lies to the right of the imaginary line running from the inferior vena cava to the fundus of the gallbladder. b) Quadrate lobe • On the visceral surface it is bounded anteriorly by the inferior border of the liver and posteriorly by the porta hepatis. • On the left it is demarcated by the fissure for ligamentum teres and on the right by the gallbladder fossa. c) Caudate lobe • This lobe is bounded superiorly by the transverse part of the fissure for ligamentum venosum and inferiorly by the porta hepatis. • On the visceral surface it is bounded on the left by the fissure for ligamentum venosum and on the right by the fossa for the inferior vena cava. • The caudate lobe has a tail- like caudate process that projects to the right, separating the inferior vena cava from the portal vein. d) Left lobe • This is the second largest of the lobes. • On the visceral surface it is separated from the caudate and quadrate lobes on the right by the fissure for ligamentum venosum and the fissure for ligamentum teres respectively. • On the diaphragmatic surface it lies to the left of the falciform ligament. Functional Lobulation • Functionally the liver is di vided into a left and a right lobe. • These two lobes have their own vascular supply and billiard drainage. • The quadrate lobe is functionally part of the left lobe as it receives blood from the left hepatic artery and drains into the left hepatic duct. • The caudate lobe is functionally part of both the left and right lobes as it receives blood from both branches of the hepatic artery and drains into both hepatic ducts. Peritoneal Relations of the Liver • The peritoneal relations of the liver include the lesser omentum, the falciform ligament, and the coronary ligament. a) Lesser omentum • The lesser omentum is a bilaminar peritoneal ligament that runs between the porta hepatis and the fissure for ligamentum venosum of the liver, and the lesser curvature of the stomach and the proximal part of the superior duodenum. • It can therefore be divided into the hepatogastric ligament and the hepatoduodenal ligament. 131 • The two layers of the free edge of the lesser omentum enclose the proper hepatic artery, the portal vein and the bile duct. b) Falciform ligament • The falciform ligament connects the liver with the anterior abdominal wall and the diaphragm. • In its free edge it contains the ligamentum teres which is the remnant of the embryonic left umbilical vein. • The ligamentum teres is surrounded by a few paraumbi lical veins which connect the veins of the anterior abdominal wall with the portal vein. c) Coronary ligament • The liver is almost entirely covered by peritoneum, except postero- superiorly where the peritoneum reflects off the liver onto the inferior surface of the diaphragm. • The peritoneum which reflects off the liver onto the diaphragm forms the coronary ligament. • The coronary ligament consists of an anterior leaf and a posterior leaf, which bound an area of the liver devoid of peritoneum, called the bare area of the liver (this lies mainly on the right lobe). • On the left and right the anterior and the posterior leaves of the coronary ligament meet to form the left and right trian gular ligaments respectively. Vasculature of the Liver Blood supply • The liver has a double blood supply via the hepatic artery and the portal vein. a) Hepatic artery • The liver is a derivative of the foregut and is thus supplied by the coeliac artery. • The hepatic artery is the continuation of the common hepatic artery after the gastroduodenal artery has been given off. • It ascends in the free edge of the lesser omentum to the porta hepatis where it divides into a left and a right branch. • The right hepatic artery supplies the right lobe and the right half of the caudate lobe. • The left hepatic artery supplies the left lobe, the quadrate lobe and the left half of the caudate lobe. b) Portal vein • A portal system is one which starts and ends i n a capillary bed. • The hepatic portal system starts as a capillary bed in the gut and its derivatives, and ends in a capillary bed in the liver. • The portal vein is formed posterior to the neck of the pancreas by the union of the splenic vein and the superior mesenteric vein. • It then ascends anterior to the vena cava and posterior to the first part THE ABDOMEN of the duodenum to enter the free edge of the lesser omentum. • Here it lies anterior to the omental foramen and posterior to the hepatic artery and bile duct. • At the port a hepatis it divides into left and right branches. • The left branch supplies the left lobe, the quadrate lobe and the left half of the caudate lobe. • The right branch supplies the right lobe and the right half of the caudate lobe. • There are two distinct streams of blood in the portal vein: i) A left stream mainly from the spleen, large intestine and stomach which passes to the left branch of the portal vein. ii) A right stream mainly from the small intestine and stomach which passes to the right branch of the portal vein. • The tributaries of the portal vein are: i) The splenic and superior mesenteric veins which form the portal vein. ii) The left and right gastric veins. iii) The para-umbilical veins. iv) The cystic vein (which drains into the right branch of the portal vein). Venous Drainage • Blood, which is delivered to the hepatic sinusoids by the hepatic artery and portal vein, drains into a central vein. • These central veins give rise to superior and inferior groups of hepatic veins which drain into the inferior vena cav a. 132 Portacaval Anastomoses • The hepatic portal system communicates with the systemic venous system at portacaval anastomoses. • As the hepatic portal system has no valves, blood can be shunted via these anastomotic connections into the systemic circulation when the hepatic circulation is obstructed. • The main sites of portacaval anstamoses are presented in the table below. SITE Veins which Veins which drain into the drain into portal venous systemic venous system system Lower Oesophageal Oesophageal Oesophagus veins drain into veins which drain the left gastric into the azygos vein system Anorectal region Superior rectal Middle and vein which inferior rectal continues as the veins which drain inferior into the Inferior mesenteric vein vena cava. Para umbilical Paraumbilical Superficial region veins of the epigastric veins anterior abdominal wall Retroperitoneal Twigs of colic Retroperitoneal reoion veins vein Spleen Splenic and The left renal vein pancreatic veins Clinical: • Liver Abcess: In tropical countries these are often large and due to amoebic disease • Liver Biopsy: Tissue samples can be obtained using a needle passed through the ninth or tenth right intercostal space in the axillary line during full expiration to reduce the size of the costodiaphragmatic recess and the risk of pneumothorax. • Portosystemic anastomosis: Connections bet ween the portal venous and systemic venous systems which become important when the portal vein is blocked.

Course & relations • The right renal artery passes horizontally lying posterior to the inferior vena cava and then the right splenic vein to reach the right kidney. • The left renal artery passes horizontally posterior to the splenic vein to reach the left kidney. Branches • Each renal artery gives off the following branches: a} An inferior suprarenal artery. b} A few ureteric branches. c} Terminal renal branches which enter the hilus of the kidney. Accessory renal arteries • One or more accessory renal arteries may contribute to the arterial supply of the kidneys. • These arteries are more common on the left and usually enter the substance of the kidney at one of the poles. THE ABDOMEN Renal veins Origin • Several veins drain the substance of the kidney. • These veins unite to form the renal vein on each side. Course & relations • The right renal vein runs to the left, posterior to the second (descending) part of the duodenum. • It receives no tributaries. • The left renal vein, which is larger than the right renal vein, runs to the right across the midline of the body. • In its course it lies anterior to the left renal artery and posterior to the splenic vein and the body of the pancreas. • It crosses the abdominal aorta to join the inferi or vena cava. • It receives the following tributaries: a) The suprarenal vein. b) The left inferior phrenic vein. c) The left gonadal vein. Clinical: • Nephrectomy: The surgical removal of a kidney. • Peritoneal dialysis: The peritoneum can be used for dialysis in renal disease. Fluid is introduced into the peritoneal cavity, and then withdrawn, removing it with most circulating toxins. • Ureteric calculi: Stones within the ureter descend from the kidney towards the bladder and may lodge at the pelvi-ureteric junction or the entrance to the bladder where the ureter traverses the bladder wall, causing excruciating pain. 138 B The Ureters 327-330 • The ureters are fibromuscular urinary conduits that extend on either side from the renal pelvis superiorly to the bladder inferiorly. • The ureters consist of an upper half (abdominal section) and a lower half (pelvic section). The Abdominal Ureter Course • It descends from the respective renal pelvis passing vertically anterior to the corresponding psoas major muscle, in line with the tips of the lumbar processes. • I t enters the pelvis by crossing the bifurcation of the common iliac artery at the pelvic brim. Relations Anteri or: a) left and right ureters • The genitofemoral nerve. b) right ureter • The descending or second part of the duodednum, • the root of the mesentery, the terminal ileum.

INTRODUCTION 340-342 • The pelvis is formed by the hip (pelvic) bones, the sacrum and the coccyx. It is arbitrarily divided into the major pelvis and the minor pelvis by the pelvic brim. The cavity of the major pelvis is demarcated from the abdominal cavity by the pelvic inlet. The minor pelvis is separated from the perineum by the pelvic outlet. The perineum is the region between the pubic symphysis anteriorly and the coccyx posteriorly. It contains the anus and the external genitalia. A The Bony Pelvis 341-342 • The bony pelvis is formed by the hip (pelvic) bones, the sacrum and the coccyx. • The bony pelvis can be divi ded into the major or false pelvis and the minor or true pelvis. • These two parts are separated by the pelvic brim which is comprised of, from anterior to posterior: a) The pubic symphysis. b) The pubic crest. c) The arcuate line of the ilium. d) The anterior edge of the ala of the sacrum (the arcuate line of the sacrum). e) The promontory of the sacrum. f) In the erect position the pelvic brim is inclined at 60° to the horizontal plane. * B The Major Pelvis (FaJse ·-p eJ~·1 s) 341-342 • This is located above the pelvic brim. • The walls of the major pelvis are formed: a) Anteriorly by the anterior abdominal muscles. b) Posteriorly by the lumbar vertebrae L3,4,5. c) Laterally by the aloe of the iliac bones. d) Superiorly by the iliac crests. e) Inferiorly by the pelvic brim. * C The Minor Pelvis (Tr ue Pe.Jut~· ) 341-342 • This is located below the pelvic brim. • The anteri or wall of the minor pelvis is formed by: a) The pubic symphysis and fibrocartilagenous di sc between the articul ating surfaces. b) The bodies, and superior and inferior rami of the pubic bone. 141 c) The obturator intern us muscle (discussed with the muscles of the lower limb). • The lateral wall of the minor pelvis is formed by obturator internus muscle. • The floor of the minor pelvis is formed by the pelvic diaphragm posteriorly and the urogenital diaphragm anteriorly, together closing the pelvic outlet. • The posterior wall of the minor pelvis is formed by: a) The sacrum, sacro-iliac joint and adjacent parts of the ilium. b) Piriformis muscle. • This is a pear-shaped muscle. • The proximal attachment of the muscle is the pelvic margin of S2,3,4, ; the superior margin of the greater sciatic notch and the sacrotuberous ligament. • Its tendon leaves the pelvis via the greater sciatic notch to attach to the greater trochanter of the femur. • The actions of the muscle are to rotate the thigh laterally, abduct the thigh, and keep the head of the femur in the acetabulum. • The muscle is innervated by nerve to piriformis (S 1,2). • The pelvic outlet is formed from anterior to posterior by: a) The pubic symphysis b) The inferior pubic rami. c) The ischial rami and tuberosities. d) The sacrotuberous ligament. e) The coccyx. • The floor of the minor pelvis is pierced from anterior to posterior by: a) The urethra. b) The vagina in the female. c) The anal canal. D The Pelvic Fascia 351 Visceral pelvic fascia • The pelvic viscera are enveloped in loose connective tissue called the visceral pelvic fascia • This fascia contains smooth muscle, which helps support the pelvic floor • Parts of this fascia may be thickened to form ligaments which provide support of the viscera e.g. the uterosacral ligament provides support for the uterus • In surgery or dissection,' potential spaces' can be found where the fascia easily gives way to pressure. E.g. the retropubic and ret rorectal spaces • These spaces consist of fascia of the loose connective tissue type to accommodate expansion of organs such as the urinary bladder and rectal ampulla PEL VIS AND PERINEUM The parietal pelvic fascia • The visceral pelvic fascia reflects onto the walls of the pelvis to form the parietal pelvic fascia • Superiorly the parietal pelvic fascia is continuous with the transversalis fascia of the abdominal cavity in the regions of the iliac crest • It is, like the transversalis fascia, separated from the peritoneum by extraperitoneal fat • The parietal fascia over the obturator internus muscle is called the obturator fascia • The obturator fascia gives rise to a tendinous arch, which extends from the ischial spine to the pubis, to which the iliococcygeal part of levator ani is attached • The part of the obturator fascia above the arch lines the pelvic cavity • The part of the obturator fascia below the arch lines the perinea! cavity and forms the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossa and the medial wall of the pudenda! canal • The part of the obturator fascia lining the perinea! cavity splits to form he pudenda! canal in which the in t ernal pudenda! artery and vein and the pudenda! nerve run E The Pelvic Peritoneum 350,354 Reflections of the Pelvic Peritoneum • The reflections of the pelvi c peritoneum will be discussed in more detail in the specific organs covered by it. t Pouches formed by reflections of peritoneum include: • In males: the peritoneum reflects from the posterior edge of the urinary bladder anteriorly, over the ductus deferens and superior ends of the seminot vesicles onto the middle 1 /3 of the rectum forming the floor of the rectovesical pouch. • In females: the peritoneum reflects from the superior surface of the urinary bladder onto the uterus forming the vesicouterine pouch. Peritoneum reflects from the uterus, posterior fornix and vagina onto the rectum forming the recto-uterine pouch. • In both males and females the lateral reflections of the peritoneum from the superior 1 ;3rd of the rectum shaping the pararectal fossae. These allow the rectum to distend as it fills up with faeces. • As these pouches are the most inferior of the peritoneal cavity, fluid may collect here. 142 2. THE PELVIC FLOOR • The pelvic floor separates the pelvic cavity from the perineum. Anteriorly, it is formed by the urogenital diaphragm. The urogenital diaphragm is pierced by the urethra, the anus, and in a woman, by the vagina. Posteriorly it is formed by the pelvic diaphragm. A The Pelvic Diaphragm 343-346 • The pelvic diaphragm is a funnel-shaped muscular sheet that forms the posterior part of the pelvic floor. The diaphragm is composed of the coccygeus and levator ani muscles. Coccygeus Proximal attachment: Distal attachment Action: Innervation: The lateral margins of the coccyx and S5 vertebra. The medial surface of the ischial spine It assists levator ani in supporting the pelvic viscera. The coccygeal plexus (S4,5) Levator ani • The levator ani muscle provides a hammock-like sheet between the pubis anteriorly and the coccyx posteriorly. • Anteriorly, between the pubis and the perinea! body, there is a gap between the two levator ani muscles. • This gap is filled at a lower level by the urogenital diaphragm. • Posteriorly there is no gap as the muscle from each side joins to form the anococcygeal ligamentligaments;anococcygeal in the midline. Constituent parts Part of levator Ani Attachments Puborectalis • This arises from the pubis and passes posteriorly to meet with its partner to form a U-shaped sling around the anorectal flexure Pubovaginalis • Some of the fibres of puborectalis sweep past the (In females) prostate in males and the middle 1 /3 of the vagina Levator Prostatae in females to form this muscle (In males) • This part of the muscle inserts into the perinea! body Pubococcygeus • This is the main part of levator ani • It arises from the pubis and runs posteriorly to insert into the coccyx and the anococcygeal ligament lliococcygeus • This passes from the tendinous arch of the obturator fascia and the ischial spine of the coccyx and the anococcygeal ligament PEL VIS AND PERINEUM • Actions a) It forms part of the pelvic diaphragm, which supports the pelvic viscera and resists inferior thrusts by increased abdominal pressure. b) Contraction of the muscle raises the pelvic floor and compresses the abdominal contents thus aiding in expulsive acts eg. defaecation. c) Pubovaginalis and puborectalis provide support for the middle third of the vagina and the prostate respectively. d) Puborectalis contracts during defaecation thus raising the anal canal over the descending mass of faeces. Innervation • Perinea! branches of the pudenda! nerve and the perinea! branch of 54. B The Urogenital Diaphragm 361 /364 Location • The urogenital diaphragm is a sheet of striated muscle which runs between the two sides of the pubic arch. • It closes the gap anteriorly between the two levator ani muscles (at a lower level than levator ani), and thus forms part of the floor of the tr ue pelvis. • The urogenital diaphragm is pierced by the following structures, from posterior to anterior: a) The anal canal. b) The vagina (in the female). c) The urethra. Muscles of the Urogenital Diaphragm • The anterior and posterior fibres of the urogenital diaphragm run transversely, but the middle fibres surround the urethra. • The fibres of the diaphragm are grouped into two muscles namely the sphincter urethrae muscle and the deep transverse perinea! muscle . Muscle Proximal/Medial Attachment Sphincter Urethrae The mucle is composed of the middle circular fibres of the uroqenital diaphraqm Deep Transverse perinea!

C The Perineum 359-362(F) + 363-366(M) Definition • The term 'perineum' refers both to the shallow compartment formed inferior to the pelvic diaphragm and to an external surface area • The perineum comportment is the area between the pubic symphysis anteriorly and the coccyx posteriorly. Laterally it is limited by the ischial tuberosities and is inferior to the pelvic outlet. • In the anatomical position, the perineum is the narrow region between the proximal parts of the thighs. • Some obstetricians refer to the perineum as the area between the vagina and anus. Divisions • The perineum is divided into two triangles by a transverse line that joins the anterior edges of the ischial tuberosities: a) The urogenital triangle lies anterior to the transverse line and contains external genitalia and terminal part of the urinary passages. b) The anal triangle lies posterior to the transverse line and contains the anal canal and ischioanal fossae. • The central tendon of the perineum or the perinea! body lies at the midpoint of this line The Perineal Body • This tendinous body is produced by the convergence of levator ani (the levator prostatae or the pubovaginalis part), the transverse perinea! muscles and bulbospongiosus • The perinea! body lies posterior to the vestibule of the vagina or bulb of the penis and anterior to the anus and anal canal. • The perinea! body attaches to the posterior margin of the perinea! membrane that lies between the external genitalia and the deep perinea! pouch 144 D The Perineal Spaces (Pouches) 359-362(F) + 363-366(M) Superficial Perinea! Space This potential space lies between the membranous layer of the subcutaneous tissue and the perinea! membrane above.

PEL VIS AND PERINEUM 3 INNERVATION OF THE PELVIS The pelvis is mainly innervated by nerves of the sacral and and coccygeal plexuses as well the pelvic part of the autonomic nervous system A The Sacral Plexus 389-397 Overview • The sacral plexus lies in the minor pelvis on the piriformis muscles. • The plexus is formed by the four ventral rami of S 1 to S4 and the lumbosacral trunk (L4,5) from the lumbar plexus. • The ventral rami divide into anterior divisions which supply the flexors and adductors of the thigh and posterior divisions which supply the extensors and abductors of the thigh. • The two main branches of the plexus are the sciatic nerve, which is mainly involved in locomotion, and the pudenda! nerve, which is mainly involved in reproduction. • The sacral plexus is found on the posterior wall of the lesser pelvis on the anterior wall piriformis muscle • Most branches of the sacral plexus leave the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen Branches The sacral plexus has 12 branches. The branches may be derived from the anterior or the posterior divisions of the plexus. The sciatic nerve may be considered as two nerves (the tibial nerve and the common fibular nerve) enclosed in a common nerve sheath. The tibial nerve is derived from anterior divisions of the plexus and the common fibular nerve is derived from the posterior divisions of the plexus. Thus the sciatic nerve is derived from both anterior and posterior divisions of the plexus. Sciatic Nerve • This is the largest nerve in the body and is formed by ventral rami from L4 to S3. • The nerve leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen and emerges at the lower border of piriformis, lying deep to gluteus maximus. • This nerve can be regarded as two nerves in a common sheath, as it splits into the common fibular nerve and the tibial nerve in the thigh. • The common fibular nerve is formed by posterior divisions of L4,5,S l ,2. • The tibial nerve is formed by anterior divisions of L4,5,S l ,2,3. a) Branches of the anterior divisions The branches which arise from the anterior divisions of the plexus are the nerve to quadratus femoris, the nerve to obturator internus, the perinea! branch of S4 and the pudenda! nerve. 145 i) Nerve to quadratus femoris • This nerve arises from the anterior divisions of the ventral rami of L4,5,S 1 . • It supplies the inferior gemellus and the quadratus femoris muscles. ii) Nerve to obturator internus • This nerve arises from the anterior divisions of the ventral rami of L5,S 1,2. • It leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen medial to the sciatic nerve and then curves around the ischial spine to the superior gemellus muscle. • It then passes through the lesser sciatic foramen and supplies obturator internus muscle from below. iii) Perinea! branch of S4 branch • This arises from the anterior division of the ventral ramus of S4. • It supplies levator ani, the external anal sphincter and the skin of the perineum. iv) Pudenda! nerve • This nerve arises from the anterior divisions of the ventral rami of S2,3,4. • It is the principal sensory nerve of the external genitalia • It leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen and enters the gluteal region at the lower edge of piriformis, medial to the sciatic nerve. • Then it enters the perineum via the lesser sciatic foramen, accompanied by the internal pudenda! artery. • In the perineum it runs in the pudenda! canal. • The branches of the pudenda! nerve are the inferior rectal nerve, the perinea! nerve and the dorsal nerve of the penis/clitoris. a) The inferior rectal nerve • This nerve runs with the inferior rectal artery and supplies the skin of the anal canal and the external anal sphincter. b) The perinea/ nerve • This is the one terminal branch of the pudenda! nerve and lies below the pudenda! artery in the pudenda! canal. • It pierces the attachment of the superficial perinea! fascia. • It gives off: i. Posterior scrotal or labial branches which are both cutaneous nerves. ii. It gives off motor nerves to the muscles of the urogenital triangle. • These muscles are : the superficial and deep transverse perinea! muscles; bulbospongiosus; ischiocavernosus; sphincter urethrae; the external anal sphincter; levator ani. • In addition the nerve to bulbospongiosus supplies the urethral mucosa and the corpus spongiosum. c) The dorsal nerve of the penis or clitoris • This nerve runs in the pudenda! canal above the internal pudenda! artery as the continuation of the pudenda! nerve. PEL VIS AND PERINEUM • It pierces the deep perinea! space near the inferior pubic ramus. • It runs deep to the perinea! membrane and emerges anterior to the urogenital diaphragm. • It then passes between the layers of the suspensory ligament of the penis or clitoris to run on the dorsum of the penis or clitoris, lateral to the dorsal artery of the penis or clitoris. • In the male it supplies the corpus cavernosum penis but in the female it is insignificant. b) Branches of the posterior divisions Branches of the posterior divisions of the sacral plexus are the superior gluteal nerve, the inferior gluteal nerve, the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh, the nerve to piriformis and the perforating cutaneous nerve. i) Superior gluteal nerve • This nerve arises from the posterior divisions of the ventral rami of L4,5,S 1 . • It leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen emerging above piriformis to supply gluteus medius, gluteus minimis and tensor fascia Iota. ii) Inferior gluteal nerve • This nerve arises from the posterior divisions of the ventral rami of L5,S 1 , 2. • It leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen and supplies gluteus maximus. iii) Posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh • This is formed by the posterior divisions of the ventral rami of S 1,2 and the anterior divisions of the ventral rami of S2, 3. • It leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen posterior to the sciatic nerve. • The posterior divisions supply the skin of the buttock and the posterior region of the thigh, and the anterior divisions supply the skin of the perineum. iv) Nerve to piriformis • This is formed by the posterior divisions of ventral rami S 1 , 2 and supplies piriformis. v) Perforating cutaneous nerve • This is formed by the posterior divisions of the ventral rami of S2,3. • It passes through the sacrotuberous ligament and supplies the skin of the buttock. 146 B The Coccygeal Plexus 389-397 • This plexus of nerves formed from the ventral rami of S4 and S5 supplies mainly the coccygeus, part of levator ani and the saccrococcygeal joint C The ANS in the Pelvis 314/315 Pelvic Sympathetic Trunk General features • The pelvic sympathetic trunk consists of four to five sacral ganglia. • It is located on the anterior aspect of the sacrum medial to the anterior sacral foramina. • Superiorly it is continuous with the lumbar sympathetic trunk. • Inferiorly the two sacral sympathetic trunks converge to form the ganglion impar on the anterior aspect of the coccyx.

Parasympathetic Nervous System in the Pelvis • The parasympathetic supply of the pelvis is derived from the hypogastric plexuses (see The ANS in the Abdomen for more detail) PEL VIS AND PERINEUM 4. SUPPLY AND DRAINAGE OF THE PELVIS A The Arteries of the Pelvis • The pelvis is supplied by the following arteries: a) The ovarian artery (branch of the abdominal aorta) in the female. b) The median sacral artery (branch of the abdominal aorta). c) The superior rectal artery, the continuation of the inferior mesenteric artery. d) The internal iliac artery. The Internal Iliac Artery Origin • This is formed by the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries. Course & Relations • It runs towards the upper end of the greater sciatic foramen where it divides into anterior and posterior divisions. • Here it is crossed by the ureter and is separated from the sacro-iliac joint by the intervening internal iliac vein and lumbosacral trunk. Branches of the Anterior Division (In the order in which they usually arise) a} Umbilical Artery • It runs anteroinferiorly between the bladder and the lateral wall of the pelvis. • It gives off a number of branches before becoming cord-like to form the obliterated part of the umbilical artery.

An iliac branch which supplies the muscle attached to the iliac crest. ii. A lumbar branch • This replaces part of the 5th lumbar artery. • The lumbar branch gives off a spinal branch supplying the contents of the vertebral canal. b} Lateral Sacral Artery • These run medially crossing the emerging sacral nerves. • They give off spinal branches which supply the spinal meninges enclosing the spinal cord. • Some branches also pass through the sacral foramina to supply the muscles on the posterior aspect of the sacrum. c} Superior Gluteal Artery • This is the continuation of the posterior division of the internal iliac artery. • It leaves the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen above piriformis by passing between the lumbosacral trunk and Sl. • It supplies the gluteal muscles. 148 B The Lymphatics of the Pelvis The lymphatic system of the pelvis is not as extensive as that of the abdomen. There are four groups of nodes in the pelvis (lumbar, common iliac, external iliac and internal iliac) that drain lymph not only from the pelvic organs but also from the lower limb via the inguinal nodes (situated just below the inguinal ligament). The lymph nodes of the plevis drain via the lumbar trunk into the cysterna chyli (see l ymphatics of the abdomen) Node Position Recieves Lymph Drains Lymph From Into Lumbar (lateral Along the a) The testes Lumbar trunk aortic nodes) abdominal aorta b) The ovaries which drains into anterior to psoas c) The uterine cisterna chyli major and the tubes diaphragmatic d) The superior crura part of the uterus e) The common iliac nodes Common Iliac Along the a) The external The lumbar nodes common iliac iliac nodes nodes artery b) The internal iliac nodes External Iliac Along the a) The inguinal The common nodes external iliac nodes iliac nodes artery b) The glans penis or clitoris c) The prostate a land Internal Iliac Along the All the pelvic The common nodes internal iliac viscera iliac nodes arterv PELVIS AND PERINEUM 4. THE PELVIC VISCERA A The Rectum Position • The rectum begins in line with the 3rd sacral vertebra as a continuation of the sigmoid colon • It follows the curve of the sacrum and coccyx (the sacral flexure) and then turns sharply backwards and downward to penetrate the pelvic diaphragm become the anal canal • This final curve i s called the anorectal flexure and is mai ntained by the puborectalis part of the levator ani (recall t he puborectal sling). Internal structure • The rectum is not straight but has three sharp flexures formed by infoldings of the mucosa, submucosa and most of the circular muscle. • These flexures are called transverse rectal folds and they partly obscur e the lumen, causing the rectum to have an S-shape in coronal section. • The upper and the lower flexures are convex to the right and the middle flexure is convex to the left. • The anterior terminal part of the rectum is dilated to form the ampulla. • The faeces is held in the ampulla just before defaecation. Peritoneal relations • The upper third of the rectum is covered anteriorly and laterally with peritoneum. • The middle third is covered only anteriorly with peritoneum. • The lower third of the rectum is not covered with peritoneum at all, as the peritoneum has reflected off the lower end of the middle third onto the seminal vesicles in the male, or the posterior part of the vaginal fornix in the female. • This reflection results in the creating of a pouch, called the rectovesical pouch in males, and the recto-uterine pouch (of Douglas) in females. • This pouch may contain parts of the small intestine or sigmoid colon. • The floor of the rectovesicol pouch or the recto-uterine pouch is bound to the perinea! body by a fascia! attachment, the rectovesical septum (in males) rectovaginal septum (in females). Relations • Anterior relations The anterior relations of the rectum differ in the male and the female. In the male a) The upper 213 is related to the base of the bladder with the rectovesical pouch intervening. 149 b) The lower 1 13 is related to the base of the bladder, the prostate, the seminal vesicles and the ductus deferens, with the rectovesical septum intervening. In the female a) The upper 213 is related to the vaginal fornix and the uterus with the rectovaginal pouch intervening. b) The lower 1 13 is related to the posterior wall of the vagina with the rectovaginal septum intervening. • Posterior relations • The lower sacral vertebrae. • The median sacral, lat eral sacral and superior rectal vessels. • The sympathetic trunks and the lower parts of the sacral plexus. Vasculature • The arterial supply is by: a) The superior rectal artery, a continuation of the infer ior mesenteric artery. b) The two middle rectal arteries (branches of the inferi or vesical arteries). c) The two inferior rectal arteries (branches of the Internal pudenda! arteries). d) Branches of the median sacral artery, a branch of the aorta. • Venous drainage is by a submucosal venous plexus which is drained superiorly by the superior rectal vein into the portal system and inferiorly by the middle and inferior rectal veins into the caval/systemic system. The anastomoses between these veins are an important area of portocaval shunting. Clinical Haemorrhoids: Dilatations of the lower rectal and upper anal veins. Haemorrhoids or 'piles' are varicosities of the superior rectal veins, which may protrude through the external anal sphincter or into the rectum. PELVIS AND PERINEUM B The Anal Canal Position. • The anal canal is the terminal 4cm of the large intestine. • It is directed postero-inferiorly and extends from the upper aspect of the pelvic diaphragm to the anus Internal Structure • The superior part of the anal canal is derived from endoderm and i s lined with simple columnar epithelium. • The inferior part of the anal canal is derived from ectoderm and is lined by stratified squamous epithelium. • An ill-defined junctional zone exists between the two parts. • The superior half of the mucous membrane of the anal canal has longitudinal ridges called anal columns. • The anorectal linel, where the rectum joins the anus, lies at the superior ends of these columns. • The inferior ends of the anal columns are joined by cresentic folds of epithelium, called anal valves!. • Superior to these anal valves are recesses called anal sinuses that produce mucous which lubricates the movement of faeces. • The line drawn through the inferior ends of the anal valves is called the pectinate line (or the dentate line or the muco-cutaneous line) and indicates the junction between the two parts of the anal canal which have different embryonic origins. • The parts of the anal canal above and below the pectinate line have different innervations, lymphatic drainage and supply. Vasculature, Lymphatics and Innervation • The vasculature, lymphatics and innervation of the anal canal differ above and below the pectinate line because of their different embryological origins. (These differences are detailed in the table be/owl. Above the Pectinate Line Below the Pectinate Line Arterial Superior rectal artery (the Inferior rectal arteries Supply continuation of the inferior (branchesof the internal mesenteric artery) pudenda! artery on each side) Venous Superior rectal vein (a tributary of Inferior rectal vein(a Drainage the inferior mesenteric vein) tributary of the internal iliac vein) Lymphatic Lymph drains into the internal iliac Lymph drains into the Drainage nodes and then into the common superficial inguinal iliac and lumbar nodes nodes Innervation Sympathetic supply is from the Inferior rectal nerve inferior hypogastric plexus (branch of the Parasympathet ic supply is from pudenda! nerve) the pelvic splanchnic nerves 150 • The middle rectal artery, a branch of the internal iliac artery, anastomoses with the superior and inferior rectal arteries at the anal valves. • The middle rectal vein has an analogous arrangement. The Anal Sphincters a) Internal Anal Sphincter • This is an involuntary sphincter formed by an enlargement of the circular muscle layer of the large intestine. • It surrounds the superior 213 of the anal canal and is innervated by the pelvi c splanchnic nerves (parasympathetic). b) External Anal Sphincter • This is a voluntary sphincter which surrounds the inferior 213 of the anal canal. • The muscle can be divided into three indistinct parts: i. The subcutaneous part • This is the most superficial part and consists of circular fibres that surround the anus. ii. The superficial part • The fibres of this part extend from the coccyx and the anococcygeal l igament to the perinea! body. iii. The deep part • This consists of circular muscle fibres which arise from the perinea! body and surround the anus. • This muscle blends with the fibres of puborectalis. • The action of the sphincter is to close the anus and anal canal voluntarily. • It is innervated by the inferior rectal nerve and the perinea! branch of S4. C The lschio-anal Fossa Boundaries • The ischio-anal fossae lie on either side of the anal canal. • They are bound: a) Anteriorly by the muscles at the base of the urogenital diaphragm. b) Posteriorly by the sacrotuberous ligament and gluteus maximus. c) Medially by the anal canal which is surrounded by levator ani and the external anal sphincter. d) Laterally by the ischium and the inferior part of obturator internus. Contents • The contents of the ischio-anal fossae include: • The fibro-fatty ischio-anal pads that support the anal canal. • The internal pudenda! artery and pudenda! nerve running in the pudenda! canal. • The perforating branches of S2,3 and the perinea! branch of S4. PELVIS AND PERINEUM D The Pudendal Canal Position: • An Opening within the obturator fascia that covers the medial aspect of the obturator internus and lines lateral wall of the ischioanal fossa. • Entry to the canal is at the lesser sciatic notch, inferior to the ischial spine. Contents: a) Internal pudenda! artery and vein b) Pudenda! nerve c) Nerve to obturator internus E The Urinary Bladder Position • The bladder is situated in the pelvis minor, posterior to the pubic bones and the pubic symphysis • It is separated from the pubic bones by the retropubic space • In infants and children the bladder located in the abdomen even when empty. Surfaces • The empty ur inary bladder has a pyramidal shape and thus has four surfaces: a) A superior surface, which is covered with peri toneum. b) A postero-inferior surface • This is related to the rectum in the male and the anterior wall of the vagina in the female. • This surface is also called the base or the fundus of the bladder. c) Two infero- lateral surfaces which face the levator ani muscle. • The neck is the lowest part of the bladder located where the fundus and the inferolateral surfaces converge • Here it is fused with the superior surface of the prostate gland in the male and surrounds the internal urethral orifice • The neck is held firmly in place by the puboprostatic ligaments in males and the pubovesical ligaments in females • The apex is at the anterior part of the bladder and points towards the upper end of the pubic symphysis. • From the apex the median umbilical ligament,Ligaments;umbilical, median which is the remnant of the embryonic Urachusurachus, passes forwards to the umbilicus. Internal Structure • The bladder has a strong muscular wall consisting of an inner and an outer longitudinal muscle layer and a middle, circular muscle layer. 151 • These muscular layers constitute the detrusor muscle of the bladder. • The mucous membrane is loosely connected to the muscular wall and thus thrown i nto folds or rugae, except in the small triangular area in the fundus called the trig one. • In the trigone the mucous membrane is smooth as it is firmly attached to the muscular wall. • The orifices of the ureters lie at the lateral angles of the trigone and the internal urethral orifice lies at the antero-inferior angle of the trigone. • Between the two ureteric orifices on the superior margin of the trigone is the interureteric fold which is formed by the subjacent muscle fibres. • In males, posterior to the internal urethral opening is a small elevation, the uvula vesicae, which is rai sed by the subjacent middle lobe of the prostate gland. Peritoneal relations • The peritoneum reflects from the superior surface of the bladder onto the anterior abdominal wall, as the urachus (the median umbilical ligament), so forming the roof of the retropubic space. • This anterior reflection rises as the bladder fills up so that the bladder is always in contact with the anterior abdominal wall without the peritoneum intervening. • This allows the distended bladder to be punctured by instruments without entering the peritoneal cavity. • The posterior peritoneal reflections differ in males and females: a) In males the peritoneum covers the ductus deferens and the seminal vesicles before reflecting onto the middle third of the rectum. b) In females the peritoneum reflects onto the uterus at the junction of its body and cervix (this creates the vesico-uterine pouch between the bladder and the uterus). Vasculature • Arterial supply to the urinary bladder is by: a) The superior vesical arteries (branches of the umbilical artery) which provide the most important supply. b) In males the inferi or vesical artery (branch of the internal iliac). c) In females the vaginal artery (branch of the internal iliac) sends a few branches to the postero-inferior part of the bladder. • Venous drainage is by the vesical venous plexus of veins which in the male is combined with the prostatic plexus. • The plexus drains into the internal iliac vein on each side. Innervation • The parasympathetic fibres to the bladder are from the pelvic splanchnic nerves (52,3,4). • Parasympathetic stimulation causes relaxation of the internal sphincter of the bladder and contraction of the detrusor muscle thus facilitating PEL VIS AND PERINEUM urination. • The sympathetic fibres to the bladder are from the inferior hypogastric plexus. • Sympathetic stimulation causes the contraction of the internal sphincter of the bladder and the relaxation of the detrusor muscle. Clinical Cystitis: inflammation of the bladder often portrayed with pain on passing urine. More common in females due to the shortness of the urethra, and subsequent easy passage of organisms. Cystoscopy: Transurethral examination of the inner lining of the bladder surface using a fibre optic cytoscope. 152 PEL VIS AND PERINEUM 6. THE MALE INTERNAL GENITALIA A The Testes Location • The testes are a pair of ovoid glands suspended in the scrotum by the spermatic cord • They are anchored by at their inferior poles to the scrotum by the remnant of the gubernaculums Structure • Each testis is ensheathed in a thick capsule called the tunica albuginea. • The latter gives rise posteriorly to the mediastinum testis from which septa radiate into the substance of the gland, dividing it into lobules. • Each lobule contains a few convoluted seminiferous tubules that straighten out as they reach the mediastinum testis to form the rete testis. • From the rete testis about twenty efferent ductules connect to the head of the epididymis. • The coverings of the testes are continuous with those of the spermatic cords. • These coverings are, from external to internal a) The external spermatic fascia. b) The cremaster muscle and fascia. c) The internal spermatic fascia. d) The tunica vagina/is • This is derived from the processus vaginalis. • It is a closed serous sac consisting of a visceral and a parietal layer. Function • The testes are the primary male reproductive organs and they produce sperm and androgens. Vasculature • Arterial supply is by the testicular artery from the anterolateral aspect of the abdominal aorta. • The testicular veins drain via the pampiniform plexus of veins to form a single testicular vein on either side. • On the right the testicular vein drains into the inferior vena cava, and on the left into the left renal vein. • The veins of the testes play a role in thermoregulation Innervation • The testis receives sympathetic fibres from T 10. • The testicular plexus of nerves is derived from the renal and aortic plexuses. Clinical Hydrocoele: 153 The accumulation of fluid around the testis between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis Varicocoeles: The occurrence of enlarged varicose gondal veins (pampinform plexus of either testis or ovary) Cremasteric Reflex: This tests nerve roots L 1 and L2 in males and involves contraction of the cremaster muscle, raising the testis after stroking the inside of the ipsilateral thigh.

The head which contains the coiled efferent ductules from the rete testis b. The body consisting the torturous convoluted duct of the epididymis c. The tail, continuous with the ductus deferens Function • It acts as a reservoir for sperm as they undergo the final stages of maturation. C Ductus Deferens Course • The ductus deferens begins at the tail of the epididymis, runs upwards in the spermatic cord and passes through the inguinal canal. • It emerges from the deep inguinal ring, crosses over the external iliac vessels and enters the pelvis and descends on the side wall of the pelvis. • The ductus deferens however does cross the obturator nerve and vessels and the obliterated part of the umbilical artery (medial umbilical ligament) • Note that the ductus deferens crosses superior to the ureter near the posterolateral angle of the bladder, running anterior to the ureter towards the fundus of the bladder • There are no other structures that pass between the ductus deferens and the parietal peritoneum. • Near the end of the ductus deferens i t dilates to form an ampulla of ductus deferens. • The ductus deferens joins with the excretory duct of the seminal vesicle medial to this gland to form the ejaculatory duct. • The two ejaculatory ducts pass through the posterior part of the prostate and open on the sides of the prostatic utricle. PELVIS AND PERINEUM Vasculature • The ductus deferens is supplied by the artery to ductus deferens deferens which usually arises from the inferior vesical artery • The artery ends by anastamosing with the testicular artery posterior to the testis. • Venous drainage is by veins which correspond to the arteries.

E The Seminal Vesicles Structure • Each seminal vesicle is a fusiform structure consisting of a single coiled tube that lies between the fundus of the bladder and the rectum. • The superior parts of the seminal vesicles are lined by peritoneum and separated from the rectum by the rectovesical pouch. • The lower parts of the seminal vesicles are separated from the rectum by the rectovesical septum. • The duct of each seminal vesicle joins the ductus deferens to form the ejaculatory duct. • The lower, tapering ends of the seminal vesicles are separated from each other by the two ducti deferentes. Vasculature • The arterial supply of the seminal vesicles is by branches of the inferior vesical artery and the middle rectal artery. Function • It secretes alkaline fluid that constitutes the greatest proportion of the seminal fluid. Innervation • Parasympathetic innervation is derived from the inferior hypogastric plexus. • Sympathetic innervation is derived from the superior lumbar nerves. F The Prostate It is the largest gland of the male internal genitalia and surrounds the prostatic urethra. External Features Capsule • It consists of a thin fibrous or true capsule, and a loose sheath of visceral fascia or false capsule. • The two capsules are separated by the prostatic venous plexusPlexus of veins;prosatatic. Surfaces • The prostate has an apex, a base and four surfaces (posterior, two inferolateral and anterior). • The apex of the prost ate lies inferior and is related to the urogenital diaphragm and the sphincter urethrae muscle. • The base of the prostate is related to the neck of the urinary bladder. a) The posterior surface • This is a flattened triangular surface that rests on th e ampulla of the PELVIS AND PERINEUM rectum. • This is the surface that is palpated in a rectal examination. • On the posterior surface is a median groove which demarcates the lateral lobes, but as the lobes are usually fused, they are collecti vely referred to as the posterior lobe. • On the superior part of the posterior surface is a depression where the ejaculatory ducts enter the prostate gland. • This demarcates the middle lobe. • The middle lobe lies between the ejaculatory ducts and the prostatic urethra • It underlies the uvula vesicae of the bladder. b) The inferolateral surfaces • These face the retropubic space. • They are supported by the levator ani muscle. c) The anterior surface • This extends from the apex to the base of the prostate. • It is narrow and convex in shape.

THE MALE EXTERNAL GENITALIA A The Penis • The penis is the male organ of copulation and is anatomically described in the erect state. Structure • The penis consists of a root and a body (with the glans constituting the end extension of the body) a) The Root of the penis • The root of the penis lies i n the superficial perinea! space. • It consists of the crura of the corpora cavernosa, the bulbous penis of the corpus spongiosum, and the associated muscles. • The crura of the corpus cavernosa are attached to the conjoint rami of the pubis and ischium. • These crura provide support for the corpus spongiosum, which lies between them and inferior to the conjoint rami of the pubis and ischium. • The bulb of the penis attaches to the posterior part of the perinea! membrane and is penetrated by the spongy urethra. b) The Body of the penis • This i s the free part of the penis. • It is composed of three cylindrical bodies of erectile tissue: i. The corpora cavernosa • These are two erectile bodies which are arranged side by side in the dorsal part of the penis. • The corpora cavernosa are fused with each other, except posteri orly, where they separate to form the two crura of the penis. • They are enveloped by a common, strong, fibrous sheath, the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa. ii. The corpus spongiosum • This erectile body lies ventrally and contains the spongy urethra. • It is also enclosed by a fibrous envelope, the tunica albuginea of the corpus spongiosum. • The distal end of the corpus spongiosum is expanded to form the glans penisGlans;of penis which covers the blunt ends of the corpora cavernosa. • The external urethral orifice or meatus, where the urethra opens, is situated near the tip of the glans penis. • The margin of the glans penis is prominent and is called the corona of the glans. • At its proximal end the corpus spongiosum has an expansion called the 156 bulb of the penis. • The body is ensheathed in a common covering called the deep fascia of the penis. • In the midline on its posterior aspect the fascia forms the suspensory ligament of the penis, anchoring the penis to the pubis symphysis. • The loose skin covering the penis is prolonged as a double fold distally to overhang the glans penis. • This is known as the prepuce or foreskin of the penis. • The frenulum of the prepuce is a median fold on the anterior aspect of the penis attaching to the glans just inferior to the external urethral meatus. Vasculature • The arterial supply is via tortuous or helicine arteries derived from: a. The dorsal arteries of the penis (branches of the internal pudenda! arteries). b. The deep artery of the penis (branch of the internal pudenda I artery). c. Artery of the bulb of the penis. • Venous drainage from the cavernous spaces passes via the deep dorsal vein to the prostatic venous plexus. • The dorsal vein of the penis is flanked on either side by the dorsal artery and the dorsal nerve of the penis. • The superficial coverings of the penis are drained by the superficial dorsal vein which lies superficial to the deep fasci a. • The superficial dorsal vein ends in the superficial external pudenda! vein. Innervation a. The skin of the root of the penis is supplied by the ilioinguinal nerve, the perinea! branch of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh, and the posterior scrotal branchesof the perinea! nerve. b.

Priapism: A permanent painful ercetion often due to thrombosis within the cavernous tissue of the penis. B The Male Urethra The urethra in the bladder neck (preprostatic) is described in the pelvis section • The male urethra consists of three parts (from proximal to distal): a) A prostatic part. b) A membranous part. c) A spongy part. The Prostatic Urethra • This is surrounded by the prostate gland. • The posterior wall of the prostatic urethra has a median longitudinal ridge called the urethral crest. • There is an enlargement on the middle part of this crest called the seminal colliculus. • On the seminal colliculis is a small slit which leads to a blind-ending sac called the prostatic utricle. • The prostatic utricle in the male is the remnant of the uterovaginal canal and has no function. • It is situated in the middle lobe of the prostate gland. • The ejaculatory ducts open on each side of the prostatic utricle into the prostatic urethra. • On each side of the urethral crest is a longitudinal groove, the prostatic sinus, into which the prostatic ductules open. The Membranous Urethra • The membranous urethra connects the prostatic and spongy parts of the urethra. • It traverses the deep perinea! space and pierces the perinea! membrane to reach the bulb of the penis. • It is surrounded by the sphincter urethrae and is therefore very narrow. • Posterolaterally to the membranous urethra the small bulbourethral gland and associated duct are embedded in the substance of the sphincter urethrae. 157 The Spongy Urethra • This is the longest part of the urethra and runs in the corpus spongiosum. • At its distal end, just before it opens at the external urethral orifice, it has a dilatation called the fossa navicularis. Clinical Extravasation of urine: If the urethra is only damaged in its membranous part, urine will drain into the urogenital diaphragm and into the pelvis extraperitoneally. If there is damage to the spongy penile urethra, urine will drain into the superficial perinea! pouch and then continue up the anterior abdominal wall because this fascia! layer continuous with superficial perinea! membrane. Urine can't trail down the thighs because the superficial abdominal fascia is fused with the deep fascia Iota of the thigh just below the ingui nal li gament. C The Scrotum • The scrotum is a loose fibro-muscular sac located inferior to the pubic symphysis. • The median scrotal raphe is a ridge indicating the bilateral origi n of the scrotum. The scrotum contains the testis and its coverings. Structure • The skin of the scrotum contains very li ttle fat which helps keep the temperature of the testes at 33, 9 degrees celcius (the body temperature of 37 degrees celcius is too high for effective spermatogenesis). • The dartos muscle is firmly attached to the skin. • If the scrotal temperature drops the muscle contracts and pulls the testis towards the body (so to conserve heat). Vasculature • The arterial supply is by: a. The external pudenda! artery (branch of the femoral artery) which supplies the anterior aspect. b. The internal pudenda! artery (branch of the internal iliac artery) which supplies the posterior aspect. c. Additional branches from the testicular and cremasteric arteries. • The venous drainage corresponds to the arterial supply and eventually drains into the external pudenda! veins. Innervation • The innervation is by: a. The ilioinguinal nerve and the genital branch of genitofemoral nerve b. supply the anterior aspect. c. Branches of the perinea! nerve and the perinea! branch of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh which supply the posterior aspect. PELVIS AND PERINEUM 8. FEMALE INTERNAL GENITALIA A The Vagina Position and Structure • The vagina is a musculo-membranous tube approximately 7,5 to 9 cm in length. • It extends from the uterine cervix to the vestibule (the cleft between the labia minora). • The long axis of the vagi na is parallel to that of the pelvic brim and perpendicular to that of the uteri ne cervix. • The vaginal lumen is flattened antero-posteriorly to be H-shaped in cross section. • It thus has an anterior and slighlty longer posterior wall. • The uter ine cervix projects i nto the superior part of the anterior wall forming a circumferential recess around the cervix in the vagina, which is called the fornix. • The fornix has an anterior, posterior and lateral parts. Relations Anterior a) The upper half of the vagina is related to the fundus of the bladder and the terminal parts of the ureters. b) The lower half of the vagina is related to the urethra. Posterior a) The fornix of the vagina is covered with peritoneum that has reflected off the middle third of the rectum. b) The upper two-thirds of the vagina rests on the ampulla of the rectum with the rectovaginal septum intervening. c) The lower third of the vagina is related to the anal canal with the perinea! body intervening. Lateral a) The upper part is attached to the broad ligament of the uterus containing the ureters and uterine vessels. b) The lower part is related to the pubococcygeus part of levator ani, the greater vestibular glands and the bulbs of the vestibule. Sphincters T he vagina is compressed by 4 muscles which act as or like sphincters: a. Pubovaginalis (part of levator ani) b. External urethral sphincter c. Urethrovaginal sphincter d. Bulbospongiousus 158 Vasculature • The main arterial supply is by the vaginal artery, a branch of either the uterine artery or of the internal iliac artery. • The main arterial supply is by the vaginal arteries supplying the middle and inferi or parts from the internal pudenda! and middle rectal arteries • The supply of the superior part of the vagina is derived from the uterine artery • Venous drainage is by a vaginal plexus which drains into the internal iliac vein via the uterine vei n Innervation • The superior 4/ 5' s of the vagina is visceral i n sensation: • Parasympathetic fibres arise from the pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2,3,4) • Sympathetic fibres arise from the inferior hypogastric plexus and lumbar splanchnic nerves • The Inferior 1 /5th of the vagina is somatic in sensation and is thus sensitive to touch and temperature: • Innervation via the deep perinea! branch of the pudenda! nerve B The Ovaries Position • The ovaries are extraperitoneal structures located in a recess on the lateral wall of the pelvis called the ovarian fossa. • The fossa is bound anteriorly by the broad ligament of the uterus and posteriorly by the ureter. Structure • In nulliparae each ovary is an almond-shaped, smooth gland. The ovary has two margins (mesovarian and free), two ends (uterine and tubal) and two surfaces (medial and lateral). Margins a) The mesovarian margin is anterior and is attached to the broad ligament. b) The free margin is posterior. Ends a) The superior (tubal) end is connected to the lateral wall of the pelvis by the suspensory ligament of the ovary. b) The inferior (uterine) end is connected to the superolateral aspect of the body of the uterus by the proper ligament of the ovary. Surfaces a) The medial surface is free. b) The lateral surface faces the ovarian fossa and is separated from the obturator nerve and vessels by the peritoneum. PELVIS AND PERINEUM Ovulation • Before puberty the ovary has a smooth, white appearance. • After puberty ovulation begins and the ovary becomes scarred as a result of it. • Ovulation, which occurs approximately once every twenty-eight days, results in the expulsion of the primary oocyte into the peritoneal cavity. • Apart from the minimal amount of serous fluid this is the only non- pathological structure that is ever found in the peritoneal cavity. • The primary oocyte is soon taken up by the uterine tube as a result of the wave-like movements of the fimbrae of the infundibulum. Vasculature • The arterial supply is by the ovarian artery (a branch of the abdominal aorta). • This bifurcates into ovarian and tubal branches which traverse the mesovarium to the ovary • The ovary is also supplied by the ovarian branch of the uterine artery ( a branch of the internal iliac artery). • The venous drainage is by a pampiniform plexus from which the ovarian veins arise. • The left ovarian vein drains into the left renal vein, and the right ovarian vein drains into the inferior vena cava. Innervation • Sympathetic nerves are derived from the ovarian plexus of nerves formed by the renal and aortic periarterial plexuses, as well as from the inferior hypogastric plexus. • Parasympathetic nerves are derived from the vagus nerves. 159 C The Uterus Structure • The uterus is a muscular organ directed in a supero-anterior direction to overhang the bladder. It can be divided into: a) A superior dilated part called the body of the uterus. Consisting of: i. the fundus: the rounded part of the body situated superior to the opening of the uterine tubes ii. The isthmus, the constricted area just above the cervix b) An inferior cylindrical part called the cervix. c) Uterine tubes The uterine tubes, broad ligaments and ovaries are collectively called the adnexa of the uterus by gynaecologists. The Body • It has an antero-inferior surface related to the urinary bladder and a posterior superior surface related to the sigmoid colon. • The two surfaces are separated by the lateral margins. • The uterine tubes enter the body at its supero-lateral aspect called the cornua of the uterus. • The rounded part of the uterus above the entry of the uterine tubes is called the fundus of the uterus. The Cervix • The isthmus is a slight constriction on the external surface indicating the junction between the body and the cervix. • The cervix projects into the superior part of the anterior wall of the vagina and thus consists of a supravaginal and a vaginal part. • The supravaginal part communicates with the lumen of the uterine body via the internal os. • The vaginal part communicates with the lumen of the vagina via the external os. The Uterine Tubes (Fallopian tubes) • The uterine tubes extend between the ovary and the cornu of the uterus. • Lie in the mesosalpinx formed by the free edges of the broad ligaments. • They runs anterolaterally and then medially to reach the uterus. • It connects the peritoneal cavity with the lumen of the body of the uterus. • The uterine tube can be divided into four parts, from proximal to distal: 1 . The uterine part, which is embedded in the muscular wall of the uterus. 2. The isthmus, which is the narrowest part of the tube and enters the cornu of the uterus. PEL VIS AND PERINEUM 3. The ampulla, which is the longest and widest part of the tube. 4. The infundibulum • This is the funnel-shaped lateral end of the uterine tube which lies next to the ovary. • It has many fringes or fimbrae on its free edge. • The largest of these fimbrae, the ovarian fimbria, is attached to the ovary. • The opening of the tube to the peritoneal cavi ty is called the abdominal ostium. Orientation of the Uterus • The cervix lies at a right angle to the vagina, and is thus tilted forwards from the coronal plane. • This angle is called the angle of anteversion. • The body of the uterus is tilted forwards on the cervix, and this is called the angle of anteflexion. Support • The uterus is held in place by: a) The pelvic diaphragm, especially the pubovaginalis part of levator ani. b) Supporting ligaments (see next paragraph). Supporting Ligaments • These are condensations of the pelvic fascia and extend from the supravaginal part of the cervix. • The ligaments are: a) The uterosacral ligament which passes to the sacrum. b) The cardina (transverse cervical)ligaments which passes laterally in the root of the broad ligament to the lateral wall of the pelvis. c) The pubocervical ligament which becomes continuous with the pubovesical ligament and passes to the pubis. Other Ligaments Related to the Uterus • Two other important ligaments related to the uterus are the round ligament and the broad ligament of the uterus. Round Ligament of the Uterus & Proper Ligament of the Ovary • The round ligament of the uterus attaches to the body of the uterus anterior to the entry of the uterine tubes and then runs through the inguinal canal to attach to the labium majora. • The proper ligament of the ovary thus connects the uterine end of the ovary to the body of the uterus posterior to the entry of the uterine tube. Broad Ligament of the Uterus 160 • This is a fold of peritoneum (i.e. it consists of two layers) which extends from the lateral margins of the body of the uterus to the side walls of the pelvis. • The uterine tube lies enclosed in the upper free edge of the broad ligament. • The cardinal (transverse cervical) ligament, which contains the uterine vessels, runs in the lower edge of the broad ligament. • Laterally, the broad ligament is elongated over the ovarian vessels to form the suspensory ligament of the ovary. • The mesosalpinx is the part of the broad ligament between the proper ligament of the ovary, the ovary and the uterine tube. • The two layers of the broad ligament enclose the following structures: a) Uterine artery in the transverse cervical ligament. b) Ovarian artery in the suspensory ligament of the ovary. c) The vesicular appendixAppendix; vesicular, epoophoron and poroophoron which are remnants of the cranial and caudal tubules of the mesonephros. d) Extraperitoneal connective tissue and muscle called parametrium. Vasculature Arterial supply of the uterus is by: a) The uterine artery (branch of the internal ili ac artery) which provides the main arterial supply. b) Branches of the ovarian arteries (branches of the abdominal aorta). • The venous drainage is by a uterine venous plexus of veins, which drains into the internal iliac veins. Innervation • The parasympathetic fibres are derived from the pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2,3,4). • The sympathetic fibres are derived from the inferior hypogastric plexus. Clinical Ectopic Pregnancy Rupture: An Acute medical emergency due to rupture of the uterine tube and bleeding into the peritoneal cavity. A non-progressed embryo lodging in the tubes usually occurs 6-8 weeks after conception. PELVIS AND PERINEUM 9. FEMALE EXTERNAL GENITALIA A The Vulva • The vulva (or pudendum) is the collective term for the female external genitalia. It consists of the mans pubis, the labia (majora and minora) and the vestibule. The mons pubis • The mans pubis is a fatty elevation in the pubic region, which is covered by skin with coarse pubic hairs. • The fat underlying the skin is a specialised region of the superficial fatty layer (of Camper) of the abdominal tela subcutanea. The labia majora • The labia majora are embryologically homologous to the scrotum. • They are two symmetrical folds of skin filled with subcutaneous fat. • Each labium majus extends from the pubic symphysis anteriorly to within 2. 5 cm of the anus posteriorly. • Between the labia majora is a slit called the pudenda! cleft. • Anteriorly the labia majora meet to form the anterior labial commissure. • Posteriorly, rather than meeting, there is a transverse bridge of skin between the two labia called the posterior labial commissure. The labia minora • The labia minora are embryologically homologous to the spongy urethra of the male. • They are two symmetrical folds of fat- free, hairless skin located medial to the labia majora. • The labia minora enclose the vestibule of the vagina. • Anteriorly, each labium minus splits into a medial and a lateral part. • The medial parts of the labia minora fuse inferior to the clitoris to form the frenulum of the clitoris(Also known as the fourchette). • The lateral parts of the labia minora fuse superior to the clitoris to form the prepuce of the clitoris. • Posteriorly the labia minora meet to form the frenulum of the labia minora of the fourchette. The vestibule Boundaries • The vestibule is bounded: a. Laterally by the labia minora. b. Anteriorly by the frenulum of the clitoris. c. Posteriorly by the fourchette. 161 Contents • The vestibule contains the external urethral orifice, the vaginal orifice, and the openings of the vestibular glands. a) External urethral orifice • The external urethral orifice is located anterior to the vaginal orifice, approximately 2cm posterior to the clitoris. • The paraurethral glands open on either side of the orifice. • These glands are homologous to the prostate gland of the male. b) Vaginal orifice • This is located posterior to the external urethral orifice and is covered to varying degrees by the hymen. c) Vestibular glands • There are greater and lesser vestibular glands. • The greater vestibular glands are oval or round glands located posterolateral to the vaginal orifice. • They are partially overlapped by the posterior ends of the vestibular bulbs. • The ducts of the glands open on either side of the vaginal orifice. • The secretions of the glands lubricate the vagi nal orifice during sexual arousal. • These glands are homologous to the bulbourethral glands of the male. • The lesser vestibular glands are small glands which secrete mucous directly into the vestibule. Arterial supply of vulva • Profuse supply from the external pudenda! arteries and one internal pudenda! artery of each side. • Labial arteries and an artery to the clitoris are derivative of the internal pudenda! artery • Venous drainage via labial veins to the internal pudenda! vein Innervations of vulva • Anterior labial nerves: branches of the ilioinguinal nerve • Genital branch of genitofemoral nerve • Perinea! branch of cutaneous nerve of thigh • Posterior labial nerve (from the perinea! nerve derivative of the pudenda! nerve) Muscles associated with erectile tissues: Bulbospongious: lschiocavernous: assists in erection of the clitoris, weakly constrict vagina maintains erection of clitoris by compressing outflow veins and pushing blood into organ for engorgement PEL VIS AND PERINEUM B The Clitoris The clitoris is an erectile body, which is homologous to the penis in most respects. It differs from the penis in that: 1 . It does not contain the urethra. 2. The corpus spongiosum is absent. 3. The bulb of the vestibule is split by the vaginal orifice into two separate bulbs in contrast to the single bulb of the penis. Stucture • The clitoris is composed of three erectile bodies: a} The corpora cavernosa • The body of the clitoris consists of two corpora cavernosa which are enclosed by a common fibrous sheath and separated by an incomplete septum. • Each corpus cavernosum arises from the respective ischiopubic ramus as a crus of the clitoris. b} The vestibular bulbs • In the female there are two vestibular bulbs lying on either side of the vaginal orifice. • These flank the vaginal orifice under cover of bulbospongiousus muscle • These are homologous to the single bulb of the penis and the corpus spongiosum of the male. • Their posterior ends overlap the greater vestibular glands. • Anteriorly the vestibular bul bs are tapered and are joined by a commissure. • Two bands of erectile tissue extend from this commissure anteriorly to connect the bulbs to the glans clitoris. • The glans clitoris is located on the free ends of the corpora cavernosa. 162 C The Female Urethra • The female urethra is approximately 4cm long and passes from the urinary bladder anteroinferiorly to open at the external urethral orifice located in the vestibule. • The urethra lies anterior to the vagina and it is very closely associated with the lower part of the anterior vaginal wall. • The superior half of the female urethra corresponds to the prostatic urethra of the male. • The inferior half of the female urethra corresponds to the membranous urethra of the male. Clinical Because the female urethra is comparatively short, there is a greater tendency for urinary tract infections in females than in males. The Vertebral Column THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN 1.

The Lower Limb 2. OVERVIEW OF THE LOWER LIMB A The Superficial Vessels of the Lower Limb • In certain parts of the lower limb the superficial fascia is split into two, and between these two layers run the cutaneous veins and nerves of the lower limb. • The blood in the cutaneous veins has to be moved against the force of gravity. • For this to happen, there are valves in the veins ensuring the one-way flow of blood. • There are also communicating veins between the cutaneous veins and the veins deep to the deep fascia. • The valves in these communicating veins ensure that blood flows only from the superficial to the deep venous system. • The contraction of the muscles moves the blood in the deep veins, causing blood to be drawn from the superficial to the deep veins via the communicating veins. • There are two large cutaneous veins, the great saphenous vein and the small saphenous vein. The Great Saphenous Vein Course • This vein originates on the medial side of the foot and is formed by the union of the dorsal vein of the great toe and the dorsal venous arch of the foot. • It then passes anterior to the medial malleolus of the tibia. • It passes posterior to the medial condyle of the femur. • The vein is accompanied throughout its course in the leg by the saphenous nerve. • From the knee it ascends superolaterally to the saphenous hiatus, pierces the cribiform fascia and joins the femoral vein. Tributaries • The medial part of the dorsal venous arch and the medial dorsal vein of the great toe. • The medial marginal veins from the sole of the foot. • The accessory saphenous vein, which is produced when the veins from the medial and posterior aspects of the thigh unite and forms the main communication between the great and small saphenous veins. • The anterior and lateral cutaneous veins, which drain the anterior and lateral part of the thigh. • The superficial circumflex iliac vein. • The external pudenda! vein. 196 • The superficial epigastric vein. Clinical • Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) - is a routine procedure in which, the great saphenous vein is removed from the leg for use by the cardiac surgeon. However, the saphenous nerve, which lies in close association with the vein, may be damaged - leading to loss of sensation on the medial side of the foot and ankle. The Small Saphenous Vein Course • This vein passes along the lateral side of the foot (from the union of the dorsal vein of the small toe with the dorsal venous arch), running with the sural nerve. • It then passes posterior to the lateral malleolus. • It passes along the lateral border of the calcaneal tendon. • Here it is accompanied by the medial cutaneous nerve of the calf proximally and the sural nerve of the calf distally. • It inclines to the midline of the fibula. • It then pierces the deep fascia between the two heads of gastrocnemius and enters the popliteal fossa, where it joins the popliteal vein. Tributaries • The lateral part of the dorsal venous arch. • Veins from the lateral edge of the sole of the foot and from the dorsum of the fifth toe. The Lower Limb B The Lymphatics of the Lower Limb The Superficial System The superficial Inguinal nodes • These nodes are situated superficial to the deep fascia and are arranged in a transver se group and a vertical group. • They drain along femoral vessels to the external iliac nodes and possibly also to the deep inguinal nodes. The superficial lymphatics • The superficial lymphatics drain along two main streams which correspond to the venous drainage: d) The lateral side of the foot and calf are drained by the lymphatics accompanying the small saphenous vein into the popliteal nodes. e) The rest of the lymphatics accompany the great saphenous vein. • The transverse nodes drain the skin of the areas drained by the proximal tributaries of the great saphenous vein, including the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall and the buttock. • The skin of the external genitalia drains either into the most medial node of the transverse group or into the uppermost node of the vertical group. The Deep System The deep nodes • These nodes are situated deep t o the deep fascia. • The deep inguinal nodes are situated in the femoral canal. • The popliteal nodes are situated in the popliteal fossa. • The anterior tibial nodes are situated at the upper end of the anterior tibial artery. The deep lymphatics • These accompany the arteries of the lower limb. • The lymphatics from the foot and the leg pass to the anterior tibial popliteal nodes • The lymphatics from the thigh pass to the external iliac nodes and a few pass to the deep inguinal nodes. • The lymphatics from the buttock pass with the superior and inferior gluteal vessels through the greater sciatic foramen into the iliac nodes. 197 The Lower Limb 3. THE GLUTEAL REGION A Structures Passing Through the Sciatic Foramina The Greater Sciatic Foremen • The following structures pass through the greater sciatic foramen: a) The piriformis muscle. b) The superior gluteal vessels and the superior gluteal nerve pass through the foramen at the upper border of the piriformis. c) The sciatic nerve passes through the foramen at the lower border of the piriformis. d) The posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh passes through the foramen lying superficial to the sciatic nerve. e) The nerve to quadratus femoris passes through the fora men lying deep to the sciatic nerve. f) The inferior gluteal vessels and the inferior gluteal nerve pass through the foramen at the lower border of the piriformis medial to the sciati c nerve. g) The obturator internus nerve, internal pudenda! artery and pudenda! nerve pass out of the foramen at the lower border of the piriformi s and pass over the spine and sacrospinous ligament. The Lesser Sciatic Foremen • The structures which pass through the lesser sciatic foramen are: the obturator internus muscle; the nerve to obturator internus; the pudenda! nerve; the internal pudenda! artery. B The Muscles of the Gluteal Region Organisation • The muscles of the gluteal region can be divided into two functional groups: a) The large glutei (maximus, medius and minimus) • These are extensors and abductors of the thigh. • Gluteus maximus is covered by fascial sheath, and gluteus medius by the thick gluteal aponeurosis. • The muscles occupy three planes from behind forwards. • This correlates with the respective attachments to the posterior, lateral and anterior aspect of the greater trochanter of the femur of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and gluteus minimus. 198 b) A deeper group of smaller muscles (piriformis, obturator internus, gemelli and quadratus femoris) • These are mainly lateral rotators of the thigh at the hip joint. • Piriformis is the key muscle of the gluteal region as many of the branches of the sacral plexus emerge either above or below it. • Injections into the buttock should be into its superolateral quandrant to avoid the sciatic nerve emerging from the piriformis's lower edge. • The surface marking of the piriformis is by a line joining the mid- point of a line, drawn between the posterior superior iliac spine and the tip of the coccyx, to the greater trochanter. Clinical • Gluteal nerve paralysis: Superior gluteal nerve damage affects the three abductor muscles: tensor fasciae latae, gluteus medius and gluteus minimus; resulting in a waddling gait. Inferior gluteal nerve damage, which affects only gluteus maximus, is a disabling condition as this muscle is the strongest muscle used in extending the leg or trunk. These nerves may be damaged during intermuscular injections i nto the buttocks. • Sciatica - is due to an irritation or damage to the sciatic roots or trunk and presents clinically as pain down the leg. • Sciatic trunk paralysis - may result from a badly placed intramuscular injection in the buttocks. Injections should always be given in the upper outer quadrant of the buttock (above the line joining the greater t rochanter and the posterior superior iliac spine) to avoid hitting the sciatic nerve. • Trendelenburg's sign - is when a patient stands on one leg and the other hip droops. The cause may be damage to the abductors (tensor fasciae latae, gluteus medius and minimus), the superior gluteal nerve or an abnormality of the hip joint.

Clinical • Intermittent Claudication: is limping due to pain, usually experienced in the calf muscles, due to a generalized ischaemia in the lower limb. Commonly it is due to atherosclerosis in the region of the adductor hiatus where the femoral artery becomes the popliteal artery. The Lower Limb The Popliteal Vein Origin and Course • The vein is formed at the lower edge of popliteus by the union of the anterior and posterior tibial veins. • The vein then runs superiorly to reach the tendinous hiatus in adductor magnus, where it becomes the femoral vein. • In the popliteal fossa t receives the small saphenous vein. • The popliteal vein and the popliteal artery are enclosed in a fascia! sheath. The Relations of the Nerves and Vessels in the Popliteal Fossa • Throughout the fossa, the realations from superficial to deep are: a) The tibial nerve b) The popliteal vein. c) The popliteal artery • The relations from medial to lateral in the proximal part of the fossa are: a) The popliteal artery b) The popliteal vein. c) The tibial nerve • The relations from medial to lateral in the distal part of the fossa are: a) The tibial nerve b) The popliteal vein. c) popliteal artery popliteal artery • Note that throughout the fossa, the tibial nerve and the popl iteal artery are seperated by the popliteal vein. • This change in relations occurs because the popliteal artery inclines laterally as it descends in the popliteal fossa. • The popliteal vein crosses from t he medial to the lateral side of the artery as it ascends in the popliteal fossa. 210 C Innervation of the Popliteal fossa The Common Fibular Nerve Origin and Course • This is the lateral terminal branch of the sciatic nerve derived from the posterior divisions of the ventral rami of L4 to S2. • The nerve usually arises near the superior angle of the popliteal fossa. • It runs along the medial side of biceps femoris and the tendon of the muscle. • It leaves the fossa by passing over the lateral head of gastrocnemius and the posterior aspect of the head of the fibula. • It then wraps around the neck of the fibula and pierces fibularis longus to enter the anterior region of the leg. • The nerve then divides into superficial and deep fibular nerves, which supply the lateral and anterior compartments of the leg respectively. Relations • The nerve lies on plantaris, the lateral head of gastrocnemius, the tendon of popliteus, soleus, and the i nferior lateral genicular nerve and vessels. Branches • In the popliteal fossa the nerve gives off: a) The lateral cutaneous nerve of the calf, which supplies the skin over the lateral aspect of the calf. b) Genicular branches to the knee joint. c) A communicating fibular branch, which joins the medial cutaneous nerve of the calf (from the tibial nerve) to form the sural nerve. • In the leg the nerve gives off: a) The superficaial fibular nerve. b) The deep fibular nerve. Clinical • Common Fibular Nerve Paralysis: is normally the result of trauma or pressure on the neck of the fibula, often following a fracture when the lower leg is put in a cast. This denervates the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg, causing sensory loss on the lateral shin and dorsum of the foot and mot or loss, which makes it impossible to dorsiflex and evert the foot, leading to foot drop. The Tibial Nerve Origin and Course • This is the medial terminal branch of the sciatic nerve derived from the anterior divisions of the ventral rami of L4 to S3. The Lower Limb • This nerve appears from under cover of semimembranosus and then runs distally, bisecting the popliteal fossa and disappearing deep to gastrocnemius. • In the calf it lies between soleus and flexor digitorum longus, and then inclines medially towards the interval between the medi al malleolus and calcaneus. • It divides into the medial and lateral plantar nerves deep to the flexor retinaculum to supply the foot. Relations • In the calf: Anterior: Flexor digitorum longus and the tibia. Posterior: Plantaris, soleus and gastrocnemius. • In the calf the nerve first lies medial to the posterior tibial artery and deep to plantaris, soleus, and gastrocnemius. • The nerve then crosses the artery superficially, and comes to lie lateral to the artery at the ankle. Branches • The nerve supplies all the muscles in the posterior compartment of the thigh and the leg, except the short head of biceps femoris, as well as all the intrinsic muscles of the foot. a) In the leg it supplies muscular branches to: i) Plantaris ii) The two heads of gastrocnemius. iii) The two heads of soleus. iv) Popliteus • This branch supplies popliteus and then hooks around the inferior border of the muscle to supply the proximal tibiofibular joint. • The nerve then gives off the interosseus nerve of the leg, which descends on the interosseus membrane to supply the tibia and the distal tibiofibular joint. b) Medial cutaneous nerve of the calf • Thi s nerve passes in the groove between the two heads of gastrocnemius. • In the middle of the leg it is joined by the communicating fibular branch to form the sural nerve. • The small saphenous vein runs with the medial cutaneous nerve of the calf in the proximal port of the leg, and with the sural nerve in the distal part of the leg. c) Three genicular branches to the knee joint, which run with the superior and inferior medial geniular and middle genicular arteries. d) Articular branches to the ankle joint. e) The medial and lateral plant ar nerves. 211 6. THE LEG A The Knee joint Classification • The knee joint is a synovial joint of the modified hinge type. Articular Surfaces • The articular surfaces are the curved condyles of the femur, the flattened condyles of the tibia and the facets of the patella. • Functionally, the knee joint consists of a femero-patella joint and a femero- tibial joint. Articular capsule • It consists of a fibrous capsule and a synovial capsule. a) The fibrous capsule • The fibrous capsule is incomplete and strengthened by expansions of the surrounding muscles and tendons. • Anteriorly, it is replace by the quadriceps mechanism, (the quadriceps tendon, patella and patellar ligament). • Posteriorly, it is reinforced on the medial side by the oblique popliteal ligament, which is formed by the recurrent fibres of the semimembranosus tendon. • Posteriorly, it is reinforced on the lateral side by an infralateral capsular extension over popliteus to the head of the fibula, called the arcuate popl iteal ligament. • Medially, it is reinforced by the medial patella retinaculum (an expansion of vastus medialis and fascia Iota). • Laterally, it is reinforced by the lateral patella retinaculum (an expansion of the vastus lateralis and the iliotibial tract). b) The synovial capsule • It inserts into the margins of the articular surfaces. • It lines the deep surface of the fibrous capsule and its modifications, except the patella and the patella ligament. • Here, it is reflected as the infrapatella and alar synovial folds. • Posteriorly, it is invaginated by the cruciate ligaments, and thus covers their anterior aspects and sides. • Superiorly, it forms the suprapatellar bursa extending between the femur and the quadriceps femoris. Ligamentous support • The ligamentous support of the knee joint can be divided into external ligaments and internal ligaments. The Lower Limb External ligaments • The ex ternal ligaments su pport the fibrous capsule on its ex ternal surface. • The ligaments are: a) The patellar l i gament • This connects the patella to the tibi al tuberosity. • The superior part of the deep s urface of the ligament is seperated from the synovi al membrane of t he knee joi nt by an infrapatellar fat pad. • Below, the deep s urface of t he ligament i s seperated from the ti bia by the deep i nfrapat ella bursa. • The medial and later al patellar reti nacula are fused wi th the corresponding edge of the pat ellar ligament. b) The collateral ligament • Functionally, the collateral li gaments prevent lateral mov ements a t the knee j oint. • T h e two collateral ligaments are: i) Medial (tibial) collat eral l igament • T he medial collateral ligament is broad and strap- like. • It extends from the medial epi condyle of the femur to the medial condyle and superi or part of the medial surface of the tibia. • The deep fibr es of the ligament are fused with the capsul e of the knee joi nt and the medial meniscus. i i) Lateral (fibular) collateral ligament • The lateral collateral ligament is round and cord-like. • It ex tends from the lateral epi condyle of the femur to the lateral surface of the head of the fibula. • It is seperated from the lateral meniscus by the tendon of popliteus. • Superiorly, the ligament is fused with the capsule of the knee but inferiorly it is seperated from the capsule by fatty tissue. c) Oblique popliteal ligament • This is an expansion of the tendon of semimembranosus. • It extends from the paste rior aspect of the medial condyle of the tibia superolaterally to attach to the posterior aspect of the capsule between the femoral condyles. d) The arcuate popliteal ligament • This is and infralateral capsular extension over the popliteus to the head of the fibula. The Internal ligaments • The internal ligaments are internal to the fibrous capsule. 21 2 a) Cruciate ligam ents • These ligaments are found wit hin the fibrous capsule of the joint but outside the syn ovial cavity. • They are cover ed by synovial membrane on their an teri or aspectc and sides. • Functi onally, they prevent movements of the k nee join t in the anteroposterior directi on. • T hey are named anterior an d posteri or a ccordin g to thei r si te of attachment to the tibia. • The an teri or cr u ci ate ligament is t aut thro ughout the enti re range of movement of the k nee j oint, whilst the posterior cr uciate ligament is taut inflex ion only. i ) The anterior cruciate ligament • This is the weaker of the two ligaments. • It ari ses from the anterior part of the inter condy lar area of the tibia, behind the anter ior horn of t he medial meniscus. • It passes superior ly, posteriorly and laterally to attach to the posterior part of the medial surface of the lateral condyle of the femur. • It pr events the tibia from being moved forwards on the femur in ex tensi on. ii) The poster ior cruciate li gament • This arises from the posterior part of the intercondylar area of the tibia, behind the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. • It passes s u periorly, anteriorly and medially to the anteri or part of the ateral sur face of the medial condyle of the femur. • It prevents the tibia from being moved back wards on the femur inflexion. b) T r ansverse ligament of the knee • This is a small band, which connects the anteri or part of the two menisci. c) The coronary ligament • It att aches the thick peri pheral margins of the respective meni scus to the fibrous capsule. d) The meniscofemoral ligaments • Anterior and posterior meni scofemoral ligaments may be present. • The posterior meniscofemoral ligament (of Wrisburg) passes from the posterior aspect of the lateral meniscus to the medial femoral condyle, just behind the attachment of the posterior cruciate l i gament. • The anterior meniscofemoral ligament follows a similar course anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament. The Menisci • There is a medial and a lateral meniscus. The Lower Limb • Each meniscus is a crescent-shaped plate of fibro-cartilage, which is interposed between the periphery of the condylar surfaces of the femur and tibia. • Functionally they act as shock absorbers and increase the stability of the knee joint. • The two menisci are joined at their anterior edges by the transverse ligament of the knee. a) The lateral meniscus • This is nearly circular in shape. • The anterior and posterior horns attach to their respective areas on the intercondylar eminence of the tibia. • The tendon of popliteus seperates the lateral meniscus from the lateral (fibular) collateral ligament. • An anterior and/or posterior maeniscofemoral ligament may be present. b) The medial meniscus • This is C-shaped and the horns are further apart. • The anterior horn is attached to the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia, in front of the anterior cruciate ligament. • The posterior horn is attached to the posterior intercondylar area, in front of the posterior cruciate ligament. • The medial meniscus is fused on the medial side with the tibial collateral ligament. Bursae • There are twelve bursae. • They are clinically only important when they become inflamed (Bursitis). • Anteriorly, there are three subcutaneous and two subtendinous bursae: a) The subcutaneous prepatellar bursa protects the skin over the distal part of the patella e. g. when kneeling while scrubbing. b) The subcutaneous infrapatella bursa protects the skin over the patella ligament e.g. when kneeling while praying. c) The subcutaneous bursa of the tibial tuberosity protects the skin covering the tuberosity e.g. when kneeling and sitting on the heels. d) The suprapatellar bursa under quadriceps tendon. e) The deep infrapatellar bursa deep to the distal half of the patellar ligament. • Medially, there are four subtendinous bursae: a) The subtendinous bursa of sartorius lies deep to tendon of sartorius as it crosses the upper edge of the medial tibial condyle. b) The anserine bursa separates the tendons of sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus from the proximal part of the medial surface of the tibia and the medial collateral ligament. c) The subtendinous medial gastrocnemius bursa seperates the head of gastrocnemius from the condylar capsule. d) The semimembranosus bursa between the tendon of semimembranosus and the medial collateral ligament. 213 • Laterally there are three subtendinous bursae: a) The inferior bicipital bursa between the biceps femoris tendon and the lateral collateral ligament. b) The subtendinous lateral gastrocnemius bursa seperates the lateral head of gastrocnemius from the condylar capsule. c) The sub-popliteal r ecess ensheathes the popliteal tendon from below. Movements • The movements at the knee joint can be explained by the shape of the femoral condylar surfaces. • The posterior 2/3 of both condyles are parallel and co-extensive thus allowing flexion and extension (the principal movements). • The anterior 1 /3 of the medial condylar surface extends laterally onto the patellar surface thus allowing rotation of the femur on the tibia. • This medial rotation, i. e. of the femur on a fixed tibia, occurs at the terminal phase of extension or the initial phase of flexion. • In this position the knee is locked and minimal muscular effort is required to maintain this position. • The quadriceps muscle is relaxed, but the iliotibial tract is tense. • The movements of the knee joint are: Muscles Producino Movement Flexion The muscles of the posterior compartment of the thigh, assisted by gastrocnemius (popliteus initiates flexion by unlockino the knee ioint) Extension Quadriceps femoris Medial Rotation Popliteus, sartorius, gracilis, semimembranosus, (femur semitendinosus rotates on fixed tibia) Lateral Rotation Biceps femoris (tibia rotates on fixed femur) Vasculature • The arteries which supply the knee joint: a) Genicular branches of the popliteal artery (continuation of the femoral artery). b) The descending genicular branch of the femoral artery. c) The anterior tibial artery (branch of the popliteal artery). d) The descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery (branch of the profunda femoris). The Lower Limb The Anastomoses around the Knee Joint • These anastomoses occur at the front and the sides of the knee joint, just proximal and distal to the patella, and just proximal to the tibial tuberority. • The anastomoses on the medial side involves the articular branch of the descending genicular artery (branch of the femoral artery) anastomosing with the superior medial and inferior medial genicular arteries (branches of the popliteal artery). • The anastomoses on the lateral side involves the following arteries anastomosing: a) The descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery (branch of profunda femoris artery). b) The superior lateral and inferior lateral genicular arteri es (branches of the popliteal artery). c) The anterior and posterior tibial recurrent arteries (branches of the anterior tibial artery). d) The circumflex fibular branch (branch of the posterior tibial artery). Innervation • The innervation is by: a) The femoral nerve through its branches to the vasti. b) The posterior branch of the obturator nerve. c) The tibial and the common fibular nerve (branches of the sciatic nerve) • These both give off articular branches. • The common fibular nerve also gives off a recurrent articular nerve. B Overview of Compartments of the leg • The tibia, fibula, interosseus membrane and the intermuscular septa divide the leg into 3 compartments. • The anterior and posterior intermuscular septa extend from rhe fibular to the deep fascia. • The compartments are: a) The anterior compartment • This compartment is located anterior to the interosseus membrane, medial to the anterior intermuscular septum and lateral to the lateral surface of the tibia. b) The posterior compartment • This compartment is bound by the tibia, the interosseus membrane, and the posterior intermuscular septum. c) The lateral compartment • This compartment is bound by the anterior and posterior inermuscular septa, and the lateral surface of the fibula. 214 C The Anterior Compartment of the Leg Contents • The compartment contains four muscles, which are primarily concerned with dorsi-flexion or extension of the foot at the ankle joint, and the extension of the toes. • All these muscles are supplied by the anterior tibial artery (branch of the popliteal artery) and innervated by the deep fibular nerve (branch of the common fibular nerve). The Anterior Tibial Artery Origin and Course • The anterior tibial artery begins at the lower border of popliteus when the popliteal artery bifurcates. • It then passes through the proximal aperture in the interossseus membrane and descends on the anterior surface of the interosseus membrane, lying between extensor hallucis longus and tibialis anterior. • Distally, the tibial artery lies on the lateral surface of the tibia, and then it runs over the capsule of the ankle joint and becomes t he dorsalis pedis artery. Branches • The Anterior Tibial Recurrent artery, which arises near the proximal end of the anterior tibial artery and then runs to the knee joint, where it forms part of the anastomoses around the knee joint. • The anterior medial malleolar artery, which runs towars the medial malleolus. • The anterior lateral malleolar artery which runs towards the lateral maleolus and anastomoses with the perforating branch of the fibular artery. The Deep Fibular Nerve Origin and Course • This nerve is derived from the common fibular nerve. • It runs deep to extensor digitorum longus to reach the anterior surface of the interosseus membrane. • Here, it lies lateral to the anterior tibial artery and deep to extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior. • In the middle of the leg the nerve lies deep to extensor hallacis longus. • In the distal part of the leg, the nerve lies between the anterior tibial artery and the tendon of extensor hallucis longus on its medial side and the tendon of extensor digitorum longus on its lateral side. • It passes deep to the superior and inferior extensor retinacula and divides into medial and lateral branches. Branches of the Deep Fibular Nerve The Lower Limb • Muscular branches to the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg. • A branch to the ankle joint. • A medial branch, which runs on the lateral side of dorsalis pedis artery and supplies dorsal digital nerves to the adjacent sides of the first interdigital cleft and first metatarsophalangeal joint. • A lateral branch, which passes deep to extensor digitorum brevis to supply that muscle, the tarsal joints and the other metatarsophalangeal joints. Clinical • Deep Fibular Nerve Paralyses: this results in numbness over the dorsum of the foot and an inability to dorsiflex the foot with extensor digitorum longus. D The Lateral Compartment of the Leg Contents • It contains two muscles, which ore primarily involved in plantar-flexion and eversion of the foot. • The muscles are supplied by the superficial fibular nerve (branch of the common fibular nerve). • There is no single artery which supplies the lateral compartment. • Blood supply of the muscles is derived from the muscular branches of the fibular artery (branch of the posterior tibial artery). The Superficial Fibular Nerve Origin and Course • This nerve is one of the terminal branches of the common fibular nerve. • It runs between fibularis longus and fibularis brevis, supplying both of them. • Distally, it lies between fibularis brevis and the anterior inermuscular septum. • In the distal third of the leg, it pierces the deep fascia and becomes the superficial cutaneous nerve. Branches of the Superficial Fibulor Nerve a) Medial dorsal cutaneous nerve • This supplies the dorsal digital nerves to the medial 2 % toes (it is assisted in the first cleft by the medial branch of the deep fibular nerve). b) Intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve • This supplies dorsal digital nerves to the fibular 2 % toes (it is assisted on the lateral side of the litt le toes by the sural nerve). 215 The Lower Limb 216 Muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg: Muscle Features Proximal Attachment Distal Attachment Actions Innervation Tibialis Anterior A fusiform muscle a) The proximal 2/3 of the a) Media cuneiform bone a) Dorsal flexes/extends Deep fibular lateral surface of the tibi a b) Base of the first metatarsal the foot nerve bl lnterosseus membrane bl Inverts the foot Extensor H allucis A fusiform muscle a) The middle parts of the The dorsum of the base of the distal a) E x tends the hallux Longus anterior surface of the phalanx of t he hallux b) Darsi-flexes the foot fibula (medial to the attachment of extensor digitorum longus) b) The interosseus membrane Extensor Digitorum a) The lateral condyle of the By four tendons to the dorsum of the a) Extends the lateral four Long us tibia, next to the proximal bases of the middle and distal toes attachment tibiofibular phalanges of the lateral four toes b) Darsi-flexes the foot joint This is attachment is via extensor b) The proximal % of the expansions anterior surface of the fibul a c) Parts of the interosseus membrane Fibularis Tertius Partially fused Distal 1 /.i of the anterior surface Dorsum of the base of the fifth a) Darsi-flexes the foot with extensor of the fibula metatarsal b) Everts the foot digitorum longus Muscles of Lateral Compartment of Leg Muscle Featurs Proximal Attachment Distal Attachment Actions Innervation Fibularis Longus A fusiform muscle The head of the fibula The lateral side of the Everts the foot Superficial fibular nerve Proximal 2/3 of the lateral medial cuneiform bone Plantar flexes the foot surface of the fibula The base of the first metatarsal Fibularis Brevis A fusiform muscle The distal 2/3 of the The dorsal surface of the lateral surface of the tuberosity on the base of fibula, overlapping the the fifth metatarsal distal parts of the attachment of fibularis longus, in the middle of the bone The Lower Limb E The Posterior Compartment of the Leg Contents • The muscles in the group are further subdivided by a transverse intermuscular septum into a superficial and a deep group. • The neurovascular plane lies between the two groups and contains the posterior tibial artery and the tibial nerve (see popliteal fossa for discussion). The Posterior Tibial Artery Origin and Course • This is formed by the bifurcation of the popliteal artery at the lower edge of popliteus muscle. • It descends between the superficial and deep muscular layers of the posterior compartment. • During its descent it is accompanied by the tibial nerve and veins. • In the lower 1 /3 of the leg it becomes superficial and at the ankle joint lies between the tendon of flexor digitorum longus medially, and the tendon of flexor hallucis longus laterally. • It passes deep to the flexor retinaculum, and then divides into lateral and medial plantar arteries. Branches a) The fibular artery • This arises a few centimetres below the origin of the posterior tibial artery and then runs inferolaterally on tibialis posterior. • Distally, it passes between tibialis posterior and flexor hallucis longus and breaks into the following branches: i) A perforating branch, which passes through the distal aperture of the interosseus membrane, where it anastomoses with the anterior malleolar arteries. ii) A nutrient branch to the fibula. b) A nutrient branch to the tibia, which is its largest branch. c) Muscular branches to the muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg. d) The circumflex fibular branch, which runs laterally around the neck of the fibula t o anastomose with the inferior geniculate artery. e) The medial plantar artery, which is one of its terminal branches. f) The lateral plantar artery, which is the other terminal branch. g) A communicating branch, which runs laterally and anastomoses with the fibular artery, just proximal to the end of the tibia. 217 The Lower Limb 218 Muscle Features Proximal Attachment Distal Attachment Actions Innervation Superficial Group of Muscles Gastroc A fusiform, two This is by 2 heads: a) Via tendo-calcaneus to the a) Plantar flexes the foot The Tibial Nerve nemius headed muscle a) The lateral head attaches to a pit on the posterior surface if the b) Flexes the leg (L4, 5, S 1,2,3) This muscle lateral fem oral condyle calcaneus c) The contraction of this muscle together with b) The medial head attaches to the popliteal b) The tendon of the sloeus blends produces rapid movements as in soleus, forms the surface of the femur, superior to the medial with the tendon of jumping or running triceps surae condyle gastrocnemius to form the muscle tendo-calcaneus or achilles Soleus A broad, flat a) The posterior aspect of the head of the tendon a) Plantar flexes the foot muscle resembles fibula c) A bursa separates the tendon b) Steadies the leg on the foot a sole, a type of b) The proximal 1 /i of the posterior surface of from the posterior border of c) The contraction of this muscle fish the fibula between the medial crest and cacaneus produces slow movement such as in posterior border walking c) The soleal line d) The medial border of the tibia e) A tendinosus arch between the fibular attachment and the proximal end of the soleal line on the tibia Plantaris Fusiform proximal The popliteal surface of the femur, just above Posterior surface if the calcaneus a) Weakly assists gastrocnemius in: belly with a long the lateral condyle medial to the attachment of the b) Plantar flexes of the foot tendon calcaneal tendon. c) Flexes of knee It may also insert into calcaneal tendon Deep Group of Muscles Popliteus A flat triangular a) By a tendon to the lateral surface of the The posterior surface of the tibia a) It unlocks the leg by rotating the femur The Tibial Nerve muscle femoral condyle, below the attachment of proximal to the soleal line laterally on the fixed tibia (L4, 5, S 1,2,3) The proximal gastrocnemius b) It simultaneously pulls the lateral attachment is b) By a tendon to posterior surface of the meniscus posteriorly, preventing it from inside the fibrous lateal meniscus of the knee joint becoming damaged capsule of the c) It weakly flexes the knee joint knee joint Flex or A fusiform a) The posterior surface of the fibula between a) The base of the distal phalanx a) Flexes the hallux at all joints Hallucis bipennate the medial crest and the posterior border of the hallux b) Plantar flexes the foot Long us muscle b) The distal third of the interosseus b) Gives off two slips to the c) Provides the initial motion for membrane tendons of flexor digitorum propelling the body forwards c) The posterior intermuscular septum longus to the 2nd and 3rd toes Flex or A fusiform a) The medial part of the posterior surf ace of Via four tendons to the plantar a) Flexes all the phalanges of the lateral Digitorum bipennate the tibia, inferior to the soleal line surf aces of the bases of the distal four toes Longus muscle b) By a broad aponeurosis to the medial crest phalanges of the lateral four toes b) Plantar flexes the foot of the fibula Tibialis A bipennate, a) The posterior surface of the tibia inferior to By a tendon to the tuberosity of the a) Inverts the foot Posterior fusiform muscle soleal line navicular, from where the ligaments b) Plantar flexes the foot b) The posterior surface of the fibula between radiate out to: the medial crest and the interosseus border c) The tarsal bones, except the a) The interosseus membrane talus d) T he bases of the metatarsals 2,3,4 The Lower Limb F The Retinacula of the Ankle • There are five retinacula situated in the ankle region, which prevent the tendons of the extrinsic muscles of the foor from bowOstringing. • These tendons are all enclosed in synovial sheathes as they pass deep to the retinacula.

THE CERVICAL VISCERA Divisions • The cervical vi scera are related anteriorly to the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles and posteriorly to the prevertebral layer of deep fascia overlying the prevertebral muscles. • The cervical viscera can be divided into thr ee layers: a) A superficial layer containing the thyroid, the parathyroid and thymus glands (refer to thorax). b) A middle layer containing the larynx and the trachea (refer to thorax). c) A deep l ayer contai ning the pharynx and the oesophagus (refer to thorax). A The Thyroid Gland 70,71,72 • The thyroid gland is large, highly vascular endocrine gland. Position • It is located anterior to the bodies of C5, 6, 7 in the superficial vi sceral layer of the neck. Capsule • The thyroid gland is enclosed in a thin, true capsule of connective tissue. • External to this capsule is the pretracheal layer of the deep fascia forming a false capsule. • The pretracheal layer of deep fascia binds the thyroid gland to the larynx above, and the trachea below, causing the gland to move up and down with the larynx during swallowing. Structure • The thyroid gland consists of pear-shaped left and right lobes, which lie anterior to the upper six tracheal cartilages. • The two lobes are joined across the midline by an isthmus which lies anterior to the 2nd to 4th tracheal cartilages. • An occasional third lobe, the pyramidal lobe, usually projects from the left side of the isthmus. • The pyramidal lobe may be attached to the hyoid bone by a muscular band called the levator glandulae thyroideae. Relations • Anterior a) The strap muscles of the infrahyoid region b) The pretracheal layer of deep fascia. 247 • Posterior a) The upper six tracheal cartilages b) The thyroid and cricoid cartilages. • Posterolateral a) The carotid sheath (IJV, Vogus nerve, CCA). Vasculature • The arterial supply is by: a) The paired superior thyroid arteries (branches of the external carotid arteries). b) The paired inferior thyroid arteries (branches of the thyrocervical trunk). c) An inconsistent, unpaired thyroidea ima artery (branch of the brachiocephalic trunk or the aortic arch or the right common carotid artery). • The venous drainage is by: a) The paired superior and middle thyroid veins which drain into the corresponding internal jugular vein. b) The paired inferior thyroid veins which drain into the corresponding brachiocephalic vein. Lymphatic Drainage • The lymphatics of the thyroid gland pass i nto the pretracheal and prelaryngeal lymph nodes. • From here the lymph drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes. Innervation • The nerve supply is from the superior and middle cervical sympathetic ganglia, reaching the gland via periarterial plexuses, and the vagus nerve. Clinical: EctopicThyroid tissue: May occur anywhere along the embryological migration pathway. Thyroid Goitre: If large it may exert pressure on surrounding structures, especially the trachea.

The Unpaired Cartilages Thyroid Cartilage Features • The thyroid cartilage, composed of two laminae hyaline cartilages, i s the largest of the laryngeal cartilages. • Anteriorly, the two lamina are fused in the midline to form an acute angle, the laryngeal prominence which is more prominent in men (\"Adams apple\"). • Superior to the laryngeal prominence, the laminae diverge to form a V-shaped superior thyroid notch. • Posteriorly, the laminae are prolonged superiorly and inferiorly to form the superior and inferior horns respectively. • The superior border & sup. Horns attach to the hyoid bone by the thyrohyoid membrane. • The thi ck median part of this membrane is the median thryohyoid ligament and its lateral parts are the lateral thyrohyoid ligament. The Neck • These ligaments and the vocal ligaments (except the rimaglottis) close the laryngeal inlet. Borders and surfaces • On the superior border, superior to the laryngeal prominence, is a notch called the superior thyroid notch which is more prominent in men. • Also on the super ior border, anterior to the greater cornu, is a superior tubercle. • On the inferior border is a lesser tubercle which divides the border into two slight concavities. • The oblique line joins the superior and the inferior tuber cles. • It provides attachment, from anterior to posterior, for: a) The thyrohyoid muscle. b) The sternothyroid muscle. c) The i nferior constrictor of the pharynx. Artie ulations • The main articulation is at the cricothyroid joints. • These are between the i nferior horns of thyroid cartilage and the lateral surfaces of the cricoid cartilage. • The main movements of the joints are rotation and sliding of the thyroid cartilage. • These movements result in a change in the length of the vocal folds. The Cricoid Cartilage • It consists of hyaline cartilage and resembles a signet ring with a board lamina posteriorly and a narrow arch anteriorly. Borders and surfaces • The superior border slopes upwards towards the posterior part of the cartilage and is attached to the inferior border of the thyroid cartilage by the cri cothyroid ligament. • The inferior border is nearly horizontal and is attached anteriorly to the first tracheal cartilage by the cricotracheal ligament. • On either side of the ridge is a fossa for the attachment of the posterior crico- arytenoid muscle. Articulations • The cricoid cartilage has two sites important to articulation on each side: a) The cricoarytenoid joint • This joint is between the base of each arytenoids cartilage and the superior border of the cricoid cartilage. • The main movements of the joints are: i) A gliding movement in which the arytenoids move towards or away from one another. 249 ii) A pivot movement in which the arytenoids swivel on the cricoid around a vertical axis, therefore rotate. • These movements result in changes in the length of the vocal folds and the abduction and adduction of the vocal folds. • The movement of the crico-arytenoid joint on one side usually involves the movement of the joint on the other side, but the joints can move independently. b) The cricothryoid joint • (See Thyroid cartilage) The Epiglottis • This is a leaf- shaped yellow, elastic cartilaginous plate. • It has a broad superior free end and a narrow tapered inferior end, which is attached to the posterior aspect of the thyroid angle by the thyro-epiglottic ligament. • The epiglottis extends upwards and is connected to the superior border of the hyoid bone by the hyo-epiglottic ligament. • On each side it is attached to the arytenoids by the ary-epiglottic folds. • The epiglottis has a bulge, called the tubercle of the epiglottis, situated on the inferior part of its posterior surface. • Situated posterior to the root of the tongue and hyoid bone, and anterior to the laryngeal inlet. • It forms the superior margin of the laryngeal inlet. The Paired Cartilages a) The Arytenoid Cartilages • Each arytenoids is shaped like a three-sided pyramid and consists of: i) A base which articulates with the upper border of the cricoid cartilage in a ball-and-socket joint. ii) An apex which curves posteromedially and bears the corniculate cartilage. iii) A vocal process which projects horizontally anteriorly to which the vocal ligament is attached. iv) A muscular process which projects posterolaerally. b) The Corniculate and Cuneiform Cartilages • These small structures are located in the posterior part of the aryepiglottic fold. • On each side the corniculate cartilage (medial) is attached to the apices of the arytenoids cartilages. The Neck 250 • On each side the cuneiform cartilage (lateral) are found in the ary- epiglottic folds and help strengthen the folds. Muscles of the Larynx • The larynx has both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles a) The extrinsic muscles of the larynx • The extrinsic muscles of the larynx move the larynx as a whole and can be divided into: • The infrahyoid muscles which depress the hyoid bone and thus the larynx. • The suprahyoid muscles which elevate the hyoid bone and thus the larynx. b) The intrinsic muscles of the larynx • The intrinsic muscles of the Larynx concerned with the movement of some of the cartilages of the larynx, which results in changes in the length and thus the tension of the vocal folds. • The intrinsic muscles of the larynx can be divided into the following function groups: i) The adduction's of the vocal cords (lateral cricoarytenoid). ii) The abductors of the vocal cords (posterior cricoaryteniod). iii) The tensors of the vocal cords (cricothyriod). iv) The relaxers of the vocal cords (thyroarytenoid and vocalis). v) The sphincters of the laryngeal aditus (transverse and oblique arytenoids and the aryepigottic).

The Neck The Ligaments and Membranes of the Larynx The thyrohyoid membrane • This membrane suspends the larynx from the hyoid bone. • It is thickened in the median plane and laterally thus forming the median and lateral thyrohyoid ligaments respectively. • The lateral thyrohyoid ligament runs between the greater cornu of the hyoid bone and the superior horn of the thyroid cartilage. The cricothyroid and cricotracheal ligaments • The cricothyroid ligament connects the cricoid cartilage with the arch of the thyroid cartilage. • The cricotracheal ligament connects the cricoid cartilage with the first tracheal ring. The vocal fold, the vocal ligament and the conus elasticus • The vocal ligaments extends from the internal aspect of the angle of the thyroid cartilage anteriorly to the vocal process of the respective arytenoid cartilage posteriorly. • The ligament forms the free edge of the conus elasticus or cricothyroid ligament. • The vocal fold (also called the vocal cords) is formed on each side by the vocal ligament, the conus elasticus, muscle fibers and the covering mucous membrane. • The opening between the two vocal folds is called the rimaglottis and changes shape during movement of the vocal folds. • The vocal folds are responsible for voice production. The quadrangular membrane and the vestibular ligament • The quadrangular membrane extends from the epiglottic cartilage superiorly to the arytenoid cartilage inferiorly. • The superior free edge is the aryepiglottic fold that separates the larynx from the piriform recess of the pharynx. • The inferior free edge is the vestibular ligament which extends between the thyroid and aryetenoid cartilages. • It is covered by mucosa to form the vestibular folds (false vocal cords). • The opening between the two vestibular folds is called the rima vestibuli. • The vestibular folds are not involved in voice production. Ligaments of the epiglottis • The ligaments related to the epiglottis are: a) The hyoepiglottic that ligament extends between the epiglottis and the hyoid bone. 252 b) The median glossoepiglottic ligament that extends between the epiglottis and the posterior part of the tongue. c) The lateral glossoepiglottic ligament that extends between the epiglottis and the side of the pharynx. d) The thyroepiglottic ligament extends between the epiglottis and the thyroid cartilage. • Mucous membranes cover the epiglottis and are reflected onto the posterior part of the tongue to form a median and two lateral glossoepiglottic folds. • The depression between the folds is known as the epiglottic vallecula. The Laryngeal Orifice/Inlet Boundaries • Anterosuperior: The Epiglottis. • Lateral: The two aryepiglottic folds. • Posteroinferior: lnterarytenoid fold. The Interior of the Larynx • The laryngeal cavity extends from the laryngeal inlet to the level of the inferior border. • The interior of the larynx is divided into three compartments by the vestibular and vocal folds. • The vestibule: The area above the vestibular folds. • The ventricle: The recess formed between the vestibular and the vocal folds. • The infraglottic compartment: The area below the vocal folds . Vasculature and Lymphatics of the Larynx • Arterial supply is by: a) The superior laryngeal artery (branch of the superior thyroid artery) which runs with the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve through the thyrohyoid membrane. b) The inferior laryngeal artery (branch of the inferior thyroid artery). • Venous drainage corresponds to the arterial supply. • The lymph drains into the prelaryngeal and pretracheal nodes, as well as into the deep cervical nodes directly. Innervation of the Larynx • The larynx is innervated by branches of the vagus nerve (CN X). • These branches are: a) The recurrent laryngeal nerve • This innervates all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid muscle (which supplied by the external laryngeal nerve). • It also supplies the infraglottic portion of the laryngeal mucosa. The Neck b) The superior laryngeal nerve • This nerve divides into an internal and an external branch. • The external branch supplies the cricothyroid muscle. • The internal branch supplies the supraglottic portion of laryngeal mucosa. Laryngeal inlet • The aditus is located obliquely in the anterior wall of the laryngopharynx, facing posterosuperiorly. • The aditus is bound: a) Anteriorly by the upper free edge of the epiglottis. b) Posteriorly by the interarytenoid notch, a small notch between the two arytenoid cartilages. c) Laterally on either side by the aryepiglottic fold which has two tubercles in its posteroinferior end containing the cuneiform and corniculate cartilages. Clinical: Tracheostomy: An opening in the trachea, used for patients who can't breathe on their own. It involves splitting the strap muscles, passing through the deep fascia and removing the isthmus. A safer emergency procedure is to pass a needle of tube through the cricothyroid membrane, just above the cricothyroid cartilage. (Abrahams et al.,2003) Recurrent Laryngeal nerve damage: A complication of thyroid surgery, and causes paralysis of the vocal cords. When the paralysis is bi lateral the voice is almost absent, as the vocal folds can not be adducted. When it is unilateral damage, injury can't be detected in normal speech. 253 D The Pharynx 59-71 Position of the Pharynx • The pharynx lies in the deep layer of cervical viscera i.e. posterior to the trachea and the larynx but anterior to the prevertebral fascia. • Between the pharynx and the prevertebral fascia anteriorly is a potential space called the retropharyngeal space. • The pharynx extends from the base of the skull, where the posterior nasal cavities open into it, to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage, where it becomes continuous with the oesophagus. • Its widest opposite the hyoid bone and narrowest where i t becomes continuous with the oesophagus. The Wall of the Pharynx • The wall of the pharynx consists of the following layers, from external to internal: a) A thin external fascial lining called the buccopharyngeal fascia. b) A muscular layer. c) A strong internal fascial lining called the pharyngobasilar fascia. d) A submucosa and mucosa. The Muscles of the Pharynx • The muscles of the pharynx can be divided into an extrinsic and an intrinsic group. • All the muscles (except styolpharungeus) are innervated by the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve via the pharyngeal plexus. The Extrinsic Muscles of the Pharynx • This group of muscles consists of palatopharyngeus, salpingopharyngeus and stylopharyngeus. • The main function of these muscles is to elevate the larynx and the pharynx during speech. The Intrinsic Muscles of the Pharynx • This group of muscles consists of the superior, middle and inferior constrictors of the pharynx. • The muscles are arranged in such a way that the superior constrictor is innermost, the middle constrictor is intermediate and the inferior constrictor is outermost. • The constrictors meet their fellows from the opposite side posteriorly in the midline to form the pharyngeal raphe. • The pharyngeal raphe is attached superiorly to the pharyngeal tubercle of the occipital bone. • The main function of the muscles is to propel food into the oesophagus during swallowing. The Neck 254 The Pharyngeal Gaps • Gaps are formed at the places where the superior, middle and inferior constrictors overlap. • These gaps allow structures to pass in and out of the pharynx. • The gaps are: a) The gap above the superi or constrictor allows passage of the auditory tube, levator veli palatini and the ascending palatini artery (branch of the facial artery). b) The gap between the superior and the middle constrictors allows passage of the stylohyoid ligament, the glossopharyngeal nerve and the stylopharyngeus muscle. c) The gap between the middle and the inferior constrictors allows passage of the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal artery (branch of the superior laryngeal artery). d) The gap below the inferior constrictor allows passage of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior laryngeal artery (branch of the inferior thyroid artery).

The Laryngopharynx Location • The laryngopharynx lies posterior to the larynx, and anterior to C4,5,6. • It ends at the inferior edge of the lamina of the cricoid cartilage (level of C6), where it narrows to become continuous with the oesophagus. Boundaries • Posterior and lateral walls are formed by the middle and inferior const rictors internally the wall is formed by palatopharyngeus and stylopharyngeus. • The laryngopharynx communicates with the larynx via an opening called the laryngeal inlet. The Neck Features • The lamina of the cricoid cartilage lies below the arytenoid cartilages, and is covered by the mucosa of the pharynx. The piriform recess is a small cavity which lies lateral to the lower part of the aryepiglottic fold, the arytenoid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage.

The motor fibers of the pharyngeal plexus • These fibers are derived from the accessory nerve (CN XI) and carried to the pharyngeal plexus by the vagus nerve (CN X). • The pharyngeal muscles (except stylopharyngeus and the tensor veli palatini) are thus supplied by fibers derived from the accessory nerve. The sensory fibers of the pharyngeal plexus • The sensory innervation of the pharyngeal mucosa is by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and the vagus nerve (CN X). • A large portion of the mucosa of the nasopharynx is supplied by the maxillary nerve (CN V2) via the pterygopalatine ganglion. Lymphatic drainage of the pharynx • Into the retropharyngeal and deep cervical lymph nodes. • The tonsillar lymphatic vessels drain into the jugulodigastric node. 257 5. THE PREVERTEBRAL MUSCLES • The prevertebral muscles lie deep to the prevertebr al fascia. • Some of the muscles in this group form part of the floor of the posterior triangle of the neck. • To facilitate easy description they can be divided into an anterior and a lateral group. A The lateral Group of Prevertebral Muscles • This group is made up by the scalene muscles (anterior, posterior and middle). • These muscles are presented in the table below. • The scalene muscles may be compared to the intercostal muscles of the thorax: a) Scalenus anterior corresponds to the intimal intercostal muscle. b) Scalenus medius corresponds to the internal intercostal muscle. c) Scalenus posterior corresponds to the external intercostal muscle. • In the thorax, the neurovascular plane lies between the second and the third muscular layers (from the surface). • Similarly, in the neck there is a plane between scalenus anterior and scalenus medius, in whi ch the subclavian artery and the roots of the brachia! plexus (C5 to Tl) run.

LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE OF THE HEAD AND NECK A The Tonsils 47,48,59, 60 The Tonsillar Ring • Tonsils are accumulations of lymphoid tissue forming an incomplete ring of lymphoid tissue around the superior part of the pharynx. • This is called the tonsillar ri ng or Waldeyer's ring. • The main tonsils in the pharyngeal region are the palatine tonsil, the lingual tonsil, the tubule tonsil and the pharyngeal tonsil. • The lingual tonsil forms the anterior part of the ring, the palatine and tubal tonsils form the lateral parts of the ri ng, and the pharyngeal tonsil forms the posterior part of the ring. a) The Palatine Tonsils • These tonsils are known by the layman as \"the tonsils\". Location of the Palatine Tonsils • Each of the two palatine tonsils lies in a tonsillar fossa, which is located between the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches. • The floor of the fossa is made up by the superior constrictor of the pharynx. • The tonsil is separated from this muscle by a loose connective tissue capsule the pharyngobasilar fascia. • The free surface of the tonsil is covered with mucosa, which has several slits called tonsillar crypts. Vasculature and Lymphatics of the Palatine Tonsils • The arterial supply of the palatine tonsils is by branches of: The facial artery (tonsillar and ascending palatine branches). The maxillary artery (greater palatine artery). The external carotid artery (ascending pharyngeal and lingual branches). • The venous drainage of the palatine tonsils is by: a) The external palatine vein which passes through the gap between the superior and middle constrictors and joins the pharyngeal plexus of veins. b) Other veins which also pass from the gland to open into this plexus or the common facial vein. • Lymphatic drainage of these tonsils is into the jugulodisgastric group of deep cervical lymph nodes. Innervation of the Palatine Tonsils 260 • Innervation is by: a) T he lesser palatine nerves (derived from the pterygomandibular ganglion). b) The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). b) The Pharyngeal Tonsil • These tonsils are known by the layman as \"the adenoids\". • Each is located at the junction of the r oof and posterior wall of the nasopharynx. • If the tonsil is large enough i t may interfere with nasal breathing thus forcing the person to breath through the mouth: \"adenoid facies\". c) The Tubal Tonsils • Are located around the pharyngeal openings of the auditory tubes. d) The Lingual Tonsil • Are located on the dorsum of the postsulcal part of the tongue. Clinical: • Cervical lymph node enlargement: Infections in the head and neck lymph node enlargement. The common site been the jugulodiagastric nodes located just below the angle of the jaw. I I The Neck B The Lymph Nodes of the Head and Neck 68 • The lymphatics of the cervical region consists of a superficial and a deep group . Superficial Group • The superficial group drains the superficial structures of the head and neck as well as the pharynx, larynx and tongue. • It consists of groups of lymph nodes, which are named according to their respective positions. • The groups of superficial lymph nodes are: a) The occipital nodes. b) The posterior auricular (mastoid) nodes. c) The superficial parotid nodes. d) The facial (buccal) nodes. e) The submandibular nodes. f) The submental nodes. g) The anterior superficial cervical nodes. • All of the above groups of nodes ultimately drain into the deep cervical group of lymph nodes. Deep Group • The deep group consists of a chain of lymph nodes which extend in a vertical manner from the base of the skull to the root of the neck. • Theses nodes lie deep to the deep fascia and are intimately related to the internal jugular vein. • A plane passing through the bifurcation of the common carotid artery divides the deep group into: The superior deep cervical groups of nodes • The most important of these groups is the jugulodigastric group. • This group of lymph nodes lies just superior to the entry of the common facial vein into the internal jugular vein. • This group drains lymph from the tonsils and from the postsulcal part of the tongue. The i nferior deep cervical groups of nodes • The most important of these groups is the jugulo-omohyoid group. • This group of lymph nodes lies just superior to the omohyoid tendon where it crosses the internal jugular vein. • It receives lymph from the submental and submandibular nodes and the presulcal part of the tongue. • The deep cervical nodes drain into the jugular lymph trunk which in turn drains into the thoracic duct on the left and the right lymph duct on the right (both drain into the respective subclavian vein). 261 7.

The Bones of the Cranium • The cranium is composed of a number of individual cranial bones which are firmly joined by immovabl e joints called sutures. • An instructive method of studying the skull is to consider each of the aspects of the cranium (eg. frontal aspect, lateral aspect etc.) in turn and identify the individual bones, distinctive features, sutures and foramina of that aspect. • The external features of the skull will be examined followed by the removal of the calotte and examination of the internal features. The Exterior Of The Skull The exterior of the skull may be viewed: a) From the front (normo frontalis) b) From behind (norma occipitalis) c) From the side (norma lateralis) d) From above (norma verticalis) • Each of these aspects will now be considered in turn. Norma frontalis (Anterior aspect of the skull) Constituent Bones • The constituent bones of this aspect are: a. the frontal bone b. the nasal bones c. the maxillae d. the zygomatic bones. Foramina 264 • The important foramina that can be identified from this aspect are: a. The orbit (which is described in more detail in The Orbit) b. The anterior nasal aperture. c. The supraorbital foramen or notch • This is located in the frontal bone on the superior margin of the orbit. • The supraorbital vessels and nerve traverse it. d. The infraorbital foramen • This is located in the maxillary bone inferior to the inferior margin of the orbit. • The infraorbital vessels and nerve traverse it. e. The zygomaticofacial foramen • This is situated inferior to the frontal process of the zygomatic bone. The zygomaticofacial nerve traverses it. Features • There are a number of important features in some of these bones that should be noted: The frontal bone • The anterior aspect of the frontal bone has the following features: a. The superciliary arches which are bony ridges located superior to the medial 1 12 of the supraorbital margins. b. The glabella which is a rounded median elevation located between the two superciliary arches. c. The nasion which is the point located at the junction between the internasal suture (between the two nasal bones) and the frontonasal suture (between the nasal bones and the frontal bone). d. The zygomatic process of the frontal bone that articulates with the frontal process of the zygomatic bones. The maxillae • The maxillae surround the anterior nasal apeture. • The anterior aspect of each maxilla has the following features: a. The zygomatic process of the maxilla, which articulates with the zygomatic bone. b. The alveolar process of the maxilla in which the upper teeth are located. c. The anterior nasal spine found in the midline inferior to the anterior nasal aperture where the maxillae are united. The zygomatic bone • The zygomatic bones are mainly responsible for the prominences of the cheeks. -The Head • The anteri or aspect of the zygomatic bone has the following features: a.

Norma Occipitalis (Posterior aspect of the skull) Constituent Bones • The constituent bones of this aspect are: a. the parietal bone b. the squamous part of the occipital bone c. mastoid processes of the temporal bones. Sutures • There are no important foramina from this aspect but there are a number of sutures: i. The lambdoid suture which separates the parietal bones anteriorly from the occipital bone posteriorly (the suture is so-called because it is shaped like the greek symbol lambda). ii. The occipitomastoid suture which separates the occipital bone medially from the mastoid process laterally. Features On the occipital bone, there are a number of important features. a) The inion • The inion is the summit of a bony elevation called the extenal occipital protuberance. • This protuberance is located in the middle of the squamous part of the occipital bone. • It gives attachment to the ligamentum nuchae. b) The nucha/ lines • On each side of the inion there are two ridges. • The uppermost of the two ridges is called the highest nuchal line. • The lateral part of this ridge gives attachment to the occipitalis. • The second ridge is the superior nuchal line. • The lateral 1 h of this ridge gives attachment to sternocleidomastoid and splenius capitis (which attaches deep to sternocleidomastoid). • The medial 1 h of this ridge gives attachment to trapezius. c) The external occipital crest • The external occipital crest passes from the inion to the foramen magnum. d) The inferior nuchal line • Passes laterally on each side from the middle of the external occipital crest. 265 Norma lateralis (Lateral aspect of the skull) Constituent Bones • The constituent bones of this aspect are: i.

Clinical: Burr Holes: In a surgical intervention, holes are drilled through the skull to relieve intra- cranial pressure (in for e. g subdural haemorrhage's). In the distant past this 'trephination' was used to release 'evil spirits' Calvaria fractures: depressed fractures: a traumatic blow to a thin area of skull causing fragment of bone to depress inwards and compress or injure the brain. Linear skull fractures: the most frequent of calvaria fractures, these usually occur at the point of impact but fracture lines often radiate away from it in two or more directions Comminuted fractures: The bone is broken in several pieces after trauma. If the area of calvaria is thick at the point of fracture, the bone may bend in without fracturing, causing a fracture some distance from this point if calvaria is thinner there. Cantre-coup fractures: no fracture occurs at the point of impact, but one occurs at the opposite end of the skull. Norma basalis (Inferior and exterior aspect of the skull) • We will now examine the external aspect of the base of the skull. 267 Boundaries The norma basalis is bounded: a) Anteriorly by the superior incisor teeth. b) Posteriorly by the inferior nuchal lines of the occipital bone. c) Laterally, from anterior to posterior, by: i) The posterior incisor teeth. ii) The zygomatic arch. iii) The mastoid process.

Gradually the mental foramen lies nearer the superior border of the body of the mandible. In extreme cases the mental foramina disappear, exposing the mental nerves. -The Head Compression of Facial Artery: The facial artery can be occluded by pressure against mandible where vessel crosses. (see facial artery for details) Hypoglossal nerve injury: Trauma to the mandible ,such as fracture, may injure the hypoglossal nerve, resulting in paralysis and eventual atrophy of one side of the tongue. The tongue deviates to the paralyzed side during protrusion because of the unopposed action of genioglossus of other side. (see CNS, CN XII) 275 2. THE FACE A The Nerves of the Face 20-21 • The inclusion i n this section of CN V3 and CN VII is to provide a contextual understanding of the innervation of the facial structures. • A detailed discussion of CN V3 and CN VII may be found in the chapter entitled \"The Central Nervous System\". Overview of the Mandibular Nerve (CN VJ) Origin and Course • The mandibular nerve is a mixed nerve. • Its sensory component arises from the trigeminal ganglion of CN V. • The other sensory branches of the trigeminal ganglion are the opthalmic nerve CN V1 (discussed in the contents of the orbit) and the maxillary nerve CN V2. • The sensory root of the mandibular nerve leaves the skull via the foramen ovale, accompanied by the motor root of CN V. • The motor root joins the sensory component of CN V3 to form a mixed nerve. • The mandibular nerve gives off a number of branches from its trunk before splitting into an anterior and a posterior division. Branches of the Trunk of the Mandibular Nerve a) The meningeal branch which re-enters the skull via foramen spinosum, with the middle meningeal artery. b) The medial pterygoid nerve • This nerve supplies the medial pterygoid muscle. • A few fibres pass through the otic ganglion to supply tensor tympani and tensor veli palatini. Branches of the Anterior Division of CN V3 • The anterior division is mainly motor, supplying branches to the muscles of mastication (except the medial pterygoid muscle). • The motor branches are: a) The deep temporal nerve to temporalis. b) The masseteric nerve to masseter. c) The lateral pterygoid nerve to the lateral pterygoid muscle. • The anterior division does have a sensory branch, the buccal nerve, which supplies sensation to the cheek. Branches of the Posterior Division of CN V3 -The Head • The posterior division is mainly sensory, except for the motor branch to the muscles that open the jaw. a} The auriculotemporal nerve. • This nerve has two roots which surround the middle meningeal artery. • It supplies cutaneous branches to the skin of the upper part of the parotid gland, the upper part of the lateral surface of the auricle, the upper part of the external acoustic meatus and the tympanic membrane. b} The lingual nerve • This nerve is the anterior terminal branch of the posterior division of CN V3. • It is joined by chorda t ympani (branch of CN VII} just below the base of the skull. • It carries the secretomotor fibres of chorda tympani to the sublingual and submandibular glands. • It carries the taste fibres of chorda tympani to the anterior 213 of the tongue. c} The inferior alveolar nerve • This nerve is the posterior terminal branch of the posterior division of CN V3. • It descends towards the mandible and gives off the mylohyoid nerve (the motor branch of the posterior division of CN V3) which supplies the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior belly of digastric. • It then enters the mandibular canal via the mandibular foramen and supplies general sensation to the teeth of the lower jaw. • The mental nerve is its terminal branch and it emerges through the mental foramen to supply the skin of the chin and lower lip. Overview of the Facial Nerve (CN VII) Origin and course • The facial nerve consists of two roots, the facial nerve proper and the nervus intermedius. • These t wo roots arise from the brainstem and enter the internal acoustic meatus where they join to f orm a single nerve. • At the en d of the internal acoustic meatus the facial nerve enters the facial canal in the petrous part of the temporal bone. • The facial canal runs laterally, above the vestibule of the inner ear, to reach the medial wall of the epitympanic recess. • The canal then turns backwards, forming a sharp bend (the geniculum}, where the geniculate ganglion is located. 276 • The canal then runs backwards, deep to the medial wall of the middle ear, below the prominence raised by the lateral semicircular canal and above the promontory. • The canal then bends downwards to reach the stylomastoid foramen. • The facial nerve exits the skull at the stylomastoid foramen and enters the parotid gland to divide into its terminal branches. Branches a) The greater petrosal nerve • This nerve arises from the geniculate ganglion and runs anteriorly in the petrous part of the temporal bone before passing through foramen lacerum to enter the pterygoid canal. • Here it joins the deep petrosal nerve (branch of the internal carotid periarterial plexus) to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal. • This nerve synapses in the pterygopalatine ganglion, which conveys taste fibres to the soft palate and secretomotor fibres to the lacrimal gland. b) chord a tympani • This branch of the facial nerve originates in the vertical part of the facial canal. • It enters the middle ear through its posterior wall, but does not pierce its mucosa. • It runs across the tympanic membrane, lying between the dense connective tissue of the tympanic membrane and the mucosal lining of the middle ear. • At the anterior wall of the middle ear it passes through the petrotympanic fissure to emerge from the skull. • Outside the skull it joins the lingual nerve. • The chorda tympani carries secretomotor and taste fibres. • The secretomotor fibres are distributed by the lingual nerve to the sublingual and submandibular salivary glands, after synapsing in the submandibular ganglion. • The taste fibres are also distributed by the lingual nerve to the anterior 213 of the tongue. c} As the facial nerve emerges from the stylomastoid foramen, motor branches are given off to: the posterior belly of the digastric and the stylohyoid muscle, as well as the posterior auricular branch to the occipitalis, auricularis posterior and the intrinsic auricular muscles . d} In the parotid gland, the nerve divides into the temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular and cervical branches which supply the muscles of facial expression. - The Head Clinical: Facial Nerve Injury: Branches are superficial, therefore subject to trauma. Commonly damaged in fractures of the temporal bone and in surgical removal of the parotid duct (parotidectomy). Injury to the nerve or its branches produces paralysis of muscles on the affected side with or without loss of taste on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue or altered secretion of the lacrimal and salivary glands. Inflammation of Facial Nerve: Most common near the stylomastoid foramen. Produces edema and compression of the nerve in the facial canal. Effects include: loss of tone of orbicularis oculi resulting in lower lid eversion and insufficient lubrication of eye (can result in ulceration). Loss of action of orbicularis oris and buccinator affects chewing and ability to blow/whistle. The mouth droops due to unopposed contralateral muscle contraction. Food and saliva tends to 'dribble out' B The Muscles Of The Face 22 The Muscle of Facial Expression • Only the muscles of facial expression with some clinical relevance will be discussed in detail. • The muscles of facial expression lie subcutaneously and are all innervated by the facial nerve. Muscles around the eye • A discussion of these muscles can be found under \"The Eyelid\" later in this chapter. Muscles around the nose • All the muscles around the nose are innervated by the buccal branch of the facial nerve. Naso/is • This muscle consists of two parts: a) A transverse part (compressor nares) • Medially, the transverse part becomes aponeurotic over the lower part of the nose and fuses with the aponeurosis of the muscle on the other side. • Laterally, the transverse part attaches to the maxilla at the piriform aperture. • Its action is to compress the anterior nasal aperture. b) An afar part (dilator no res) 277 • Laterally this part attaches to the maxilla. • Medially it attaches to the skin over the ala of the nose. • Its action is to widen the anterior nasal apertures, such as when fl . th t ·1 . annq e nos n s m oncer. Muscle Attachments Action Procerus Extends between the aponeurosis of Draws the skin nasalis and the skin over glabella downwards wrinkling it as in frowning Depressor This extends from the maxilla to Dilates the nostrils Sep ti columella (mobile part of the nasal septum) Muscles around the mouth a) Orbicularis oris • This is a circular muscle around the mouth. • It purses the lips, closes the mouth and compresses the lips against the teeth. • It is innervated by the buccal and marginal mandibular branches of the facial nerve (CN VII). b) Buccinator • The buccinator is a rectangular muscle which lies at a deeper level than the other facial muscles. Medial The fibres of the muscle merge with those of orbicularis oris Attachment Lateral Attachment Its fibres attach to the lateral aspect of the alveolar processes of the molars in the mandible and maxilla, and also to the pterygomandibular raphe. To push the cheeks against the teeth, which is required during chewing (to push the food back under the molars), during swallowing and i n whistling it obliterates the vestibule of the mouth.

The External Veins of the Face a) The supratrochlear vein • This vein is formed by the convergence of the veins draining the forehead. • It descends in the median plane parallel with its fellow. • Each vein diverges to join the corresponding supraorbital vein to form the facial vein (here known as the angular vein) at the medial canthus of the eye. b) The supraorbital vein • The supraorbital vein runs from the zygomatic arch of the temporal bone. • It receives tributaries from the middle and superficial temporal veins. • Medially, near the medial canthus, it joins the supratrochlear nerve to form the facial nerve -The Head c) The facial vein • The facial vein is formed by the union of the supratrochlear and supraorbital veins on each side. • It is called the angular vein as it lies near the medial canthus of the eye. • It runs inferiorly through the face, lying posterior to the facial artery, but following a more direct and superficial course than the artery. • Antero-inferior to the angle of the mandible it is joined by the anterior division of the retromandibular vein. • It descends lying superficial to the loop of the lingual artery, CN XII, and the external and internal carotid arteries. • The facial vein ends by draining into the internal jugular vein. Clinical: Facial laceration: The face has no distinct deep fascia and subcutaneous tissue below. The facial muscle attachments are loose. Therefore, facial lacerations will gape. Suturing must be done with great care to prevent scarring. Compression of Facial Artery: Can be occluded by pressure against the mandible where the vessel crosses. Because of the numerous anastomoses between its branches and other facial arteries, the compression of one facial artery will not stop all bleeding. Facial Bleeding: As a rule. Facial wounds bleed freely and heal quickly Facial pulses: Superficial temporal and facial artery pulses are often measured when it is inconvenient to measure other body pulses ( eg by an anaesthesiologist at the head of an operating table). 279 D The Scalp 19 Extent • In an anteroposterior direction the scalp extends from the supraorbital margin anteriorly, to the superior nuchal line posteriorly. • Transversely, the scalp extends on each side to the level of the zygomatic arch. Layers • The scalp consists of five layers. • The first three layers are fused and are referred to as the scalp proper. • The layers are: a) Skin b) Connective tissue layer. • This connective tissue layer is very tightly adhered to the first and third layers of the scalp. • When a blood vessel in this layer is torn or cut the connective tissue tends to hold open the wound, and thus bleeding proceeds freely. c) Aponeurosis of epicranius. • This aponeurosis, also called the galeal aponeurosis, is the membranous tendon of the epicranius muscle which covers the superior aspect of the calvaria. • Anteriorly the aponeurosis is attached to the two frontal bellies of epicranius, or the frontalis muscle. Action: Elevates the eyebrows and produces wrinkles on the forehead when one frowns Innervation The temporal branch of the facial nerve • Posteriorly the aponeurosis is attached to the two occipital bellies of epicranius, orthe occipitalis muscle. Action: Pulls the scalp backwards, and produces wrinkles on the posterior part of the neck. Innervation The posterior auricular nerve (branch of the facial nerve). d) Loose connective tissue • This layer allows free movement of the scalp proper. • As it consists of loose connective tissue swelling in this layer can be extensive, as opposed to the second layer of connective tissue where swelling can only be slight. • This layer is crossed by emissary veins which connect the scalp veins in the second layer to the venous sinuses in the cranium. - The Head • These emissary veins provide a means by which infection can spread into the cranial cavity. e) Pericranium • The pericranium is a layer of dense connective tissue. • It is loosely attached to the bones of the cranial fault. • At the sutures between the bones, the pericranium is continuous with the endocranium lining the inner surface of the skull and is thus firmly attached at these structures. Clinical: Scalp Infection: The loose connective tissue layer (layer four) is the danger area of the scalp because pus or blood spreads easily here. Infection in this layer can pass into the cranial cavity through emissary veins infecting intracranial structure like the brain and meninges. An infection or fluid can enter the eyelids from the scalp because frontalis muscle inserts into the skin and subcutaneous tissue and not to bone. Consequently black eyes can result from injury to the scalp or forehead. Scalp laceration: Bleed profusely due to numerous anastomoses of branches of the ICA and the ECA. The skin margins do not retract when lacerated because they are held open by the fibrous arrangement of the dense connective tissue (layer II). Unconscious patients may bleed to death from scalp lacerations if the bleeding is not controlled. At the medial angle of the eye, an anastomosis occurs between the facial branch of the external carotid artery and cutaneous branches of the Internal carotid artery. If the Internal carotid artery suffers stenosis, this anastomosis can supply/contribute to supply of intrancranial structures. I.e. Facial art ery to dorsal nasal branch of ophthalmic artery. 280 3. THE ORAL REGION A The Oral Cavity 47 The oral cavity is divided into two parts: a) The oral vestibule b) The oral cavity proper Oral Vestibule • The space between the teeth and the buccal gingival is the oral vestibule. • It has a connection to the exterior via the mouth • Its dimensions are determined by the actions of the circumoral muscles • These muscles include: orbicularis oris, buccinator, risorius, and the depressors and elevators of the lips Oral cavity proper • The space between the upper and lower dental arches • Boundaries: Laterally and anteriorly: Superiorly: Posterior The maxillary and the mandibular alveolar arches The palate The oropharynx • At rest with the mouth closed the oral cavity proper is completely occupied by the tongue. The Cheeks • The cheeks constitute the lateral moving parts of the oral cavity • They are covered internally by a mucous membrane and externally by skin. • The primary muscle of the cheeks is buccinator • A buccal fat pad exists between the muscle and the mucous membrane and is especially prominent in infants • The cheeks are innervated by buccal branches of the mandibular nerve (CN Viii) and supplied by buccal branches of the maxillary artery. -The Head B The Lips 47 The external lip • The vermilion border indicates the borders of the lip • The skin inwards from the vermilion border is known as the transitional zone, which is hairless and highly vascular and is continous with the mucous membrane of the mouth • The upper lip lies between the nose and opening of the oral cavity • Laterally the lips are demarcated from the cheeks by the nasolabial grooves which extend from the nose and pass 1 cm lateral to the angles of the mouth, and are especially prominent when smiling • The philtrum is an intranasal hollow, which extends from the nasal septum to the vermilion border above the upper lip • The labiomental groove separates the lower lip from the chin The lntraoral lip • The labial frenula are folds of mucous membrane in the midline of the upper and lower lips, extending from the vestiular gingival to the mucosa of the lips. Vasculature of the Lips • The vessels of the lips anastomose with each other forming an arterial ring. • The upper lip: supplied by the superior labial branches of the facial and infraorbital arteries. • The lower lip: supplied by the inferior labial branches of the facial and mental arteries Innervation • Upper lip: superior labial branches of the infraorbital nerves (CN Vii) • Lower lip: inferior labial branches of the mental nerves (CN Viii) Lymphatic drainage of the lips • Lymph from the upper lip and lateral parts of the lower lip pass to the submandibular lymph nodes • Lymph form the medial part of the lower lip passes to the submental lymph nodes Clinical: The 'Danger Triangle' of the face for infection is from the corners of upper lip to the bridge of the nose. Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Lip: This usually involves the lower lip. 281 Cancer cells from the central part of the lower lip, floor of mouth and tip of tongue metastasise to submental lymph nodes. Those from lateral parts of lower lip metastise to submandibular lymph nodes. Cleft Lip: The \"harelip\" is a congenital anomaly of the upper lip. Clefts vary from a small notch in the transitional zone and vermilion border to ones extending through the lip into the nose. In severe cases the cleft ex tends deeper and is continuous with a cleft in the palate. Cleft lip may be unilateral or bilateral Cyanosis of the Lips: Dark-bluish, purplish coloration of the lips and the mucous membranes due to deficient oxygenation of capillary blood. Common discoloration in a cold environment results from decreased blood supply and increased oxygen extraction. Simple warming up reverses nonpathological vasoconstrictive cyanosis in cold lips Large Labial Frenulum: Excessively large labi al frenulum in children may cause a space between central incisor teeth. A frenulectomy reduces the frenulum and allows approximation of teeth. -The Head C The Teeth 52-53 External structure of a tooth • Each tooth consists of: a) A crown • The crown is the part of the tooth that projects from the gums. • The different teeth have different crowns, for example: i) Premolars are bicuspid. ii) The upper molars have four cusps. iii) The lower molars have five cusps. b) A neck c) A root • This is the part of the tooth that lies in the alveolus or socket. • The number of roots varies amongst the different types of teeth: i) Incisors, canines and premolars have a single root. ii) Maxillary molars have three roots. iii) Mandibular molars have four roots. Internal structure of a tooth • Each tooth has an inner core of dentine, which is covered by enamel on the crown and cement on the roots. • In the dentine is a pulp cavity which contains the nerves and blood vessels of the tooth. • The pulp cavity extends into the roots to form the root canals. Types of teeth • Children have 20 deciduous teeth. • On each side of the jaw there are: a) Two incisors which erupt at approximately 6 to 8 months. b) One canine which erupts at approximately 18 months. c) Two molars which erupt in approximately the 2nd year. • Adults have 32 permanent teeth. • On each side of the jaw there are: a) Two incisors which erupt in the 7th and 8th years respectively. b) One canine which erupts in the 9th year. c) Two premolars which erupt in the 9th and 10th years respectively. d) Three molars which erupt respectively in the 6th year, the 12th year and between puberty and the age of 25. Nerves of the teeth • The upper teeth are supplied by the maxillary nerve (CN V3) in the following way: a) The anterior superior alveolar branch supplies the canines and the incisors. b) The middle superior alveolar branch supplies the premolars. 282 c) The posterior superior alveolar branch supplies the molars. • The lower teeth are supplied by the inferior alveolar branch of the mandibular nerve (CN V2). Arteries of the teeth • The upper teeth are supplied by the following branches of the maxillary artery: a) The posterior superior alveolar artery supplies the molars and the pr emolars. b) The infraorbital artery supplies the canines and the incisors. • The lower teeth are supplied by the inferior alveolar branch of the maxillary artery (branch of the external carotid artery). Clinical Gingivitis: Improper oral hygiene results in food and bacterial deposition in the tooth and gingival crevices. The gingivae swell and redden as a result. If untreated the disease spreads to other supporting structures including alveolar bone, producing periodontitis- inflammation and destruction of alveolar bone, surrounding connective tissue and periodontal membrane. Dental caries: Decay of the hard tissues of a tooth results in the formation of dental caries (cavities). Treatment involves removal of the decayed tissue and restoration of the anatomy of the tooth with dental materials. -The Head D The Palate 48 • The palate consists of the hard palate and the soft palate. • It separates the nasal cavity above from the oral cavity below. The Hard Palate Structure • The hard palate comprises the anterior 2 13 of the palate. • It consists, from anterior to posterior, of the palatine processes of the maxillae and the horizontal plates of the palatine bones. Relations The alveolae and the gums. It becomes continuous with the soft palate. • Anteriorly: • Posterioly: Features • The hard palate has a median raphe which ends anteriorly just behind the upper incisor teeth at the incisive foramen. • This foramen is the common opening of the incisive canals which transmit the nasopalatine nerve and terminal branch of the sphenopalatine artery (branch of the maxillary artery). The Soft Palate • The soft palate forms the posterior fibromuscular 1 h of the palate. • It lies between the oropharynx and the nasopharynx and slopes backwards and downwards. • Laterally the soft palate is continuous with the wall of the pharynx and is joined to the tongue and the pharynx by the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches correspondingly. Layers of the soft palate • The soft palate consists, from superior to inferior, of the following layers: a) The posterosuperior lamina of the palatopharyngeus muscles. b) The uvula, which hangs down from the posteromedian part of the palate. c) The levator veli palatini muscle. d) The palatopharyngeus muscle. e) The tensor veli palatini muscle which forms the palatine aponeurosis. f) The palatoglossus muscle. Muscles of the Soft Palate a) Tensor veli palatini • This is a thin triangular muscle which gives rise to a tendon, which hooks around the pterygoid hamulus and runs to the soft palate. • At the soft palate it spreads out to form the palatine aponeurosis. Superior i. The lateral lamina of the auditory tube and the adjacent 283 Attachment part of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone ii. The scaphoid fossa. Inferior attachment The tendon hooks around the pterygoid hamulus and then spreads out as the palatine aponeurosis Actions: i. It tenses the soft palate. ii. It opens the pharyngeal ostium of the auditory tube to equalise air pressure between the middle ear and the pharynx. Innervation: The medial pterygoid nerve (branch of CN V3) via the otic ganglion. b) Levator veli palatini Superior attachment Inferior attachment Action The medial lamina of the auditory tube and the adjacent part of the petrous temporal bone. The upper surface of the palatine aponeurosis i. It draws the soft palate upwards and backwards. ii. It opens the pharyngeal ostium of the auditory tube to equalise air pressure between the middle ear and the pharynx. The pharyngeal branch of the vagus (CN X) via the pharyngeal plexus. Innervation c ) Uvu/ae Muse/es • These are paired muscles. Origin: The spine of the hard palate Insertion: Either side of the uvula Action: When one of the muscles contracts, it draws the uvula to the same side. Innervation: The vagus nerve (CN X). • Palatopharyngeus muscle (discussed with the muscles of the pharynx) .Pg • Palatoglossus muscle (discussed with the muscles of the tongue) .Pg Clinical Cleft Palate: A relatively common congenital defect, resulting from failure of closure of the nasopharyngeal isthmus. The infant may have difficulty suckling, being unable to generate the necessary pressure difference between the -The Head oropharynx and the nipple. Speech may be affected. The cleft may involve the uvula or it may extend through the soft and hard regions of the palate. Tonsillitis: Infection of the palatine tonsils (btw palatoglossus and palatopharyngeus). The inflamed tonsil may be packed with pus, particulary in the crypts of the lymphoid mass and even develop into and abscess(quinsy). Pain is often referred to the ear via CN IX which lies in the tonsillar bed (CN IX also supplies sensation to the middle ear). Swallowing is also made difficult. Lingual Tonsils: Lie behind the sulcus terminalis. Often inflamed bilaterally. If unilateral inflammation occurs, it may be mistakned for an early carcinoma. 284 E The Tongue 54-56 - • The tongue is a mobile, muscular organ important in articulation, mastication, _g_ eglutition and taste. c. - -·:..- r- ,.,,.... -1 or :.: , . y, 1· v ... ~. The Dorsal Surface of the Tongue • The dorsum of the tongue is divided by a V-shaped sulcus called the sulcus terminalis. • The apex of the sulcus terminalis lies posterior at a small depression called the foramen cecum. • The foramen cecum is the remnant of the embryonic thyrnglossal duct. • The region anter[.Q r to the sulcus is called the oral or presulcal part of the tongue. ~ i '\"- ·1:::..o c-l •.1 • The region e_ osterior to the sulcus is called the p)l aryngeal or postsulcol part of the tongue. • The oral and the pharyngeal parts of the tongue have different embryonic origins, and they thus have different innervation and lymphatic drainage. • The tongue is further sub-divided into a left and a right half by a median sulcus. a) The presulcal (oral) tongu!l!_ • On the dorsum of the presulcal part of the tongue are small projections of the lamina propria called 12 apillae. • These papillae differ in size and sh q pe: i. Vallate papillae are large and occur in the region immediately anterior to the sulcus terminalis. ii. Fungiform papillae are low and broad and occur at the sides of the tongue. iii. Conical papillae occur in a line which runs posterior and parallel to fhe sulcus terminalis. iv. Fili form papillae cover the greater part of the dorsum of the tongue and give the tongue its velvety appearance. v. Foliate papillae are transverse folds of mucosa and occur at the sides of the to ngue. b) The postsulcal (pharyngeal) tongue- • The postsulcal part of the tongue has no papillae. • The rr) UCosa of the dorsum of the tongue covers the lingual tonsil. • Touching this part of the tongue results in nausea.

Muscles of the Tongue • The tongue consists of intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. a) Intrinsic muscles of the tongue • These muscles are arranged in a superior longitudinal layer, a middle transverse and vertical layer, and an inferior longitudinal layer. • They arise and insert in the substance of the tongue and their function is to change the shcpe of the tongue. • The intrinsic muscles are divided into two halves by a {j brous lingual septum lying deep to the median sulcus. 285 b) Extrinsic muscles of the tongue Insertion Action Innervation a) The fibres radiate into the a) The muscle as a The hypoglossal correspondi ng half of the tongue whole depresses nerve (CN XII) from tip to base the tongue b) Some of the lower fibres insert b) The lowest fibres i nto the hyoid bone protrude the tongue The posterior half of the side of the Depress the tongue tongue, interdigitating with styloglossus The entire length of the side of the Draw the side of the tongue interdigitating with tongue upwards hvoolos sus and backwards The posterior part of the side of the Elevate posterior Pharyngeal branch tongue part of tongue, of vagus CN X via constricting isthmus pharyngeal olexus • These muscles are listed i n the table above and overpage. • The relations of the hyoglossus muscle are: Superficial: The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), the submandibular duct, the lingual nerve and submandibular ganglion, a section of the deep part of the submandibular gland Deep: The second part of the lingual artery, the terminal portion of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), the stylohyoid ligament, the middle pharyngeal constrictor muscle Vasculature of the Tongue • The main arterial supply is by the lingual arteries (branches of the external carotid arteries}. • Additional supply is derived from the tonsillar and ascending palatine arteries (branches of the facial artery} and the ascending pharyngeal arteries (branches of the external carotid artery}. • The lingual vein on each side is formed by: a} The dorsal lingual vein. b} The vena comitans of the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII}. c} The deep lingual vein. • The lingual vein droips into the common facial vei l] or directly into the internal jugular vein. Lymphatic Drainage of the Tongue • The lymphatic drainage of the tongue di ffers from region to region: a) The presu/cal tongue -The Head • There are no significant anastomoses between the lymphatic ducts on either side of the midline in the presulcal tongue thus causing lymph to drain mainly unilaterally. • The tip of the tongue drains to the submental nodes which then drain to the jugulo-omohyoid nodes. • The lateral aspects of this region drain to the submandibular nodes, which drain to the deep cervical nodes. • The central part of this region drains directly to the jugulo-omohyoLd nodes. b) The postsu/ca/ tongue • There are numerous anastomoses between the lymphatics on either side of the midline in the postsulcal tongue allowing the lymph to drain bilaterally. • The lymph mainly drains into the jugulodigastric nodes. Innervation of the tongue a) Motor innervation • The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) supplies all the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue, except palatoglossus, which is supplied by the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve (CN X) via the pharyngeal plexus • For the presulcal part of the tongue, common sensation is supplied by the lingual nerve (branch of CN Viii), whilst taste sensation is supplied by chorda tympani (branch of CN VII) • For the postsulcal part of the tongue, including the vallate papillae, common sensation and taste are supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). • In addition, the dorsum of the tongue near the epiglottis is supplied by the internal laryngeal nerve (branch of the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus). Clinical: Gag reflex: Touching stimulation of the posterior third of the tongue or posterior oropharynx causes gagging. Glossopharyngeal branches provide the afferent (sensory) part of the gag reflex. CN X and CN XI are responsible for muscular contraction of each side of the pharynx, raising the soft palate and contracting the pharyngeal muscles. Paralysis of Genioglossus muscle When paralyzed, the tongue has a tendency to fall posteriorly, obstructing the airway and presenting risk of suffocation. Total relaxation of the genioglossus occurs in general anesthesia; therefore the tongue of an anaesthetized patient must be prevented from relapsing. 286 Injury to hypoglossal nerve: Trauma, such as fracture of the mandible, may injure the hypoglossal nerve, resulting in paralysis and eventual atrophy of one side of the tongue. The tongue deviates to the paralyzed side during protrusion because of the unopposed action of genioglossus of other side. Sublingual absorption of Drugs: For quick absorption of drugs. The pill or spray is put under the tongue where it dissolves and enters the deep lingual veins quickly. The tongue appearance The dorsum of the tongue may have a whitish, furred appearance in the normal individual. Excessive or discoloured 'furring' suggest fever, the fur actually being desquamated epithelial cells. -The Head F The Salivary Glands 56-57 • The salivary glands include: a) The major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands). b) The minor salivary glands located i n the mucosa/submucosa of the oral cavity. The Parotid Gland Location • The parotid glands are the largest paired salivary glands. • Each gland is located inferior to the external ear and posterior to the ramus of the mandible in the parotid bed. • The parotid bed is bound: a) Anteriorly by the posterior border of the ramus of the mandible, covered by the medial pterygoid muscle medially and the masseter laterally. b) Posteriorly by the mastoid process, covered by the posterior belly of the digastric muscle medially and the sternocleidomastoid muscle laterally. c) Medially by the styloid process of the temporal bone. d) Superiorly by the floor of the external acoustic meatus and the capsule of the temporomandibular joint including the stylomandibular ligament. Structure a) Capsule • The parotid bed is lined by the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. • It splits into: i. A superficial lamina of parotid fascia which adheres to the parotid gland. ii. A deep lamina of parotid fascia which is attached to the tympanic part of the temporal bone and to the styloid process. • Inferiorly the fascia is thickened to form the stylomandibular ligament which separates the parotid gland from the submandibular gland. b) Features • The gland is shaped like a three-sided pyramid with its apex directed inferiorly. • It has the following surfaces: i. A superior surface related to the external acoustic meatus. ii. An anteromedial surface related to the posterior border of the ramus of the mandible. 287 iii.

Vasculature • The arterial supply is from the external carotid and its branches. • The venous drainage is by the veins related to the external jugular vein. Lymphatic drainage -The Head • The lymphatics pass through the superficial and deep parotid lymph nodes to end in the superficial and deep cervical nodes. Innervation • The skin overlying the gland is supplied by the great auricular nerve (a cutaneous branch of the cervical plexus). • Secretomotor (parasympathetic) preganglionic fibres arise from the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) in the jugular canal. • These fibres are carried by the tympanic nerve (a branch of CN IX) to the medial wall of the middle ear where they form the tympanic plexus. • The lesser petrosal nerve (a branch of the tympanic plexus) then carries the fibres from the tympanic plexus to the otic ganglion which is suspended from the medial pterygoid nerve. • In the otic ganglion the preganglionic fibres synapse, and the parasympathetic postganglionic fibres are carried from the otic ganglion to the parotid gland by the auriculotemporal nerve (branch of CN V3 ). • The sympathetic fibres arise from the external carotid periarterial plexus. The Submandibular Gland Location • The submandibular glands are paired salivary glands located in the submandibular triangle.

Medial: Hyoglossus and mor e anteriorly, genioglossus. Vasculature and lymphatics • The arterial supply is by the submental artery (branch of the facial artery) and glandular branches from the facial artery. • The venous drainage is by veins, which correspond to the arteries. • The lymph from the gland drains into the submandibular nodes. The Sublingual Gland Location • The sublingual glands are paired salivary glands that lie on the floor of the mouth (the mylohyoid muscle) between the mandible and the genioglossus muscle. • The gland surrounds the terminal portion of the submandibular duct. Structure • The left and right sublingual glands unite anteriorly around the lingual frenulum. Sublingua/ Ducts • Drainage of the gland is by: a) About ten to twenty lesser sublingual ducts which open directly onto the sublingual fold or into the submandibular duct. b) A greater sublingual duct, which opens with the submandibular duct onto the sublingual caruncle. -The Head Relations Anterior: Posterior: Medial It meets the sublingual gland from the opposite side The oral part of the submandibular gland.

The Innervation of the Sublingual and Submandibular Glands a) Parasympathetic supply (secretomotor) • The parasympathetic preganglionic fibres from the facial nerve join the lingual nerve via chorda tympani. • These fibres then run to the submandibular ganglion which is suspended from the lingual nerve. • The preganglionic fibres synapse in the submandibular ganglion • The postganglionic fibres return to the lingual nerve through which they are distributed to the glands. b) Sympathetic supply • The sympathetic fibres are derived from the superior cervical ganglion and are distributed to the glands via the periarterial plexus on the facial artery and its branches. Clinical: Parotid Gland infection: May occur through the bloodstream as occurs in mumps, an acute communicable virus. Causes inflammation (parotiditis) and swelling. Severe pain occurs because parotid sheath resists swelling. Often worsens during chewing. Mumps: acute infection of the parotid and submandibular salivary glands. It is extremely painful and both opening the mouth and chewing may be restricted. The mumps virus may also cause inflammation of the parotid duct, producing redness of the parotid papilla. Redness of the parotid papilla can be used to distinguish the pain of mumps from that of a 289 toothache Parotidectomy (surgical removal): Requires tedious dissection to minimize damage to branches of the facial nerve. Abscess of parotid gland: bacterial infection of the parotid gland can occur from very poor dental hygiene and spread from mouth via parotid ducts. Origin of cheek swelling must be distinguished between parotid gland infection or dental origin.

Articular surfaces • The articular surfaces are: a) The head of the mandible b) The mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the squamous part of the temporal bone. • A biconcave fibrocartilagenous articular disc is interposed between the two surfaces. Articular capsule • The articular capsule consists of an outer fibrous capsule and an inner synovial membrane. a) The fibrous capsule • A thin fibrous capsule is attached to the margins of the articular area of the temporal bone, around the neck of the mandible, and to the circumference of the disc. b) The synovial membrane • The two synovial membranes: • The superior synovial membrane lines the capsule superior to the articular disc • The inferior synovial membrane lines capsule inferior to the disc Ligaments • The ligaments of the joint are: a) The lateral temporomandibular ligament • This ligament is produced by the thickening of the fibrous capsule laterally. • Its fibres pass postero-inferiorly from the lateral surface of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone to the posterolateral surface of the neck of the mandible. • Movements • All the movements of the joint require a combination of the above two 291 Insertion Actions Innervation a) The apex, anterior a) Elevates the Deep temporal border and medial mandible and thus nerve surface of the coronoid closes the jaw (branch of CN process of the mandible b) The posterior fibres V3) b) The anterior border of retract the protruded the ramus of the mandible mandible The lateral surface of the It elevates and Masseteric ramus and the coronoid protrudes the nerve (branch process of the mandible mandible thus closing of CN V3) the jaws a) A small fovea on the a) It helps open the Lateral anter ior aspect of the jaws by pulling the pterygoid nerve neck of the mandible condylar process (branch of CN b) Articular disc and and the arti cular disc V3) capsule of the forwards on the temporomandibular articular tubercle joint b) It helps protrude the mandible The medial surface of the a) It elevates the Medial ramus inferior to the mandible, thus pterygoi d nerve manibular foramen closing the jaws (branch of CN b) Acting bilaterally, it V3) helps protrude the mandible b) The sphenomandibular ligament • This ligament lies on the medial side of the joint and between the lingula of the mandible and the spine of the sphenoid bone. c) The stylomandibular ligament • This ligament runs between the angle of the mandible and the styloid process of the temporal bone. • The ligament separates the submandibular salivary gland from the parotid salivary gland. • The disc divides the joint into a superior and an inferior compartment: a) In the inferior compartment the head of the mandible rotates on the articular disc. b) In the superior compartment the head of the mandible and the disc glide anteriorly onto the articular tubercle of the temporal bone. movements. -The Head a) Depression • This involves two movements: i. The lateral pterygoid pulls the articular disc and head of the mandible forwards on the articular tubercle. ii. Gravity and the digastric muscle, assisted by the platysma and mylohyoid muscles, pull the mandible downwards, causing the head of the mandible to rotate. b) Elevation • This is the reverse action of depression: i. Movement of the head and the articular disc back into the articular fossa is brought about by the posterior fibres of temporalis. ii. The elevation of the mandible is brought about by the masseter and temporalis. c) Protrusion • The head of the mandible and the disc slide forwards on the tubercles while the teeth of the upper and lower jaw remain in contact. • The action is brought about by the medial and lateral pterygoid muscles. d) Retrusion • The opposite movement to protrusion brought about by the posterior fibres of temporalis. e) Side-to-side (lateral) movements • These movements are used in the grinding of food and are brought about by the medial and lateral pterygoid muscles on each side acting alternately. Vasculature • The superficial temporal art ery (branch of the external carotid artery) and branches of the maxillary artery (branch of the external carotid artery). Innervation • The auriculotemporal and masseteric nerves (branches CN V3). Clinical Dislocation of the TMJ: The only joint in the body that can be dislocated without external violence. Excessive contraction of the lateral pteygoids (e. g. in yawning or large bite) may cause heads of the mandible to dislocate anteri orly. In this position, the mouth remains open and the person is unable to close it. Most commonly, a blow to an open mouth dislocates the joint on that side. Dislocation of the TMJ may also accompany fractures of the mandible. Posterior dislocation is uncommon with the posteglenoid tubercle and the strong temporomandibular ligament resisting movement. On a fall onto an open mouth or direct blows to the chin, the mandible fractures before the TMJ dislocates 292 4. THE NASAL REGION The nose is the superior part of the respiratory tract and houses the peripheral olfactory organs. It consists of the external nose (the part that you can see in the mirror) and the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity is divided in the sagittal plane by the nasal septum into left and right parts. Posteriorly the nasal cavities open into the nasopharynx via the posterior nares or choane. The external nose, the nasal septum, the paranasal sinuses and the nasal cavities and associated nerves and vessels will be viewed. A The External Nose 32 • The external nose is pyramidal in shape and has two openings inferiorly called the anterior or external nares (commonly called the nostrils). • The anterior nares are separated by the nasal septum. • The vestibule of the nose is the part of the nasal cavity that is situated immediately above each nostril. • The lateral wall of the vestibule is expanded to form the ala nasi (nasal wing). • The vestibule is lined by coarse hairs that trap particles in the inspired air. The skeleton The skeleton of the external nose consists of a superior, immovable bony part and a lower, mobile cartilaginous part. a) The superior bony part • The bony part consists of the nasal bones (which form the bridge of the nose), the frontal processes of the maxillae and the nasal part of the frontal bone. b) The cartilaginous part • This consists of five main cartilages and numerous small cartilages. • These cartilages are connected to each other by the continuity of their perichondria • The main cartilages are: i) Paired lateral cartilages above. • These cartilages articulate with the margin of the piriform aperture. ii) Paired major a/or cartilages below. • Each major cartilage has a medial and a lateral crus. • The medial crura of the two cartilages are connected to each other in the midline and to the antero-inferior part of the nasal septum. • They form part of the columellaColumella which is the inferior fleshy part of the nasal septum. • The lateral crus extends into the ala nasi but does not reach the bony -The Head margin. Clinical: Nasal Fractures: These are common due to the prominence of the nose. Deviation can occur especially if a lateral force was applie d. Epist axis usually occurs. Bone and cartilage disrupt ion r esults in di splacement. If a direct blow to the nose o ccurs, the cr ibr ifor m plate o f ethmoid bone may fracture. Severe fractures may result i n tearin g of the cranial meninges and bact eria in the nasal mucosa cab enter the cranial cavi ty, causing meningi tis. 293 B The Nasal Cavities 33-35 • The nasal cavities are located between the anteri or nares anteriorly, and the posterior nares or choanae posteriorly. • Each cavity i s di visible into t hr ee parts i .e. the vestibule, the olfactory region and the respiratory regi on. a) The v estibule • Refer to the di scussion of the ext ernal nose for details. b) The olfactory r egi on • This is located between the superior choncha and the r oof of the nasal cavity, below the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone • It is lined with olfactory epithelium. c) The respiratory region • This is the rest of the nasal cavity. • It is l i ned by respiratory epithelium. Boundaries of the nasal cavity a) The Floor • The floor of the nasal cavity is formed: i. Anteriorly by the superior surface of the palati ne process of the maxilla. ii. Posteriorly b y the superior surface of the horizontal plate of the pal atine bone. b) The Roof • The roof of the nasal cavit y is formed: i. In its anterior 1 /3 by the nasal spine of the frontal bone which slopes antero-inferiorly; the nasal bone; the junction between the septal and the lateral nasal cartilages. ii. In i ts middle 1 13 by the cribri form plate of the ethmoid bone and is thus horizontal. iii. In its posterior 1 I s by the anterior surface of the body of the sphenoid bone which slopes postero-i nferiorly. c) The Medial wall • The medial wall of the nasal cavity is formed by the nasal septum. • The nasal septum has bony, cartilaginous and membranous parts. • It is composed, from anterior to posterior of: i. A membranous part between the lower edge of the septal cartilage and the major alar cartilages. ii. The medial crura of the major alar cartilages. iii. The septal cartilage. iv. The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone which forms the superior part of the septum. v. The vomer which forms the postero-inferior part of the septum. -The Head d) The Lateral waif • The parts of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity are: i. anteriorly • Anteriorly the wall is formed by the nasal and lacrimal bones, the frontal process of the maxilla, and the alar and lateral cartilages. ii. in its middle • In its middle the wall is formed by three bony projections called the conchae: 1 . The superior and middle conchae are processes of the ethmoid bone. 2. The inferior choncha is a separate cranial bone. • The space below the superior, middle and inferior conchae are called the superior, middle and inferior meatuses respectively. • The space above the superior choncha is called the spheno-ethmoidal recess. • Under cover of the middle concha is a rounded bulge, the ethmoidal bulla, produced by the middle group of ethmoidal air-cells bulging into the middle meatus. • Below the bulla is a slit called the semilunar hiatus. iii. posteriorly • Posteriorly the wall is formed by the medial pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone. • The paranasal sinuses open on the lateral wall. Clinical Infections of the nasal cavities may spread to the: 1 . Anterior cranial fossa through the cribriform plate 2. Nasopharynx and retro pharyngeal soft tissues 3. Middle ear through auditory tube 4. Para nasal sinuses 5. Lacrimal apparatus and conjunctiva Deviation of the Nasal Septum: May be displaced or deviate from median plan because of birth injury. Most often, however, deviation occurs during adolescence, adulthood from trauma, If the deviation is so severe as to impede air passage, then surgical repair is indicated. Rhinitis: Swelling and inflammation of the nasal mucosa during upper respiratory tract infection and allergic reactions (eg hay fever). Swelling of the mucosa occurs readily because of its vascularity. 294 C The Paranasal Sinuses 43-46 • These sinuses are air-filled extensions of the respiratory part of the nasal cavity. • There are four paired paranasal sinuses, named according to the bone in which they are located: a) The frontal sinuses • These cavities are located between the diploe of the frontal bone, superior to the orbit. • The left and right sinuses are separated by a thin bone and are usually not of equal size. • Each frontal sinus drains separately into a nasofrontal duct which opens via the infundibulum into the anterior part of the semilunaris hiatus of the middle meatus. • The mucosa of the sinus is innervated by the supraorbital nerve (branch of CNV1). b) The ethmoidal sinuses • These sinuses are comprised of several small cavities, called the ethmoidal air cells, which are located i n the lateral mass of the ethmoid bone. • The sinuses are situated medial to the orbit and are divided into three groups: i. The anterior cells which drain into the anterior part of the semilunaris hiatus of the middle meatus. ii. The middle cells which open on the summit of the ethmoidal bulla. iii. The posterior cells which open directly into the superior meatus. • The mucosa of the sinus is innervated by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal nerves (branches of the nasociliary branch of CN Vi). c) The sphenoidal sinuses • These sinuses lie in the body of the sphenoid bone posterior to the orbit. • The two sinuses are separated by a bony plate which is usually not in the median plane. • Each sinus opens into the back of the spheno-ethmoidal recess. • The mucosa of the sinus is innervated by the posterior ethmoidal nerve. d) The maxillary sinuses • These are the largest of the sinuses and occupy the body of the maxilla inferior to the orbit. • Each sinus is pyramidal in shape: i. The base is formed by the lateral wall of the nasal cavity. ii. The apex lies in the zygomatic process. -The Head iii. The anterior and posterior walls are formed by the corresponding walls of the maxilla. • Each sinus opens behind in the semilunar hiatus of the middle meatus. • The mucosa of the sinus is innervated by the anterior, posterior and middle superior alveolar nerves (branches of CN V2 ). Clinical Sinusitis: The paranasal sinuses are continous with the nasal cavities through the apertures that open into them. Thus infection may spread from the nasal cavities, producing inflammation and swelling of the mucosa of the sinuses (sinusitis) and local pain. Sometimes several sinuses are blocked (pansinusitis). Also, swelling of the mucosa may block one or more openings of the sinuses into the nasal cavities. Infection of ethmoidal air cells: If nasal drainage is blocked, infections of the ethmoidal cells may break throught the fragile medial wall of the orbit. Severe infection from this source may cause blindness because some posterior ethmoidal air cells lie close to the optic canal, giving passage to the optic nerve and the ophthalmic artery. Spread of infection from these cells could also affect dural nerve sheath of the optic nerve causing optic neuritis. Maxillary Sinus Infection: Most commonly infected sinuses, probably because their ostia are located high on their superomedial walls, a poor location for natural drainage of the sinus. When the mucous membrane of the sinus is congested, the maxillary ostia are often obstructed. Because of the high location of the ostia, when the head is erect it is impossible to drain the sinuses until they are full. Because the ostia of the right and left sinuses are on the medial sides (i.e. directed towards each other), only the upper ostium at that time can drain when lying on ones side. 295 D Vasculature of the Nasal Cavity 36-37 • The anterior part of the nasal septum has an area of rich anastomoses of the arteries in the area. • Kiesselbach's area is often the site of epistaxis after trauma. • The arterial supply of the nasal cavity is from • Sphenopalatine artery • Anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries • Greater palatine artery • Superior labial and lateral nasal branches of facial artery • The majority arterial supply of the nasal cavity is by: a) The sphenopalatine artery • This artery arises from the maxillary artery in the pterygopalatine fossa and enters the nasal cavity through the sphenopalatine foramen. • It supplies the lateral wall and the nasal septum of the nasal cavity. b) The anterior ethmoidal artery • This artery arises from the opthalmic artery in the orbit. • It leaves the orbit via the anterior ethmoidal foramen, crosses the ethmoid bone and the floor of the anterior cranial fossa, and enters the nose. • It supplies the nasal septum and the anterior part of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity. • Venous drainage of the nasal cavity is by a venous plexus which is particularly well-developed over the inferior concha. • The venous drainage follows the arterial supply and may be connected by an emissary vein to the superior sagittal sinus inside the cranium. Clinical Epistaxis: Relatively common because of the rich blood supply to the nasal mucosa. Trauma is the usual cause and bleeding, usually located in the anterior third of the nose on the medial septum (Littles Area), a site of rich anastomoses (Kiesselbachs) from external and internal carotid branches (facial, palatine, ophthalmic). Associated with infections and hypertension. -The Head E Innervation of the Nasal Cavity 40-42 • The olfactory epithelium gives rise to the olfactory nerves, which pass through the cribiform plate of the ethmoid bone to reach the olfactory bulb. • The rest of the nasal cavity is supplied mainly by: • Nasopalatine nerve • Greater palatine nerve • Anterior and posterior ethmoidal nerves • Nasal branches Two main nerves are described below a} The anterior ethmoidal nerve (branch of the opthalmic nerve} • It runs with the anterior ethmoidal artery to supply the lateral wall and the septum of the nasal cavity. b) Nasal branches • These branches originate from the pterygopalatine ganglion and enter the nasal cavity via the sphenopalatine foramen with the sphenopalatine artery. • The branches supply the lateral wall and septum of the nasal cavity. The pterygopalatine ganglion • The pterygopalatine ganglion is suspended by two ganglionic branches from the maxillary nerve in the pterypalatine fossa. • It obtains its parasympathetic and sympathetic fibres in the following way: • Parasympathetic (secretomotor} fibres are carried by the greater petrosal nerve from the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. • Sympathetic fibres ore carried by the deep petrosal nerve from the superior cervical ganglion. • The greater and deep petrosal nerves join to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal. • This nerve enters the pterygopalatine ganglion supplying it with sympathetic and parasympathetic fibres. • The ganglion sends out fibres to the following structures: a} The pharynx via the pharyngeal nerve. b} The palate via the palatine nerves. c} The lacrimal gland via fibres carried by the maxillary nerve. d} The nasal cavity via nasopalatine and nasal branches. 296 5. THE EAR Overview of the Ear • The ear consists of an external, middle and internal part. • Between the external and the middle ear is the tympanic membrane. • The two main functions of the ear are balance and hearing, and thus it is called the vestibulocochlear organ. A The External Ear • The external ear consists of: a} The auricle, which collects the sound waves and directs them towards the external acoustic meatus. b) The external acoustic meatus, which is a canal channeling the sound waves to the tympanic membrane. The Auricle • The skeleton of the auricle is a single convoluted cartilage plate, which is covered with skin on all its aspects. • Anteriorly the cartilage is attached to the calvaria, and posteriorly it has a free-rolled edge called the helix. • The helix begins as a crus superior to the external auditory meatus and ends in a lobule or ear lobe. • There is a second ridge, the antihelix, which runs parallel to the helix dividing the auricle into an outer scaphoid fossa and deeper concha. • The antihelix begins anterosuperiorly as two crura, which limit the triangular fossa, and ends inferiorly as the antitragus. • The tragus projects posteriorly from the anterior portion of the external ear partially covering the external auditory meatus. • The tragus is separated from the antitragus by an intertragic notch. • The innervation of the auricle is by: i. The great auricular nerve (a cutaneous branch of the cervical plexus} ii. The auriculotemporal nerve (CN Viii branch} iii. Auricular branch of CN X supplying concha iv. Lesser occipital nerve Clinical External Ear injury (Cauliflower ear}: Bleeding within the auricle resulting from trauma may produce and auricular hematoma. Localised collection of blood forms between the perichondrium and auricular cartilage. As the hematoma enlarges it compromises the supply of blood to the cartilage. If untreated (e.g. by aspiration), fibrosis-formation of fibrous tissue-develops in the overlying skin, forming a malformed auricle )e.g. the cauliflower ear -The Head The External Acoustic Meatus • The external acoustic meatus is an S-shaped canal which is about 2,5 cm long in adults. • It extends in a medial and slightly anterior direction from the concha of the auricle to the tympanic membrane. • The lateral 1 h of the canal is cartilaginous, and the medial 2/3 is bony. • Skin lines the entire external acoustic meatus as well as the outer surface of the tympanic membrane. • The skin of the cartilagenous part has ceruminous glands which produce cerumen (wax), sebaceous glands and laterally directed hairs which prevent the entry of small objects. • The bony part of the canal is bounded by the tympanic part of the temporal bone on all sides, except superiorly, where it is bound by the squamous part of the temporal bone. • The diameter of the canal varies. • It is narrowest about 0,5 cm from the tympanic membrane, a point called the isthmus. • The supero-inferior diameter is greatest at the lateral end of the canal. • The antero-posterior diameter is greatest at the medial end of the canal. • Innervation of the external acoustic meatus is by: a) The auriculotemporal nerve (branch of CN V3J which supplies the superior and anterior wall. b) The auricular nerve (branch of CN X) which supplies the inferior and posterior wall. Clinical Otitis Externa: Bacterial infection of the skin of the external acoustic meatus. The infection often develops in swimmers who don't dry their meatus. The affected individual complains of itching and pain in the external ear. Pulling the auricle increases the pain. Tympanic membrane The thin, oval and semi-translucent tympanic membrane forms the partition between the external and the middle ear. • It consists of two layers of collagenous connective tissue lined: a) On the outer surface by skin continuous with that of the external auditory meatus. b) On the inner surface by mucous membrane continuous with that of the middle ear. • Along most of its circumference the membrane is thickened and attached to the tympanic sulcus at the medial end of the meatus. • Superiorly, the tympanic sulcus is absent and is replaced by the tympanic notch. • The tympanic membrane is oval in shape and lies obliquely, such that the 297 antero-inferior quadrant lies deeper than the postero-superior quadrant. • Its lateral surface has a deep concavity. • When viewed with an otoscope, the umbo the deepest point of this concavity and marks the position of the tip of the manubrium of the malleus. • A triangular area, called the cone of light, radiates antero-inferiorly from the umbo. • On its medial side the tympanic membrane is attached to the malleus along the length of its manubrium. • Superior to the attachment of the malleus the membrane appears less tense and is called the pars flaccida. • The pars flaccida corresponds with the tympanic notch where the tympanic membrane leaves the bone and passes to the lateral process of the malleus. • The pars flaccida is demarcated by two diverging folds called the anterior and posterior mallear folds. • The rest of the membrane is taut and is called the pars tensa (tense part) • The Tympanic membrane moves in response to air vibrations that pass through the external acoustic meatus. • These movements are passed via the ossi cles in the middle ear to the inner ear • The external surface of the tympanic membrane is supplied mainly by the auriculotemporal nerve with some additional by the auricular branch of CN x • The internal surface is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) Clinical Otoscopic Examination: examine external acoustic meatus and tympanic membrane begins by straightening the meatus. In adults the helix is grasped and pulled postero- superiorly (up, out and back). These movements reduce the curvature of the meatus, facilitating insertion of an otoscope. In infants the external acoustic meatus is very short so care must be taken not to injure the tympance membrane. The babys ear is pulled infero-posteriorly (down,back). The tympanic membrane is normally translucent and pearl gray with the handle of the malleus visible near the center of the membrance. Perforation of the Tympanic Memb: \"Ruptured eardrum\" may result from otitis media and Is one of several causes of middle ear deafness. Perforation of the membrane may also result from foreign bodies in the external acoustic meatus or excessive pressure (e.g. scuba diving). Minor ruptures of the tympanic membrane often heal spontaneously. Large ruptures mainly require surgical repair. Incisions in the middle ear (for e. g. to release pus from a middle ear abscess) are made postero-inferiorly to avoid damage to the chorda tympani nerve and because the superior half is much more vascular. -The Head B The Middle Ear 87-89 • The middle ear or tympanic cavity is an air- filled cavity in the petrous part of the temporal bone. • The tympanic cavity consists of two parts: a) The tympanic cavity proper. b) The epitympanic recess. • The contents of the middle ear include the auditory ossicles, the chorda tympani and tympanic plexus, and the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles. • The middle ear has connection anteriorly with the nasopharynx via the pharyngotympanic tube (auditory tube (of Eustachius)) The Walls Of The Middle Ear • The middle ear has six walls ie. anterior, posterior, medial, lateral, superior and inferior walls. a) Anterior waif • This is also called t he carotid wall as it separates the tympanic cavity from the carotid canal. • It is narrow because the medial and the lateral walls converge anteriorly. • The anterior wall has two openings: a) Superiorly the semicanal for tensor tympani muscle opens. b) Inferiorly the auditory tube (eustachian tube), which connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx, opens. • The semicanal for tensor tympani and the auditory tube are separated by a bony septum. • This septum projects posteriorly into the middle ear to form a shelf called the processus cochleariformis. • The tendon of tensor tympani wraps around the posterior end of this shelf to insert into the malleus. b) Posterior waif • This is also called the mastoid wall as it is formed by the mastoid process. • The posterior wall has the following openings: a) Superiorly is the aditus ad antrum which provides a communication between the middle ear and the mastoid air cells. b) Inferiorly is a bony projection, the pyramidal eminence, which contains the stapedius muscle (the tendon of the muscle emerges from the eminence and attaches to the stapes). c) Lateral to the pyrami dal eminence is an opening where chorda tympani (branch of CN VII) enters the middle ear. 298 c) Medial waif • This is also called the labyrinthine wall as it is formed by the lateral wall of the inner ear. • This wall has several features: i. A posterosuperior prominence • This marks the position of the lateral semicircular canal of the inner ear. ii. The tympanic promontory • This is formed by the basal turn of the cochlea. • The tympanic plexus of nerves is located on the surface of the promontory. • This plexus is formed by the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). • The plexus gi ves off: 1 . Sensory branches to the tympanic cavity and the auditory tube. 2. A communicating branch to the greater petrosal nerve. 3. The lesser petrosal nerve. iii. The round window • Posteroinferior to the promontory is the round window or fenestra cochlea which is covered by the secondary tympanic membrane. • This membrane moves in and out to dissipate the pressure created in the inner ear by movement of the foot-plate of the stapes. iv. The oval window • Posterosuperior to the promontory is the oval window or fenestra vestibuli receiving the foot-plate of the stapes. • It transmits the vibrations of the ossicles to the perilymph of the inner ear. v. The prominence of the facial canal • The prominence of the facial canal, which carries the facial nerve, passes superior to the promontory and then curves downwards passing posterior to the windows. d) Lateral waif • This i s also called the membranous wall and is formed mainly by the tympanic membrane and the lateral wall of the epitympanic recess. • The chorda tympani (branch of CN VII) passes between the fibrous and mucous layers of the tympanic membrane. e) Superior wall • The superior wall or roof is formed by a thin plate of bone called the tegmen -The Head tympani. • The tegmen tympani separates the tympanic cavity from the middle cranial fossa. • The tegmen tympani extends anteriorly to cover the semicanal for tensor tympani and posteriorly to form the roof of the mastoid antrum. f) Inferior wall • This is also called the jugular wall as it is formed by a thin plate of bone separating the tympanic cavity from the jugular canal at the level of the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein. The Auditory Ossicles • The ossicles are little bones that bridge the gap between the tympanic membrane and the oval window or fenestra vestibuli on the medial wall of the middle ear. • The ossicles are also responsible for amplifying sound waves. • The three ossicles, from lateral to medial, are the malleus, the incus and the stapes. a) Mal/eus (hammer) • This is the most lateral of the ossicles and consists of: a) The head • This lies in the epitympanic recess. • It articulates with the body of the incus at a saddle-shaped synovial joint. b) The manubrium • This is attached to the tympanic membrane from the umbo almost to the circumference. • The tendon of tensor tympani inserts into the handle. c) An anterior and a lateral process • These are placed at right angles to the long axis. • The lateral process is attached to the tympanic membrane. • The anterior process is attached by the anterior ligament of the malleus to the petrotympanic fissure. b) lncus (anvil) • This is the intermediate of the ossicles and consists of: i. A body which lies in the epitympanic recess and articulates with the head of the malleus. ii. A short, posterior projecting crus which is attached by a ligament to the lateral wall of the epitympanic recess. iii. A long vertical crus • This is parallel to the manubrium of the malleus. • Its end articulates with a hollow in the head of the stapes at a 299 synovial ball-and-socket joint. Stapes (stirrup) • This is the most medial of the ossicles and consi sts of: a) A head which articulates with the incus. b) Anterior and posterior crura. c) A flattened oval base or foot- plate • This fits into the oval window or fenestra vestibuli. • It is held in place by an annular elastic ligament Structures Communicating With The Middle Ear • The two most important structures communicating with the middle ear are the auditory tube and the mastoid antrum. The auditory tube • The auditory (pharyngotympanic or Eustachian) tube is a 3, 5 cm long canal that provides a communication between the middle ear and the nasopharynx. • The posterior 1 h of the tube is bony and the anterior 2/3 is cartilagenous. • The bony part lies between the petrous and tympanic parts of the temporal bone. • This part is narrow and runs from the anterior wall of the tympanic cavity to the lateral end of the sphenopetrosal recess. • The cartilagenous part runs in the sphenopetrosal recess to reach the opening above the superior constrictor of the pharynx. • In section the cartilage is hook-shaped and has a medial and a lateral lamina. • Tensor veli palatini arises in part from the lateral lamina. • Levator veli palatini arises in part from the medial lamina. • Salphingopharyngeus attaches to the cartilage near its pharyngeal opening. • These three muscles are responsible for the patency of the tube. • During swallowing salphingopharyngeus and tensor veli palatini open the tube. • Inferiorly and laterally the cartilagenous part of the tube is deficient and i s closed by a fibrous membrane. • Internally the auditory tube is lined by a mucous membrane, continuous posteriorly with that of the middle ear and anteriorly with that of the nasopharynx. • The tube allows equilisation of the air pressure between the middle ear and the nasopharynx. • This prevents large pressure differentials across the tympanic membrane which might cause it to rupture. The mastoid antrum -The Head • The mastoid antrum is a small cavity located posterior to the epitympanic recess in the petromastoid part of the temporal bone. • The roof of the antrum is formed by the tegmen tympani which separates it from the middle cranial fossa. • The floor of the antrum is formed by the mastoid process. • The floor has openings which allow for communications with the mastoid air cells and is also closely related to the jugular bulb. • Anteroinferiorly The mastoid antrum is related to the canal for the facial nerve Muscles Of The Middle Ear • There are two muscles in the middle ear that are of importance; the tensor tympani and the stapedius • The main function of both of these muscles is to dampen excessively loud sounds. Tensor tympani muscle Origin: The upper surface of the cartilageneous part of the auditory tube and the adjacent sphenoid and petrosal temporal bone. The handle of the malleus. It tenses the tympanic membrane, dampening the vibrations of excessively loud sounds. Innervation: The mandibular nerve (CN V3} via the otic ganglion (the nerve does not synapse in this ganglion}. Insertion: Action: Stapedius Muscle Origin: The interior of the pyramidal eminence. Insertion: The neck of the stapes. Action: It prevents excessive movements of the stapes and so dampens excessively loud sounds. Innervation: The facial nerve (CN VII). Clinical Otitis Media: A bulging red tympanic membrane may indicate pus or fluid in the middle ear, a sign of otitis media. Infection of the middle ear is often secondary to upper respiratory tract infection. Inflammation and swellinh of the mucous membrane linong the tympanic cavity may cause partial or complete blockage of the auditory tube. The tympanic membrane becomes red and bulges and the individual may complain of 'ear popping'. An amber-colored bloody fluid may be observed through the tym panic membrane. If untreated, otitis media may produce impaired hearing as the result of scarring of the auditory ossicles, limiting the ability of these bones to move in response to sound. Mastoiditis: 300 Infections of the mastoid antrum and mastoid air cells may result from a middle ear infection that causes inflammation of the mastoid process. Infections may spread superiorly into the middle cranial fossa through the petrosquamous fissure in children and cause osteomyelitis (bone infection} of the tegmen tympani. Since the advent of antibiotics, mastoi dits is rare. Auditory tube: The auditory tube forms a route for infection to pass from the nasopharynx to the tympanic cavity. The tube is easily blocked by swelling of its mucous membrane,(even mild infection, head cold) given that the walls of the cartilaginous parts are normally in apposition. When the auditory tube is occluded, residual air in the tympanic cavity is usually absorbed into the mucosal blood vessesls, resulting in lower pressure in the tympanic cavity, retraction of the tympanic membrane and interference with its free movement. Finally hearing is affected. Swallowing or yawning can alleviate the pressure changes of air flight in that they open the auditory tubes. -The Head C The Internal Ear 90-92 • This is composed of bony canals called the osseous (bony) labyrinth. • The osseous labyrinth is filled with perilymph and, a system of membranous canals called the membranous labyrinth is suspended in this perilymph. • The perilymph drains into the subarachnoid space. • The membranous labyr inth is filled with endolymph and contains the sensory organs of hearing and balance. Osseous labyrinth • This labyrinth is located in the petrous portion of the temporal bone and consists of three parts: a) The vestibule • This chamber is medial to the middle ear, posterior to the cochlea but anterior to the semicircular canals. • The vestibule contains the utricle and saccule. • The fenestra vestibuli opens on its lateral wall and the three semicircular canals open on its posterior wall. • It has a diverticulum, the aqueduct of the vestibule, which opens at a narrow fissure posterolateral to the internal acoustic meatus, on the posterior face of the petrous temporal bone. b) The semicircular canals • These three canals are situated at right angles to one another. • The anterior canal lies under the arcuate eminence of the temporal bone and it projects vertically with its long axis directed anteromedially at 45°. • The lateral canal is nearly horizontal and projects slightly into the middle ear. • The posterior canal projects vertically with its long axis directed posterolaterally at 45°. • Each semicircular canal almost forms a full circle with a swelling at the base called the ampulla c) The cochlea • This consists of a bony canal which spirals about 2 3/ 4 times around a central axis called the modiolus which is directed antero-laterally. The base of the cochlea bulges into the middle ear to form the promontory . The canal is incompletely divided into two passages by an osseous spiral lamina. The spiral canal of the modiolus runs in the base of the spiral lamina and contains the spiral ganglion in which the peripheral processes of the sensory hair cells synapse. The basilar membrane is attached to the sharp edge of this lamina and to the wall of the canal to complete the division of the canal into two • • • • 301 • passages. The vestibular membrane passes from the upper surface of the sharp end of the lamina to the wall of the cochlear canal. The scala tympani containing perilymph is below the basilar membrane. The scala vestibuli containing peri lymph lies above the vestibular membrane. The two scalae are continuous with each other through a narrow opening, the helicotrema, at the apex of the cochlea. • • • Membranous labyrinth • This also has three main parts: a) The utricle and saccule • These are two sacs in the bony vestibule that are connected by the utricosaccular duct. From this duct the endolymphatic duct passes through the bony aqueduct of the vestibule to end in a blind dilatation, the endolymphatic sac. This sac lies deep to the dura mater over the post erior surface of the petrous bone. The utricle receives the five openings of the semicircular ducts. The saccule communicates with the cochlear duct by means of the ductus reuniens. The sacs contain the macula which translates gravitational stimuli into impulses in the branches of the vestibular portion of the CN VIII. • • • • • • b) The semicircular ducts • These ducts are found in the semicircular canals and they open into the utricle. • Each duct has two crura: i) An ampullary crus • This crus has a dilatation at the one end to form the ampulla which contains an ampullary crest. • The ampullary crest responds to changes in the pressure of the endolymph. • Changes in pressure result in the generation of impulses in the vestibular nerve . ii) A simple crus • This crus does not have an ampulla. • The simple crura of the anterior and posterior ducts unite to form a common crus so that only five crura enter the utricle. c) The cochlear duct • The cochlear duct, like the rest of the membranous labyrinth, contains endolymph. -The Head • It lies between the basilar membrane and the vestibular membrane and is thus surrounded by the perilymph of the two scalae. • On the basal membrane is the spiral organ of Corti, overlaid by a gelatinous tectorial membrane. • The organ contains hair-cells which respond to vibrations of the endolymph. • These vibrations set up impulses in the cochlear portion of the CN VIII. Blood supply of the labyrinth • The internal ear is chiefly supplied by the labyrinthine artery (branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery). The vestibulocochlear /auditory nerve (CN VIII) • CN VIII traverses the internal acoustic meatus in company of the facial nerve, nervus intermedius, and the labyrinthine artery. • It divides at the end of the meatus into an anterior cochlear and a posterior vestibular portion. • The cochlear portion is concerned with hearing and enters the base of the modiolus. • The vestibular portion is concerned with equilibrium and supplies the utricle, saccule, and the ampullae of the semicircular ducts. • The vestibular nerve has the vestibular ganglion from which peripheral branches pass through the bone to reach their destinations. Clinical Hyperacusis: Increased acuity of hearing (lowered threshold). Most commonly from damage to the stapedius muscle (CN VII) or tensor tympani muscle (CN V). Occasionally associated with Bell's Palsy. Motion Sickness: The Maculae of the membranous labyrinth are primarily static organs, which have small dense particles (otoliths) embedded amongst hair cells. Under the influence of gravity, the otoliths cause bending of the hair cells, which stimulate the vestibular nerves and provide awareness of the position of the head in space; the hairs also respond to quick tilting movements and to linear acceleration and deceleration. Motion sickness results mainly from fluctuating stimulation of the maculae. Meniere Syndrome: Related to blockage of the cochlear aqueduct and is characterized by recurrent attack of tinnitus, hearing loss and vertigo. These symptoms are accompanied by a sense of pressure in the ear, distortion of sounds, and sensitivity to noise. Afflicted individuals have an increase in endolymphatic volume with ballooning of the cochlear duct, utricle and saccule. 302 Dizziness: Injuries of the peripheral auditory system cause three main symptoms: hearing loss (usually conductive hearing loss); vertigo (dizziness) when in the semi- circular ducts; and tinnitus (buzzing/ringing) when localized in the cochlear duct. Tinnitus and hearing loss may result from lesions anywhere in the peripheral or central auditory pathways GENERAL CLINICAL ANATOMY OF EAR AND HEARING: Hearing Loss: Two types: conductive hearing loss resulting from anything in the middle or external ear that interferes with the movement of the round or oval windows. Sensorineural hearing loss, resulting from defects in the cochlea, cochlear nerve, brainstem or cortical connections High tone deafness: Persistent exposure to excessively loud noises causes degenerative changes in the spiral organ, resulting in high tone deafness. This type of hearing loss commonly occurs in workers who are exposed to loud noises and do not wear protective ear devices. (e. g. persons working in mines) -The Head 6. THE ORBIT A The Osteology of the Orbit • The orbit is a bony recess in the skull shaped like a four-sided pyramid with its apex pointing posteriorly. • The constituent bones of the orbit are lined with orbital periosteum or periorbita. The orbital margin • The orbit has the following margins: a) The medial margin • This is formed in its upper 1 /2 by the frontal bone, and in its lower 1 /2 by the lacrimal crest of the maxilla. b) The lateral margin • This is formed in the upper 1 /4 by the frontal bone, and in the lower 3/4 by the frontal process of the zygomatic bone. c) The supra-orbital margin • This is formed by the frontal bone. • Its medial 1 /3 is rounded and is separated from the middle 1 /3 by the supra-orbital notch or foramen. • This notch transmits the supra-orbital nerve and vessels. d) The infra-orbital margin • This is formed equally by the maxilla medially and the zygomatic bone laterally. The Walls of the Orbit a) The medial wall • This is formed by the orbital plate of the ethmoid bone and completed with contributions from the frontal, lacrimal, and sphenoid bones. • The medial wall is extremely thin • The medial walls of the two orbits are parallel to each other. • The lateral wall is at 45° to the medial wall of an orbit. • Features of the medial wall are: i. The vertical lacrimal groove or sulcus • This is formed anteriorly by the maxilla and posteriorly by the lacrimal bone. • It forms a fossa for the lacrimal sac and adjacent part of the nasolacrimal duct. ii. The anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina • These are located along the suture between the ethmoid and frontal bones. • They transmit the ethmoidal vessels and nerves. 303 b) The lateral wall • This is formed in its anterior 1 h by the frontal process of the zygomatic bone, and in its posterior 1 h by the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. • The lateral walls of the two orbits are at right angles to each other. • Features of the lateral wall are: i. Anteriorly it separates the orbit from the temporal fossa. ii. Posteriorly it separates the orbit from the middle cranial fossa. iii. The roof and the lateral wall are separated posteriorly by the superior orbital fissure. • This fissure communicates with the middle cranial fossa and transmits the occulomotor (CN Ill), trochlear (CN IV) and abducent nerves (CN VI). • In addition the terminal branch of the opthalmic nerve (CN Vi) and the superior opthalmic vein traverse the fissure. • The medial ends of the superior and inferior orbital fissures converge to form the apex of the orbit. • The fissures enclose a V-shaped area constituted by the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. c) The superior wall (roof) • This is formed mainly by the orbital plate of the frontal bone with the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone contributing posteriorly. • Features of the superior wall are: i. The anteromedial part which contains a part of the frontal air sinus. ii. The anterolateral part which contains a fossa for the lacrimal gland. iii. At the junction of the medial wall with the superior wall is the optic canal which transmits the optic nerve and the opthalmic artery (branch of the internal carotid artery). d) The inferior wall (floor) • This is formed mainly by the orbital surface of the maxilla; and partly by the zygomatic bone anterolaterally, and the orbital process of the palatine bone posteriorly. • Special features of the floor are: i. It is separated from the lateral wall by the inferior orbital fissure which contains amongst others the maxillary nerve. ii. It forms the roof of the maxillary sinus. iii. It is grooved behind by the infraorbital sulcus, which passes forwards and becomes the infraorbital canal, transmitting the infraorbital nerve and vessels. Clinical Blow out fracture -The Head Can result from direct trauma to eye. The eye itself is rarely ruptured but the thin orbital floor is often fractured and the eye and its surrounding fat are pushed into the roof of the maxillary sinus. The thinness of the medial and inferior walls of the orbit predispose it to fracture after trauma. Orbital tumors Because of the proximity of the optic nerve to the sphenoi dal and posterior ethmoidal air sinuses, a malignant tumor in these sinuses may erode the thin bony walls and compress the optic nerve. Tumors of the orbit cause exophthalmia. Middle cranial fossa tumors can enter the orbit via the superior orbital fissure; those of the temporal and infratemporal fossae gain access through the inferior orbital fissure. 304 B The Eyelids 77 • The eyelids or palpebrae serve to protect the eyes from injury and to keep the cornea moist. • The upper eyelid is larger and more mobile than the lower eyelid. Structure • From superficial to deep each eyelid consists of: i. Skin and subcutaneous connective tissue. ii. Fibres of orbicularis oculi. iii. The tarsus, the orbital septum, tarsal glands and the tendon of levator palpebrae superioris (the latter only in the upper lid). iv. The conjunctiva. • Each of these components will now be discussed in detail. Orbicularis oculi • This muscles consists of three parts: The orbital port • This part arises from the medial palpebral ligament, encircles the orbital margin, and re- inserts into the medial palpebral ligament. • Its action is to draw the overlying skin medially so to screw up the eye eg. when partially protecting the eye from bright light. The polpebral part • This part arises from the medial palpebral ligament and inserts into the lateral palpebral ligament. • When acting alone, its action is to gently close the eyelid eg. in blinking or in sleeping. • When this part acts with the orbital part it closes the eye forcibly eg. in protecting the eye from a blow. The locrimal port • This part arises from the margin of the fossa for the lacrimal sac and from the sac itself. • It divides into upper and lower slips which pass laterally and attach to the tarsal plates of the respective eyelids. • Its action is to draw the eyelid and the lacrimal papillae medially. • It also pulls on the lacrimal fascia and dilates the lacimal sac which promotes the drainage of tears. • The innervation of orbicularis oculi is by the the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve (CN VII). The Tarsi • Each eyelid contains a tarsal plate of dense connective tissue, which maintains the shape of the eyelid, and provides a small amount of protection to the eye. • The superior tarsal plate is larger than the inferior tarsal plate. -The Head • The orbital septum is a fascia! sheath that attaches the tarsal plates to the superior and inferior orbital margins. • The superior and inferior tarsi fuse medially and laterally to form the medial and lateral palpebral ligaments respectively. • These ligaments in turn insert into the medial and lateral walls of the bony orbit. Tarsal glands • These glands are embedded on the deep surface of the tarsal plates. • They are yellow in colour and run parallel to each other, at right angles to the margin of the eyelid. • They may be seen through the conjunctiva when the eyelids are everted. • The ducts of the glands open on the free margins of the eyelids, just behind the eyelashes. Levator palpebrae superiosis muscles • This is a thin, tri angular muscle that elevates the upper eyelid. • The origin of the muscle is the roof of the orbit, anterior to the optic canal. • It passes anteriorly super ior to the superior rectus. • Distally the muscle becomes aponeurotic and then splits into: a) A superficial lamina • The superficial lamina is attached to : i. The anterior surface of the superior tarsus, deep to the orbital septum. ii. The skin of the eyelid by piercing the orbital septum and the palpebral part of orbicularis oris. • The fibres of the superficial part are voluntary and are supplied by the occulomotor nerve {CN Ill). b) A deep lamina • This is attached to the upper margin of the superior tarsus. • It contains smooth muscle fibres that form the superior tarsal muscle. • This muscle is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system via the periarterial plexus of the opthalmic artery (branch of the internal carotid artery). The Conjunctiva • The eyeball and the inner surfaces of the eyelids are lined by a transparent mucous membrane known as the conjunctiva. • The conjunctiva may be divided into two parts: a) The palpebral conjunctiva • This lines the inner surface of the eyelids and is reflected off the bases of the lids onto the eyeball, where it is continuous with the bulbar conjunctiva. • These reflections form recesses called the superior and inferior 305 conjunctival fornices. b) The bu/bar conjunctiva • The bulbar conjunctiva lines the exposed part of the eyeball i.e. it covers the cornea and a part of the sclera. • It is firmly attached to the cornea, where it is called the anterior epithelium of the cornea. • It is only l oosely attached to the sclera. • It is innervated by the opthalmic nerve {CN V1) and the maxillary nerve (CN V2). Clinical Eyelid Nerve Injuries: Lesions of the oculomotor nerve cause drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis) due to loss of function of levator palpebrae superiosis. Damage to facial nerve prevents the eyelids from fully closing (through loss of function of orbicularis oculi). Normal rapid protective blinking is lost. Loss of tonus of the l ower eyelid cause the lid to fall away, leading to dryness of the cornea. Thus irritation of the eyeball results in excessive but inefficient lacrimation. Inflammation of Palpebral glands Sty formation (hordeolum): Obstruction of the ducts of the ciliary glands causing a painful suppurative (pus-producing) swelling on the eyelid. Cysts of the sebaceous glands of the eyelid, chalazia, may form. Chalazi a are generally more painful than sti es Periorbital ecchymosis Blows to the peri-orbital region often cause significant swelling and hemorrhage into the eyelids and extravasation of blood into periorbital skin. (common in boxers: reason why boxers get cut around the eyes often after multiple blows) -The Head C The Lacrimal Apparatus 78 • The lacrimal apparatus consists of the lacrimal gland which secretes a fluid commonly known as tears, and the lacrimal canaliculi, lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct which collect the tears and direct them towards the nasal cavity. First noted will be the outline of the lacrimal pathway i.e. the path that the lacrimal fluid follows from the lacrimal gland to the nasal cavity. Then decribed is the lacrimal apparatus in more detail. The Lacrimal pathway • The lacrimal gland secretes lacrimal fluid (tears) which pass through the excretory ducts. • These ducts open in the superior conjunctival fornix. • The action of orbicularis oculi results in the tears being spread across the conjunctiva, keeping it moist. • Most of these tears evaporate but some enter into two small openings, namely the superior and inferior lacrimal puncta situated on the lacrimal papillae on the margin of each eyelid. • From the puncta the tears drain through two lacrimal canaliculi into the lacrimal sac. • The lacrimal sac drains via the nasolacrimal duct into the nasal cavity. • If the lacrimal canaliculi become overwhelmed the fluid overflows the eyelids and tears flow down the cheeks. The Lacrimal Gland • This is located in the supero-lateral part of the orbit, and consists of two parts: a) A larger orbital part • This is located above levator palpebrae superioris in the lacrimal fossa. • This fossa is on medial side of the zygomatic process of the frontal bone. c) A smaller palpebral part • This is located below the aponeurosis of levator palpebrae superioris. • It projects into the lateral part of the upper eyelid and is visible through the conjunctiva when the eyelid is everted. • These parts are continuous posterolaterally, around the lateral surface of the aponeurosis of levator palpebrae superioris. • The excretory ducts of both parts open into the superior fornix of the conjunctiva. • The movement of levator palpebrae superioris milks the gland so that continuous lubrication is provided and the conjunctiva is kept moist. • Vasculature • The arterial supply is by the lacrimal artery (branch of the opthalmic 306 arteries). • Innervation • Secretomotor (parasympathetic) preganglionic fibres are derived from the facial nerve (CN VII). • The fibres are carried by the greater petrosal nerve (branch of the CN VII) to the pterygopalatine ganglion where they synapse. • From the pterygopalatine ganglion the postganglionic fibres enter the zygomatic branch of the maxillary nerve (CN V2). • The fibres then cross via a communicating branch from the zygomatic nerve to the lacrimal branch of the opthalmic nerve. • The lacrimal nerve innervates the lacrimal gland. The lacrimal lake and caruncle • Where the superior and inferior eyelids meet medially and laterally, the medial and lateral angles or canthi are formed respectively. • In the medial canthus of the eye is an area called the lacrimal lake, which contains a small fleshy body, called the lacrimal caruncle. • Lateral to the lacrimal caruncle is a fold of conjunctiva, which slightly overlaps the eye. • This fold is called the semilunar fold. The lacrimal sac • This lies in the lacrimal sulcus on the medial wall of the orbit. • It is continuous with the nasolacrimal duct, which opens into the inferior meatus of the nasal cavity. -The Head D The Eyeball (bulbus oculi) 83-85 Structure • The eyeball consists of three concentric layers. • These layers are an external fibrous layer, a middle vascular layer and an i nternal retinal layer. a) The external fibrous layer • This is continuous with the dura mater and consists of: the sclera and the cornea. I. The sclera • The sclera is the white of the eye and forms the posterior 5 /6 of the eyeball. • It provides insertion for the extraocular muscles. II. The cornea • The cornea is transparent and forms the anterior 1 I6 of the fibrous coat of the eyeball. • A layer of epithelium covers the anterior surface of the cornea. • This epithelium is continuous with the conjunctiva at the margins of the cornea. • The cornea joins the sclera at the limbus. b) The middle vascular layer This layer is continuous with the pia and arachnoid mater. It consists of: the choroid, Iris and the ciliary body • • i). The choroid • The choroid lines most of the sclera, and near the corneal limbus gives off a ring of ciliary processes called the corona ciliaris. • The peripheral ends of these processes are attached to the ciliary ring which is joined to the anterior end of the choroid. • The central ends point towards the lens and the posterior chamber. ii. ) The iris • The iris is situated anterior to the lens, and divides the area between the cornea and the lens into a large anterior and small posterior chamber. • The iris forms a diaphragm with a central aperture, called the pupil, for conducting light. • The two chambers communicate with each other via the pupil. • The iris has circular muscle fibres which constitute the constrictor pupillae muscle and radial fibres which constitute the dilator pupillae muscle. • The constrictor pupillae muscles are innervated by the parasympathetic fibres of the occulomotor nerve and the dilator pupillae muscles by sympathetic fibres from the periarterial plexus of the opthalmic artery. 307 iii.) The ci/iary body • The main functions of the ciliary body are: a) Suspension of the lens and accomodation. b) Secretion of aqueous fluidinto the anterior chamber of the eye. • The ciliary body consists of an ex ternal part called the ciliary muscle and an internal part called the ciliary processes. • The ciliary muscle connects the circumference of the iris with the choroid. • It has radiating(or meridional) fibres and circular fibres. • The radiating fibres arise from the deep aspect of the sclerocorneal junction and radiate posteriorly to attach to the ciliary processes and r ing. • When they contract, they draw the ciliary processes forwards thus relaxi ng the suspensory ligaments. • The lens, being elastic, then assumes a more convex shape and is able to focus at a shorter distance. • The adjustment is known as accomodation. c) The internal retinal layer • The optic vesicle is an evagination of the brain which forms the retina during development. • The anterior half of the optic vesicle involutes against the posterior half to form an optic cup which has two layers of retinal tissue: i) Outer pigmented layer • The outer layer is heavily pigmented to prevent the reflection of light. ii) Inner neural layer • This light sensitive neural layer ends anteriorly at the posterior edge of the ciliary body in a wavy border called the ora serrata retinae. • A thin prolongation, the ciliary part of the retina, covers the ciliary body and it is continued over the back of the iris as the iridial part of the retina. • In the posterior part of this layer is the optic disc or blind spot where the optic nerves enter the eye and spread out in the neural layer. • The optic disc is insensitive to light as t here are no photoreceptors. • Lateral to the optic disc is an oval yellow area called the macula lutea. • The central depressed area of the macula is called the fovea centralis, with its center known as the foveola. • Here there is a high concentration of cones and vision is most acute. • The retina is supplied by the central artery of the retina, a branch of the ophthalmic artery The retractile material of the eyeball • Light passing to the retina passes through several media and thus gets refracted. -The Head • These media are, from external to internal: a ) The cornea • This is responsible for most of the refraction of light in the eye. • The cornea is lined by the bulbar conjunctiva. b) The aqueous humour • This is found in the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. • It is secreted by the ciliary processes and provides nourishment for the avascular cornea and lens. • The fluid drains from the iridocorneal angle into a canal, the sinus venosus sclerae (Schlemm's canal) close to the sclerocorneal junction. • The sinus is drained by anterior ciliary veins which end in opthalmic veins. c) The lens • This is a bi-concave disc which is enclosed in an elastic transparent capsule. • It is suspended from the ciliary process by the suspensory ligament of the lens. d) The vitreous humour • This is a colourless jelly which occupies the vitreous chamber between the lens and the retina. • The periphery of the humour condenses to form the vitreous membrane. • Anteriorly there is a concavity in the membrane called the hyaloid (glassy) fossa, which accommodates the lens. • The part of the vitreous membrane in front of the ora serrata is thickened and forms the zonula circularis. • This splits into two layers: i. An anterior layer passes over the ciliary processes to the equator of the lens, thus forming the suspensory ligaments of the lens. ii. a posterior layer which lines the hyaloid fossa Clinical Hyperemia of the Conjunctiva The bulbous conjunctiva is colorless except when its vessels are dilated and congested \"bloodshot eyes\". Hyperemia of the eye is caused by local irritation (e.g. smoke, dust etc.). Subconjuctival Hemorrhage A common and are manifested by bright or dark red patches deep to and in the bulbar conjunctiva. The hemorrhage can occur from injury or inflammation. Rupture of small subconjuctiv al capillaries can occur from trauma, excessive hard blowing of nose, and paroxysms of coughing or violent sneezing. Papilledema: 308 An increase in CSF pressure slows venous return form the retina, causing edema of the retina. This is viewed during opthalmoscopy as swelling of the optic disc - papilledema. Opthalmoscopy: examination of the eye using an opthalmoscope to visualize certain structures in the eye including: the pale opti c disc, the macula lutea, the radiating retinal vessels and the fovea centralis. The retina contains the only blood vessels that can be readily observed in the body Corneal abrasions: Foreign objects such as di rt/sand produce corneal abrasions that cause sudden stabbing eye pain and excessive tears with pain on opening and closing eyelids. Corneal lacerations Presbyopia: As people get older their lenses become harder and more flattened. These changes reduce the focusing power of the lenses and reading matter for instance has to be held awkwardly at arms length - presbyopia. Cataracts: Loss of transparency of the lens to opaqueness. The lens can be removed surgically and the loss of refracting power replaced by spectacles. Cataract extraction is a routine eye operation Hyphema: Hemorrhage into the anterior chamber of the eye usually results from blunt trauma to the eye. Initially the anterior chamber is tinged red as blood accumulates in the cavity. The initial hemorrhage stops after a few days and recovery is usually good Glaucoma: Drainage of aqueous humor through scleral venous sinuses decreases significantly there is a buildup of intraocular pressure in the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. Blindness can occur from compression of the neural layer of the retina and the retinal blood supply. Central Retinal Artery Blockage: Terminal branches of the central retinal artery are end arteries, obstruction of them by an embolus results in immediate and total blindness. Blockage is usually unilateral and occurs mainly in the elderly. -The Head E The Muscles of the Orbit 80 a) The rectus muscles • There are four recti muscles which arise from the common tendinous ring surrounding the optic canal and the junction of the superior and inferior orbital fissures. • From their origin the muscles run anteriorly, close to the walls of the orbit, each according to its name viz. superior, inferior, medial, and lateral. • Each attaches to the eyeball 0,5 cm posterior to the sclerocorneal junction. • The lateral and medial rectus muscles lie in the same horizontal plane and th e superior and inferior rectus muscles lie in the same vertical plane. Muscle Action (to front of eyball) Innervation Superior Rectus Turns eyeball upwards and Oculomotor nerve medially (CN Ill) Inferior Rectus Turns eyeball downwards and medially Medial Rectus Turns eyeball medially Lateral Rectus Turns front of eveball laterally Abducent Nerve (CN VI] b) The oblique muscles of the eye • These muscles can only abduct the eye from a medial position to the resting position. • Abduction beyond this point depends entirely on the lateral rectus muscle. a) The superior oblique muscle Origin: The roof of the orbit (the body of the sphenoid) supero-medial to the optic canal. Insertion: Passing forward the muscle forms a tendon. • This tendon passes through the trochlea, a fibrocartilagenous pulley-like loop attached to the superomedial angle of the orbit. • The tendon then passes posterolaterally (inferior to the superior rectus) to insert into the sclera in its superolateral aspect, posterior to the equator of the eyeball. Action: Turns the front of the eyeball downwards and laterally. Innervation: Trochlear nerve (CN IV). b) The inferior oblique muscle Origin: The floor of the orbit (the maxilla) just lateral to the opening of the nasolacrimal canal. The lateral part of the sclera, deep to the lateral rectus. Turns the front of the eyeball upwards and laterally. Occulomotor nerve (CN Ill). Insertion: Action: Innervation: 309 Clinical: Oculomotor nerve palsy: Affects most of the ocular muscles including levator palpebrae superiosis and sphincter pupillae. The superior eyelid droops and cannot be raised voluntarily because of unopposed orbicularis oculi tonus (CN VII}. The pupil is fully dilated and unreactive (unopposed dilator pupillae). The pupil is fully abducted and depressed (down and out) because of unopposed lateral rectus and superior oblique action. -The Head F The Vasculature of the Orbit 81 a) The opthalmic arterv • The opthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery. • It passes through the optic foramen within the dural sheath of the optic nerve. • It then follows a si nuous course around the opti c nerve, first lying inferior, then lateral, then superior and finally medial to the nerve. • It runs anteriorly close to the superomedi al wall of the orbit. • It has the following branches: i) Central artery of the retina • This is one of the smallest branches of the opthalmic artery. • It arises inferior to the optic nerve and runs within the dural sheath of the optic nerve towards the eyeball. • There it pierces the optic nerve and runs within its substance to emerge through the optic disc to supply the internal surface of the retina. • This artery is essentially an end artery i. e. it does not anastomose with any other artery and blockage of this artery will cause blindness. ii) The other branches correspond with the branches of the opthalmi c division of the trigeminal nerve i.e. ethmoidal, supratrochlear, supraorbital, lacrimal, muscular, ciliary, anterior and posterior ethmoidal branches. b) The opthalmic vein • The main veins of the orbit are the superior and inferior opthalmic veins, and the central vein of the retina. i) The superior opthalmic vein • Anteriorly, the superior opthalmic vein anastomoses with the facial vein. • Posteriorly, it passes through the superior orbital fissure to end in the cavernous sinus. • As the vein has no valves blood can flow in any direction in the vein. ii) The inferior opthalmic vein • The inferior opthalmic vein begins as a plexus on the floor of the orbit. • It passes through the inferior orbital fissure to anastomose with the pterygoid plexus. • It may also communicate with the superior opthalmic vein. iii) The central vein of the retina • This vein usually drains into the cavernous sinus but it may also end by joining the superior opthalmic vein. Clinical: Central Retinal vein blockage: The central vein of the retina enters the cavernous sinus, thrombophlebitis of this sinus may result in the passage of thrombi to the central vein and produce clotting in the small retinal veins. Blockage of the central retinal vein usually 310 results in slow, painless loss of vision. G The Innervation of the Orbit 82 • The nerves which enter the orbit are the optic nerve (CN II), the opthalmic and maxillary branches of the trigeminal nerve (CN V), the occulomotor nerve (CN Ill), the trochlear nerve (CN IV), and the abducent nerve (CN VI). a) The opthalmic nerve (CN V1) • Just before the opthalmic nerve enters the orbit it divides into the nasociliary, frontal and lacrimal nerves. • These branches enter the orbit through the superior orbital fiss ure. • The nasociliary nerve is the only one of the branches to pass through the common tendinous ring. i) The nasociliary nerve • The branches of the nasociliary nerve in the orbit are: 1) The anterior ethmoidal nerve • This nerve is one of the terminal branches of the nasociliary nerve. • It leaves the orbit via the anterior ethmoidal canal which leads to the lateral edge of the cribiform plate (in the anterior cranial fossa). • The nerve then leaves the anterior cranial fossa via a slit at the anterior end of crista galli, and passes i nto the nasal cavity where it supplies the nasal mucosa. • It terminates as the ex ternal nasal branch. 2) The infratrochlear nerve • This is the other terminal branch of the nasociliary nerve. • It passes below the trochlea of the tendon of superior oblique and leaves the orbit to supply the skin and conjunctiva in the superomedial region. 3) Long ci/iary nerves • These two nerves pierce the sclera to lie between it and the choroid. • They supply the ciliary body, the cornea and the sympathetic fibres for dilator papillae of the iris. • These sympathetic fibres are derived from the periarterial plexus around the internal carotid artery. 4) Posterior ethmoidal nerve • This nerve passes through the posterior ethmoidal canal to supply the mucosa of the sphenoid and ethmoidal air sinuses. 5) Communicating branches to the ciliary ganglion. ii) The frontal nerve • This nerve runs superior to levator palpebrae superioris and then divides into -The Head two branches: 1) Supraorbital nerve • This nerve passes with the supraorbital artery through the supraorbital notch or foramen to supply the skin of the upper eyelid, forehead and scalp. • The mucosa of the frontal sinus is also supplied. 2) Supratrochlear nerve • This passes superior to the trochlea with the supratrochlear artery. • It supplies the skin of the upper eyelid and forehead (near the midline). iii} The lacrimal nerve • The lacrimal nerve runs on the lateral rectus to reach the lacrimal gland. • Parasympathetic fibres pass from the pterygopalatine ganglion into the lacrimal gland via the zygomatic branch of the maxillary nerve (CN V2 ). • The lacrimal nerve carries these parasympathetic (secretomotor) fibres to the lacrimal gland. b) The maxillary nerve (CN V2) • The maxillary nerve enters the orbit via the inferior orbital fissure. • Branches of the maxillary nerve relevant to the orbit are: i) The zygomatic nerve • The two branches of this nerve, the zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal nerves, enter the lateral wall of the orbit via the zygomatico-orbital foramina. c) The ciliary ganglion • The ciliary ganglion is suspended from the maxillary nerve in the eyeball between the optic nerve and the lateral rectus. • It receives: i. A sensory root from the nasociliary nerve (branch of CN V1). ii. Parasympathetic preganglionic fibres from the occulomotor nerve (CN Ill). iii. Sympathetic fibres from the internal carotid plexus via the opthalmic artery. • It gives off: i. About 10 to 20 short ciliary nerves which run with the optic nerve and supply sensation to the cornea and the eyeball. ii. Motor (parasympathetic postganglionic) fibres to the ciliary muscle and the sphincter pupillae. iii. Sympathetic fibres to the vessels of the iris and the dilator pupillae muscles. Relations of the superior orbital fissure • The vessels and nerves that pass through the superior orbital fissure do so in a very specific order. 311 • Recall that the common tendinous ring surrounds the optic canal and a part of the superior orbital fissure. • Thus structures which pass through the superior orbital fissure may pass through the common tendinous ring, above it, or below it.

The brain is regarded by most as a complex, mystical organ that is not meant o be understood by anyone other than a neurology professor. This misconception is further propagated by neuroanatomy texts which delve into the subject in such detail that the reader becomes confused and gives up hope. We have tried to improve on older texts by: l. Including enough detail so that the reader has a thorough understanding and knowledge of the nervous system, but avoiding clinically irrelevant and potentially confusing facts. 2. Stressing the relationship between the anatomy and the physiology of the various structures. This chapter is spent explaining the jargon used in describing the nervous system. Understanding these terms is half the battle won. Divisions • The nervous system may be divided on either an anatomical basis or a functional basis. Anatomical division • Anatomically the nervous system is divided into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). • The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord. • The PNS consists of all nervous tissue other than the CNS. • The nerves of the PNS may arise from either the brain or from the spinal cord. • Nerves arising from the brain are called cranial nerves and nerves arising from the spincal cord are called spinal nerves. • There are twelve cranial nerves, appropriately labelled CN I to CN XII (they are discussed in detail later on). • There thirty one spinal nerves: a) Eight arise from the cervical part of the spinal cord. b) Twelve arise from the thoracic part of the spinal cord. c) Five arise from the lumbar part of the spinal cord. d) Five arise from the sacral part of the spinal cord. e) There is only coccygeal spinal nerve. Functional division • Functionally the nervous system may be divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. • The somatic nervous system is also called the voluntary nervous system and 314 innervates structures such as muscles. • The autonomic nervous system is also called the involunatary nervous system and innervates structures such as the heart and gastrointestinal tract. • Some authors describe the nervous system as follows: The nervous system may be divided into the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system may in turn be divided into the autonomic and the somatic nervous system. This division makes no sense as the anatomical and functional divi sions are mixed. As you will see the CNS contains both autonomic and somatic componenets. These components do not spontaneously arise from nowhere in the PNS as suggested above. Ganglia and tracts • The smallest functional unit of the nervous system is the neuron or nerve cell. You should read about the different types of neurons in your micro- anatomy text before you continue with this secti on. • Neurons are not homogeneously scattered throughout the nervous system but rather neurons that have similar functions are grouped together. • T here is thus functional groups of cell bodies with a bundle of nerve fibres extending from them making up the nervous system. • A group of cell bodies in the CNS is called a nucleus and in the PNS is called a ganglion. • The group of nerve fibres that emerges from a nucleus is called a tract or fasciculus and those emerging from a ganglion is called a peripheral nerve (or simply nerve for short). • Tracts and nerves have either a sensory or motor function (or both in which case they are said to be mixed). NOTE FOR USE AND UNDERSTANDING OF CNS SECTION • Although it is convenient to label nerves and tracts simply as being \"motor\" or \"sensory\", it doesn't tell you about the exact nature of stimulus that the structure is transmitting. A three letter labelling system was therefore devised. This system is quite akward and takes a long time to get used to, but if you learn the generalisations below, you should have a good understanding of it. • The understanding of the nerves and tracts mentioned can be emphasized if they are grouped into categories so commonality can be seen. • The groupings accentuate understanding but it is to be stressed that their understanding is not the bottom line of neuroanatomy and the subject can be learnt adequately without their mastering • Thus, it is highlighted again that learning neuroanatomy can be a frustrating but ultimately rewarding experience. Do not lose heart along the way. The CNS • Tracts and peripheral nerves can be classified according to three criteria: a) General or special • Nerves classified as general supply structures which have developed from somites and those classified as special supply structures which have developed from pharyngeal arches. • In more practical terms, nerves which are labelled as special are those sensory nerves associated with the olfaction, vision, hearing and balance, and those motor nerves that innervate the striated muscles which developed from pharyngeal arches i.e. the striated muscles of the head and the neck. • All other nerves are labelled as general. b) Visceral or somatic • Nerves which innervate the organs or viscera are visceral nerves, while nerves which innervate skeletal muscle, skin and joints are somatic nerves. c) Afferent or efferent • Motor nerves are called efferent nerves and sensory nerves are called afferent nerves.

THE SPINAL CORD A External Anatomy of the Spinal Cord 153 Position • The spinal cord (or spinal medulla) lies in the vertebral canal in the vertebral column. • It is continuous above with the medulla oblongata at the foramen magnum. • The spinomedullary junction is indicated by: • The foramen magnum. • The pyramidal decussation. • The origin of ventral rami of C 1 . • In the lumbar region the spinal cord expands to form the conus medullaris. • The spinal cord ends at the tapering end of conus medullaris. • This point is variable and usually lies at the upper border of L2 or at the intervertebral disc between L 1 and L2. • The spinal cord is shorter than the vertebral canal because the vertebral canal grows faster than the spinal cord (in the newborn the spinal cord ends at the lower border of L2). • Support of the Spinal Cord • The spinal cord is anchored superi orly by the following structures: a) Denticulate ligaments • These are teeth-like projections of the pia mater that attach to the spinal dura throughout its length. • (Refer to the section on the pia mater for more details). b) Fi/um terminale • This is a 20 cm long connective tissue filament which extends inferiorly from the tip of the conus medullaris. • Its proximal 15 cm, the filum terminale internum, is surrounded by extensions of the arachnoid and dura mater up to the level of the lower border of S2. • Proximally the filum is continuous with the pia mater. • Its distal 5cm, the filum terminale externum, fuses with the surrounding dura mater and attaches to the posterior aspect of the coccyx. c) Spinal nerve roots provide secure segmental attachment as they leave the verterbal canal via the intervertebral foramina. Fissures and Sulci • The spinal cord is a cylindrical structure which has several sulci and a fissure. • The ventral (anterior) median fissure is a deep groove in the median The CNS sagittal plane. • The sulci are: a) The dorsal (posterior) median sulcus • This is a less distinct groove posteriorly and is continuous with the posterior median septum. b) The dorsal (posterior) intermediate sulcus • This lies lateral to the dorsal median sulcus and demarcates the fasciculus gracilis from the fasciculus cuneatus. c) The ventrolateral and dorsolateral sulci These indicate the site of origin of the ventral and dorsal roots respectively. Spinal Meninges • Meni nges are membranes which cover the brain and the spinal cord. • The meninges, from external to internal are: a) The dura mater also known as the pachymeni x. b) The arachnoid mater. c) The pia mater. • The arachnoid mater and the pia mater are collectively known as the leptomeninges (delicate membranes). • The meninges of the brain and spinal cord are similar but not exactly the same, and they are therefore discussed separately. a) Dura Mater • This is the tough external sheath that is continuous with the inner meningeal layer of the intracranial dura mater. • It is not fused to the vertebral periosteum in the vertebral canal as the periosteum is analogous to the outer endosteal layer of the intracranial dura. • The epidural space lies between the periosteum of the vertebral canal and the spinal dura mater. • It contains adipose tissue, venous plexuses and emergent spinal nerve roots. • Superiorly, the dura is attached to the foramen magnum and the posterior longitudinal ligament of the bodies of C2,3. • Inferiorly, the dura fuses with the filum terminale at the level of S2 and then extends inferiorly to attach to the posterior surface of the coccyx. • Along the length of the spinal cord the dura is also attached to the intervertebral foramina by extensions around the spinal nerve roots. • The dura mater forms a separate sheath for each of the dorsal and ventral roots. • The adjacent surfaces of theses sheaths are fused just proximal to the dorsal root ganglion. b) Arachnoid Mater • This is a thin membranous layer connected to the pia mater by web-like 316 strands called trabeculae. • Distally it terminates at the level of S2 by fusing with the filum terminale. • The subdural space is a potential space between the arachnoid mater and the dura mater. • The subarachnoid space which lies between the arachnoid and pia mater contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). c) The Pia Mater • This is a delicate membrane closely adherent to the neural tissue of the spinal cord. • Beyond the conus medullaris the pia mater continues as the filum terminale. • It plays an important role in anchoring the spinal cord in the vertebral canal by means of the following: i) The denticulate ligaments • These are 21 paired triangular laminae of pia mater that pierce the arachnoid membrane to attach to the dura mater between the intervertebral foramina. • They form two incomplete teeth-like septa on either side of the spinal cord. ii) The posteromedian ligament • This is an ill-defined structure more prominent in the lower cervical and thoracic region. The CNS B Internal Anatomy of the Spinal 158-160 The spi nal cord consists of grey matter and white matter. The grey matter is centrally located in the spinal cord and is H or butterfly shaped. The white matter is located peripherally. The white appearance of the white matter is because of the large number of myelinated nerve fibres. The Grey Matter Anatomical Sub-division • The grey matter appears grey as it contains a l arge number of neuronal cell bodies, glial cells and unmyelinated dendrites. • The neuronal cell bodies that have anatomical and functional similarities are grouped into cell columns called nuclei. • The laminae correspond closely, but not completely, with the nuclei. • On each side the grey matter is divided into a dorsal horn, a ventral horn and a lateral horn. • The dorsal and ventral horns are united by a thin grey commissure (connecti ng band of tissue) in which the central canal lies. • The central canal is continuous rostrally with the fourth ventricle of the brain. a) The Dorsal horn • This is found at all levels and recei ves the sensory (GSA and GVA) fibres that enter the spi nal cord. • The dorsal horn has the following nuclei: i) Dorsomarginal nucleus . ii) Substantia gelatinosa which integrates input for the ventral and lateral spinothalamic tracts. iii) Nucleus proprius which gives rise to the ventral and lateral spinothalamic tracts. iv) Nucleus dorsalis of Clarke which gives rise tothe dorsal spinocerebellar tract. b) The Ventral horn • This is found at all levels • The horn is mainly motor in function and relays motor (GSE) fibres. • Some of the nuclei of the ventral horn are: i) The sacral parasympathetic nucleus which extends from S2 to S4 and gives rise to the preganglionic parasympathetic fibres which innervate the pelvic viscera. ii) The medial motoneuron nucleus which extends the entire length of the spinal cord and gives rise to motor fibres which innervate the axial 317 muscles. iii) The lateral motoneuron nucleus which extends the entir e length of the spinal cord and gives rise to motor fibres which innervate the appendicular or limb muscles. c) The Lateral horn • This is found at levels Tl to L2 and relays GVE fibres. • It contains, amongst others, the intermediolateral nucleus which ex tends from Tl to L3 and gives rise to preganglionic sympathetic fibres. The White Matter Anatomical Subdivision • The white matter is divided into the following parts on each side: a) A dorsal column • This is located between the posterior median sulci and the dorsolateral sulci. • Above the level of T6 it is divided by the posterior intermediate septum into a medial fasciculus gracilis and a lateral fasciculus cuneatus. b) A lateral column • This is located between the dorsolateral and ventrolateral sulci. c) A ventral column • This is located between the anterior median fissure and the ventrolateral sulci. d) A ventral white commissure • This is located between the central canal and the anterior median fissure. The CNS C The Spinal Nerves 163 The Origin of the Spinal Nerves • The spinal cord gives rise to 31 pairs of spinal nerve roots. • It is enlarged in the segments innervating the limbs: a) The cervical enlargement extends from the spinal segments C5 to Tl. b) The lumbosacral enlargement extends from the spinal segments L3 to S2. • The spinal nerves are distributed in the following way: a) Eight cervical spinal nerves. • Even though there are only seven cervical vertebrae, there are eight cervical spinal nerves. • This is because the spinal nerves C 1 to Cl arise rostral to the corresponding cervical vertebra, and CS arises caudal to the seventh cervical vertebra. • The first thoracic and subsequent spinal nerves arise caudal to the corresponding vertebra. b) Twelve thoracic spinal nerves. c) Five lumbar spinal nerves. d) Five sacral spinal nerves. e) One coccygeal spinal nerve. • The spinal nerves all emerge through the intervertebral foramina except: a) Cl which passes between the atlas and the skull. b) S5 and the coccygeal spinal nerves which emerge via the sacral hiatus. • As the vertebral column is longer than the spinal cord, the caudal spinal nerves have to run a progressively longer, more inferior and more acutely- angled course to reach their corresponding intervertebral foramina. • Distal to the termination of the spinal cord the lumbosacral nerve roots extend downwards in the subarachnoid space to reach the respective intervertebral foramina. • These nerve roots are known as the cauda equina (horse's tail). Structure of the Spinal Nerves • Each spinal nerve is formed by the union of a dorsal (sensory) root and a ventral (motor) root in the intervertebral foramen. • Spinal nerves are thus regarded as mixed nerves as they convey both motor and sensory information. a) Dorsal root • Sensory fibres are relayed from the periphery to the dorsal root ganglion (located in the intervertebral canal) where they synapse on pseudounipolar neurons. • The dorsal root then forms a number of dorsal rootlets or fila which enter the spinal cord at the dorsolateral sulcus. 318 b) Ventral root • The ventral root, which relays motor fibres, originates from a number of ventral rootlets or fila which emerge from the ventrolateral sulcus of the spinal cord. • The rootlets unite to form the ventral root, which exits via the intervertebral foramen, where it unites with the dorsal root to form the mixed spinal nerve. Dermatomes, sclerotomes and myotomes • The derivatives of every somite are innervated by a corresponding spinal nerve: • A dermatome refers to the cutaneous area thus innervated. • A myotome refers to the muscles thus innervated. • A sclerotome refers to bones and ligaments thus innervated. Important dermatomes to remember are: C2 which abuts on the sensory area of CN V. C 3,4 which innervates the \"cape\" area T4 which innervates the area at the level of the nipple. Tl 0 which innervates the area at the level of the umbilicus. L 1 which innervates the inquinal reoion. S2,3 which innervate the perianal area. Note: • There is considerable overlap between dermatomes. The CNS D Vasculature of the Spinal Cord 164-165 The Arterial Supply • The spinal cord is supplied by three longitudinal vessels namely the anterior spinal artery and two posterior spinal arteries. a) Anterior spinal artery • At the junction of the upper and lower halves of the medulla, in the median plane, each vertebral artery gives rise to an anterior spinal artery. • The left and right anterior spinal arteries join to form a single trunk which descends on the mouth of the anterior median fissure. b) Posterior spinal arteries • The posterior spinal arteries arise bilaterally from either the vertebral artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. • Each posterior spinal artery divides into two trunks that descend anterior and posterior to the dorsal nerve roots respectively. c) Spinal branches of extra vertebral arteries • These arteries arise as follows: i. In the neck they arise from the vertebral artery and the ascending and deep cervical arteries. ii. In the thorax they arise from the supreme and posterior intercostal arteries. iii. In the lumbar region they arise from the lumbar and lateral sacral arteries. • These spinal branches each divide into an anterior and a posterior radicular branch that reach the spinal cord via the intervertebral foramina along the ventral and dorsal roots respectively. • The anterior and posterior radicular arteries join the anterior and posterior spinal arteries respectively. The Venous Drainage • Veins draining the spinal cord drain into an internal vertebral venous plexus situated in the epidural space. • This plexus communicates: i. Superiorly with the intracranial occipital and transverse venous sinuses via the foramen magnum. ii. With the external venous plexuses situated outside the vertebral column. • Both the internal and external plexuses drain into the intervertebral veins, which then in turn drain into the vertebral, posterior intercostal, lumbar, and lateral sacral veins. 319 E Tracts of the Spinal Cord 158 Overview • Functionally the white matter consists of: a) Ascending tracts which relay sensory information from the periphery to the central structures. b) Descending tracts which relay motor information from the central structures to the peri phery. • There are many tracts but only those that are cli nically relevant will be discussed in any detai l. Ascending tracts • Generally an ascending tract consists of a chain of three neurons: a) First order neurons which are always located in the dorsal root ganglion. b) Second order neurons which are located in the spinal cord or brain stem. c) Third order neurons which are usually located in the thalamus. • (Some of the ascending tracts only have a first and a second order neuron). • Each ascending tract usually decussates (crosses the midline) before it reaches its final destination. • Some of the ascending pathways mediating conscious sensation are: a. The dorsal columns which relay the descriminitive modalities eg conscious proprioception (position) and fine touch. b. The lateral spinothalamic tracts relaying pain and temperature sensation. c. The ventral spi nothalamic tracts relaying pressure and coarse touch sensation. • Some of the ascending pathways mediating unconscious sensation are the dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar pathways which relay sensory information to the cerebellum to enable coordination of muscle movement. Descending tracts • The descending tracts are divided into two main groups: b) The pyramidal tract • This tract is responsible for voluntary muscle movement. c) The extrapyramidal tracts • The extrapyramidal tracts refer to all the descending tracts other than the pyramidal tract. • These tracts, which relay somatic and visceral motor fibres, include: 1. The vestibulospinal tract. 2. The reticulospinal tract. The CNS 3. The rubrospinal tract. 4. The tectospinal tract. The Ascending Tracts The Dorsal Columns Function • This tract relays the decriminitive modalities i.e. a.Conscious proprioception (eg. being able to tell the position of a limb}. b.Stereocognosis (form recognition}. c. Pressure and vibration. d. Two-point discrimination. e. Light touch sensation. First order neurons • The first order neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia. • Their dendri tes run from receptors in the skin (eg. Meissner's and pacinian corpuscles} and in the muscular system (eg. muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs). • Their axons enter the spinal cord via the dorsal roots and ascend on the ipsilateral side in one of two fasciculi: a. The sacral fibres, lumbar fibres and thoracic fibres T 6 to Tl 2 ascend in the fasciculus gracilisFasciculus;gracilis which is the medial component of the dorsal column. b. The thoracic fibres Tl to T 6 ascend in the fasciculus cuneatus which is the lateral component of the dorsal column. • The axons of the first order neurons terminate in the caudal medulla by synapsing with the second order neurons. Second order neurons • The second order neurons are located in the caudal medulla where they are organised into the nucleus cuneatus and the nucleus gracilis • Their axons decussate to form a bundle of fibres called the medial lemniscus and ascend to the thalamus where they terminate in the ventral posterolateral (VPL} nucleus of the thalamus by synapsing with the third order neurons. Third order neurons • These are located in the VPL nucleus of the thalamus. • Their axons project via the posterior limb of the internal capsule to the somatosensory area of the postcentral gyrus. 320 The Spinothalamic Tracts There are two spinothalamic tracts called the lateral and ventral spinothalamic tracts. I) Lateral Spinothalamic Tract Function • This tract relays pain and temperature sensations. First order neurons • The first order neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia. • Their dendrites run from receptors in the skin, musculoskeletal apparatus and viscera. • Their axons enter the spinal cord and then usually run either up or down a spinal segment or two in the dorsolateral tract of Lissauer. • They terminate in the dorsal horn where they synapse with the second order neurons. Second order neurons • The second order neurons are located in the dorsal horn. • Their axons decussate in the ventral white commissure to ascend in the contralateral lateral column so forming the lateral spinothalamic tract. • In the brainstem the axons join the medial lemniscus to reach the ventral posterolateral (VPL} nucleus of the thalamus where they terminate by synapsing with the third order neurons. • In the brainstem the axons are sometimes described as a separate tract, the spinal lemniscus. Third order neurons • The third order neurons are located in the VPL nucleus of the thalamus. • Their axons project via the posterior limb of the internal capsule to the somatosensory area of the postcentral gyrus. II) Ventral Spinothalamic Tract • The ventral spinothalamic tract is continuous with the lateral spinothalamic tract, and can be considered as the ventral part of the spinothalamic complex. Function • This tract relays coarse touch and pressure sensation. First order neurons • The first order neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia. • Their axons project to the dorsal horn where they terminate by synpasing with the second order neurons. The CNS Second order neurons • The second order neurons are located in the dorsal horn. • Their axons decussate in the ventral white commissure and ascend in the contralateral ventral column so forming the ventral spinothalamic tract. • The axons terminate in the thalamus where they synapse with the third order neurons. Third order neurons • The third order neurons are located in the VPL nucleus of t he thalamus. • Their axons project via the posterior limb of the internal capsule to the postcentral gyrus. The Spinocerebellar Tracts There are two spinocerebellar tracts: the dorsal and the ventral spinocerebellar tracts. Function • Both tracts relay unconscious proprioceptive information to the cerebellum to enable coordination of movement and posture. I) Dorsal Spinocerebellar Tract First order neurons • The first order neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia of CS to S3. • Their dendrites run from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs. • Their axons enter the grey matter of the spinal cord and terminate by synapsing on the nucleus dorsalis of Clarke. • (The first order neurons provide the afferent limb of the muscle-stretch reflex). Second order neurons • The second order neurons are located in the nucleus dorsalis of Clarke. • Their axons ascend in the ipsilateral lateral column as the dorsal spinocerebellar tract to reach the cerebellum via the inferior cerebellar peduncle. • The axons terminate in the cerebellum. II) Ventral Spinocerebellar Tract First order neurons • The first order neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia of L 1 to S2. • Their dendrites run from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs. • Their axons enter the grey matter o f the spinal cord and termi nate by synapsing on a nucleus which has not yet been well-defined. 321 • (The first order neurons provide the afferent limb of the muscle-stretch reflex). Second order neurons • The second order neurons are located in the grey matter of the spinal cord. • Their axons decussate in the ventral white commissure to ascend in the contralateral lateral column as the ventral spinocerebellar tract. • The axons reach the cerebellum via the superior cerebellar peduncle. • They terminate in the cerebellum. The Descending Tracts The Pyramidal Tracts Function • The pyramidal tract is responsible for voluntary muscle contraction. Origin • The pyramidal tract arises mainly from the motor cortex of the precentral gyrus. Central Course • The pyramidal tract consists of two components: a) The corticobulbar or corticonuclear tract • This tract runs from the motor cortex to the brainstem. • It influences voluntary movements of the head and neck by effecting the lower motor neuron activity of the respective cranial nerves. b} The corticospinal tract • This tract runs from the motor cortex to the spinal cord. • Both of the above tracts descend via the ipsilateral internal capsule to the ventral aspect of the midbrain. • The corticobulbar fibres leave ipsilaterally and contralaterally to terminate at different brain stem levels. • The corticospinal tract descends ipsilaterally through the basis pedunculi of the midbrain and then through the pons to enter the medulla where it forms the medullary pyramidsPyramids; medulla. • The majority of the fibres [80%) decussate in the caudal medulla at the cervicomedullary junction to form the lateral corticospinal tract. • This decussation is called the pyramidal decussationDecussation;pyramidal of the medulla. • A few [20%) remain uncrossed and form the ventral corticospinal tract. Corticospinal fibres in the spinal cord The CNS a) The lateral corticospinal tract • It descends in the contralateral lateral column posterior t o the plane of the denticulate ligaments. • Diminishing in size, the tr act sends ax ons i nto the grey matter as it descends. • These axons influence, via a number of in t erneurons, the actions of oc and Y motor neurons. b) The ventral corticospinal tract • It descends in the ipsi lateral ventral column. • It ter minates by decussating at spinal cor d level in the ventral whi te commissur e. The Extrapyramidal tr acts • The extrapyramidal tracts refer to all the descendi ng t racts other than the pyrami dal tract. • These tracts, which relay somatic and visceral motor fibr es, include: l. The vestibulospinal tr act. 2. The reticulospinal tract. 3. The rubrospinal tr act. 4. The tectospin al tract. 322 2. GENERAL FEATURES OF THE BRAIN A The Meninges 94- 96 • The br ain, like the spinal cor d, is covered by thr ee me ninges. From ex tern al to internal they are: a) The dura mater. b) The arachnoid mater. c) The pi a mater. • Only the impor tant intracr anial modi fications of the meni nges will be di scussed. The Dura Mater (pachymeninx) Organisation • The dura of the brain consists of two layers: a) An outer endos teal layer. • T his layer is derived from the internal cranial periosteum and is therfore adherent to the internal surfaces of the cranial bones. • Through the cranial sutures and foramen magnum this layer is continuous with pericranium lining the outer surfaces of the cranial bones. • It is analogous to the per iosteum of the vertebral canal. b) An inner meningeal layer. • This layer becomes continuous with the spinal dura at the foramen magnum. • It provides tubular sheaths for the cranial nerves as they pass through the cranial foramina. • As the nerves emerge from the skull, this layer fuses with the epicranium of each nerve. • The meningeal layer surrounding the optic nerve fuses with the sclera of the eye. • The endosteal and the meningeal layers of the dura are tightly adherent except in two regions: a) Dural reflections • In certain regions the meningeal dura separates from the endosteal dura to form folds called dural reflections eg. falx cerebri. • There are four such reflections (or folds) and they are discussed in more detail on the next page. • The main function of these reflections is to incompletely divide the cranial cavity and support the brain. The CNS b) Venous sinuses • These are venous channel which lie between the two layers of the dura mater • The venous sinuses are also discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Vasculature of the dura • The dura and the cranial bones are supplied by the middle meningeal artery. • This is a clinically important artery as a head injury may cause it to rupture which may result in an extradural haemorrhage. • The artery will therefore be discussed in more detail. The Middle Meningeal Artery Origin • The middle meningeal artery arises from the maxillary artery. Course • From its origin the artery enters the skull via the foramen spinosum. • It runs anterolaterally on the floor of the middle cranial fossa and then turns superoanteriorly to reach the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. • Here it divides into two branches. Branches a) An anterior (frontal) branch • This branch runs superiorly towards the pterion. • In the region of the pterion, the artery often passes throught a bony tunnel. • It then curves supero-posteriorly and runs towards the vertex of the skull, passing parallel and slightly posterior to the coronal suture. • The artery often gives rise to a branch which runs posteriorly on the deep surface of the pari etal bone. b) A posterior (parietal) branch • This runs posteriorly over the dura covering the superior temporal gyrus towards the apex of the occipital bone. Dural Reflections • There are four dural reflections or folds. • There reflections project into the cranial cavity so dividing it into three intercommunicating compartments. • There are two compartments superior to the tentorium cerebelli (on either side of the falx cerebri) and one compartment inferior to the tentorium cerebelli. a) Faix Cerebri 323 • This is a crescent-shaped, midline structure that occupies the median longitudinal fissure of the cerebrum. • Anteriorly it is attached to the crista galli of the ethmoid bone. • It extends posteriorly, attached to the median sulcus of the calvaria. • Posteriorly it terminates at the internal occipital protuberance by attaching to the tentorium cerebelli at a right angle. • The falx cerebri is associated with the superior and inferior sagittal sinuses and the straight sinus. b) Tentorium Cerebelli • This is a tent-like structure separating the middle and posterior cranial fossae. • It thus overlies the cerebellum. • It is defective posterior to the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone to form the tentorial notch or incisure. • This notch transmits the midbrain and posterior cerebral arteries. • Posterolaterally it is attached to the lips of the transverse sulci of the occipital and parietal bones. • Anterolaterally it attaches to the superior aspect of the petrous part of the temporal bone and the posterior clinoid process on either side. • Anteriorly the free edge attaches to the anterior clinoid process on either side. • Thus the anterolateral and anterior attachment cross each other to form the trigeminal (Meckel's) cave between them. • This cave contains a) The trigeminal ganglion. b) The cavernous sinus. c) Diaphragma Sel/ae • This is a horizontal part of the dura, which overlies the sella turcica, and is pierced by the pituitary stalk or infundibulum. d) Faix Cerebelli • This is a small median septum of dura in the posterior fossa protruding into the posterior cerebellar notch. • It is often paired. • Posteriorly, it is attached to the internal occipital crest. • Superiorly, it is attached to the inferior aspect of the tentorium cerebelli. • Inferiorly, it is indistinct from the dura posterior to the foramen magnum. The Dural Venous Sinuses between the two layers of the dura mater. These will be discussed in the 'Venous drainage of the Brain'. The CNS The Arachnoid Mater The Aachnoid villi and granulations • The arachnoid villi are small protrusions of arachnoid mater that project through apertures in the the meningeal layer of dura into the venous sinuses. • They are particularly abundant in the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses. • With age the distal parts of these villi become distended. • These enlargements are called arachnoid granulations. • The arachnoid granulations often leave impression on the internal aspect of the cranium. • CSF from the subarachnoid space into the intracranial venous sinuses vi a these structures. The Subarachnoid cisterns • In certain regions the shape of the brain does not conform exactly t o the shape of the insi de of the cranium. • In these regions the pia mater (which lines the brain) and the arachnoid mater (which lines the dura mater) are separated by spaces called cisterns. • The cisterns are therefore pools of CSF in the subarachnoid space. • The subarachnoid trabeculae which connect the pia mater to the arachnoid mater are scant or absent in the regions. • The main cisterns are: a) The cistern of the lateral Fossa • It is formed where the arachnoid mater bridges the lateral fissure. • It contains the middle meningeal artery. b) The pre- and postchiasmatic cisterns • They are related to the optic chiasma. c) The interpeduncular cistern • It is formed where the arachnoid mater bridges the cerebral peduncles. • It contains the arterial circle of Willis. d) The cisterna ambiens • It is found on either side of the mi dbrain. • It contains CN IV, the posterior cerebral artery, the anterior choroidal artery, the optic tract and the basal vein of Rosenthal. e) The superior cistern 324 • It is located between the splenium of the corpus collosum and the superior cerebellar surface. • It contains the great cerebral vein and the pineal body. • The cisterna ambiens and the superior cistern may be regarded as a single cistern, the cistern of the great cerebral vein. f) The pontine cisternCistern;pontine • It is located anterior to the pons. • It communicates: i) Superiorly with the interpeduncular cistern. ii) Inferiorly with the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord. iii) Posteriorly with the cerebellomedullary cistern. • It contains the vertebral artery and the basilar artery and its branches. g) The cerebellomedullary cistern or cisterna magna • It is an extensive cistern formed where the arachnoid mater spans between the inferior cerebellar surface and the medulla. • Inferiorly it i s continuous with the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord. • CSF may be drained from this cistern by inserting a needle anterosuperiorly through the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane. Pia Mater • It differs from the spinal pia mater by being more vascular but slighltly less adherent to the neural tissue. • The pia is invaginated to form the tela choroidea and choroid plexus of the 3rd and 4th ventricles, and the choroi d plexus of the lateral ventricles. Clinical Rupture of a congenital aneurysm can result in haemorrhage into the subarachnoid spaces resulting in a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Sudden and intense headache, stiffness of the neck and loss of consciousness are indications. Inflammation of the dura is called pachymeningitis and is very rare. Meningitis refers to inflammation of the pia and arachnoid. Symptoms include severe headache over entire head and neck, vomiting, and stiffness of neck muscles. The CNS B The V asc ulature of the Brain 130-141 Arterial Supply of the Brain The arterial supply of the brain may be divided into an anterior and a posterior system. The anteri or system is formed by the internal carotid arteries and their cerebral branches. The posterior system is formed by the vertebral arteries and their branches. Both the anterior and the posterior systems lie in the subarachnoid space and communi cate with each other via the arterial circle of Willis. Internal Carotid Artery On each si de the internal carotid artery is formed by the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. It then runs upwards in the neck, enters the skull and divides into its two terminal branches, the anterior and the middle cerebral arteries. It is divided into four parts named the cervical part, the petrous part, the cavernous part and the cerebral part. Each of these parts will be discussed in detail. Origin • Each internal carotid artery is formed by the bifurcation of the common carotid artery at the level of C3,4. a) The Cervical Part Course and relations • The carotid artery has six sharp bends in its course. • It ascends anterior to the transverse processes of C 1 , 2, 3 in the carotid sheath and then runs vertically upwards towards the carotid canal in the petrous part of the temporal bone. • In its cervical course it lies on longus capitis, from which it is separated by the superior cervical ganglion and the superior laryngeal nerve. • Posterolaterally CN IX, X, XI and XII intervene between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein. • Medially it is separated from the pharynx by the ascending pharyngeal artery, and the external and internal laryngeal nerves. • Anterolaterally it is overlapped by the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein. • The artery is crossed by the posterior belly of the digastric. • Anteriorly, below the digastric, it is crossed by: a) The lingual and facial veins. b) The hypoglossal nerve. c) The superior root of ansa cervicalis. • Anteriorly, at the level of the digastric, it is crossed by: a) The occipital artery. 325 b) The posterior auricular artery. c) The stylohyoid muscle. • Anteriorly, above the digastric, it is separated from the external carotid artery by: a) CN IX and the pharyngeal branch of CN X. b) The styloglossus and stylopharyngeus muscles. c) The deep part of the parotid gland. Branches • The cervical part has no branches b) The Petro us Part Course and relations • It ascends in the carotid canal and then tuns anteromedially (1st bend) to run in the petrous temporal bone towards foramen lacerum. • It then turns upwards at a right angle i n foramen lacerum (2nd bend) to enter the floor of the cavernous sinus. Branches • The petrous branch has numerous small branches (not discussed). c) The Cavernous Part Course and relations • It ascends to the level of posterior clinoid process and turns anteriorly at a right angle (3rd bend) to run parallel to the body of the sphenoid bone in the cavernous sinus. • At the level of anterior clinoid process it turns upwards at a right angle (4th bend) and pierces the roof of the cavernous sinus behind the optic canal. • It now lies in the subarachnoid space. Branches • The cavernous part has numerous small branches (not discussed). d) The Cerebral Part Course and relations • The internal carotid artery then turns backwards at a right angle (5th bend) to lie on the roof of the cavernous sinus for a short distance. • It then bends upwards (6th bend) between CN II and Ill to end below the anterior perforated substance by dividing into its main branches. Branches • The branches of the cerebral part are: The CNS a) The opthalmic artery • This artery arises as the internal carotid artery emerges from the roof of the cavernous sinus. b) The anterior cerebral artery • This is a terminal branch of the internal carotid artery. • It runs anteromedially towards the longitudinal fissure and anterior to the optic chiasma it turns sharply superiorly to run in the fissure. • It runs on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere, just superior to the corpus callosum. c) The middle cerebral artery • This is the larger terminal branch of the internal carotid artery. • It runs laterally in the lateral cerebral sulcus and in the region of the insula divides up into a number of branches. d) The anterior choroidal Artery • This supplies the cerebral peduncle and then turns laterally to supply the choroid plexus of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. e) The posterior communicating artery which forms part of the arterial circle of Willis. Vertebral Artery This artery arises f rom the subclavian artery and then runs superiorly towards the skull. It may be divided into four parts namely the prevertebral part, the transversarial part, the atlantic part and the intracranial part. Each of these parts will be discussed in detail. The artery is surrounded by a sympathetic plexus derived from the inferior cervical ganglion. Origin • The vertebral artery arises from the l st part of the subclavian artery, deep to the vertebral vein. The Prevertebral Part Course and relations • This part of the artery passes through the triangle of the vertebral artery. • The base of this t riangle is formed by the l st part of the subclavian art ery. • The roof is formed by the carotid sheath and its contents. • The apex is t he t ubercle of the transverse process of C6. 326 • The limbs of the triangle are formed by scalenus anterior and longus colli. The Transversarial Part Course and relations • This part of the artery ascends through the foramina of the transverse processes of the upper 6 cervical vertebrae. • Here it lies anterior to the ventral rami of the cervical vertebrae. • The artery is surrounded by a venous plexus, which forms the vertebral vein below C6. Branches • The transversarial part has spinal and muscular branches. The Atlantic Part Course and relations • It emerges from the foramen transversarium of the atlas and runs backwards and medially. • It reaches the groove for the vertebral artery in the posterior atlantal arch, anteri or to the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane, to enter the vertebral canal. The lntracranial Part Course and relations • It enters the cranium via foramen magnum and pierces the dura and arachnoid maters to lie in the subarachnoid space. • On the lower, anterior aspect of the pons it unites with its fellow from the opposite side to form the basi lar artery in the midline. Branches • The intracranial part has the followi ng branches: • a) The posterior spinal arteries (these usually arise from the posterior cerebellar arteries). b) The anterior spinal arteries [See spinal cord). c) The posterior inferior cerebellar arteries • These may also arise from the basilar artery. • Each artery passes posteriorly, lying lateral to the medulla oblongata. • At the posterior border of the medulla it divides into a medial and a lateral branch, both of which supply the cerebellum. • The posterior inferior cerebellar art ery also supplies the lateral medulla and the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle. The CNS The Basilar Artery Origin and Course • This is a median artery formed by the junction of the two vertebral arteries. • It runs superiorly through the pontine cistern lying in the median groove of the pons. • It terminates at the upper border of the pons by dividing into two posterior cerebral arteries. Branches • The artery gives rise to the following paired branches: a) The anterior inferior cerebellar arteries • Each artery passes posterolaterally lying anterior to CN VI, VII and CN VIII. • It supplies these cranial nerves as well as the anteroinferi or part of the cerebellar surface. b) Numerous small ponti ne arteries. c) The labyrinthine artery • This runs with CN VIII towards the internal acoustic meatus. • It may also arise from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. d) The superior cerebellar arteriesArteries;cerebellar, anterior • It passes posteriorly along the upper border of the pons and then curves around the cerebral peduncle to reach the superior surface of the cerebellum. • It supplies the adjacent parts of the pons, the midbrain, and the superior surface of the cerebellum. e) The posterior cerebral arteries. • CN Ill and CN IV run between the superior cerebellar arteries and the posterior cerebral arteries. The Arterial Circle (of Willis) • The arterial circle of Willis is the circular anastomotic ring formed on the ventral surface of the brain between the anterior and posterior arterial systems. • This arterial anastomoses ensure maximum collateral supply to the brain i f any of the component arteries become occluded. • Most of the arterial circle lies in the interpeduncular fossa. • It is composed of seven vessels: • The anteri or cerebral arteries. • The anterior communicating branch between the two anterior cerebral arteries. • The posterior communicating arteries connecting the internal carotid artery with the posterior cerebral arteries. 327 • The posterior cerebral arteries. • There are a number of branches which arise from the circle, and these may be divided into one of two categories: Central branches • These branches enter the brain mainly via the anterior and posterior perforated substances (these structures are discussed later) to supply the internal parts of the brain. • These branches to not have extensive anastomoses. Cortical branches • These branches anastamose quite extensively on the pia mater. • They then give rise to smaller branches which enter the cortex and supply the brain. Clinical Circle of Willis: The anastomoses of the circle of Willis allow for alternative routes of circulation if vital vessels to the brain are occluded. These anastomoses can take over full function for a completely occluded major vessel over time. Because the constant flow of blood to the brain is so vital, these redundancies are lifesaving in many patients. Arterial Territories • Clinically, it is vitally important to know the areas or territories supplied by the constituent arteries of the carotid and vertebrobasilar arterial system. • In general: a) The vertebrobasilar system supplies the cerebellum, the brainstem and parts of the occipital lobes. b) The carotid system supplies the greater part of the cerebral hemispheres. The CNS C Venous Drainage of the Brain 138, 197-98 • On the whole, the veins of the brain run independant of the arteries. The diploic veins, the superficial cerebral veins and the deep cerebral veins lie in the subarachnoid space. They pierce the arachnoid and dura and drain into the intracranial venous sinuses. The venous sinuses then drain into: a) The internal jugular veins. b) The internal and external venous plexuses. c) The pterygoid and pharyngeal venous plexuses. d) The facial veins via the opthalmic veins and their connections to the supraorbital, supratrochlear and angular veins. lntracranial Venous Sinuses • These are valveless, endothelial-lined, venous channels lying between the meningeal and endosteal layers of dura. They are often associated with dural reflections but also occur in regions where there are no dural reflections. These sinuses are important because they drain all the blood of the brain. In addition, the superior sagittal also drains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). For discussion of the circulation of CSF, see Ventricular System of Brain Organisation • Anatomically these sinuses are divided into: a) Median sinuses i.e. the superior sagittal sinus, the inferior sagittal sinus, the straight sinus, the occipital sinus and the basilar plexus. b) Paired sinuses i. e. the lateral sinus (the transverse and sigmoid sinuses), the cavernous sinuses, the sp henoparietal sinuses, the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. • Functionally these sinuses are divided into: a) An anteroinferior system consisting of the cavernous sinuses, the sphenoparietal sinuses, the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses and the basilar plexus. b) A posterosuperior system consisting of the superior and inferior sagittal sinuses, the straight sinus, the l ateral sinuses and the occipital sinus. a) Superior Sagittal Sinus • It is located in the medi an cranial attachment of the falx cerebri. • In certain areas it widens laterally to form lacunae. • Arachnoid granulations project into the lacunae. • It usually terminates at the internal occipital protuberance by turning to the right and becoming the right transverse sinus. • At this point the straight sinus, the superior sagittal sinus, the two transverse sinuses and the occipital sinus communicate to form the confl uence of sinuses. 328 b) Inferior Sagittal Sinus • It is located in the median free edge of the falx cerebri. • Posteriorly it i s joined by the great cerebral vein to form the straight sinus. • It drains the falx and the medial surface of the hemisphere. c) Straight Sinus • It is located in the tentorial attachment of the falx cerebri. • It is formed by the union of the inferior sagittal sinus and the great cerebral vein. • It usually terminates by turning to the left at the internal occipital protuberance and becoming the left transverse si nus. • It drains the central and posterior parts of the cerebrum, a part of the cerebrum, the falx and the tentorium. d) Occipital Sinus • This sinus is formed just posterior to the foramen magnum by a number of venous channels. • It runs superiorly in the cranial attachment of the falx cerebelli and ends in the confluence of sinuses. • Anteriorly it communicates with the internal vertebral venous plexus via the fora men magnum. • Laterally it communicates via the marginal sinuses with the sigmoidal sinuses. e) Basilar Plexus • The basilar plexus consists of intercommunicating channels between the layers of dura mater on the clivus. • It communicates with the cavernous and inferior petrosal sinuses. • It drains to the internal vertebral venous plexus. f) Lateral Sinuses • Each lateral sinus consists of a transverse sinusSinus;transverse and a sigmoid sinusSinus;sigmoid. • The transverse sinuses are located in the occipital and parietal attachment of the tentorium cerebelli. • The right transverse sinus is usually derived from the superior sagittal sinus, and the left transverse sinus is usually derived from the straight sinus. • Each transverse sinus then runs forwards to the lateral part of the petrous temporal bone where it turns inferomedially towards the jugular foramen as the sigmoid sinus. • The sigmoi d sinus terminates by draining into the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein. The CNS g) Cavernous Sinuses • These are located on either side of the body of the sphenoid bone. • Every sinus extends from the superior orbital fissure anteriorly, to the apex of the petrous temporal bone posteriorly. • They are interconnected by means of the anterior and posterior intercavernous sinuses.

THE CRANIAL NERVES 110-129 A Overview of the Cranial Nerves a) The special somatic afferent (SSA) group comprises: 1) The Olfactory Nerce (CN I) 2) The Optic Nerve (CN II) 3) The Vestibulocochlear Nerce (CNVlll) b) The general somatic efferent (GSE) group comprises: 1) Oculomotor Nerve (CN Ill) 2) Trochlear Nerve (CN IV) 3) Abducent Nerve (CN VI) 4) Hypoglossal Nerve (CN XII) c) The pharyngeal arch group comprises: 1) Trigeminal Nerve (CN V) 2) Facial Nerve (CN VII) 3) Glossopharyngeal Nerve (CN IX) 4) Vogus Nerve (CN X) 5) Accessory Nerve (CN XI) . I d I d • There are twe ve pairs of croruo nerves numbered m ros ro-cau a or er . Cranial Name Attachment Nerve I Olfactory Directly to the cerebrum II Optic Diencephalon Ill Oculomotor Mdibrain IV Trochlear v Triqeminal Pons VI Abducent Pontomedullary Junction VII Facial VIII Vestibulocochlear IX Glossopharynqeal Medulla x Vaqus XI Accessory Spinal Cord and Medulla XII Hvpolqlossol Medulla The CNS The Modalities of the Cranial Nerves • The way inwhich nerves are described (GVA etc.) has already been discussed at the beginning of the chapter. To understand the arrangement of these modalities better, it is useful to consider the embryological development of the cranial nuclei • Functionally similar nuclei of the rhombencephalon are arranged in columns. • The modality of a cranial nerve depends on the modality of the column in the rhombencephalon from which it arises or in which it terminates. • The columns are arranged in a specific order in the rhombencephalon. • Each side of the rhombencephalon is divided by the sulcus limitans into a medial motor part and a lateral sensory part. • In turn the motor and sensory areas are subdivided from medial to lateral into the following columns: The Pharyngeal Arch group of Cranial Nerves Overview • The following nerves innervate the derivatives of the pharyngeal arches: • The first pharyngeal arch is innervated by CN V. • The second pharyngeal arch is innervated by CN VII. • The third pharyngeal arch is innervated by CN IX. • The fourth and sixth pharyngeal arches are innervated by CN X. These cranial nerves all contain SVE, GVE, GVA, SVA and GSA components • When reading this section it is important to remember that motor fibres run from the brainstem to the structure that they innervate without synapsing on a ganglion. • Sensory fibres run from the structure that they supply to a ganglion • Other fibres run from the ganglion to the brainstem where they synapse on a group of neurons called a sensory nucleus. You are fortunately not required to known where the axons of the neurons in the sensory nucleus run to. 335 CN I The Olfactory Nerve Function • It mediates the sense of smell or olfaction. (See the Limbic system for full details.) • It is a special somatic afferent nerve (SSA) Clinical • Unilateral lesions of the olfactory region of the cerebrum do not produce complete anosmia due to olfactory nerves tracts sending fibres to both olfactory areas of the cerebral cortex. • Anosmia: loss of smell often following forehead trauma, fracture of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and resultant damage to olfactory nerves. CN II The Optic Nerve Origin • Developmentally the retina and the optic nerve are outgrowths of the brain. • The axons of the ganglion cells in the ganglion layer of the retina converge on the optic disc or papilla to become the optic nerve at the lamina cribrosa of the sclera. • This is located near the posterior pole of the eye. • As the optic nerve emerges from this point, it is ensheathed by the meninges. lntracranial Course • The optic nerve enters the middle cranial fossa via the optic canal or fora men. • Here it lies superomedially to the ophthalmic artery, and superolaterally to the body of the sphenoid bone. • The optic nerve runs posteromedially to the optic chiasmaChiasma;optic. • The optic chiasma is located superior to the sella turcica, inferior to the third ventricle and medial to the internal carotid artery and anterior perforated substance on each side. • In the optic chiasma, fibres from the nasal/medial half of the retina (subserving the temporal visual fields) cross to the contralateral optic tracts. • Fibres from the temporal or lateral half of the retina (serving the nasal visual fields) remain uncrossed in the ipsilateral optic tracts. • The fibres of each optic tract then give rise to two tracts namely the retinogeniculate tract and the retinopretectal tract. a. Retino-geniculate tract The CNS • The majority of fibres of the optic tract pass to the lateral geniculate body as the retinogeniculate tract. • These fibres are responsible for vision and project from the lateral geniculate body via the optic radiations or geniculocalcarine tract to the calcerine cortex of the occipital lobe. b. Reti no-pretectal tract • A few fibres of the optic tract bypass the lateral geniculate body and run in the bracium of the superior colliculus to the pretectal nucleus. • The pretectal nucleus is a collection of neurons found at the junction of the midbrain and the diencephalon, near the superior colliculus. • The axons of each nucleus pass to Edinger-Westphal nuclei. • Those fibres which decussate to reach the nucleus of the other side do so via the posterior commissure. • These fibres form the afferent limb of the pupillary light reflexes. Function • It fulfills the function of vision and the afferent limb of the pupillary light reflexes. Clinical • Orbital tumors: because of the proximity of the optic nerve to the sphenoidal and posterior ethmoidal air sinuses, a malignant tumor in these sinuses may erode the thin bony walls and compress the optic nerve. • Lesion of the optic nerve causes complete blindness on the side of lesion. 336 CN Ill The Oculomotor Nerve Central Connections • The oculomotor nucleus complex lies anterior in the periaqueductal grey matter of the midbrain, at the level of the superior colliculus. • The complex is functionally divided into: a. An anterior somatic efferent component. b. A posterior general visceral efferent component (the Edinger-Westphal nucleus). • The axons pass anteriorly from the nuclear complex, traversing parts of the tegmentum, including the red nucleus, and the medial part of the substantia nigra. • The oculomotor nerve emerges on each side from the medial aspect of the basis pedunculi (crura cerebri, part of cerebral peduncles). lntracranial Course • Covered with pie. it passes between the superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries and runs forwards in the interpeduncular cistern, lateral to the posterior communicating artery. • It then pierces the arachnoid membrane in the interval between the free and attached borders of the tentorium cerebelli, pierces the inner dural layer lateral to the posterior clinoid process and enters the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. • Here it lies superior to CN IV. • The nerve divides into a superior and an inferior branch or ramus before leaving the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. Extracranial Course • Both rami enter the orbit via the superior orbital fissure, within the common tendinous ring. • They are separated from each other by the naso-ciliary nerve. • The small superior ramus passes superiorly to innervate the superior rectus muscle and the superficial lamina of levator palpebrae superioris. • The large inferior ramus passes anteriorly to innervate the medial rectus, the inferior rectus and the inferior oblique muscles. • The inferior ramus also gives parasympathetic (GVE) branches to the ciliary ganglion. • From the ciliary ganglion, short ciliary nerves project to supply the ciliary muscle and sphincter pupillae. Function • The nerve has two modalities: GSE and GVE. a. GSE • It innervates the superficial lamina of levator palpabrae superioris and The CNS most of the extra-ocular muscles i. e. medial, superior, infer ior recti and i n feri o r oblique muscles. b. GVE • This arises from the E di nger- Westphal nucleus and projects preganglioni c fibres to the ciliary ganglion. • The ciliary ganglion projects postganglioni c fibres (GVE or parasympathetic fibres) to the sphincter pupillae (iris contracti on) and the ciliary muscle (accommodation). Clinical Oculomotor n erve palsy: Affects most of the ocular muscles includi ng levator palpebrae s uperi osis and sphincter pupillae. The superior eyelid droops and cannot be raised voluntaril y because of unopposed orbicularis oculi tonus (CN VII). The pupil is fully dilated and unr eacti ve (unopposed dilator pupi llae). The pupil is fully abducted and depressed (down and out) because of unopposed lateral rectus and superi or obliqu e action. No lens accomadation i s another result (Ciliary muscle paralysis). CN IV The Trochlear Nerve Central Connections • The trochlear nucleus l i es anterior i n the periaqueductal grey matter of t he midbrain at the lev el of the inferi or colliculus. • The n erve passes postero- laterally between the periaqueductal gr ey matter and the mesencephali c part of CN V. • The left and r ight nerves pass into th e super ior medullary velum, where they decussate and emerge on the contralateral si de of the s uperior c erebellar peduncles. • They are the only cranial nerves to emerge on the poster ior aspect of the brai nstem. lntracranial course • It enters the subarachnoi d space passing s uperior to the superior cerebellar peduncle and encir cling the midbrain. • It pierces the dura behind the posterior clinoid process and below the free edge of tentorium cerebelli to enter the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. • In the wall it lies inferior to CN Ill and superior to CN V i. • It enters the orbi t via the superior orbital fissure, superior to the common tendinous ring and medial to the frontal nerve (branch of CN V 1 ). Extracranial course • The nerve runs medially in the orbit and innervates the superior oblique muscle from its superior surface. 337 Function • The GSE component i nnervates th e s uperior oblique mus cle. Clinical Trochlear Nerve palsy: Rare condition affects only the superior oblique m. and commonly presents as a squint or with the patient complaini ng of diplopia (double vision) on looking downwards or at the end of the nose. The CNS CN V The Trigeminal Nerve • The trigeminal nerve is the largest of the cranial nerves. It has a large sensory (GSA) component which supplies the skin of the face, the mucous membranes of the nasal cavities, the paranasal sinuses, the mouth and the anterior 2/3 of the tongue. The teeth and conjunctiva are also supplied by the sensory component. The nerve also has a small motor (SVE) component that supply the muscles of mastication, tensor tympani, tensor veli palatini, mylohyoid, and the anterior belly of digastric. Reminder: • Motor fibres run from the brainstem to the structure that they innervate without synapsing on a ganglion. • Sensory fibres run from the structure that they supply to a ganglion (in this case the trigeminol ganglion) • Other fibres run from the ganglion to the brainstem where they synapse on a group of neurons called a sensory nucleus Origin and lntracranial course The motor component of CN V • The motor component of CN V originates from the motor nucleus of CN V. • This nucleus lies in the grey matter of the SVE column i n the upper pons. • It is medial to the sensory nucleus of CN V. • This component emerges from the pons, lying medial to the sensory component. • It passes anteriorly towards the trigeminal cave. • In the trigeminal cave, it passes deep to the trigeminal ganglion to exit the skull via the foramen ovale. • Just outside the foramen ovale the motor root unites wi th the mandibular nerve. The sensory component of CN V • The trigeminal ganglion consists of unipolar neuron • The fibres which emerge from the cell bodies of these neurons divide into central and peripheral branches. • The peripheral branches form the opthalmic and maxillary nerves and the sensory component of the mandibular nerve. • The central branches form the major part of the sensory component of CN V. • A small part of the sensory component is formed by nerve fibres which do not originate in the trigeminal ganglion. • The sensory component passes posteriorly towards the pons, lying lateral to the motor component. • It enters the lateral aspect of the pons at the junction between the pons and the middle cerebellar peduncle. 338 • As the sensory fibres enter the brainstem, about half of the fibres divide into ascending and descending branches, whilst the rest ascend or descend unbranched. • These ascending and descending fibres synapse on the three components of the sensory nucleus CN V. • From superior to inferior they are: a. The mesencephalic nucleus • The fibres which do not hove their cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion synapse on thi s nucleus. • These fibres are concerned with proprioception. b. The (superior or main) sensory nucleus • This is located in the lateral part of the pons, deep to the rhomboid fossa. • The ascending fibres, which are concerned mainly with tactile stimuli, synpase on this nucleus. c. The spinal nucleus (spinal tract of the trigeminal nucleus) • This extends from the sensory nucleus superiorly to the C 1 segment of the spinal cord inferiorly. • The descending fibres, which relay mostly pain and temperature sensation, synapse on this nucleus. • From the sensory nuclear complex, most of the fibres cross the midline and ascend in the trigeminal lemniscus to the VPM of the dorsal thalamus. • From here the fibres are relayed to the post-central gyrus. • Some fibres however ascend to the ipsilateal thalamic nucleus. Peripheral branches of CN V • Three major branches arise from the trigeminal ganglion. • They are the opthalmic nerve and maxillary nerve, which are purely sensory, and the mandibular nerve, which is a mixed motor and sensory nerve. a) The Opthalmic nerve (CN V1) (see orbit for details) lntracranial course • It passes forwards in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus below CN IV. • Before exiting to the orbit, through the superior orbital fissure, it divides into its three terminal branches, the nasociliary nerve, the frontal nerve and the lacrimal nerve. • The nasociliary nerve lies within the common tendinous ring between the upper and lower divisions of CN Ill. • The frontal and lacrimal nerves lie above the common tendinous ring in The CNS the lateral part of the superior orbital fissure. Branches • (See the orbit for more details) • The branches of the nasociliary nerve are communicating branches to the ciliary ganglion, two long ciliary nerves, anterior and posterior ethmoidal nerves and the infratrochlear nerve. • The branches of the lacrimal nerve convey GVE fibres derived from CN VII to the lacrimal gland. b) Maxillary nerve (CN V2) lntracranial course • It passes in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus below CN Vi. • It exits from the middle cranial fossa via foramen rotundum to enter the pterygopalatine fossa. • It traverses the pterygopalatine fossa and reaches the infratemporal fossa via the pterygomaxillary fissure. • It exits the infratemporal fossa via the inferior orbital fissure to become its terminal branch, the infraorbital nerve, lying successively in the infraorbital groove and canal.

Function • The GSE component innervates the lateral rectus muscle. Clinical Abducent nerve injury: Loss of innervation of only the lateral rectus muscle of the eye. Damage results in inability to move the eye laterally in the horizontal plane. This symptom may be an i ndication of raised intracranial pressure due to the long intracranial course of the sixth cranial nerve. Diplopia may occur. Aneurysm of the internal carotid artery within the cavernous sinus may put pressure on the abducens. A variety of tumors at the base of the brain will tend to compress the nerve against the clivus. 341 CN VII The Facial Nerve Origin • The facial nerve consists of a motor root called the facial nerve proper, and a sensory root called the nervus intermedius. • The nervus intermediusNerves;nervus intermedius also carries some of the motor fibres of the facial nerve. • The facial nerve proper and nervus intermedius emerge from the pontomedullary junction, just lateral to the olive. lntracranial Course • CN VII proper and nervus intermedius enter the subarachnoid space and pass laterally to the internal acoustic meatus. • They traverse the internal acoustic meatus in company of CN VI II and the labyrinthine artery. • The two roots of the facial nerve unite in the meatus and the trunk enters the facial canal at the lateral end of the meatus. • The facial canal runs laterally, above the vestibule of the inner ear, to reach the medial wall of the epitympanic recess. • The canal then turns posteriorly, forming a sharp bend (the geniculum), where the geniculate ganglion is located. • The canal then runs posteriorly, deep to the medial wall of the middle ear, below the prominence raised by the lateral semicircular canal and superior to the promontory. • The canal then bends i nferiorly to reach the stylomastoid foramen. Extracranial course • As the nerve emerges from the stylomastoid foramen, it runs forwards crossing the styloid process, the retromandibular vein and the external carotid artery. • It enters the posteromedial aspect of the parotid gland and divides into upper and lower divisions, from which its terminal branches innervating the muscles of facial expression arise. • The superior division gives off the temporal and zygomatic branches. • The inferior division gives off the buccal, marginal mandibular, and cervical branches. • The temporal branches emerge from the superior border of the gland; the zygomatic, buccal and marginal mandibular from the anterior border; and the cervical branches from the i nferior border.

The cervical branch Central Connections of the Facial Nerve a) The facial nerve proper • The motor fibres of the facial nerve proper arise from the motor nucleus of the facial nerve. • This nucleus is located in the inferior part of the pons, anterolateral to the The CNS abducent nucleus, and represents the visceral efferent column (both general and special). • The fibres which arise from the motor nucleus of CN VII pass posteromedially and loop around the abducent nucleus to produce the facial colliculus in the rhomboid fossa. • These fibres emerge from the brainstem at the pontomedullary junction. b) The nervus intermedius • The nervus intermedius is the sensory component of the facial nerve, but it also carries some of the motor fibres of the facial nerve. i) The motor fibres • The motor fibres arise from the superior salivatory nucleus. • This nucleus is located in the pons posterolateral to the motor nucleus of CN VII and represents the GVE column. ii) The sensory component • Peripheral processes pass via the greater petrosal nerve and chorda tympani from the taste buds to the geniculate ganglion in the facial canal. • From there the central processes pass to the brainstem where they end in the solitary tract nucleus. • This nucleus is located in the medulla and represents the SV A column. Clinical Facial Nerve Injury: 343 Branches are superficial, therefore subject to trauma. Often damage from fracture of temporal bone. Lesion of Zygomatic Branch: paralysis including loss of tonus of orbicularis oculi, in the lower eyelid. This causes drooping and failure of tears spreading and thence dry cornea ulcerations.

The CNS E The circulation of the CSF • The CSF is a clear acellular fluid found in the ventricular s y stem and the subarachnoid s p ace. • It is produced by the choroid plexus i n the lateral, third and fourth ventricles. • It leaves the ventricular system via the three foramina of the fourth vent ricle to reach the cerebellomedullary and pontine cisterns. • It then percolates through the subarachnoid space surrounding the entire CNS. • It is reabsorbed by the arachnoid granulations found mainly in the superior sagittal venous sinus, and via the spinal veins, especially in the lumbar region. Clinical Hydrocephalus Overproduction of CSF, hindrance to flow or obstruction of absorption results in excess CSF in ventricles and enlargement of head. This raises pressure, dilates ventricles, compresses the brain, causes atrophy of adjacent tissues. In children the great pressure separates the unfused bones of the calvaria allowing the head to swell to great size 368 THORACIC VERTEBRAE Category • The thoracic vertebrae are irregular bones Position • The thoracic vertebrae and intervening intervertebral discs form the posterior bony part of the thorax.
