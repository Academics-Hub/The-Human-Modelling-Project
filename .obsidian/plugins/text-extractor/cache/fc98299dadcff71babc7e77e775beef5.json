(30) A person is breathing at a rate of 14 breaths per minute, with a tidal volume of 450ml. A capnometer is used to measure the CO2 content of their exhaled breath and it is found that, on a volumetric basis, it has a CO2 content of 4%. m3⋅ 1.1) Assuming that metabolism of glucose is representative of their overall metabolic activity, determine the rate at which they consume glucose (6) (Chemical formula of glucose: C6H12O6) 0.04 * 450ml/breath *14breath/minute = 252ml/minute NOW, assume temperature is 308K (exhaled breath emerges at body temperature) and P is 1 atm; PV = nRT 1atm * 0.252l/min = n * 0.082057 L⋅atm⋅K−1⋅mol−1 * 308K n(CO2 out)=0.01mol/min Stoichiometry: C6H12O6 +6O2  6CO2 + 6H2O Therefore, 0.01 mol/min CO2 = 0.001667 mol/min glucose = 0.3g/min (this is 18g/hour, or 432g/day, roughly in line with normal nutritional intake so this is a sensible answer, considering we started from a fairly normal respiration rate, so I don’t think there is anything that I’ve messed up in the calcs. 1.2) Determine the rate at which energy is yielded by this reaction using the following enthalpies of formation: ∆ H °f (H2O(liquid)) = -292.74kJ/mol; ∆ H °f (CO2,(gas)) = -393.5kJ/mol; ∆ H °f (glucose) = -1273.3kJ/mol; ∆ H °f (O2) = 0 (by definition) You may neglect the energy changes associated with temperature change for this calculation, as those effects are small compared to the energy of reaction. (10) Because we are given the enthalpy of formation for liquid water, what we will wind up calculating here will be the Higher Heating Value, because our output is liquid water. (Which heating value is appropriate for this calculation can be subject to some discussion.) As before, C6H12O6 +6O2  6CO2 + 6H2O; And ∆ H reaction=H products−H reactants So ΔHproducts = 6 ¿ (CO2,(gas))] + 6 [∆ H °f (H2O,(liquid))] = 6.[ -393.5kJ/mol] + 6.[ - 292.74kJ/mol] = -4117.44kJ/mol (this is per mole of glucose reacted) And ΔHreactants = ¿ (glucose,(gas))] = -1273.3kJ/mol Therefore ∆ H reaction = -4117.44kJ/mol –(-1273.3kJ/mol) = -2844.14kJ/mol (per mol of glucose reacted) (Intuitive check: this number should be negative because energy is released) Now, 0.3g/min; Molecular mass of glucose is 180g/mol so 0.3g/mol / 180g/mol = 0.001667mol/min. 0.001667mol/min * -2844.14kJ/mol = 4.74kJ/min. This is ~66.7W, which seems intuitively reasonable for resting metabolic rate. 1.3) Determine the O2 content of their exhaled breath (6) By the stoichiometry of the glucose reaction, C6H12O6 +6O2  6CO2 + 6H2O, so nO2 consumed = nCO2 produced, = 6.nGlucoseconsumed, = 0.010mol/min. Now determining O2 inhaled SEEMS difficult because we do not know the volume or temperature of the inhaled air. However, in the PV = nRT equation, V is proportional to T, so whatever factor the temperature changes by, the volume changes by the same factor, provided that n doesn’t change significantly. In other words, because n = PV/RT, the change in volume and the change in temperature cancel out. So we can calculate nO2, in using the temperature and volume of the exhaled breath and it will be the same as it would if we calculated using those values for the inhaled breath. (If you want to, assume some inlet temperature and do the calculation, assuming change in moles is minor.) Hence, we are assuming nin, total = nout, total, and we are calculating nout, total using Vout and Tout. nout=PV/RT = 1atm. 6.3/min / (0.08206L⋅atm⋅K −1⋅mol−1 . 308K) = 0.25mol/min. nin, total = 0.25mol/min; nO2, in = 0.21*nin, total = 0.0525mol/min. nO2,out = nO2, in - nO2, react= 0.0525mol/min – 0.01mol/min = 0.0425mol/min. Therefore, mol fraction of O2, out= 0.0425mol/min/0.25mol/min = 0.17. New oxygen content is 17%. There is a shortcut that can be made, which is to say that if the moles of O2 consumed is equal to the moles of CO2 produced, the percentage increase of CO2 must be equal to the percentage decrease of O2. And hence, 21% - 4% = 17%. This serves as an intuitive check on our answer. 1.4) If the patient begins to breathe more deeply, changing their tidal volume to 800ml while maintaining the same breathing rate of 14 breaths per minute, and their metabolic activity is unchanged, determine the new CO2 and O2 contents of their exhaled breath. (8) The CO2 production is the same, so the Concentrationnew = Concentrationold . Vold/Vnew = 4% . 450ml /800ml = 2.25%. With the previous shortcut, this means that the new O2 will be 21% - 2.25% = 18.75%. Alternatively, this question can be done rigorously in the same way as the previous one.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
