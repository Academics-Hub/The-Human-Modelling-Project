When eating carbohydrate rich meal - high blood glucose, high insulin (low glucagon, low acetyl-CoA), a) pyruvate is converted to acetyl-Co-enzyme A by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) b) energy generation in TCA cycle or fatty acid synthesis. c) pyruvate converted to acetyl-coA cannot be recovered for glucose synthesis. 2. pyruvate converted to lactate in anaerobic cells – RBCs, muscle… – transported to the liver - converted back to pyruvate. 3. In fasting (low blood glucose, low insulin, high glucagon), stress (high cortisol, high fatty acid catabolism leading to high acetyl-CoA) - pyruvate is converted to oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis. 4. In low blood glucose, muscle protein is broken down to amino acids. Amino groups are transferred on to pyruvate which is converted to alanine for transport to the liver for gluconeogenesis. The mitochondrion Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) Catalyses the irreversible conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA 2 NAD+ 2 NADH ETC 6 ATPs 8 ATPs + TOTAL 24 ATPs + = 38 ATPs 6C 3C 2C Mitochondria requires Vitamin B1 - thiamine pyrophosphate PDH Pyruvate dehydrogenase • Regulation – Stimulated by • insulin • ADP, • Ca2+ , – Inhibited by • Acetyl-CoA • NADH • ATP • Once glucose oxidation passes through PDH, glucose cannot be recovered. • PDH is stimulated by insulin, ADP and Ca2+. • PDH is inhibited by acetyl-CoA and NADH and ATP • PDH activity requires thiamine pyrophosphate (derived from vitamin B1) Thiamine deficiency results in decreased activity of PDH which causes beriberi Beriberi is characterised by: increased plasma [lactate] high output cardiac failure neurological symptoms Beriberi is common in: • Alcoholics: due to poor nutrition and ↓ absorption of thiamine (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome) • Populations that rely on polished rice. PDH PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Pathophysiology of carbohydrate metabolism - diabetes mellitus Diabetes = “Siphon” (excess urination) Mellitus = “Honeyed” Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus • fasting blood [glucose] above normal • abnormal glucose tolerance test Procedure: 1) Subject must fast (~8 hours). 2) Subject is given 75 g of glucose and blood glucose measured every 30 minutes for ~3 hours. In a normal person blood [glucose] returns to normal within 2 hours. Types of diabetes mellitus Type 1 diabetes mellitus • Total deficiency of insulin = “insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDM)” • Cause: inability of β-cells of pancreas to produce insulin. • Early onset • Requires insulin therapy. Type-2 diabetes mellitus • Decreased response to insulin (insulin resistance) = “non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)”. • Later onset • Associated with obesity. • Treatment involves drugs • increase GLUT4 receptor sensitivity to glucose • decrease glucose reabsorption via the GLUT2 receptors in the nephron of the kidney Metabolic profile in type 1 diabetes mellitus • ↑↑↑ blood glucose concentration – levels of greater than 21nmol/l in untreated patients. • no insulin • slightly increased [glucagon] due to lack of insulin inhibition of glucagon secretion Caused by: • • decreased uptake of glucose by all cells (due to no insulin) • • increased gluconeogenesis (due to “uninhibited” glucagon) • • increased glycogenolysis (due to “uninhibited” glucagon) I.e. insulin:glucagon ratio is very low Clinical picture in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus • glucose appears in urine (glycosuria) due to kidney tubular maximum limit that prevents reabsorption of glucose in the tubules • glucose in urine pulls water with it (osmotic diuresis and polyuria) • although glucose being excreted in urine, more glucose being made in the body – • patient develops hypertonic dehydration with thirst (polydipsia) • cells are deprived of glucose leading to decreased storage (glycogen and fat → weight loss) • decreased glycolysis, which results in decreased ATP production (tiredness). • N.B. insulin also regulates metabolism of lipids and proteins. 5. Regulation of glucose metabolism – the ‘metabolic see-saw’ ii) ↓insulin ↑ glucagon adrenaline cortisol ↓glycolysis ↓glycogen synthesis ↓glucose uptake into cells ↑ glycogenolysis ↑ gluconeogenesis ↑ glucose release into blood Net effect = an increasing blood glucose concentration i) ↑insulin ↓ glucagon adrenaline cortisol↓ glycogenolysis ↓ gluconeogenesis ↓ glucose release into blood ↑glycolysis ↑glycogen synthesis ↑ glucose uptake into cells Net effect = a decreasing blood glucose concentration The most important factor is: insulin: glucagon ratio Conclusion Regulation of glucose metabolism & pathophysiology Normal condition • When blood glucose concentration is above the middle of the normal range, it stimulates secretion of insulin, which stimulates uptake of glucose into cells and glucose use (glycolysis and glycogenesis). • Higher blood glucose concentration inhibits secretion of glucagon, adrenaline and cortisol, resulting in less glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and less release of glucose into the blood. • The aim of glucose homeostasis is to maintain the blood glucose concentration in the middle of the normal concentration range. When blood glucose concentration is lower, less insulin is secreted, resulting in less uptake of glucose into cells and less glucose use (glycolysis and glycogenesis). • Lower blood glucose concentration stimulates secretion of glucagon, adrenaline and cortisol, which together increase glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, which release glucose into the blood. Conclusion Regulation of glucose metabolism & pathophysiology Diabetes Type 1 pathophysiology • Patients with type I diabetes mellitus cannot produce insulin • severely decreased uptake of glucose from the blood and use of glucose, • decreased inhibition of glucagon increases glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis and secretion of glucose into the blood. • increased blood glucose results in increased urinary glucose, which draws water into the urine, causing hypertonic dehydration. Diabetes Type 1I pathophysiology • Patients with type II diabetes mellitus produce insulin, but their cells have decreased ability to respond to it, • decreased uptake of glucose from the blood • decreased inhibition of glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis and glucose secretion. • increased blood glucose results in increased urinary glucose, polyuria and hypertonic dehydration, but fat metabolism is less affected than in type I.
