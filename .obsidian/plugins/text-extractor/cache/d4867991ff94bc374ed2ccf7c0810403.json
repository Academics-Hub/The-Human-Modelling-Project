Mastication is an essential part of human digestionb. Energetic costs of mastication are not well understoodc. Evolutionary significance of mastication in humans remains uncleard. Purpose of the study is to examine energetics and evolutionary implications of mastication in humansMethods:a. Experimental setup involved measuring energy expenditure during chewingb. Participants were given different types of food with varying levels of hardnessc. Energy expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetryd. Data analysis focused on comparing the energetic costs of mastication for different foods and individualsResults:a. Energetic cost of chewing is affected by food hardnessb. Chewing soft food requires less energy than hard foodc. Individual differences in masticatory performance affect energetic costsd. Mastication accounts for 2-12% of total daily energy expenditureDiscussion:a. Energetic costs of mastication are influenced by both food properties and individual factorsb. Evolutionary implications suggest that humans have evolved to process a wide range of foods, including hard onesc. Mastication may play a role in human social interactions and cultural practicesKey Takeaways:BacklinksMedical papersThe cost of chewing- The energetics and evolutionary significance of mastication in humansAbstractAny change in the energetic cost of mammalian mastication will affect the net energy gain from foods. Although the energeticefficiency of masticatory effort is fundamental in understanding the evolution of the human masticatory system, nothing is knowncurrently about the associated metabolic costs of chewing different items. Here, using respirometry and electromyography of themasseter muscle, we demonstrate that chewing by human subjects represents a measurable energy sink. Chewing a tastelessodorless gum elevates metabolic rate by 10 to 15% above basal levels. Energy expenditure increases with gum stiffness and is paidfor by greater muscle recruitment. For modern humans, it is likely that mastication represents a small part of the daily energy budget.However, for our ancestors, before the onset of cooking and sophisticated food processing methods, the costs must have beenrelatively high, adding a previously unexplored energetic dimension to the interpretation of hominin dentofacial fossils.1.
