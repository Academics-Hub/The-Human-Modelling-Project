NOTE: • Left testicular/ovarian vein drains into the left renal vein • Left adrenal vein drains into left renal vein • No tributaries from spleen, pancreas, gallbladder drain into portal system VENOUS DRAINAGE Portal hepatic vein: Portal system – Form GIT – Formed by union of splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein – Posterior to head of pancreas on L2 – Tributaries: • Inferior mesenteric vein • Gastric veins • Cystic veins VENOUS DRAINAGE Portal system Caval system • Hepatic portal vein • IVC • Drains nutrient rich deoxygenated blood • Drains nutrient poor deoxygenated blood • From GIT • From limbs, abdominal wall and paired structures • Into IVC via hepatic veins inside liver • Directly into the right atrium VENOUS DRAINAGE 23 ▪ Diameter > 3cm ▪ Different types ▪ Back pain, pulsations in abdomen ▪ Associated with thoracic aorta and popliteal aneurysms ▪ Risk factors: Male, smoking, high blood pressure, family history https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/cms/attachment/554f56f2-225b-4836-a4e1-0ca1298d4a13/gr1_lrg.jpg","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
