In daily life, food intake is the most important factor influencing the occurrence of hyperglycemia. However,the large variability in PPGR dynamics to different types of food is inadequately predicted by existing glycemic measures. Theobjective of this study was therefore to quantitatively describe PPGR dynamics using a systems approach.MethodsPostprandial glucose and insulin data were collected from literature for many different food products and mixed meals. The predictivevalue of existing measures, such as the Glycemic Index, was evaluated. A physiology-based dynamic model was used to reconstructthe full postprandial response profiles of both glucose and insulin simultaneously.ResultsWe collected a large range of postprandial glucose and insulin dynamics for 53 common food products and mixed meals. Currentlyavailable glycemic measures were found to be inadequate to describe the heterogeneity in postprandial dynamics. By estimatingmodel parameters from glucose and insulin data, the physiology-based dynamic model accurately describes the measured datawhilst adhering to physiological constraints.ConclusionsThe physiology-based dynamic model provides a systematic framework to analyze postprandial glucose and insulin profiles. Bychanging parameter values the model can be adjusted to simulate impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance.a. Model-based analysis of postprandial glycemic response dynamics is a valuable tool for understanding the impact of different types offood on blood glucose levels.b. Personalized dietary recommendations can be developed based on this information, which may improve public health outcomes.c. Further research should focus on validating the model with larger datasets and exploring additional factors that influence postprandialglycemia.Key Takeaways:1. Model-based analysis of postprandial glycemic response dynamics can help understand the impact of different types of food on bloodglucose levels.2. Carbohydrate-rich foods have a higher impact on blood glucose levels than protein or fat-rich foods.3. Personalized dietary recommendations based on individual differences in glycemic response may improve public health outcomes.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
