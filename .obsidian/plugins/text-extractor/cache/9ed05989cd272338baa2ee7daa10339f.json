GLANDULAR EPITHELIUM Definition Epithelial cells specialized for the function of secretion Molecules stored in secretory granules Function Cells may synthesize, store and secrete proteins (pancreas), lipids (adrenal and sebaceous gland) and carbohydrates and protein complexes (salivary gland) Classification According to the morphology According to the mode of secretion According to the nature of secretion GLANDULAR FORMATION Endocrine glands Secretions are released into adjacent blood vessel Exocrine glands Secretions are secreted unto a surface or into ducts that are connected to a surface. Paracrine Secretions reach adjacent target cells by diffusion Autocrine Secretions are targeted for receptors on the same cell that produce the secretions TYPES OF GLANDULAR EPITHELIUM Unicellular gland Multicellular glands Single secretory cell, scattered in the midst of non secretory lining epithelia cells. Consists of more than one cell, classified by structure of the gland. TYPES OF EXOCRINE GLANDS https://www.memorangapp.com/flashcards/98273/Lecture+1+Exocrine+Glands/ General structure of exocrine glands Stroma= capsule and septa divide gland into lobes and lobules Parenchyma= cells that secrete Acinus= cluster of secretory cells surrounding a duct that drains the acinus cells Classification of exocrine glands Shape of secretory portion Structure of ducts Simple (not branched) Compound (2 or more branches) Tubular Acinar/alveolar Specialized Branched Coiled SIMPLE GLANDS (Unbranched ducts) Simple tubular glands What substances are secreted and what is its function at its location? Simple coiled tubular glands SkinWhat substances are secreted and what is its function at its location? Simple branched tubular glands Duct What substances are secreted and what is its function at its location? Simple branched alveolar glands What substances are secreted and what is its function at its location? Simple acinar/alveolar Example; mucus glands along urethra. Not common in adult humans. Simple tubular Example; glands of colon Simple coiled tubular Example; eccrine sweat glands Simple branched tubular Example; stomach and uterus glands Simple branched acinar Example; sebaceous glands SIMPLE GLANDS COMPOUND GLANDS (Branched ducts) Compound tubular glands Duodenal Brunner's gland What substances are secreted and what is its function at its location? Compound alveolar glands Pancreas What substances are secreted and what is its function at its location? T T T A A A A D D D Compound tubuloalveolar glands A-alveolar, T- tubular, D-duct What substances are secreted and what is its function at its location? Salivary glands Compound tubular Example; Brunner’s gland (duodenum Compound acinar (alveoli) Example; Exocrine pancreas Compound tubular alveoli Example; Salivary glands COMPOUND GLANDS Mode of secretion Merocrine Secretory products are delivered in membrane bound vesicles to apical surface of cells and by exocytosis released fro the cell. Example ; pancreas, sweat glands Holocrine Secretory products accumulate within maturing cells which undergoes cell death. Leading to release of cell debris and secretory products into lumen of gland Example ; sebaceous glands thin skin Apocrine Secretory product accumulates in the apical portion and are released with a thin layer of cytoplasm. Example; mammary glands, armpit and groin area How secretions are released from the gland Apocrine glands Nature of secretion Mucous Viscous and slimy, mucinogen stain palely may appear empty Example ; goblet cells, salivary glands, surface cells of stomach Serous Watery protein secretions, cytoplasm stain intensely basophilic Example ; digestive enzymes by pancreas Lipid Waxy lipid secretion. Example; sebum secreted by sebaceous glands The type of secretions released Serous • Darkly stained. Top eoisinophilic, base basophilic • Contains zymogen granules • Round nuclei towards the base Mucous • Lightly stained, appears empty • Filled with mucoid material. • Flattened nuclei towards the base Lipid • Cluster of lightly stained cells • Some cells may appear hollow and vacoulized. • Centrally placed nuclei Histology of different secretory cells Straited ducts Classification and identification of glandular epithelia Tissue Classification Identification Simple coiled tubular gland Eccrine sweat gland Simple branched alveolar gland Sebaceous gland Compound alveoli gland Exocrine pancreas Describe by classifying the structure. What is this? Identify by giving the particular name of the structure. Who is this? Revise criteria for classifying covering epithelium NUMBER OF LAYERS • Simple • One layer of cells resting on the basement membranes • Stratified • Two or more layers of cells SHAPE OF CELL FOUND IN SURFACE LAYER • Columnar • Elongated cells with basally placed oval nuclei • Cuboidal • Square shaped cell with centrally placed round nuclei • Squamous • Flattened cell with cigar shaped nuclei SPECIALIZATION • Apical pole • Microvilli brush border • Cilia • Keratinization • Keratinized • Non-keratinized Criteria for classifying glandular epithelium STRUCTURE OF DUCT • Simple • Compound (Branched) SHAPE OF SECRETORY PORTION • Tubular • Alveolar • Branched • Coiled Review some glandular epithelium Gland Classification Identification Mode of secretion Nature of secretion Location s Simple branched alveolar Sebaceous gland Holocrine Lipid Thin skin PRACTICAL QUESTIONS 1 Why are intestinal glands classified as \"simple” glands and why “tubular” glands? 2 Where is the lamina propria (connective tissue) in relation to the intestinal glands? 3 Only one cell type occurs in the simple columnar epithelium found in the uterus. What is the function of these epithelial cells? 4 In the eccrine sweat glands, Classify the epithelium which lines the duct. Classify the epithelium which lines the secretory end piece. Classify the sweat gland. What is the chemical nature of sweat and what is its function? 5 Classify the sebaceous gland. What is the nature of secretion of this gland and the function of the secreted product called sebum? What is the mode of secretion of the sebaceous gland? 6 Define a compound gland. Identify three types of compound glands and discuss the morphological differences between them? 7 What are the distinguishing features of the serous and mucous secretory end-pieces? What is the function of the serous and mucous secretion in the submandibular gland (relate the structure/staining reaction with the function of the gland)? PRACTICAL SPOT QUESTION a) Identify the encircled structure. b) Classify the encircled structure. c) Name the secretions released by the encircled structure d) Identify the organ shown in this photomicrograph. RECAP Classify the gland. Relate the nature of secretion to the function and location References • Anthony L.
