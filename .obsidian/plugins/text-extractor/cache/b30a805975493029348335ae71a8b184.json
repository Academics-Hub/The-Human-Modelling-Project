The growth and development of bone INTRAMEMBRANOUS OSSIFICATION • Slide 110 Foetal skull (late) Note: – Vascular mesenchyme – Osteoblasts secreting osteoid – Osteoblasts trapped in mineralising osteoid. They will thereafter be known as osteocytes – Once the osteoid is fully mineralised it is known as bone – Mixed spicules containing both osteoid and bone Foetal Skull (early) Slide 109 Spicules of osteoid and bone Mesenchyme Foetal Skull (early) Developing epidermis Capillary Osteocyte in lacuna Developing hair follicle Bone Spicule of developing bone Foetal Skull (early) Arteriole Mesenchyme Osteocytes in lacunae Venule Bone Osteoid Osteoblasts Note: – The pale eosinophilical osteoid – The more basophilic mineralised osteoid = bone INTRAMEMBRANOUS OSSIFICATION • Slide 109 Foetal skull (early) • Slide 110 Foetal skull (late) Note: – The further development of the mesenchyme and the epidermis – Osteoblasts secreting osteoid – Osteocytes trapped in lacunae within the mineralised osteoid – The coalescing of mixed spicules of osteoid and bone – The development of marrow cavities Foetal Skull (late) Slide 110 Spicules of developing bone coalescing Hair follicle Endosteal cells Osteoid Developing marrow cavity Foetal Skull (late) Osteocytes in lacunae Osteoblasts Bone ENDOCHONDRAL OSSIFICATION Note: – Requires a hyaline cartilage model upon which osteoid is laid down and mineralised • The hyaline cartilage model develops via chondrogenesis ENDOCHONDRAL OSSIFICATION • Slide 52 Foetal knee Note: – The developing femur, patella and tibia. – The developing synovial cavity – The surrounding tissues Endochondral Ossification Developing femur Developing tibia Developing patella Developing synovium Developing articular cartilage Endochondral Ossification Developing femur Developing patella Secondary ossification centre Endochondral Ossification Developing femur Secondary ossification centre Hyaline cartilage Zonation associated with endochondral ossification Endochondral Ossification Zone of cell rest Zone of hypertrophy Zone of cell proliferation Zone of calcified cartilage Zone of resorption Osteoid Endochondral Ossification Hypertrophied chondrocytes Calcified cartilage Haematopoeitic cells Osteoblasts Calcified cartilage Endochondral Ossification Osteoblasts Osteoid Osteoclasts Use your gross anatomy knowledge to identify developing: a) Muscle groups and muscles b) Ligaments c) Bones","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
