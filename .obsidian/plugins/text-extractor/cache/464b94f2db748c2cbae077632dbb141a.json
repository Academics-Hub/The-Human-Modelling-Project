List down and explain as many reasons as possible why low power factor is undesirable? 2. Why is leading power factor undesirable? PF Correction Concept 𝑉 𝐼𝑅 𝐼𝐿 𝐼 𝜃 PF improvement entails placing a suitable reactance parallel with the load such that the additional reactance cancels/reduces that in the load.
