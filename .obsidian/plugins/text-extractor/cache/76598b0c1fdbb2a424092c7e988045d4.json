ascends obliquely anterosuperiorly, medial to temporalis muscle Masseteric artery Traverses mandibular notch, supplying temporomandibular joint and masseter muscle Deep temporal arteries Anterior and posterior arteries ascend between temporalis muscle and bone of the temporal fossa, supplying mainly muscle Pterygoid branches Irregular in number and origin; supply pterygoid muscles Buccal artery Runs anteroinferiorly with the buccal nerve to supply the buccal fat pad, buccinator and buccal oral mucosa Maxillary Artery Part Course Branches Distribution Third (pterygopalatine) Distal/anteromedial to the lateral pterygoid muscle, passes between heads of lateral pterygoid and through pterygomaxillary fissure into the pterygopalatine fossa Posterior superior alveolar artery Descends on maxilla’s infratemporal surface with branches traversing alveolar canals to supply maxillary molar and premolar teeth, adjacent gingiva and mucous membrane of maxillary sinus Infra-orbital artery Traverses inferior orbital fissure, infra- orbital groove, canal and foramen, supplies inferior oblique and rectus muscles, lacrimal sac, maxillary canines and incisor teeth, mucous membrane of maxillary sinus and skin of infra-orbital region of the face Artery of pterygoid canal Passes posteriorly through pterygoid canal, supplies mucosa of upper pharynx, pharyngotympanic tube and tympanic cavity Pharyngeal branch Passes through palatovaginal canal to supply mucosa of nasal roof, nasopharynx, sphenoidal air sinus and pharyngotympanic tube Maxillary Artery Part Course Branches Distribution Third (pterygopalatine) Distal/anteromedial to the lateral pterygoid muscle, passes between heads of lateral pterygoid and through pterygomaxillary fissure into the pterygopalatine fossa Descending palatine artery Descends through the palatine canal, dividing into greater and lesser palatine arteries to mucosa and glands of hard and soft palate Sphenopalatine artery Terminal branch of maxillary artery, traverses sphenopalatine foramen to supply walls and septum of nasal cavity; frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoid and maxillary sinuses and anterior part of palate Pterygoid Venous Plexus • Located partly between the temporalis and the pterygoid muscles • It is considered to be the venous equivalent of the maxillary artery i.e. most of the veins that accompany the branches of the maxillary artery drain into this venous plexus • It anastomoses anteriorly with the facial vein via the deep facial vein and superiorly with the cavernous sinus via emissary veins Mandibular Division CNV3 Mandibular Division CNV3 • Arises from the trigeminal ganglion in the middle cranial fossa • It immediately receives the motor root of the trigeminal nerve and descends through the foramen ovale into the infratemporal fossa • Branches include: • Auriculotemporal nerve • Inferior alveolar nerve • Lingual nerve • Buccal nerve Auriculotemporal Nerve • Encircles the middle meningeal artery and divides into numerous branches • The largest branch passes posteriorly, medial to the neck of the mandible and supplies sensory fibers to the auricle and temporal regions • The auriculotemporal nerve also sends articular (sensory) fibers to the TMJ • It conveys postsynaptic secretomotor fibers from the otic ganglion to the parotid gland Inferior Alveolar Nerve • Enters the mandibular foramen and passes through the mandibular canal, forming the inferior dental plexus, which sends branches to all mandibular teeth on the associated side • The mental nerve passes through the mental foramen and supplies the skin and mucous membrane of the lower lip, skin of the chin and the vestibular gingiva of the mandibular incisor teeth Mandibular Division CNV3Lingual Nerve • Lies anterior to the inferior alveolar nerve • It is sensory to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue, the floor of the mouth and the lingual gingivae • It enters the mouth between the medial pterygoid muscle and the ramus of the mandible and passes under cover of the oral mucosa, just inferior to the 3rd molar tooth • The chorda tympani nerve (CNVII branch) carrying taste fibers from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue, joins the lingual nerve in the infratemporal fossa Otic Ganglion • Parasympathetic • Located in the infratemporal fossa, just inferior to the foramen ovale, medial to the mandibular nerve and posterior to the medial pterygoid muscle • Presynaptic parasympathetic fibers derived from mainly the glossopharyngeal nerve synapse in the otic ganglion • Postsynaptic parasympathetic fibers, which are secretory to the parotid gland, pass from the otic ganglion to this gland through the auriculotemporal nerve Pterygopalatine Fossa Pterygopalatine Fossa • Small pyramidal space inferior to the apex of the orbit and medial to the infratemporal fossa • It lies between the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone posteriorly and the rounded posterior aspect of the maxilla anteriorly • The fragile perpendicular plate of the palatine bone forms its medial wall • The incomplete roof of the fossa is formed by a medial continuation of the infratemporal surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone • The floor of the fossa is formed by the pyramidal process of the palatine bone Pterygopalatine FossaPterygopalatine FossaPterygopalatine Fossa Maxillary Nerve CNV2 • Runs anteriorly through the foramen rotundum to enter the pterygopalatine fossa • Gives off the zygomatic nerve which branches off into the zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal nerves, which supply general sensation to the lateral region of the cheek and temple • Gives off the two ganglionic branches to the pterygopalatine ganglion, which suspend the parasympathetic pterygopalatine ganglion in the superior part of the fossa • The pterygopalatine nerves convey general sensory fibers of the maxillary nerve, which pass through the ganglion without synapsing to supply the nose, palate and pharynx • The maxillary nerve exits the fossa through the infra- orbital fissure, after which it is known as the infra-orbital nerve Pterygopalatine Fossa CLINICAL ANATOMY • Inferior alveolar nerve block • An inferior alveolar nerve block anesthetizes the inferior alveolar nerve. • The site of the anaesthetic injection is around the mandibular foramen, the opening into the mandibular canal on the medial aspect of the ramus of the mandible. This canal gives passage to the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle. • When this nerve block is successful, all mandibular teeth are anesthetized to the median plane. The skin, mucous membrane of the lower lip, the labial alveolar mucosa and gingivae and the skin of the chin are also anesthetized because of their innervation provided by the mental nerve. • There are possible problems associated with an inferior alveolar nerve block, such as injection of the anaesthetic in the parotid gland or the medial pterygoid arch, thus affecting the movement of the mandible 1. Identify the highlighted structure 2. Which vessels are associated with each division of the highlighted structure 3. In which area/s of the head and neck region will you find the various part of the highlighted structure 4. If your patient sustains a fracture to the condyle of the mandible, could this structure be at risk? Explain?","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
