For communication, please do not send me an email if you need clarification on any of the slides. Let us communicate via the discussion function on Ulwazi so that everyone who wants to read the answers can do so. The link for the chat function is https://ulwazi.wits.ac.za/courses/27146/discussion_topics/243049?module_item_id= 282929 “Enzymes” is the first topic of the biochemistry section. The biochemistry section, generally, is about explaining the role of the nutrients that we eat. That is, what is the nutrient, what does the nutrient do at a biological level, how does the nutrient contribute to what the body is and in a lot of cases, how does the nutrient provide energy. Thus we will study how nutrition is the relationship of food substances (nutrients) to living bodies. Carbohydrates, proteins and lipids are macronutrients that are required in large amounts. These nutrients need to be metabolized, and the reactions that are responsible for the metabolism of nutrients are catalyzed by a specialized class of proteins called enzymes. If you see questions on these notes, these are not for marks. These questions are here to help you think about and engage with the content, and sometimes give a different perspective depending on whether you are a bachelor of health sciences, medical or engineering student. This textbook contains the more easily accessible summarised content that we are explaining. There are several copies available in the library and at the medical school Van Schaik bookshop. 2 In our study of enzymology, we will first of all learn how these enzyme proteins are made in cells. There is a bit of overlap with the Proteins section, and so do not think of these two components separately. As you will have noticed from your past paper question booklet, the questions have integrated topics; and so one of the key measures of gauging how much you have understood is by applying the knowledge learnt to the functioning of the entire human body. Once we have understood how proteins are made, we will tackle the mechanisms by which enzymes work. Enzymes speed up chemical reactions and this is absolutely important for humans in maintaining homeostasis. Without sufficient energy provided during metabolism, we would cease to exist because the chemical reactions are too slow to support life. Haphazard chemical reactions occurring in cells would also be harmful to humans and so we will briefly learn about how hormones regulate enzymatic activity. At the end of the year you will cover a lot more of the detail in “Endocrinology” and so do not forget the concepts that you learn here. One of the key competencies is the ability diagnose diseases when you are working in your professional lives. As such, the significance of laboratory enzyme concentrations will be explained. Isoenzymes become important as different tissues release different versions of the enzyme, and so measuring the concentration (activity)ofthe enzyme helps predict what is happening in the patient. This, by the way, is also one of the reasons for examining students using problem solving exercises (PSEs), so that you get used to interrogating laboratory data. 3 If you look at your objectives, they state that you have to understand what the enzymatic markers of liver (hepatitis), cardiac (heart) and skeletal muscle damage are. You will learn about the cardiovascular system in block 3, liver and exercise in over block 4. Again, the concepts you learn here will be important for those topics. Remember that for tests 2, 3 and 4 there are revision multiple choice questions (MCQs) from the previous blocks and the applied and practical questions (APQs) are integrated between the different topics that you have covered. 4 An example of a section through a healthy liver is shown in the bottom of the picture above. You will see that there is a nice healthy colour and the liver has a regular size. In contrast, in a patient (top half above) with severe hepatitis (hep = liver, itis = inflammation), there is hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver) and necrosis (cell death). We will explore the enzymes that are released when hepatocytes (liver cells) are damaged. 5 In patients who ingest too much cholesterol, atherosclerotic plaques build up inside the capillaries and block blood flow. Cardiomyocytes (cardiac muscle cells) require oxygen and nutrients, meaning that blockage of the capillaries results in failure to deliver adequate oxygen and nutrients to the cells. Cardiac tissue necrosis occurs, and the enzymes that were present inside the cardiomyocytes are released into the blood. 6 This slide is not too informative from a diagnostic point of view as sections of skeletal muscle are not routinely taken from patients. However, from a pathological perspective, the top slide shows a representative field of skeletal muscle that has the requisite mass and cell component. Panel B is a tissue section taken from a patient with skeletal muscle cell lysis. As such, the muscle component is reduced, with more open areas visible on the slide. 7 We will quickly recap some concepts that you may have forgotten, but you have already covered them in first year chemistry, thereby you should understand them. Very briefly, over the next series of lectures you will be learning about the reactions that are occurring inside cells. These reactions will be broadly classed under the heading of the nutrients. For example carbohydrates, proteins and lipids will be some of the topics that you will learn about. All of these topics have one thing in common, which is that all the chemical reactions in those topics are catalysed by enzymes. This means that enzymes will be the first topic that you will learn due to the commonality across the biochemistry and physiology section. Question: Based on what you will learn in Blood, which enzyme is increased in the plasma when erythrocytes are damaged? Question: Based on what you will learn in the Autonomic Nervous System, which enzyme catalyses the degradation of acetylcholine? 8 The image above shows a diagram of a typical cell. You should brush up on the function of the organelles as the localisation of an enzyme inside an organelle gives a clue about the enzyme’s function. For example, a mitochondrial enzyme is most likely to be involved in energy production, not protein synthesis as would a ribosomal enzyme. 9 Generally speaking, enzymes are intracellular as that is where you expect them to be because they are inside cells catalysing biochemical reactions. However, there are some noticeable exceptions. Digestive enzymes are found in the lumen (and are thus extracellular) of the gastrointestinal tract. These enzymes are required for the digestion (breakdown) of macromolecules so that the resultant monomers are absorbed into the bloodstream. At the end of this series of lectures, we will learn about the measurement of plasma enzyme activity (concentration), and see how this is used to predict the nature of the tissue that is being damaged. 10 This slide shows the objectives of lecture 1 of Proteins, which you will learning about at the towards the end of block 1. Do note that most enzymes in the body are proteins, and so we will cover protein synthesis in a bit more detail in Proteins. For now we will briefly explain how proteins are derived from amino acids, and how these amino acids are assembled to produce a 3-dimensional protein conformation (shape). 1112 Amino acids or peptides are the monomers (mono = one), which are used to make the polypeptides (poly = many). If we write down the sequence (order) of the amino acids in the polypeptide, we end up with a primary structure as shown for Met-Asp-Leu-Tyr as shown above. These polypeptides eventually fold into a 3-dimensional shape, which is called a protein’s tertiary structure. In enzymology we are interested in an enzyme’s tertiary structure because the enzyme’s function depends on the shape the enzyme folds into. In contrast, when you are learning about the gastrointestinal tract, you will be learning about protein digestion, whereby a protein’s 3-dimensional structure is denatured (destroyed) so that absorption of the amino acids can occur into the bloodstream. 13 Broadly speaking, there are two different types of amino acids: hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids. Hydro is the name for water, phil means love and phobia is a dislike of. Thus, hydrophilic amino acids dissolve in water, whereas hydrophobic amino acids do not. As such, the hydrophobic amino acids tend to cluster amongst themselves as shown in green above, whereas the hydrophilic amino acids form hydrogen bonds with water and thus dissolve in physiological fluids. In the diagram above, polar means that the molecule is charged and so can form hydrogen bonds with water. Therefore the enzyme conformation depends on the spatial arrangement of the constituent amino acids. 14 As a result of the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the enzyme’s amino acids, the enzyme conformation is generally globular (roughly round in shape). The enzymes shown above are lysozyme, catalase, deoxyribonuclease, chymotrypsin, aspartate transcarbamoylase and alcohol dehydrogenase. This diagram is not to be learnt, as it is for illustration only. 15 For now do not worry about this diagram. It will be important when we cover proteins. For enzymes it will suffice to know that amino acids interact together via ionic/electrostatic forces, or van der Waals interactions when they form the enzyme tertiary structure. Disulphide (S-S) bonds are also important for linking some polypeptide chains in some multi-subunit (allosteric) enzymes. For now, this slide is not too important, but will be when we cover proteins as you must be able to differentiate between a protein’s primary (A), secondary (B), tertiary (C) or quaternary (D) structure. For block 1, an enzyme has a 3-dimensional conformation as shown in (C) above. Some enzymes are made up of more than one subunit as shown in (D), and we shall see this phenomenon when we cover isoenzymes. As a revision question from Biology, how does the haemoglobin quaternary structure enable the cooperative binding of oxygen in erythrocytes? 16 Enzymes have a conformation that enables them to tightly bind to molecules that match the enzyme binding site. This occurs because enzymes have a groove in their structure that recognises their substrate. The name of the groove is called an active site. Active sites are so specific such that one enzyme only recognises one substrate molecule. This is a desirable feature because we wouldn’t want enzymes to bind a wide range of molecules as we would lose the metabolic control we are trying to achieve. Pharmaceutical companies take advantage of this fact when they design drugs to inhibit an enzyme active site, such that there aren’t many side effects as only the enzyme of interest is inhibited by a particular drug. Question: By the end of this series of lectures, and based on what you will learn about during the autonomic nervous system on the inhibition of acetylcholinestase, what form of enzyme inhibition is this? When you do Temperature regulation in block 3, you will learn about the inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase in the production of prostaglandins. Cyclooxygenase is an enzyme, and so you should now realise that these concepts will keep popping up over the course of the year. Back to enzymes, it should be noted that the recognition of a substrate by an enzyme is highly specific in that only one substrate molecule is bound by an enzyme (we shall see a few exceptions for isozymes). However, the strength of the binding between the active site and substrate may be strong (have a high affinity) or weak (have a low affinity). 17 Once a substrate binds to an active site, the substrate is quickly converted into a product. The role of enzymes in the body is to speed up the conversion of the reactants (substrates) into products. All metabolic reactions in the body are catalysed by enzymes. Eating food enables the nutrients to be digested (broken down), absorbed and used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or energy. This energy is then used to maintain homeostasis or grow body tissues. 18 Do not memorise this table. You must be able to explain the principle of enzyme nomenclature, and understand how enzymes can change the chemical structure of their substrates. 19 This slide will not make any sense now, but by the time we cover Micronutrients you will have seen the biochemical reactions that all of these enzymes carry out. Thus when you are studying for test 2, and if you do not know what these enzymes are doing, you will NOT have learnt a sufficient amount of biochemistry over the course of the year. 20 If we try to visualise a simple reaction whereby two different reactants, A and B can form a product C, the reaction requires energy input so that product C is formed. There more energy put into the system, the faster the reaction rate as it is easier for the reactants to overcome the energy barrier of the reaction. Question: What are the mechanisms that can be used in a test-tube situation to increase the speed of a chemical reaction? The human body is generally maintained at 37 degrees Celsius, and exposed to 1 atm of atmospheric pressure. Thus high temperatures or high pressures cannot be used to accelerate chemical reactions. Enzymes are thus biological catalysts that speed up biochemical reactions in the body (or a test tube if they are extracted). Enzymes accelerate chemical reactions by constraining the reactants in the active site, and forcing reactants A and B to form product C. 21 We can visualise enzyme catalysis as the “hill” shown in the figure above. In this case, a reactant Y needs an energy input (b→a) so that product X is formed. High heat and high pressures can be used to enable molecule Y to undergo the change into product X. The energy input (b→a) is also called the reaction activation energy, which is required to convert Y to X. In the body, enzymes lower the activation energy by reducing the reaction activation energy requirement to (b→d). As a result of the enzyme lowering the activation energy, many more Y molecules have enough energy to form product X. The reaction rate is thus greatly enhanced. 22 This slide is effectively putting into words, what we saw in the previous slide. Briefly, at physiological temperatures, very few reactants have sufficient energy to form a product. When the shape of a reactant exactly matches the shape of an active site (high specificity), the enzyme binds with great specificity to the reactants and constrains the reactants within the active site. Due to the reactants being confined to the active site, an alternative reaction pathway is provided that has a lower activation energy than the uncatalysed reaction. More reactant molecules are then able to form a product molecules. The product then diffuses away from the active site because the product has a different shape from the reactants and so binds poorly to the enzyme active site (low specificity and low affinity). For reversible reactions the low specificity and low affinity is not correct, but ignore this for now. However, what is always true is that after a chemical reaction the enzyme is not changed, and has the same structure as the enzyme had before the chemical reaction. Enzymes are not modified at the end of a reaction that they catalyse, but it is the cofactors or the coenzymes that are chemically changed. 23 For a chemical reaction to take place, the reactants must have enough energy to overcome the energy barrierthat is required to force the reactants into forming products. The was some people visualise this is like walking uphill (reactants gaining energy), and when one reaches the top of the mountain peak (energy barrier), one can then walk downhill (product formation).. In the diagram above, the energy barrier is represented by the brown line. The X-axis shows the kinetic energy of the molecules, whilst the Y-axis shows the number of molecules with a particular amount of energy. When the molecules are sluggish andslow, they do not have much kinetic energy (panel A). In this case the molecules have insufficient energy to form products. Thus all the molecules remain as reactants. In panel B the molecules have gained sufficient energy from heat or an increase in pressure such that some molecules have enough energy to form reactants. When the heat or pressure is increased to such an extent that all molecules have enough energy to overcome the energy barrier (panel C), then all he reactants are converted to products. To give away the whole point of the enzymes series of lectures, enzymes are biological catalysts that provide an alternative reactant pathway that requires lower energy to form products. Do remember that enzymes found in humans work best at 37 degrees Celsius, and so now you will hopefully start realising why enzymes are important biological catalysts at the low body temperature of 37OC. 24 In summary, enzymes accelerate reactions but do not alter the equilibrium of a chemical reaction. Enzymes cannot force reactions that are not thermodynamically impossible to occur. The specificity of enzymes enables them to only bind one substrate. However, we will see when we do nucleotides that there are come purines that are sufficiently similar such that the enzyme cannot differentiate between the purine molecules. In this case, the enzyme catalyses the conversion of more than one substrate. 25 Classically, it is easier to think of enzyme active site and substrate (ligand) binding as a lock and key, respectively. For a substrate to bind the shape must exactly unlock the active site by snugly fitting into the active site. This is what is shown in (A) above whereby the yellow ligand binds into the green enzyme perfectly. (B) shows the sequence in a morestepbystepmanner, wherebythe red substrate binds to the green enzyme, is converted to a yellow product. The product diffuses away and the unmodified enzyme is recycled for catalysing repetitive reactions. An easy reaction equation as written in (C) is thus: enzyme + substrate → enzyme-substrate complex → enzyme-product complex → enzyme + product. The cartoon above the reaction shows the enzyme lysozyme in blue. You may cover lysozyme in Immunology, but if not ignore this enzyme. 26 The induced-fit hypothesis is the modern way of understanding how enzyme active sites bind to their substrates. For our purposes, I am not too bothered about the difference between the lock and key hypothesis, and the induced-fit hypothesis. 27 Hopefully you have all heard about protease inhibitors that are currently used to treat HIV infection. When you cover the Gastrointestinal tract, you will learn about a different set of protease enzymes that are found in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. Chymotrypsin and trypsin are good examples of these gastrointestinal tract enzymes. They work by hydrolysing peptide bonds, but the active sites shown above are different as they recognise different substrate molecules. Chymotrypsin binds hydrophobic amino acids (not to be remembered, but this is just an illustration of the conformation difference), whereas trypsin binds to ionic amino acids (again not to be remembered). 2829 Apologies if this is getting repetitive, but I want to reinforce the mechanism by which an enzyme active site lowers the activation energy of a chemical reaction. Now we will move on to the kinetics of enzymology (cue horror-movie music). We will not be doing any hectic mathematics, but this section will be important for those students who will do pharmacology next year, when you are learning about drug inhibitors. Questions: Based on what you will learn about the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by organophosphates, why do new acetylcholinesterase molecules have to be synthesised? Can the inhibition of alpha adrenergic receptors be overcome in the body? If you don’t know the answer to the second question, that is fine as it will be explained when you do the cardiovascular system. The following section is especially important for answering the test and exam questions on the direction of a chemical reaction and the equilibrium point of enzyme catalysed reactions. 30 The carton above demonstrates the enzyme + substrate → enzyme-substrate complex → enzyme-product complex → enzyme + product equation we have previously described. 31 We are not going to do much mathematics, but there are two important values that we must understand when we look at an enzyme reaction-rate curve. These two values are the maximal reaction rate/velocity (Vmax) and the Km value. Vmax is intuitive because it is the maximum speed at which the enzyme can catalyse a specific reaction. When one divides Vmax by 2 the value obtained is the Km. Km is useful because it is a measure one can use to assess the affinity of an enzyme for a particular substrate. The smaller the value of Km, the higher the affinity of an enzyme for catalysing the conversion of a substrate into a product. Conversely, the greater the value of Km, the lower the affinity the enzyme has for binding to the substrate. 32 Now we can see a practical example when we have 2 enzymes, enzyme 1 and enzyme 2. These two enzymes have a different protein structure, but they catalyse the same biological reaction because they bind to the same substrate and form the same product. They are thus called isoenzymes (iso = same). In the example shown above, enzyme 1 and enzyme 2 ultimately have the same Vmax, because they reach the same maximal reaction rate as shown by the plateaued horizontal line in orange. Enzyme 1 gets to the maximal reaction rate earlier than enzyme 2, but eventually they reach the same Vmax. Based on looking at the graph, which enzyme has a higher affinity for the substrate? The smaller the value of Km, the higher the affinity, and so in this case Km1 has a smaller value than Km2, which means that enzyme 1 has a higher affinity for the substrate than enzyme 2. 33 Before I forget, DO NOT use →, ↑, ↓ when answering questions in physiology. These symbols do not show causality as they may mean up; which is not the same thing as increased, which is also different from accelerates. As we saw from the reaction rate curves in the preceding 2 slides, if the concentration of substrate is increased, the reaction rate will also increase. However, the comes a point when all the enzyme active sites are saturated and the reaction rate cannot occur any faster, and at this point, the reaction rate plateaus. Enzymes are protein molecules, and so heat denatures them. So cooking food destroys the enzyme structure. Intramolecular ionic bonds that maintain the enzyme’s tertiary structure are also disrupted by extremes of pH. Therefore enzymes have an optimal pH at which they work best. Proteolytic enzymes that reside in the stomach work best at an acidic pH, whereas proteolytic enzymes secreted by the pancreas work best at an alkaline pH. Since ionic bonds require a charge to be formed, changing the concentration of salts (ionic strength) where the enzyme is found would also disrupt the tertiary structure, and thus ultimately the active site of the enzyme. 34 This slide illustrates the effect that changing the pH and substrate concentration has on an enzymes reaction rate. 35 Homeostasis is all about maintaining a constant internal environment in the body. This means that there has to be a way of regulating the amount and the activity of enzymes depending on the body’s needs. If more enzymes are required to catalyse a specific reaction, more enzymes are synthesised. If there are too many enzymes, then the body degrades the excess enzymes. Generally, hormone secretion is the signal that determines the response that the body does. Enzyme synthesis or degradation takes time, and so a more rapid method of hormones regulating enzyme activity is by phosphorylation of the enzyme, which changes the shape and charge of the enzyme because phosphate is a negatively charged molecule. At the very beginning we saw that restricting enzymes to a specific subcellular compartment is a good way of regulating enzyme activity. If an enzyme is present in the mitochondrion, it is likely to be involved in energy production. You have already encountered the principle of allosterism when you were learning about the oxygen dissociation curve when you learnt about oxygen binding to haemoglobin. In this case, there are enzymes that have more than one protein subunit (multimeric or oligomeric) in their structure. For example, lactate dehydrogenase has four subunits in its structure. What do you think the significance of 4 subunits is for enzymatic reactions that are catalysed by lactate dehydrogenase? 3637 The enzyme active site may be hydrophobic, hydrophilic or amphipathic (have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components). However, if there are plenty of hydrophilic amino acids on the outside of globular (round-shaped enzymes) , this enzyme is likely to be lipid-soluble and will be found in biological membranes. In contrast, if most of the amino acids on the periphery are hydrophilic, hydrogen bonds can be formed with water and so this enzyme will be found dissolved in water in the cytoplasm or other watery organelle. 38 Regulation of enzymes by allosterism is important for fine-tuning of enzyme responses. In the slide shown above, if an enzyme is monomeric (has only 1 subunit) the reaction rate requires a wide range of substrate molecule concentration for activity. This would be very inefficient for processes whereby there are only a small amount of biological molecules in the body. Having a dimeric (2 subunit) enzyme structure improves enzyme efficiency by narrowing the substrate concentration required for enzyme activity. However, you will note that there is a better response when tetrameric (4 subunit) enzymes catalyse biological reactions. Effectively, this is the same co-operative binding of oxygen to haemoglobin that you learnt about in blood. When you are learning about carbohydrates, an important reaction that you will hear about in glycolysis is the unidirectional formation of pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate. Do remember that many biochemical reactions are reversible, that is, they can go in either direction depending on the concentration of reactants and products (reaction equilibrium). However, there are some reactions that can only occur in one direction, and the activity of pyruvate kinase is one example. Insulin is a hormone that is produced when the blood glucose concentration is high. Insulin is thus the hormonal signal that tells cells that glycolysis should be stimulated (glycolysis is the conversion of glucose to pyruvate). One of the regulated sites of insulin action is the activity of pyruvate kinase whereby increased insulin plasma concentrations stimulate dephosphorylation of pyruvate kinase. The dephosphorylated pyruvate kinase has higher activity and catalyses the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. That is, glycolysis is stimulated by insulin. 39 The secretion of hormones and their resultant physiological effects still takes at least a few minutes. Sometimes this time interval is not rapid enough. A more rapid manner of regulating enzyme activity is by negative feedback pathways. In this case, once a sufficient amount of product has been synthesised, the increased concentration of that product inhibits upstream reactions and thus slows down the cycle, and prevents further formation of product. 40 There are quite a few classes of enzyme inhibitors as you will see when you read your textbooks. For our purposes, we will only focus on two types of pharmacological enzyme inhibitors: competitive reversible inhibitors and non competitive irreversible inhibitors. As their names suggest, the competitive reversible inhibitors bind to the enzyme active site and compete for binding with the substrate molecule. In contrast, and generally, non competitive irreversible inhibitors bind to a site that is not the active site, but in this case irreversibly denature the enzyme, such that the enzyme can no longer catalyse any reactions. New enzymes thus have to be synthesised, which is time and energy consuming and takes place over many hours or days. 41 This cartoon shows how inhibitors (I) compete with substrates (S) for binding to the enzyme active site to prevent the formation of product (P). 42 For those who are mathematically inclined, the inhibition of enzyme activity by the competitive inhibitor is shown in the slide above. Effectively this slide shows us that competitive reversible enzyme inhibitors lower the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate molecules (higher Km value). This inhibition is reversible because the inhibition can be overcome by adding more substrate, because adding more substrate leads to the enzyme eventually reaching the same Vmax as occurs when there is no inhibitor present. 43 This cartoon shows how inhibitors (I) compete with substrates (S) for binding to the enzyme active site to prevent the formation of product (P). 44 The hallmark of noncompetitive irreversible inhibition is that the enzyme can never reach Vmax because the enzyme molecules have been permanently inactivated by binding to the inhibitor. If the substrate sneaks into the active site before the inhibitor inactivates the enzyme, then a product will be formed. This is why there is no change in the affinity of the enzyme (no change in Km) because the enzyme has bound the substrate before the inhibitor. 45 This slide is a tasty morsel of the main course that we will cover in Micronutrients. It is also a very important heads up over the entire metabolism course. During the various lectures you must pay attention to the vitamins that you learn about during various topics. Vitamins, enzymes and energy production are how the questions are integrated for tests and exams. E.g. from Blood you should already know the difference between a microcytic and a megaloblastic anaemia. After nucleotides you will know which biochemical pathway has been subverted in these micronutrient deficiency states. For now, it will be sufficient to note that we require small concentrations of helper molecules that enable enzymes to carry out their function. These helper molecules are either inorganic metal ions, in which case they are called enzyme cofactors. Alternatively the helper molecules are organic carbon-containing coenzymes. Both cofactors and coenzymes have to be obtained from the diet as humans cannot synthesise them. One of the key characteristics of enzymology is that the enzyme is not chemically altered by the time the substrate has been converted to a product. It is the cofactor or coenzyme that is modified, so that the enzyme is left unchanged. The changes in the coenzyme, makes it mandatory that the coenzymes must be regenerated or replenished, which means that these coenzyme nutrients have to be eaten regularly such that the body’s store is maintained. 46 During gluconeogenesis (formation of glucose from a non carbohydrate source) an important reaction that you will learn about is the one that is catalysed by pyruvate carboxylase. As you can tell from the name of this enzyme, pyruvate is the substrate and the addition of a carboxylate molecule is the reaction taking place. When a carboxylate molecule is added to pyruvate, the molecule oxaloacetate is formed. A new covalent bond is being formed between the carboxylate and pyruvate, and so energy is required for this process. ATP is the energy source. The carboxylate is derived from bicarbonate ions and the helper molecule for this reaction is the coenzyme biotin, which is obtained from ingesting the vitamin biotin. Thus structurally pyruvate carboxylase is unchanged at the end of the reaction, but it is the coenzyme biotin that is modified during the chemical reaction when pyruvate is converted to oxaloacetate. 47 For now, all that is important to note is that cofactors and coenzymes help enzymes carry out enzymatic catalysis. It is only the metal ion cofactor or the organic coenzyme that is modified at the end of a chemical reaction. Thus these cofactors and cofactors have to be constantly replenished, which is one of the reasons that humans require a regular diet of vitamins and other micronutrients. Thus for block 1, it is not necessary to remember the contents of this table. By the end of the year, you will have learnt about all these enzymes, and so if you are studying for the exam; the contents of this table should ring a loud bell. 48 During glycolysis, one of the first things that you will learn about is the phosphorylation of glucose once it enters the cell. Why do you think glucose has to be rapidly phosphorylated once glucose is intracellular? There are two commonly used enzymes that phosphorylate glucose inside cells. They are hexokinase and glucokinase (These enzymes were discovered before the conventional 2-name nomenclature system. Hex = 6). Hexokinase is found in most cells, whereas glucokinase is the glucose sensor in the pancreas; and glucokinase is the predominant glucose phosphorylating enzyme in the liver. Why do you think most cells have hexokinase but the liver has glucokinase? Now, because hexokinase and glucokinase have the same enzyme activity (they both phosphorylate glucose), but they have a different chemical structure, they are called isoenzymes/isozymes. Enzymes that have the same enzymatic activity, but different tissue distribution are also called isoenzymes or isozymes. Hexokinase and glucokinase also fit this bill of an identical reaction catalysed but different tissue distribution. Sometimes different subunits are put together to form an enzyme (as we saw in enzyme allosterism). In this case, oligomeric enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase have four subunits that make up the whole enzyme. There are M and H subunits that make up lactate dehydrogenase. We need 4 M or H subunits to make up a functional lactate dehydrogenase molecule, and so lactate dehydrogenase is made up of: MMMM, or MMMH, or MMHH, or MHHH or HHHH subunits making up the five different lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes. 49 Glucose is a small molecule that can cross plasma membranes. The plasma concentration of glucose is kept at a low concentration of about 5 mmol/L. Once glucose enters a cell, it would be undesirable for the glucose to leak out of the cell and so it is rapidly phosphorylated by hexokinase to form glucose-6-phosphate. Glucose-6-phosphate now has a negative charge and so cannot leak out of the cell and becomes trapped inside the cell for the cell’s use in energy provision. Before you listen to the audio, and from looking at the graph: Which enzyme has a higher affinity for glucose? Which enzyme has a greater capacity to phosphorylate glucose? Now answer the question of why glucokinase is found in the liver. 50 Apart from the gastrointestinal digestive enzymes, most enzymes are intracellular. If a cell is lysed, the intracellular contents are released into the plasma. You will learn about this concept in haemolysis, whereby erythrocyte components are found in the plasma when erythrocytes are degraded. The same concept can be applied to other organs. There are some enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase that are found in high concentrations in hepatocytes. When hepatocytes are damaged the alanine aminotransferase is released into the plasma. Clinicians can take blood samples when they are diagnosing hepatitis. If they find increased plasma activities of alanine aminotransferase then this will help them confirm the diagnosis of hepatitis. The more alanine aminotransferase found in the blood, either the longer the liver disease has been occurring, or the more severe the liver disease is, or both the chronic time course or severity of disease. 51 This is a busy slide, but it is a nice concise summary of the enzymes that you need to know in block 1, and for some, you will cover again when you do the specific organs. ALT and AST (I do not like abbreviations, but students like using them. One reason this is bad is if you are writing an answer for your PSE and write ALP, instead of ALT, you will not get any marks as it is the wrong enzyme. However if you are writing it out in full you will easily see that you have made a mistake. Also some abbreviations are not standard and so the marker may not know which enzyme you are talking about unless you define the abbreviation first) are used to help diagnose liver disease as they are found in high concentrations in hepatocytes. You will note that aspartate aminotransferase can also be found in other tissues and so it is not an exclusive marker for hepatocyte damage. When you learn about the liver you will learn about gamma () glutamyl transferase, and when you do the gastrointestinal tract, you will learn about the different amylase isozymes. Creatine kinase MM is easy to remember because it comes from muscle. BB comes from the brain, and thus MB is from the heart. Troponin is not an enzyme, but troponin is the most commonly used marker for cardiac tissue damage nowadays and you should remember it from the topic Excitable tissue. Lactate dehydrogenase is not used for cardiac tissue tests nowadays. It is nice for tests though because many concepts can be examined  52 Speaking of which, this slide covers at least 4 chapters that you will learn about over this year: • From Blood, you will know that haemolysis causes increased plasma LDH activity (concentration). • From Carbohydrates you will learn about anaerobic respiration. Now, you should know that erythrocytes do not have mitochondria and so can only obtain ATP via glycolysis. This means that the intracellular environment of erythrocytes is anaerobic. The red blood cells transport oxygen, not use oxygen for energy provision. The LDH isozyme found in erythrocytes must function in an anaerobic environment. This LDH isozyme (HHHH) is not explicitly stated in your course objectives, and so you don’t have to know about its subunit structure. • From Carbohydrates you will learn that there is a small finite pool of NAD+ available inside cells. During glycolysis NAD+ is utilised and so the LDH catalysed conversion of pyruvate to lactate is very important for regenerating NAD+ to keep glycolysis occurring inside cells. • From Micronutrients you will learn that NAD+ is obtained from vitamin B3 (niacin). • From the Liver, one of the functions of the liver is lactate detoxification. In this case lactate is converted by LDH to pyruvate using NADH. • For those who are tired of my lectures and cant wait to get a stiff G&T, one of the reasons alcoholics are malnourished is that the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, which is used by hepatocytes to detoxify alcohol, uses NAD+ as a cofactor. When one drinks too much alcohol all the NAD+ becomes depleted, and there becomes no NAD+ available for glycolysis. 5354 Hopefully, it is now apparent that enzymes are absolutely required for the regulation of all chemical reactions taking place in the bod. If this control is absent, haphazard reactions take place and unwanted biochemical products are formed that cause disease. Understanding where particular enzymes reside also helps clinicians differentially diagnose disease states, based on the plasma activities of enzyme markers detected.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
