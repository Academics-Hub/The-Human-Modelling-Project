Professor of Anatomy and Human Biology Emeritus In the eighty years SInce the Department of Anatomical Sciences of the University of the Witwatersrand came into being immediately after World War I, the Department has been acutely aware of its responsibility to its students. It has sought to offer attractive, far-ranging and palatable courses in the morphological disciplines to students of medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, nursing and pharmacy, as well as to undergraduate and post graduate students in the science stream. We have promoted the view that a healthy balance between the four pillars on which academe is built - teaching, research, service and administration - is essential if the discipline of anatomy is to survive and that one of the ways in which this message is transmitted is through the provision of well-written, lucid and relevant text books. The University of the Witwatersrand's Anatomy Department has a long history of publication of texts. The earliest of these was Alexander Lee McGregor's admirable A Synopsis if Surgical Anatomy, the first edition of which appeared in 1932 and which has run through twelve editions. Michael Kent Wright's excellent book Fibre Systems if the Brain and Spinal Cord was published by Witwatersrand University Press in 1952 and its third edition, now entitled Wright's Fibre Systems if the Brain and Spinal Cord, was revised and edited by Pamela M De Beer Kaufman and A David Mendelow in 1981. Mary Veenstra's valuable Practical Histology for Medical and Dental Students was published in 1970 and has continued to be used through a succession of editions, while the third edition of Cynthia Reid's helpful and sensible A Primer if Human Neuroanatomy was published from the Wits Anatomy Department in 1996. To this list should be added the work which was the predecessor of the present book. Man's Anatomy was written by my late and much loved colleague, Morris Arnold, and myself and published by Witwatersrand University Press in 1963. Its title is regarded by some as politically incorrect by today's standards, but it is interesting to recollect that the name was suggested to us in those early days by a woman writer of distinction! The second and third editions appeared in 1967 Foreword Xl11 and 1977. For the fourth edition (1988), the two original authors were delighted to welcome as co- author Professor Emeritus John Cameron Allan. As he is one of the two co-authors of this book, which I have the honour of introducing, there is a direct element of continuity between the authors of the old book and those of the new. Man's Anatomy was a three-volume work designed to serve both as a guide to the dissection of the human body and as a systematic textbook of human anatomy. With the passing of the decades, many medical schools, especially in the western and anglophone world, have found it appropriate and necessary to cut down on the amount of time devoted to human anatomy, histology and embryology. In many areas this trend has even led to the virtual elimination of dissection as the primary means of learning human anatomy and to the dismantling of anatomy departments as such, and the redistribution of their functions to departments such as surgery (for gross or clinical anatomy) and pathology (for microscopical anatomy). This haemorrhage of anatomical sciences appears to have gone furthest in the United States of America. As the USA has often been seen as a trend-setter for many academic and intellectual developments, the tendencies to downgrade anatomy as a component in the medical curriculum, and to liquidate departments of anatomy have come to be seen as 'modern', 'advanced', and 'the pattern of the future' . It should not be forgotten, however, that of some two thousand medical schools in the world, only a very small percentage have allowed themselves to be remodelled by these experiments. In the overwhelming majority of schools, anatomy still plays a substantial role, both academically and departmentally. At the Wits Medical School, the teaching programme in anatomy has, for nearly fifty years, embraced such aspects as surface and living anatomy (as both practical and theoretical modules), radiological anatomy (which, along with living anatomy, best bridges the gap between the cadaver and the patient), developmental anatomy (as a sound basis for the understanding of much adult morphology) and teratology, human genetics (which enlivens, explains and fills out the human biological aspects of our discipline), evolutionary anatomy (as a basis for understanding how adult anatomy has come about during long-term or phylogenetic development), the essential anatomy of the neonate and the child, and the morphology of puberty and adolescence, growth and maturation, sexual dimorphism and the secular trend in human growth. I believe these features add flesh and blood to the dry bones and sinews of anatomy. They produce in students what I like to think of as the 'Ezekiel effect' (a reference, of course, to the vision of the prophet Ezekiel in the Valley of Bones). The pressures to reduce the amount of anatomy taught to medical and allied medical students were nevertheless in my mind when Witwatersrand University Press approached me to prepare a new edition of Man's Anatomy. I felt that the time was ripe for our three-volume work to be condensed into, or replaced by, a single volume book. Moreover, I was anxious that a new and younger generation of anatomists and human biologists should make a substantial input into what would be largely a new text. I invited two of my former PhD students, Julius Kieser and David Ricklan, to undertake the task of producing the new book. They accepted enthusiastically but insisted that that remarkable anatomy teacher, encyclopaedist of morphology and lucid expositor, John Cameron Allan, known far and wide as 'Jack', and sometimes as 'Mr Anatomy of Johannesburg', should join them as co- author. With his customary co-operative and helpful attitude, he accepted. David Ricklan found it necessary to withdraw from the project, so the team charged with the new venture has comprised 'Jack' Allan, who still teaches anatomy in the Wits department after a lifetime as surgeon, anatomist, teacher and researcher, and 'Jules' Kieser, who is at present Head of the Department of Oral Sciences and Orthodontics at the University of Otago, New Zealand. These two outstanding men have the advantage of being professionally qualified clinicians, hence the clinical relevance of the anatomy laid bare in these pages has been a prime consideration. Clear XIV Practical Anatomy language has been considered pre-eminent, as it was in this volume's predecessors. The importance of this is twofold: for English-speaking students, absorption and digestion are likely to be easier if the style is lucid and not convoluted; for those for whom English is not a first language, it is essential that the text be couched in correct and simple English, free of recondite and regional colloquialisms. Above all, this book presents an introduction to anatomy through dissection of the human body. This expresses the authors' belief that the best place to study anatomy is in the dissection hall and at the cadaver-side. The text is garnished with simple line-drawings that not only aid understanding, but are readily reproducible, so students may supplement other forms oflearning by sketching. I like to think of such motor activities as completing the reflex arc of learning. The contents of the book are, of course, applicable in those schools of anatomy which, through shortage of cadavers, or inadequacy of embalming facilities, rely upon plastinated specimens. There are useful references to radiological appearances and to some of the more elaborate imaging procedures. For it must be appreciated, by student and teacher alike, that almost every part of the human body may now be visualised in the living subject by imaging techniques. Truly, as Ralph Ger has written, we should replace the phrase 'gross anatomy' (a term I have never liked!) by 'clinical anatomy'. Methods for cross-linkage between cadaver anatomy and the imaged anatomy of the living subject should be actively explored in anatomy departments. In this way a new and vivid relevance of anatomy rises to the surface - just as, not so long ago, the introduction of open heart surgery suddenly made the study of cardiac embryology both meaningful and relevant to the undergraduate and postgraduate student. In relation to graduates, I am convinced that Practical Anatomy will prove of value - as did its predecessor - to postgraduate students who are preparing for specialisation in various medical and dental disciplines, such as candidates for the fellowship in surgery and its various related disciplines. I am proud and delighted to have been invited to offer these few pages by way of a Foreword. I congratulate Jack Allan and Jules Kieser on bringing this work to fruition. There is no doubt that generations of students will look back with gratitude to this book and)ts authors. Johannesburg 3 November 1998 Preface This book, an introduction to anatomy, is aimed at the beginner in the field of medicine and its allied disciplines. Students often face the vast field of anatomy with some trepidation, yet studied from a logical and developmental point of view, the subject becomes both fascinating and exciting. Undoubtedly, the best place to learn anatomy is in the dissection hall, at the cadaver. The authors, both clinically orientated, have been conscious of this fact and of the fact that the basic necessity of the study of 'cadaver anatomy' is to translate it to living anatomy. With this in mind, the dissection method emphasises throughout the necessity of studying the skeleton and the living model as a prelude to the actual physical dissection of the cadaver. In places, general principles have been stated to enable the student to apply them to other parts of the body. The text is rooted in practical anatomy as indicated by the authors' tried and tested method of dissection and an effort has been made to keep the language of the text as simple and 'user friendly' as possible. Many of the diagrams in the new text are taken from the book's excellent predecessor, Man's Anatomy. Additional diagrams have been added and we have attempted to keep them as simple and as illustrative as those in the original text. Weare grateful to a number of people who have read through parts of the text and have made useful suggestions, most of which have been included in the book. In particular we wish to thank Emeritus Professor Carl Friz of the Department of Anatomy, University of British Columbia, who read and edited earlier drafts; Dr George Dias of the Department of Anatomy and Structural Biology, Otago University, for assistance in preparing the Head and Neck Chapter; Professor Beverley Kramer and Mr Riaze Asvat of the Department of Anatomical Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand. We owe a debt of gratitude to Professor Phillip Tobias for allowing us to rewrite a book which has stood the test of time. Weare grateful too, to Glynny Kieser who typed the original drafts, to Cheryl Brant, who edited the early chapters, and to Pat Tucker of the Witwatersrand University Press whose infinite encouragement and patience helped greatly in bringing the book to fruition. Jules Kieser John Allan Chapter One Introduction The word 'anatomy' is derived from two Greek words, ana- and -temnein, which, put together, mean 'to cut up'. While this is its strict meaning, it has gradually become synonymous with 'structure'. In the medical and allied fields, there are various ways in which 'structure' may be used or interpreted: â¢ clinical anatomy is that used by the doctor, nurse or physiotherapist in diagnosis or treatment at the bedside; â¢ surgical or operative anatomy is that used by the surgeon in the operating room; â¢ radiological anatomy is that used by the radiologist in the interpretation of X-ray films; â¢ comparative anatomy is that used by the zoologist when comparing the structure of various animals. â¢ developmental anatomy is used to describe how the human body grows within the mother's womb and later, after birth, into adulthood. â¢ functional anatomy or physiology is the study of how structures 'work'. All of these terms only consider the 'gross' aspect of structure, that which can be seen by the naked eye. However, all gross structures are made up of smaller structures called 'tissues', the structure of which is properly visible only under the microscope. The study of tissues under the microscope is called histology. Tissues, in turn, are made up of smaller elements, cells, the study of which is called cytology. The matter may be taken even further because the cells are made up of chemical substances which consist of molecules which are made up of atoms which in turn consist of a proton surrounded by one or more 'shells' of electrons. It is by the linkage of these electrons in particular ways that different substances are formed. These substances, through cells, tissues, and organs, give form to the human body. From the foregoing, it is obvious that structure is basic to all physical things and function will depend to a large extent upon the nature of the structure. For the study of medicine and its allied sciences, a knowledge of structure is, therefore, a fundamental requirement. It is necessary for the proper understanding, not only of normal function but also of disordered structure and function, a subject which is called pathology. 2 Practical Anatomy To attain these objectives, the anatomy of the human body on a cadaver (preserved dead body) is studied. The first purpose will be to acquire a knowledge of the shape and parts of the body together with the positions and relationships of the various organs within the body. The second and equally important purpose is to learn how to apply this knowledge to the living subject, since it is with living people that the doctor and allied practitioners are mostly concerned. Before this can be done, the technique of exposing the structures of the body must be acquired. This is called dissection. Before commencing to 'anatomise' (cut up) the body there are a number of things to be considered. Firstly, a cadaver is required, which is usually provided by the medical school department; some medical schools, however, study anatomy entirely from books and models. The cadaver will have been preserved (embalmed) by the injection of preserving fluid containing alcohol, formaldehyde, phenol, glycerine and an antifungal agent. This solution kills all bacteria and viruses and thus it is most unlikely that you will acquire any illness from handling such cadaver material. There are, however, two hazards of which you should be aware. The first is that some people are sensitive (allergic) to formaldehyde and such people should wear gloves when dissecting and should wash the hands thoroughly after the dissecting session, in case there has been a perforation of the glove. The second is that the chemical fumes arising from tl:-e cadaver have a tendency to destroy soft contact lenses. Wearers of soft lenses are advised, therefore, to go back to wearing spectacles during dissection sessions. In most departments of anatomy, it is mandatory to wear suitable clothing during dissection sessions. A clean white coat is protective and also lends an air of professionalism and dedication to the process of dissection of the human body upon which it is your privilege to be educated. It is important to wear closed shoes as a falling scalpel may seriously injure a dissector's foot. 1.1 DISSECTION EqUIPMENT A certain amount of equipment is necessary to perform a dissection adequately: â¢ a set of dissecting instruments containing a scalpel, two pairs of forceps - one with teeth and one with serrated blades - a strong pair of scissors, and a malleable probe; â¢ a small handlens to view small objects; â¢ grease pencils to mark the skin of the cadaver; â¢ a skeleton consisting of separate bones. An articulated skeleton will usually be provided by the anatomy department; â¢ a small plastic sponge and a cloth duster or dish-cloth; â¢ one or two wooden tongue depressors; â¢ a towel and a cake of soap; â¢ a flashlight; â¢ rubber or plastic gloves; and â¢ a drawing book and a set of coloured pencils or felt tip pens. It is preferable to work in a room which is equipped with a chalkboard. 1.2 TERMINOLOGY It is important to learn the names of the vanous organs and parts of the body for one's own understanding. Most of the words in anatomy have been derived from Latin or Greek. Those students who have been fortunate enough to have a background in Latin and/or Greek will acquire the terminology fairly quickly, while those who have not had such a background may have some difficulty. It is important, therefore, to look at the spelling of each technical word and to break it up into its separate parts. A consideration of the parts will usually indicate the meaning of the word. Introduction 5 flexion respectively. When the foot is tilted laterally (outwards) or medially (inwards) these actions are called eversion and inversion respectively. Any action in which a part moves away from the sagittal plane is called abduction; an action that causes a part to move towards the sagittal plane it is called adduction. A combination of the movements of flexion, abduction, extension and adduction is called circumduction (moving in a circle); this may be seen in the wrist, shoulder, hip and foot. Finally, in relationship to terminology, students are constantly harassed by words combined with prefixes and suffixes. As these are amongst the most commonly used and important words in anatomy, a list of commonly used prefixes and their meanings, and examples has been included below. a-/an- ab- ad- ambi- = without; athelia = without nipples, anencephaly = without brain = away from; abduct = move away from = towards; adduct = move towards = both sides; cisterna ambiens = ambidextrus ante- = before; antebrachium = forearm anti- = against, opposite; antihelix = against the helix of the ear apo- = from; apophysis = attachment from bone bi- = two; biceps = two heads circum- = around; circumflex = bend around contra- = opposite; contralateral = opposite side com- = together with; venae comites = accompanying veins de- = away from; dementia = away from the mind dia- = to the end; diaphragm = to the end of the thorax dis- dys- ex- ecto- ento- epi- eu- exo- extra- hemi- hyper- hypo- in- infra- inter- intra- intro- meta- ob- para- per- peri- post- pro- = twice; discoid = two flat sides = bad; dyslexia = bad reading = out of; extraperitoneal = outside the peritoneum = outer; ectoderm = outer membrane = inner; entoderm = inner membrane (lining) = on, against; epididymis = on the testis = well; euphoria = good health = outside; exostosis = from outer bony surface = beyond, outside; extraembryonic coelom = half; hemiparesis = weakness of half of body = excessive; hypertonia = excessive muscle tone = under; hypoglycaemia = lack of blood sugar = within; indurate = harden within = below; infraspinatus = below spine of scapula = between; interthalamic adhesion = within; intrauterine = within the uterus = inwards; introitus= entrance to vagina = between; metacarpus = between wrist and digits = against; obturator membrane = next to; parametrium = next to the uterus = through; per vaginam= vaginal birth = around; pericardium = around the heart = atter; postdiastolic = atter diastole = before; proptosis = forward (bulging) eyes 6 Practical Anatomy re- retro- semi- sub- super- supra- syn- trans- ultra- = back again; recurrent nerve = turn ing back = behind; retroperitoneal = behind peritoneum = half; semispinalis = half spinal muscle = below; subcutaneous = below the skin = above; supercilliary = related to eyebrow = above; supraglenoid = above glenoid cavity = together; synapse = junction between nerves = across; transpyloric plane = across pylorus = beyond; ultraviolet = light beyond visible There are only a few suffixes used in descriptive anatomy. For example, the suffix -oid means resembling; thus, deltoid means resembling the Greek letter delta and hominoid means resembling man. The suffixes -unculus and -icle indicate a diminutive, thus, homo is man and homunculus is a little man; pes is a foot and pedicle or peduncle indicate a little foot. Anatomical terms with prefixes and suffixes are in very common use and it is advisable for the student to becol11.e wholly familiar with them. 1.3 TECHNIQUES OF DISSECTION A good dissection is like a work of art - the more often one looks at it, the more one sees in it. Like the artist, the dissector must take care and trouble over the work. The so-called 'hit-and-run' or 'slash-and-smash' technique inevitably results in poor work. It is impossible to learn anatomy from a poor dissection. The artist is not born with the skill to paint and the dissector, likewise, is not born with the skill to dissect. It is care and practice which makes a perfect picture and a perfect dissection. There are two basic methods of exposing structures: by 'sharp' dissection with the scalpel, which is reserved for those who have already acquired a skill, or by 'blunt' dissection with the finger or similar blunt object, which is the technique which should mainly be used by the beginner. There is a third type - the 'scissors' dissection - which is commonly used by surgeons. It is performed by the 'close and open' technique and is the safest method in that it causes the least trauma. After a while, when some skill has been acquired, all three methods may be used by the anatomy dissector. Sharp dissection in the hands of the beginner often results in the destruction or even ablation of structures which are important for study. It is important to realise that the body contains many 'space-saving' devices. Thus, if a nerve is going to a particular place, then it is often accompanied by an artery and a vein. Because the vein is filled with blood and is, therefore, dark in colour, it may be used to identify the neurovascular elements of a part. It should also be noted that the nerves and blood vessels are like a tree - as they branch away from the centre or trunk, they become smaller. Since dissection, by its very nature, must begin from the outside, the beginner is faced with finding the smallest structures first. This makes early dissection somewhat difficult and emphasises the necessity to apply care to the finding of small but important structures. A scalpel will sometil11.es make contact with bone or other hard material and, as a result, will lose its edge. It is necessary, therefore, to sharpen or hone the blade from time to time. An oil-stone is provided in most dissection rooms for this purpose. Incisions should be made with a sharp scalpel and should be deep enough to enter the subcutaneous fatty plane. Note that the skin on the back (posterior aspect) of the body tends to be thicker than that on the front and correspondingly more care should be taken with anterior Introduction 7 incisions, lest the cut pass too deeply. By far the best technique (once the skin has been incised) is 'blunt' dissection with the fingers or with the 'handle-end' of the scalpel. The skin and subcutaneous fat should be pared off the underlying muscles. In this way, the nerves and blood vessels are easily identified as they emerge through the underlying deep fascia and muscle, en route to the skin. When removing skin, especially that of the trunk and limbs, the plane of separation between the superficial and deep fascial planes is used. This emphasises an important concept in dissection. The layers of the body, for the most part, are separable from one another and dissection is made correspondingly more easy if separation of organs and structures is carried out along anatomical cleavage planes. Working in anatomical planes is one of the favourite 'tricks' of the surgeon. Not only does it make for ease of identification but it provides for the safety of surrounding structures. It is advisable to cut short or shave the hairy parts of the body. This provides for cleaner and more satisfactory dissection of the region. As noted previously, good dissection comes with practice. When dissecting, it is advisable to have the bones of the region close at hand so that frequent reference may be made to them. In this way, the structure of the bones may be studied and appreciated as dissection proceeds. This obviates the necessity for setting aside special time for the study of the bones themselves. 1.4 CARE OF TIlE CADAVER The cadaver is the greatest asset in the study of anatomy and it is necessary, therefore, to preserve and care for it for the duration of the dissection course. The greatest hazard is dehydration and desiccation, usually brought about by very efficient air-conditioning systems, but not infrequently by careless students who neglect the elementary rules of cadaver care. Since the embalming fluid contains a large proportion of volatile methyl alcohol which itself is a powerful dehydrating agent, a rapidly changing surrounding air volume accelerates the removal of the alcohol and, with it, the water normally contained in the cadaver. Added to this, if the ambient humidity is low, the water loss is even greater. Even slight dehydration renders the body tissues hard and inflexible and useless for proper dissection. As in the living individual, the skin affords the best protection against dehydration. In dissecting any region, do not remove more than the required amount of skin. At the end of a dissection sessiori, the exposed tissues should be liberally soaked with embalming solution and the area covered with the skin which has been removed previously. This, in tum, is covered with a cloth soaked in the solution, and finally the whole cadaver is covered with plastic or rubber sheeting, tucked in completely around the cadaver. Plastic cling-wrap may also be used. It is also necessary to preserve all soft tissues and organs such as fat, fascia, muscle, heart, lungs, liver etc., in a bin set aside for the cadaver, so that at the final disposal, each cadaver is complete and may be given a proper burial or cremation. Chapter Two Regions of the Body The human body, in company with all other biological bodies, is set out in layers, and within these layers, the body is segmented from head to foot. During the various phases of dissection, the dissector will encounter each of the structures described below, either singly or in combination. The structures have been described as following one another inwards. The skin is the most superficial structure and separates the organs from the environment. It consists of two layers, the outer epidermis and the deeper dermis. The dermis contains the small 'organs' of the skin, namely hair follicles, smooth muscle, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, nerves, blood vessels and lymph vessels. In the hands and feet, the hair follicles are modified to form nails. The subcutaneous tissue lies immediately beneath the skin and gives the skin its mobility on the deeper and more fixed tissues. It is a layer of areolar connective tissue containing a variable amount of yellow fat. It gives transit to blood vessels and nerves en route to the skin. The fibrous element of the subcutaneous tissue (tela subcutanea) is sometimes referred to as superficial fascia, especially when there has been a loss of fat, making the connective tissue more conspicuous. The deep fascia is the next layer, and is the general fibrous investment of structures lying deep to the tela subcutanea. It is seen predominantly in the neck and the limbs. The deep fascia may either be very thin or very robust. In the case of the limbs, it forms an elastic covering for the muscles and usually separates them into groups by sending intermuscular septa inwards between them. These septa form compartments containing muscles, nerves and blood vessels. In some places, particularly near joints, the deep fascia is thickened to form retinacula which hold the tendons of muscles in place. The muscles are reddish brown structures which form the bulk of the soft parts in nearly all regions of the body. In general, to be effective a muscle must have attachments. The origin is the relatively fixed end and the insertion is at that end which is movable. Usually, the origin is proximal and the insertion distal, but these may be reversed. Muscle is covered with a thin layer of connective tissue, the epimysium which allows it to move smoothly upon adjacent muscles or other structures. A tendon is one of the means of attachment of a muscle to bone, and it consists of a compact mass of closely packed fibrous tissue (collagen material), usually with a smooth and glistening surface and is slightly yellow in colour. It is often invested by a synovial sheath, especially when passing under a retinaculum. Regions of the Body 9 Classification of muscle: â¢ skeletal muscle - striated or voluntary; â¢ smooth muscle (involuntary) - intestine, blood vessel, ureter, bladder; â¢ cardiac - myocardium (heart muscle) The skeletal muscle may be further classified in shape and configuration as: â¢ rectangular - straight fibres, with or without intersections (sartorius, rectus abdominis); â¢ rhomboid - angular fibres (intercostal, masseter, rhomboids); â¢ fusiform - fibres tapering to a narrow end (brachialis, gastrocnemius); â¢ digastric - two bellies with an intermediate tendon (omohyoid, occipito-frontalis) â¢ pennate - like a feather (unipennate - peroneus longus; bipennate - rectus femoris; multi pennate - deltoid); â¢ sphincteric - circular muscle (anal, urinary sphincters); â¢ fan-shaped - fibres radiating from a point (pectoralis major and minor, temporalis). Space is saved by the transformation of a muscle into a tendon; this is specially so near to joints where several muscles (tendons) may attach to adjacent bones. Tendons may be thick and rounded, thin and narrow, or broad and 'flat'. In the latter case the 'flat' or 'broad' tendon is called an aponeurosis, and is the mode of insertion of a broad, flat muscle. Nerves are whitish cords which emanate from the central nervous system. They are usually accompanied by blood vessels and give off branches to skeletal muscle and to the skin. In the interior of the body, the nerves which supply the internal organs are of a special kind (autonomic nerves) and are designed to drive smooth muscle and glands. Blood vessels consist of arteries (carrying blood away from the heart) and veins (carrying blood to the heart). They are hollow muscular tubes of varying sizes - those near to the heart are large and those remote from the heart are small. In the cadaver, the arteries are generally empty while the veins are filled with clotted blood. This fact enables us to identify veins, even when they are very small. In the limbs there are often two or more veins with each artery and they are known as venae comites. In general, the main vessels of a part pass onwards between muscle groups while their local branches pass among the muscles which make up a group. Joints or articulations are places where two parts of the skeleton come into contact and move upon one another. The movement takes place 'within' the joint. There are several types of joints. The large articulations have articular ends to the bones, covered with articular cartilage to ensure smooth movement, and are shaped to facilitate the required movements. Some joints have intra-articular fibrocartilaginous discs designed to obviate incongruities in articular surfaces. Many joints possess a synovial membrane which provides lubricant fluid for the joint. All joints have a surrounding capsule which protects the interior of the joint and prevents the synovial fluid from leaking out. Classification of joints: â¢ fibrous - immovable (sutures of skull), slightly movable (interosseous membrane); â¢ cartilagenous - immovable (spheno-occipitaQ, slightly movable (symphysis pubis); â¢ synovial with joint cavity - shoulder, elbow, knee, hip. Most joints have surrounding ligaments or capsular condensations to provide strength and stability to the joint. Ligaments are bands of dense connective tissue having a smooth silvery appearance. 10 Practical Anatomy They usually connect bone to bone but may exist in other places e.g. ligamentium arteriosum. Bursae are often present near joints or in places where structures are subject to friction or pressure. A bursa is a sac containing fluid designed to offset the effects of friction or pressure. Bones are generally the deepest structures, being clothed with muscle and fascia. Bone is made up of two basic elements - a collagenous model which is infiltrated with calcium salts. Under the influence of osteoblasts two types of bone are formed - compact bone and spongy or cancellous bone. There is a considerable variety of bones but, in general, a long bone has a shaft (diaphysis) and two articular ends which usually are the growing parts (epiphyses). The bone is surrounded by a vascular membrane, the periosteum, which provides the greater part of its outer blood supply. This membrane is also responsible for the moulding or shaping of bones, especially those which have been injured. A bone also has an internal blood supply via the nutrient artery . This supply is largely to the bone marrow which is inside the bone and responsible for the formation of blood cells Classification of bones: â¢ long bones - humerus, femur, tibia; â¢ short bones - carpal, tarsal; â¢ flat bones - scapula, ribs, sternum; â¢ irregular bones - vertebrae, facial bones; â¢ sesamoid bones - (these develop within tendons) pisiform, patella. It is customary to study bones in their prepared and dried state. This might give the impression that bone is an inert tissue, but this is untrue. Bone is a vibrant and active tissue albeit that it is very hard as compared with other tissues. 2.1 SUBDIVISIONS OF TIlE BODY The human body is roughly divided into regions such as the head, neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, perineum, upper limbs and lower limbs. In the limbs particularly, the regions may be divided into 'sub-regions' e.g. arm, forearm, hand; thigh, leg, foot. The main subdivisions are in the table below; study Figs. 2.1 and 2.2, and identify the regions on the cadaver. Subdivisions of the body Head Neck Back of neck Trunk Thorax Thoracic cavity Pectoral region (region of the breast) Breast (mamma or mammary gland) Upper limb Scapula (shoulder blade) region Shoulder Axilla (armpit) Arm Elbow Cubital fossa (anterior of elbow) Abdomen Abdominal cavity Pelvic cavity Perineum Lumbar region Inguinal region (groin) Forearm Wrist Hand Palm of hand Dorsum of hand Fingers neck (collum) â¢..â¢.. \". shoulder ..â¢..â¢... thorax ---------- axilla----- coastal margin ----------1------Â·1\\------- cubital fossa ----- forearm wrist (carpus) -- palm digits thigh (femur) digits ----------------------'''''IJ A back of neck (nucha) ------------------ scapular region -------- vertebral furrow ----- lumbar region (loin) - gluteal region - gluteal sulcus popliteal fossa ------------------- calf (sura) ------------------- sole of foot (planta) ------------------- B Regions <if the Body 11 ------------------------head (caput) anterior median line midclavicular line ---------- arm (brachium) umbilicus ------ abdomen ---\\----lÂ·----Â·---hip inguinal sulcus external genitalia ..... - knee (genu) -------------------Ieg (crus) ------------------ankle --------------------- dorsum of foot --,------ scapular line ---- elbow (cubitus) dorsum of hand FIGURE 2.1 THE ANATOMICAL POSITION AND SUBDIVISIONS OF TIlE ANTERIOR (A) AND POSTERIOR (B) ASPECTS OF THE BODY Regions if the Body 13 A FIGURE 2.3 ANTERIOR (A) AND POSTERIOR (B) ASPECT OF SKELETON The thoracic cage is formed by the 12 ribs on each side, articulated posteriorly to the 12 thoracic vertebra and anteriorly to the sternum. The skull consists of the cranium and the mandible. The cranium is subdivided into the calvaria or 'brain box' and the facial skeleton. The facial portion includes the maxilla (upper jaw) and contains the orbit nasal cavity and the mandible (lower jaw). The calvaria may be further divided into the calotte (skull cap) and the cranial base. The upper limb and pectoral girdle consists of the scapula (shoulder blade), clavicle (collar bone), humerus (arm bone), ulna (medial forearm bone), radius (lateral forearm bone), carpals (8 bones of the wrist), metacarpals (5 bones of the palm), and phalanges (14 finger bones). The scapula bears a prominent spine on its convex posterior surface, and a shallow, pear-shaped socket, the glenoid fossa, at its lateral angle, for the head of the humerus. The spine of the scapula ends laterally in a flattened ledge, the acromion. The upper edge of the scapula presents the coracoid process, which juts upwards and forwards. The medial end of the clavicle articulates with the manubrium sterni, and the lateral end with the acromion. The scapulae and clavicles form the pectoral girdle. 14 Practical Anatomy The lower limb and pelvic girdle consists of the ox coxae (hip bone, comprising ilium, ischium and pubis), the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), tibia (medial leg bone),flbula (lateral leg bone), tarsals (7 bones of the instep), metatarsals (5 bones of the forefoot), and phalanges (14 toe bones). The hip bone bears a cup-shaped socket, the acetabulum, for the head of the femur. The twisted blade of bone above the acetabulum is the ilium. It is bounded above by an S-shaped iliac crest. The crest ends in front at the anterior superior iliac spine and behind at the posterior superior iliac spine. Below and behind the acetabulum is the ischium. The large knob of bone which one sits is the ischial tuberosity . The two hip bones join each other in the anterior midline at the pubic symphysis. Lateral to the upper end of the symphysis is the pubic crest, which ends laterally at the pubic tubercle. The two hip bones form the pelvic girdle. The cavity contained within the pelvic girdle and the sacrum is the pelvic basin. Chapter Three The Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limb The most convenient place to commence the dissection of the human body is at the region of the shoulder (pectoral) girdle. Examine an articulated skeleton and identifY the pectoral girdle. It consists of the clavicles and the scapulae, joined to one another laterally at the acromioclavicular joints. The clavicles are united in front by means of the manubrium sterni at the sternoclavicular joints. The girdle is slung from the trunk solely by these two joints. It is also evident from the skeleton that the upper limbs are slung from the girdle at the shoulder joints. Common sense should indicate that since the upper limb may be fairly heavy, the girdle will require large muscles to support it. Now examine the girdle region of a living model. Feel the bulky muscles surrounding the scapula. Clasp the hands in front of the chest, and push them together to demonstrate the powerful pectoral muscles anteriorly. IdentifY the lower angle of the scapula and ask the subject to raise the upper limb to above the head. Follow the angle of the scapula as he does this and note that ~t moves laterally almost to the middle of the side of the chest. Clearly, there is some kind of 'joint' between the scapula and the chest wall. Start dissection by removing the skin of the anterior pectoral region. If the cadaver is a l1lale, make the incisions along the lines marked (Fig.3.1). If the cadaver is a female, it is important not to remove the breast with the skin as it is much easier to dissect the breast if it is attached to the chest wall. In the female, carefully make a circular incision around the areola (the pink or pigmented area around the papilla or nipple). The cut must go only through the skin to ensure that the ducts leading to the nipple are not divided. Elevate the skin on the side away from the areola for about 3-5cm. The depth of the incisions over the sternum and clavicle should reach to bone, but those over the shoulder and costal margin should not penetrate muscle. If the cadaver has a thick layer of subcu- 20 Practical Anatomy To expose the structures deep to pectoralis major, make a cut through the sternocostal head of pectoralis major about 3cm from the centre of the sternum. Carefully elevate and detach the muscle from the underlying costal cartilages. When about Scm of muscle has been elevated extend the incision upwards and along the surface of the clavicle, keeping close to the bone. Extend the medial incision downwards along the costal margin, to where the muscle ends. It is important not to cut too deeply on the costal margin for fear of dividing the underlying rectus abdominis and external oblique muscles. Carefully elevate the clavicular head of pectoralis major from the surface of the clavicle and the underlying tissues. Come along the deltopectoral groove and preserve the cephalic vein lying in the groove. The pectoralis minor muscle lies closely beneath pectoralis major and it is very easily damaged if the overlying pectoralis major is roughly reflected. Pass a finger gently between the two muscles from below and feel the 'string-like' nerves entering the deep surface of pectoralis major. These are the medial and lateral pectoral nerves emanating from the brachial plexus. These nerves constitute the motor nerve supply to the two muscles. Continue the reflection of pectoralis major until it is completely freed from underlying structures and is attached only by its humeral insertion.

Reflection of pectoralis major reveals three underlying muscles, subclavius, pectoralis minor and serratus anterior (Figs. 3.7, 3.8 & 3.9). All these muscles are covered by deep fascia; the fascia surrounding pectoralis minor is termed the clavipectoral fascia (Fig. 3.10). Above pectoralis minor there is a triangular space between its upper edge, subclavius, and the 1st and 2nd ribs. Spanning this space is a thin areolar membrane, the costocoracoid membrane, which contains some fat. Above, the membrane is attached to the costocoracoid ligament and below to the upper border of pectoralis minor. Within the membrane is a crescentic opening through which a number of important structures pass: â¢ the cephalic vein ~ entering the axillary vein; â¢ lymph channels from the breast to the apical axillary lymph nodes; â¢ the lateral pectoral nerve ~ supplying pectoralis major; â¢ the acromiothoracic artery . subclavius ---- costaclavicular ....................

By careful scissors dissection, identity all the structures mentioned above. This done, carefully remove the membrane, preserving the structures already identi- fied. Remove the fat behind the region of the membrane and find the large axillary artery and vein, and the cords of nerves from the brachial plexus related to these blood vessels. From the lower border of pectoralis minor, follow the fascia downwards until it reaches the skin of the armpit. This fascia is tough and fatty and is known as the suspensory ligament of the axilla (armpit). The ligament gives the skin of the armpit its hollowed out appearance. Divide the thick fascia covering serratus anterior and seek for the long thoracic nerve (CS,6,7). The nerve may be quite long and thin and embedded in fat and fascia. Division of this nerve results in paralysis of serratus anterior. Note that the muscle is supplied from its superficial surface. Clean the under surface of the clavicle with a cloth to expose the costocoracoid ligament. Note that laterally it is attached to the coracoid process, and medially it blends with the tendon of subclavius, attaching the muscle to the first rib. At this time also seek for the powerful costoclavicular ligament lying between the medial end of the clavicle and the first rib (Fig. 3.7). The costoclavicular ligament is an accessory ligament of the sternoclavicular joint. The costal attachment of the ligament lies just behind the attachment of subclavius. It is short, thick and difficult to see. It must be divided to release the medial end of the clavicle for further dissection. The simplest way to do this is to firstly divide the tendon of subclavius close to the first rib and, pulling it laterally, visualise the ligament immediately behind by pushing the shoulder forwards and upwards to elevate the clavicle. Pass a scalpel between the first rib and the clavicle and divide the ligament by cutting medially. Do not cut backwards as there is a real danger of dividing the subclavian vein, subclavian artery and the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. The Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limb 23 â¢ the posterior wall is formed by teres major, latissimus dorsi and subscapularis; â¢ the lateral wall is formed mostly by the coracobrachialis muscle and partly by a small part of the intertubercular sulcus of the humerus, and â¢ the lower boundary of the space consists of skin lined with a stout layer of axillary fascia. pectoralis major ----------------------------------.- scapula -------------------------------- FIGURE 3.12 SCHEMATIC TRANSVERSE SECTION OF THE AX/LLA Some textbooks cite pectoralis minor as part of the anterior wall, but it is better considered as part of the contents rather than a boundary. Since pectoralis major has been reflected, the upper limb may now be abducted to 30Â° or more from the sagittal plane to afford space to display the axillary structures. Remove the fat of the axilla. This serves to protect the more vital contents of the axillary space - the nerves and vessels of the upper limb. Now consider the structures which could be construed as being the contents of the space: â¢ the axillary lymph nodes; â¢ the axillary artery and vein; â¢ and the cords and branches of the brachial plexus. The pectoralis minor is the 'key' to the axilla. It crosses the space from the coracoid process to the chest wall and, in so doing, it divides the axillary artery into three parts. The artery begins at the lateral border of the first rib and ends at the lower border of the teres major muscle: â¢ the first part (above the muscle) has one branch, the superior thoracic artery; â¢ the second part (behind the muscle) has two branches, the acromiothoracic and lateral thoracic arteries; and â¢ the third part (below the muscle) has three branches, the anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries and the subscapular artery. The superior thoracic artery supplies the outer surfaces of the upper two intercostal spaces. The acromiothoracic artery divides into four branches: â¢ the deltoid branch accompanies the cephalic vein in the deltopectoral groove; â¢ the clavicular branch supplies the sternoclavicular joint; â¢ and the acromial and pectoral branches supply their named regions. 24 Practical Anatomy The lateral thoracic artery passes along the lower border of pectoralis minor on the chest wall to supply the chest wall and the muscle; it also gives lateral mammary branches to the breast. The large subscapular artery descends along the lateral border of the scapula and about half way along, it gives the circumflex scapular artery and then continues as the thoracodorsal artery which accompanies the thoracodorsal nerve, supplying the chest wall. The circumflex scapular artery curls around the lateral scapular border and, in the infraspinous fossa, forms an anastomosis with the suprascapular and transverse cervical arteries, both of which arise from the subclavian artery. If the axillary artery is damaged and requires ligation, the person will not necessarily lose the upper limb as the anastomosis will compensate for the loss of supply from the axillary artery. The axillary vein begins at the lower border of teres major by the conjunction between the brachial veins and the basilic vein, and ends at the outer border of the first rib. It is closely related to the axillary artery along its entire course, usually lying anterior to the artery. It commonly receives tributaries corresponding roughly to those of the artery. Near the apex of the axilla it receives the cephalic vein. As the fat is removed, look for the axillary lymph nodes that lie mainly around the principal veins of the axilla. There are 3 main groups of lymph nodes: â¢ the subscapular group around the subscapular and thoracodorsal veins; â¢ the pectoral group around the lateral thoracic vein; â¢ the apical group in the apex of the axilla. The nerves of the axilla emanate from the brachial plexus. 3.4 THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS The brachial plexus comprises roots, trunks, divisions, cords and branches. Part of the plexus lies in the neck (i.e. above the clavicle) and part lies below the clavicle. The upper part will be more clearly seen when the root of the neck is dissected. In order to establish continuity through this junctional region, the construction of the whole plexus will be briefly described. The anatomical plexus begins as the anterior primary rami of the nerves C5-T1, which are mixed nerves (i.e. motor and sensory) and they are called the roots of the plexus. Note: these roots are not the same as the roots of the spinal nerves which enter and leave the spinal cord. Because of the positions of the limbs on the embryonic body being anterolateral and anterior to the coronal morphological plane (the plane through the transverse processes of the vertebrae) they must necessarily be supplied by anterior primary rami. These rami emerge into the neck between the scalenus anterior and scalenus medius muscles in company with the subclavian artery. The subclavian vein is not in this compartment but lies in front of scalenus anterior. The roots of C5 and C6 join to form the upper trunk while C8 and T1 join to form the lower trunk. The root of C7 continues alone to form the middle trunk (Fig. 3.13). Each trunk divides into anterior and posterior divisions, usually just above the level of the clavicle. Approximately behind the clavicle, the divisions unite to form cords: â¢ all the posterior divisions join to form the posterior cord; â¢ the upper two anterior divisions join to form the lateral cord; and â¢ the lower anterior division alone, forms the medial cord.

Each cord divides into two branches which unite to form nerves, approximately behind the pectoralis minor muscle. To visualise these arrangements, reflect pectoralis minor by detaching its digitations from the 3rd, 4th and 5th ribs and turn the muscle laterally to expose the axillary artery and vein surrounded by the nerves. The axillary vein, lying anterior to the axillary artery and nerves, obscures them, The vein should be removed entirely, after freeing it from all surrounding structures, When reflecting pectoralis minor, preserve the medial and lateral pectoral nerves and note from which parts of the plexus they arise (Fig. 3,13), Wipe away the fat and areolar tissue in a downward direction to avoid damage to small branches. The first nerve to be found is usually the median nerve lying almost anteriorly upon the artery. Trace the median nerve upwards to where it forms a 'V' over the artery. Follow the limbs of the 'V' upwards, until they join with nerves lying lateral and medial to the artery. This formation resembles the letter 'M'. The 'up-going' nerves are the lateral and medial cords while the 'down-going' nerves are the musculocutaneous nerve on the lateral side and the ulnar nerve on the medial side. Now pick up the upper part of the artery with forceps and, dissecting behind it, find and expose the posterior cord. Follow the cord upwards and downwards until the branches are found. These are the radial nerve passing downwards and the axillary nerve passing laterally, to disappear behind the humerus in company with the posterior circumflex humeral artery. 3.5 THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE PECTORAL GmOLE Examine the bones of an articulated skeleton. Note the vertebral column (both the cervical and thoracic parts), the scapula and the clavicle. On the living model, feel for a 'bump' on the back of the head and identify the external occipital protuberance. Bend the neck forwards and at the base of the neck find two prominences. These are the spinous processes of the C7 (vertebra prominens) and Tl vertebrae. Count the spinous processes downwards until the first sacral is reached. Feel laterally for the acromion process (the tip of the shoulder) and follow it medially and slightly downwards along the spine of the scapula. Turn the cadaver into the prone position, and place a wooden block under the chest. Make an incision from the external occipital protuberance to the spine of the first sacral vertebra, down to bone. Make an incision from acromion to acromion, being careful to go only to the surface of the underlying muscle. At the acromion processes, carry the incisions down the lateral aspect of the arms to the elbows. At the level of the iliac crest, make an incision across the trunk, being careful to go only to the surface of the covering of the muscle. Beginning at the corners, raise all the flaps of skin and subcutaneous tissue. As the skin of the back is much thicker than that of the chest, the flaps are The Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limb 27 semispinalis splenius capitis splenius cervicis levator scapulae supraspinatus deltoid ------------------------ T1 -------------------------- rhomboid minor aponeurosis over infraspinatus ________ ylfr!If/!i\"'!;;:~~~- ------------------------- rhomboid major ---------------------------T5 teres minor ---- --------------------------- T7 teres major ,'--''',-,-,--\"----------------------------- outline of trapezius latissimus dorsi ------------------ ' ------------------------------ T12 external oblique ----------------- lumbar triangle ------------------\",',',,/\\\\\\\\\\\\-. FIGURE 3.15 MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER REGION AND BACK AFTER THE REMOVAL OF TRAPEZIUS divide trapezius from its lateral attachments to the scapula and clavicle, and elevate it medially. Clear away the dense fascia overlying the scapular muscles to expose them completely. Under trapezius, identifY the next layer of muscles which may be conveniently divided into a medial group of three muscles (levator scapulae, rhomboid minor, and rhomboid major), and a lateral group of four muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres major and teres minor) (Fig. 3.15). Subscapularis, located in front of the scapula, extends from the medial two-thirds of the subscapular fossa, to the lesser tubercle of the humerus. This muscle, along with teres major and latissimus dorsi, forms the posterior wall of the axilla (Fig. 3.12). Proceed laterally to the posterior border of deltoid; free it and pull it laterally to expose the long and lateral heads of the triceps muscle. Above the long head of triceps, look for the axillary nerve and the posterior circumflex humeral artery coming through the quadrangular space and, more medially, for the circuniflex scapular artery coming through the triangular space (Fig. 3.17). The Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limb 31 Follow the basilic vein downwards to where it disappears under the skin at the wrist. Follow the vein upwards to find that at about the middle of the arm it disappears deeply by passing through an opening in the deep fascia to join the brachial vein. Note also that the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm emerges through the same opening. Using blunt forceps and stroking through the fat in a longitudinal direction, expose the cutaneous nerves in both the arm and forearm (Fig. 3.18). HavingJocated all the veins and nerves in the arm and forearm remove the fat to expose the underlying deep fascia. The deep fascia forms a sleeve which encloses the structures of the limb. Make a circumferential cut just below the insertion of deltoid and a similar one at the wrist. Join these two incisions by a cut along the anterior aspect of the arm and forearm. Reflect the two resulting fascial flaps medially and laterally. Look for the medial and lateral intermuscular septa in the arm, which pass deeply from the surrounding fascial layer on each side towards the medial and lateral supracondylar ridges of the humerus. These septa divide the brachial structures into anterior and posterior compartments (Fig. 3.19). The muscles in such compartments share the same nerve and blood supply, and have the same general function. At the elbow, the deep fascia is attached to the epicondyles and to the olecranon process. Leave these attachments intact for the present. anterior compartment posterior compartment FIGURE 3.19 DIAGRAMMATIC SECTION THROUGH THE ARM TO SHOW THE DIVISION INTO MUSCULAR COMPARTMENTS 3.6.2 Muscular Components of the Arm The muscles in the arm can be divided into anterior flexors and posterior extensors. There are three flexor muscles in the anterior compartment, all supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve, a terminal branch of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus. The muscles in the posterior compartment are all supplied by the radial nerve or its branches arising from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. Define the two heads of biceps brachii. Follow the heads distally to find that they form a single belly which becomes tendinous at the elbow. By displacing the surrounding structures, find the tendinous attachment to the tuberosity of the radius (Fig. 3.20A). As the muscle becomes tendinous, it forms a 'tendinous expansion' which passes medially over the forearm flexors to become attached to the deep fascia of the forearm. This expansion is the bicipital aponeurosis . Pull the biceps laterally to display the deeper brachialis muscle arising from the front of the humerus and from the medial intermuscular septum. Follow the brachialis muscle downwards, medial to the biceps tendon, to find its attachment to the coronoid process of the ulna (Fig. 3.20B). The Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limb 33 Finally, identity corocobrachialis running from the tip of the coracoid process to the middle of the humerus (Fig. 3.20C). Draw the limb over the trunk to the opposite side to expose the posterior aspect of the arm. Sever the attachments of the deep fascia to the epicondyles, supracondylar ridges, and the olecranon process, and remove the fascia. This exposes the triceps muscle. Holding the deltoid laterally, identity the three heads of triceps, the long and lateral heads high up and the medial head lower down. Note that they form a short tendon attaching to the olecranon process (Fig. 3.21A). A few deep fibres are attached to the capsule of the elbow joint. These fibres constitute the articularis cubiti muscle. The triangular anconeus muscle may be regarded as a distal continuation of the lateral fibres of the medial head of triceps. It is attached above to the lateral epicondyle, and below to the lateral surface of the olecranon and the back of the ulna (Fig. 3.21B). B A FIGURE 3.21 SUPERFICIAL STRATUM OF TRICEPS (A) AND ANCONEUS (B) 3.6.3 The Deep Neurovascular Components of the Arm On the medial side of the biceps lies the neurovascular bundle of the arm consisting of the brachial artery, the median and ulnar nerves, and the brachial veins (Fig.3.22). They are enveloped in a 'tube' of fascia. Place the upper limb on an arm rest and keep the elbow slightly flexed to facilitate separation of the structures. Now identity the neurovascular components without distracting them too much. From the termination of the axillary artery at the lower border of teres major, trace the brachial artery down- wards to the level of the neck of the radius or the radial tuberosity. Here it divides into radial and ulnar arteries. In its downward course to the elbow, the artery gives off the profunda (deep) brachii artery, superior ulnar collateral artery, nutrient artery to the shaft of the humerus, and muscular branches. The musculocutaneous nerve lies between biceps and brachialis after emerging from the coracobrachialis muscle. It supplies these three muscles. After emerging through the deep fascia at the lateral edge of the biceps tendon, it continues as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm. The radial nerve crosses the long head of triceps to disappear behind the humerus. The median nerve is initially situated on the lateral side of the brachial artery; at about the middle of the arm it crosses the artery to reach the medial side. It crosses the cubital fossa and then passes deeply to enter the forearm between the two heads of pronator teres.

Release the tension on flexor carpi radialis and brachioradialis to allow them to assume their normal positions. Identity the radial artery and follow it over the surface of pronator teres to the medial border of brachioradialis. It follows the tendon to the wrist from where it pursues a course into the hand to form the deep palmar arch. During its course it gives off numerous branches: the radial recurrent artery arises near the elbow, between brachialis and brachioradialis, supplying them and the elbow joint, and also forms an anastomosis with the profunda brachii artery; the muscular branches to the radial side muscles; and near the wrist it gives off the supeiftcial palmar artery and the anterior and posterior carpal arteries. The superficial palmar artery usually completes the superficial arterial arch with the ulnar artery. At the lower end of the forearm, the radial artery lies upon the anterior surface of the radius where the 'clinical pulse' is felt. At the elbow, the ulnar artery lies deeply under flexor carpi ulnaris and on the surface of flexor digitorum profundus. At the wrist, it rises to the surface lying medial to the nerve and the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris. Here, it passes over the flexor retinaculum to enter the palm of the hand, forming the superficial palmar arch. In the forearm it gives the: â¢ anterior and posterior recurrent arteries, which pass upwards in front and behind the medial epicondyle, supplying the surrounding muscles, the elbow joint and forms an anastomosis with the ulnar collateral and supratrochlear arteries (Fig. 3.31); â¢ common interosseous artery, a short channel arising opposite the radial tuberosity, which splits to form the anterior interosseous artery and the posterior interosseous artery. â¢ muscular branches to the surrounding muscles; â¢ anterior and posterior carpal arteries which anastomose with the branches of the radial artery. Once again return to the elbow to follow the radial, ulnar and median nerves into the forearm. Locate the ulnar nerve between the two heads of flexor carpi ulnaris. It descends between flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus, supplying these muscles. In the lower half of the forearm it lies lateral to flexor carpi ulnaris, just deep to the fascia. Displace the upper part of bra chi or adia lis laterally from brachialis to locate the radial nerve. Here, the nerve gives off a branch to brachioradialis. Opposite the lateral epicondyle or a little below, the nerve divides into superficial and deep branches. The supeiftcial branch is easily followed to the wrist because it lies first upon supinator and then on the deep surface of brachioradialis. About 10 cm above the wrist it emerges from under the tendon on to the posterolateral aspect of the forearm from where it supplies the ball of the thumb and the back of the index, middle and one half of the ring finger. The deep branch of the radial nerve dips into the substance of supinator and passes around the lateral aspect of the radius to reach the back of the forearm. Tease away the fibres of supinator to follow the nerve posteriorly to where it becomes the posterior interosseous nerve. The Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limb 43 Between the fingers are webs, with that between thumb and index being the largest. Flex the joints at the base of the fingers and place a pencil between the index and middle fingers, against the web, to discover that the web is not at the base of the finger but about halfway along the proximal phalanx. The nail, which covers approximately half of the terminal phalanx, is modified hair. At the base of the nail is the nail-root which consists of a fold of skin with a superficial part, the eponychium, and a deep part, the hyponychium. The nail grows (at a rate of about lmm per week) from the depth of this fold. Between the nail and the posterior surface of the bone is the nail-bed to which the nail itself is firmly attached. From the distal end of the nail-bed to the attachment of the deep fascia is a fat-filled pocket known as the pulp of the finger. It is divided into smaller pockets by fibrous trabeculae passing from the dermis to the periosteum of the bone. (see Fig 3.38A p.47). Examine the bones of an articulated hand. Note that there are three sets of bones in the hand. These are, from proximal to distal: â¢ 8 carpal (wrist) bones set in two rows, proximal and distal (Fig. 3.32). The proximal row, from lateral to medial, contains the scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum and pisiform (sesamoid) bones; the distal row, from lateral to medial, contains the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and hamate. â¢ 5 metacarpal (palm) bones distal to the carpal bones. The first (thumb) metacarpal is short and stout and articulates with the trapezium; the remaining four may be classified as short-long bones, each having a base which articulates with the distal row of carpal bones, a shaft which is bowed posteriorly, a neck and a head. The middle metacarpal is the longest of the four. â¢ phalangeal (finger) bones, there are two phalanges in the thumb and three in each of the remaining four fingers. In each finger there is a proximal, middle and distal phalanx decreasing in dimensions distally. radius --------------------- ------------ head of ulna ----0-0-000-000000 hamate trapezoid i i capitate FIGURE 3.32 THE RADIOCARPAL JOINT As is evident there is a multiplicity of joints between all these bones and this lends versatility of movement to the hand. If the fingers have become flexed during the embalming process, it is advisable to fasten them to a board with small nails or tacks through the finger tips. With the fingers and thumb 'spread-eagled' on the board, continue the lateral incision along the back of the thumb, over its tip to the first web, and then along the outer edge of the index finger, over its tip to the second web. Continue in this fashion until the incision reaches the distal wrist crease on the ulnar side of the hand; reflect the skin to expose the deep fascia of the palm. When removing the skin from the proximal part of the hypothenar eminence, it might be possible to see the fibres of the palmaris brevis muscle, arising from the palmar aponeurosis and inserting into the skin of the region. The Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limb 47 Having cleared the arch and its branches, search for the nerve supply to the fingers. This comes from the ulnar and median nerves. Identify the ulnar nerve as it enters the hand; it divides into deep and superficial branches on or just distal to the retinaculum. Follow the supeificial nerve and note that it gives a branch to palmaris brevis, and then, in company with the superficial palmar arterial branch, it divides into two, one branch supplying the medial side of the little finger and the other to the adjacent sides of the little and ring fingers (Fig. 3.37). The deep branch passes medially to supply the hypothenar muscles, the medial two lumbrical muscles and the interosseous muscles. Now proceed more laterally to identify the branches of the median nerve, the muscular branch and the common palmar digital branch. The latter divides into palmar digital nerves, and on reaching the webs, they divide into proper palmar digital nerves to supply the contiguous surfaces of the thumb, index, middle and ring fingers (Fig. 3.37). 3.9.3 The Flexor Tendons of the Fingers Identify the flexor tendons of the fingers as they emerge from under the flexor retinaculum. Note that they are covered with a thin membrane, the synovial sheath. A little further distally, the tendons appear to be bare and then, at a slightly lower level, they are covered again by synovial sheath, which persists into the fingers. To follow the tendons completely it may be necessary to divide the arteries and nerves, but keep them intact if possible. If the flexor synovial sheaths are filled with radio-opaque liquid and radiographed, the appearances resemble those shown in Fig. 3.38. The sheath around the tendon of flexor pollicis longus is the radial bursa, and that around the little finger is the ulnar bursa. Both these bursae pass under the flexor retinaculum, and they frequently communicate with one another. They are of clinical importance in infections of the fingers. Since all the fingers have essentially the same construction, it is necessary to dissect only one, and this should be the middle finger which is the largest. rommoo'ca\"o, betw'\" mdlal ~d \"'oa, b\"rnae ........... J synovial sheath of flexor pollicis longus 00- / (radial bursa) digital synovial sheath ----------- FIGURE 3.38 SYNOVIAL SHEATHS OF THE HAND AND FINGERS _____ common synovial sheath of flexors (ulnar bursa) The core of the termination of the finger is formed by the bony terminal phalanx, which is covered by periosteum except at its proximal end which is covered by hyaline articular cartilage. In its development, it has an epiphysis at its proximal end and it is to this segment of the bone that tendons are attached. The extensor expansion of the finger is attached to the posterior surface, and the flexor digitorum profundus to the anterior portion. The deep fascia of the finger is also attached at this point. Carefully isolate the palmar digital arteries and nerves and follow them to the terminal phalanx. The tendons, covered with synovial sheath, lie between them. The synovial sheaths allow smooth 48 Practical Anatomy movement of the tendons. The sheath is reinforced with fibrous tissue over the proximal and middle phalanges forming the fibrous flexor sheaths. These sheaths are 'pulleys' to prevent bow-stringing of the tendons when they contract over the flexor surfaces. Beginning at the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint, split the synovial and fibrous flexor sheaths along the entire length of the finger. This exposes the tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus. Note that both tendon and sheath are smooth, glistening and wet. Trim away the sheaths on both sides to fully expose the tendons. At the upper end of the proximal phalanx or even above, the superficial tendon splits into medial and lateral bands on either side of the profundus tendon. Follow the medial and lateral bands to their insertions on the edges of the middle phalanx. Likewise, follow the profundus tendon to its termination at the base of the terminal phalanx. After dividing the synovial sheath and studying the attachment of the tendons, lift them out of the sheath to find the vincula tendinum. The vincula are like tiny mesenteries of synovial membrane which convey minute blood vessels to the tendons. 3.9.4 Thenar Muscles The thenar muscles are contained within the thenar eminence which overlies the base of the thumb. They are part of the mechanism which makes the thumb a special and essential functional unit of the hand. The muscles are arranged in three layers which are relatively easily separated from one another. Abductor pollicis brevis, the most superficial of the three, has an origin from the flexor retinaculum, and also from the scaphoid and trapezium carpal bones. The muscle fibres converge into a short tendon which contains a lateral sesamoid bone and inserts, together with that of flexor pollicis brevis, into the anterior surface of the proximal phalanx of the thumb (Fig. 3.39A). Flexor pollicis brevis lies partly beneath abductor brevis, and takes origin from the lateral end of the flexor retinaculum; it has the same insertion as abductor pollicis brevis (Fig. 3.39B). The muscle may be crossed by the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery to complete the superficial palmar arterial arch. The tendon of flexor pollicis longus emerges from under it, on its way to attach to the base of the distal phalanx of the thumb. Opponens pollicis is the deepest of the three muscles, and may be displayed by flexing the metacarpophalangeal joint to slacken the two superficial muscles and then retracting them. Opponens pollicis is seen arising from the flexor retinaculum and the adjacent trapezium. The fibres pass obliquely laterally and downwards to insert, under cover of the abductor into the lateral side of the first metacarpal shaft (Fig. 3.39C). All three of these muscles are supplied by the muscular (recurrent) branch of the median nerve. FIGURE 3.39 ABDUCTOR POLUCIS BREVIS (A), FLEXOR POLUCIS BREVIS (B) AND OPPONENS POLUCIS (C) 50 Practical Anatomy 3.9.6 The Deep Palmar Structures Identify the median nerve as it passes into the carpal tunnel. Pass the handle of a scalpel into the tunnel superficial to the nerve and divide the retinaculum completely in the centre by cutting down on to the handle. If necessary, remove a wide segment of the retinaculum to create a gap. Cut the median nerve about 2cm above the retinaculum and pull it downwards through the gap, using scissors to release it from its surroundings. Divide the superficial arterial arch in the centre and, turning the parts medially and laterally, pull the median nerve through that gap, releasing the branches as it goes. Identify the tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis in the lower forearm and tether them together with a tape surround. Divide the tendons above the tape. Using the tape as a retractor, pull the tendons downwards through the gap in the retinaculum using scissors to separate them from the profundus tendons by snipping through the synovial sheath and surrounding areolar tissue. Pull the tendons down as far as the webs of the fingers, leaving the profundus tendons intact and in their normal position. This procedure exposes the four lumbrical muscles attached to the flexor digitorum profundus tendons. Each muscle arises from the lateral side of the relevant tendon. Follow the lumbrical muscles downwards to the webs and note that each is surrounded by a sleeve of areolar tissue forming.a lumbrical canal. The two radial lumbrical muscles are supplied by the median nerve, the two ulnar lumbricals by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. Pass a tape around the tendons of flexor digitorum profundus above the wrist and tie them into a bundle. Cut the tendons above the tape. Pull the tendons downwards through the gap in the retinaculum down to the level of the webs. This procedure clears to a large extent, the carpal tunnel. Elevation of the profundus tendons exposes the deep palmar arterial arch, the adductor pollicis muscle, the interosseous muscles and the tendons of the wrist flexors. The tendon of flexor pollicis longus remains in the tunnel. At the level of the metacarpophalangeal joints, the deep transverse metacarpal ligament is evident (Fig. 3.41). radial artery .. ---------------------------------- ---------- deep branch of ulnar artery ---------- deep palmar arch ---------- 4th palmar interosseous oblique head of adductor poliicis -------------------- ---------- 4th dorsal interosseous transverse head of adductor poliicis --------- --- 3rd dorsal interosseous 1 st dorsal interosseous i deep transverse metacarpal ligament radialis indicis artery FIGURE 3.41 THE FLOOR OF THE PALM The deep palmar arterial arch extends from the radial artery, crosses the bases of the 2nd to 5th metacarpal bases and ends by joining the deep branch of the ulnar artery under opponens digiti minimi. The radial artery appears in the palm by passing between the oblique and transverse heads of adductor pollicis after penetrating between the two heads of the first posterior interosseous muscle. The arch gives off: The Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limb 51 â¢ three peiforating branches which pass through the dorsal interossei to anastomose with dorsal metacarpal arteries; â¢ three palmar metacarpal arteries which join the common palmar digital branches of the superficial palmar arch, near the webs. The deep branch of the ulnar nerve runs deep to the flexor tendons, in the concavity of the deep palmar arch. It supplies all eight interossei, the two ulnar lumbricals, and adductor pollicis. Define the surface of adductor pollicis. The oblique head has its origin from the palmar surface of the capitate bone and the adjacent ligaments, while the transverse head is attached to the anterior surface of the 3rd metacarpal (Fig. 3.41). The two heads join to be inserted into the medial aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. There is usually a sesamoid bone at the insertion of the muscle. It is supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. The four anterior (palmar) interossei muscles lie between the metacarpal bones. The muscles insert into the bases of the proximal phalanges, the lateral two into the medial surfaces and the medial two into the lateral surfaces (Fig. 3.42). They are supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. The anterior interossei adduct the two radial and two ulnar digits towards the middle finger. In the hand the middle finger is regarded as the axis for abduction and adduction. The posterior (dorsal) interossei muscles abduct the fingers from the middle finger axis. These four muscles each arise by two heads from the adjacent sides of the metacarpals. The two ulnar dorsal interossei are attached to the ulnar sides of the proximal phalanges of the 3rd and 4th fingers, the two radial dorsal interossei are attached to the radial sides of the 2nd and 3rd fingers. Finally, follow the flexor tendons of the wrist to their attachments. flexor carpi ulnaris -------------- ----------------- --------------- ------ ---- flexor carpi radialis -------------- palmar interossei dorsal interossei ---------------- ----- FIGURE 3.42 THE INTEROSSEOUS MUSCLES OF THE HAND 52 Practical Anatomy DEEP PALMAR MUSCLES Origin Insertion Action Innervation Lumbricals 1 st and 2nd: radial side of the tendons Each lumbrical is attached to the Flexes the proximal Two radicallumbrica/s of flexor digitorum profundus of the radial side of the extensor phalanx and assists in supplied by median index and middle fingers respectively. expansion of the corresponding extending the distal two nerve. 3rd and 4th: adjacent sides of the finger. phalanges.

Remove the skin from the back of the hand and fingers. The fingers should remain relatively straight. IdentifY on the back of the wrist the sloping extensor (posterior) retinaculum which extends over the thumb tendons on the lateral aspect of the forearm (Fig. 3.43). Begin by identifYing the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and the superficial muscles attached to its posterior surface. This is the common extensor origin. Separate the muscle bellies from one another and follow their tendons downward (Fig. 3.44). The most lateral muscle is brachioradialis, followed by extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi radialis brevis. The next muscle, extensor digitorum, arises from the lateral epicondyle and from a septum between it and extensor carpi radialis brevis; at the wrist it flattens and divides into four tendons which pass under the extensor retinaculum. Extensor carpi ulnaris and extensor digiti minimi arise at a point adjacent to anconeus. Extensor carpi radialis longus is supplied directly from the radial nerve.

Place the elbow in extension and cut a large window in the anterior capsule to expose the interior of the joint. Flex and extend the elbow and rotate the radius to see the movements within the joint. Note the synovial lining. Peel away the capsule to demonstrate the anular ligament of the radius which holds the head of the radius in the notch of the ulna (Fig. 3.49). The ligament has a downward extension which is attached to the neck of the radius as a pocket which contains synovial membrane. anular ligament ........ ~~~~J FIGURE 3.49 THE ANUIAR UGAMENT The capsule is relatively thin at the front and back and is streaked with longitudinal and oblique fibres which are referred to as the anterior and posterior ligaments. The medial ulnar collateral ligament is a more robust group of fibres which attaches to the medial epicondyle and fans out into two bands, one attaching to the olecranon (the posterior band), the other attaching to the coronoid process (the anterior band). The space between the two bands is bridged by a transverse band (Fig. 3.S0A). The space between the anterior and posterior bands gives access to vessels supplying the interior of the joint .

The apex is joined to the lateral epicondyle, the base to the anular ligament (Fig. 3.50B). All the large nerves which cross the joint give twigs to it - ulnar, musculocutaneous, median and radial nerves. The Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limb 61 In the carpometacarpal joints, the proximal ends of the metacarpals are locked into the distal row of carpal bones and are held in place by anterior and posterior ligamentous bands. The carpometacarpal joint of the thumb is a separate joint with saddle-shaped articular surfaces to permit the wide range of movements of the digit. The joint is a synovial joint with a capsule and lateral and medial ligaments. The carpometacarpal joint of the little finger is of a similar construction to allow for opposition of that finger. 3.12.5 The Finger Joints The metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints have a similar construction. They are all synovial joints with capsules and collateral ligaments. Anteriorly, the capsules are reinforced with palmar ligaments and posteriorly the capsules are fused with the elements of the extensor expansion. Examine the joints of the middle finger in which the tendons have been dislocated. Cut the tendons off at their distal attachments. Carefully dissect away the synovial sheath and the fibrous flexor sheaths to display the underlying palmar ligaments. Passing around the sides of the finger, remove the overlying soft tissue to display the joint capsule of the proximal interphalangeal joint, with its collateral ligaments (Fig. 3.54). palmar li:::,igament strong attachment of palmar ligament: : loose attachment of palmar ligament to base of proximal phalanx i i to neck of metacarpal proximal phalanx: : i : : metacarpal i~ i--/{ ~A0ii~ y , , , ' , interphalangeal joints i i extensor expansion extensor tendon FIGURE 3.54 THE JOINTS OF THE FINGERS Note that the attachment of the ligament is towards the back of the distal end of the proximal bone so that when the joint is flexed, the ligament becomes tight. This arrangement lends stability to the joint in flexion, by fixing the distal bone to the proximal. Try this exercise on a living model: straighten the index metacarpophalangeal joint and note how easily the finger may be moved laterally and medially at the joint. Now, flex the joint passively and rotate the finger. The metacarpal must necessarily rotate with it because it is fixed by the ligaments . ,. ,. i . ......... ,.\" FIGURE 3.55 COLLATERAL UGAMENTS OF THE METACARPOPHALANGEAL AND INTERPHALANGEAL JOINTS Chapter Four The Thorax The thorax (chest) is located between the root of the neck and the abdomen. The upper limit of the thorax is called the cervicothoraac inlet. Since the thorax is continuous with the abdomen, it may be regarded as part of the trunk. The thorax is separated from the abdomen by the musculotendonous diaphragm. Examine an articulated skeleton. The front of the thorax consists of the sternum and adjacent costal cartilages, the sides consist of the ribs, and the back consists of the vertebral column and the 'angles' of the ribs. The sternum consists of the manubrium to which the clavicles, and 1st and 2nd costal cartilages are attached, the body to which the 2nd to 7th costal cartilages are attached, and the xiphisternum to which the 7th costal cartilage is partially attached. The sternal components are sometimes referred to as sternebrae, with the manubrium being labelled as 1, the body being composed of 2 to 5 and the xiphisternum being number 6. There are 12 ribs on either side; the upper 10 are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum, while the 11 th and 12th have no sternal attachment. The upper 7 ribs are attached directly to the sternum by costal cartilages and are called true ribs; ribs 8, 9 and 10 attach to the rib above, i.e., rib 8 attaches by cartilage to 7, 9 attaches to 8, and 10 attaches to 9. These are calledfalse ribs. Ribs 3 to 10 have more or less the same configuration and may be called typical ribs, while ribs 1, 2, 11 and 12 are atypical ribs. A typical rib is composed of an oval shaft which has a costal sulcus (groove) on the undersurface. The anterior end of the shaft is rough and hollow for the attachment of the costal cartilage. It curves smoothly backwards until, at the back, the curvature becomes more acute forming the angle. A short distance further, there is a tubercle with a smooth articulating facet that articulates with a similar one on the transverse process of the relevant vertebra. Beyond this, the rib becomes narrow, forming the neck. The rib terminates with a slightly bulbous head which has an articular facet with upper and lower faces separated by the crest of the head. These faces articulate with demifacets of adjacent vertebral bodies. The 1st rib has all the general features of a typical rib but is modified in size and shape because of its position and relations. It has a broad and flat shaft, with the curvature angulated laterally rather than posteriorly. The upper surface of the shaft is grooved. The neck is long and narrow, and the head is small with a single facet. 64 Practical Anatomy ~ ............................. external intercostal membrane FIGURE 4.2 EXTERNAL INTERCOSTAL MUSCLE AND MEMBRANE Carefully remove the external intercostal membrane and the muscle backwards for about 20cm to expose the internal intercostal muscle. The fibres of the internal intercostal muscle run downwards and laterally, in the opposite direction to the external muscle. The muscle begins at the border of the sternum and extends backwards to about the angle of the ribs, where it becomes converted to a membrane, the internal intercostal membrane (Fig. 4.3). membrane muscle oooooooooooooooooooooo 00000000 FIGURE 4.3 INTERNAL INTERCOSTAL MUSCLE AND MEMBRANE Carefully cut away the internal intercostal muscle, preserving the nerves, to expose third muscle layer, the intimal intercostal muscle (Fig. 4.4). The muscle is often very thin or even absent, and thus is not easy to find. It is much more likely that the parietal pleura, the thin and almost transparent membrane lining the thoracic cavity, will be encountered. The pleura is fairly firmly adherent to the deep surface of the ribs. FIGURE 4.4 INTIMAL INTERCOSTAL MUSCLE AND SUBCOSTAL MUSCLE The Thorax 65 It is not necessary to dissect more than one intercostal space on either side. It is necessary, however, to ensure that all the soft tissue is removed from the outer surfaces of ribs 2 to 7, to beyond the midaxillary line, in preparation for the cutting of the ribs which takes place in that line. 4.1.1 The Sternocostal Joints Dissect the costochondral junction of the 4th rib. The costochondral junction has a slightly thickened capsule covering it, which is reinforced by radiate sternocostal ligaments on the posterior and anterior surfaces of the sternum. The fibres of the radiate ligament of the 4th costal cartilage radiate from the cartilage to the 2nd and 3rd sternebrae. Cut into the capsule to enter the joint and note that the presence of a synovial cavity. In the elderly, the costal cartilages may undergo calcification and ossification, and the joints may fuse. This renders respiration more difficult. Study a bony rib on the cadaver. Note that is covered with a membrane, the periosteum. Make a longitudinal incision into the membrane and, using the handle of a scalpel, strip it from the surface of the rib. Note that the envelope surrounds the bone completely. The periosteum consists of two layers: an outer fibrous cover and an inner layer consisting of special cells which have a pluripotential nature. They are special in the sense that under particular circumstances they may 'produce bone' or are osteogenic, and under other circumstances they may 'remove bone' or are osteoclastic. As a result of these properties, the periosteum is said to be responsible for the 'moulding' of bone, especially after fractures. Wolff's Law states that the shape and structure of a bone is related to the forces applied to it. The production and resorption of bone by the cells of the inner deep layer of the periosteum are responsible for reshaping. All bones are covered with periosteum and, in life, the bone receives a considerable part of its blood supply from the periosteal vessels. The nutrient artery which enters the bone through the nutrient foramen supplies mostly the bone marrow contained within the bone, although there is an anastomosis between the outer and inner supplies. Extend the incision over the costochondral junction to the costal cartilage and note that membrane is continuous on to the cartilage. It is now referred to as the perichondrium. 4.1.2 The Neurovascular Components There are twelve pairs of thoracic nerves. The anterior primary rami of T1-11 are called intercostal nerves; the anterior primary ramus ofT12 is the subcostal nerve. Each intercostal nerve enters the space anterior to the internal intercostal membrane, and runs forwards in the plane between the 2nd and 3rd muscle layers (Fig. 4.5). At the angle of the rib it enters the costal sulcus, below the intercostal artery and vein. The intercostal nerves 1-6 reach the sternum by travelling along the spaces between the ribs. At about the angle of the rib, the intercostal nerve gives off a collateral branch and a lateral cutaneous branch. The collateral branch runs forwards in the lower part of the intercostal space, and ends by either rejoining the upper (main) intercostal nerve, or as an additional anterior cutaneous 66 Practical Anatomy intercostal nerve external intercostal muscle, -------------------------- anterior cutaneous branch : external intercostal membrane FIGURE 4.5 COURSE AND DISTRIBUTION OF AN UPPER INTERCOSTAL NERVE nerve. Near the sternum the upper intercostal nerve turns forwards, piercing the various muscle layers, and ends as the anterior cutaneous nerve of the thorax. The posterior intercostal arteries accompany the nerves and veins. The arteries of the upper two spaces are derived from the subclavian artery; those of the succeeding nine spaces are the branches of the descending thoracic aorta. Near the front end of each space the posterior intercostal artery anastomoses with an anterior intercostal artery derived from the internal thoracic artery. Most of the right posterior intercostal veins drain directly into the vena azygos, while the lift posterior intercostal veins reach the vena azygos via the hemiazygos or the accessory hemizygos veins (Fig. 4.6). right braChiOi::,cePhaliC vein supreme intercostal vein i i left brachiocephalic vein .: I , ~i~~ ________________ supreme intercostal vein supenor vena cava -----------~--~---(~~------~-1-----------left superior intercostal vein , \" vena azygos -----------;-~\\J- : nght supenor Intercostal vein --------------77-= 4 or 4 5 6 8 5 8 h ' , 9 ( 1 emlazygos vein ----------;~-~------------------- ~o \"boo,tal 'e;\"------\"-~ II i~~---~~---------subcostal vein right ascending lumbar vein -----------------------~\\~ ~ ------------------------ left ascending lumbar vein :1,J: right renal vein iii left renal vein inferior vena cava FIGURE 4.6 DRAINAGE OF THE POSTERIOR INTERCOSTAL VEINS 68 Practical Anatomy ------------------- internal thoracic artery --------------------- transversus thoracis ----------- ------- superior epigastric artery --~----------- musculophrenic artery FIGURE 4.8 TRANSVERSUS THORA CIS ON THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF STERNUM AND COSTAL CARTILAGES The internal thoracic artery has been called the 'anterior life-line' of the body. The posterior life- line is the aorta and, when it is occluded, the internal thoracic artery takes over by numerous anastomotic channels to provide blood to the lower reaches of the body. The internal thoracic artery is a branch of the first part of the subclavian artery. It runs down on the surface of the pleura after passing deep to the subclavian vein. Thereafter, it lies behind the costal cartilages, about 1cm from the sternal margin. It ends behind the 6th costal cartilage by dividing into the superior epigastric and musculophrenic arteries. Between the successive cartilages, it gives perforating branches through the intervening muscles to the skin and anterior intercostal branches laterally into the intercostal spaces. These m ay be paired, and they anastomose with the anterior ends of the posterior intercostal arteries from the aorta. The venae comites join just below the level of the 1st rib to form the internal thoracic vein which enters the brachiocephalic vein of the relevant side. Dissect a low intercostal space from the interior, to demonstrate the neurovascular bundle lying in the costal sulcus and note again that the relationships are vein, artery and nerve from above downwards. Note the intercostal nerve and the posterior intercostal artery and vein, which form the intercostal neurovascular bundle. These lie for the most part in the costal sulcus, but as they proceed anteriorly, they become more exposed because the sulcus becomes more shallow. Using a pair of sharp forceps, carefully separate the three elements of the bundle and note that their relationships are vein, artery, nerve from above downwards. In several of the spaces, a collateral branch of the nerve may be seen running in the lower part of the intercostal space. Trace the bundle backwards, noting that it comes to lie between the internal intercostal membrane and the intimal muscle (Fig. 4.5). Below the 8th intercostal space the intimal intercostal muscle layer becomes more obvious and may cover one or more ribs and spaces on their inner aspects. This is the subcostal muscle (Fig. 4.4), and is homologous with transversus abdominis. 4.4 TIlE PLEURAL SACS With the anterior thoracic wall laid back upon the abdominal wall, view the thoracic contents. The pericardial sac lies in the middle, with the lungs situated on either side. IdentifY the diaphragm below and note that it separates the thorax from the abdomen. The Thorax 71 4.5.1 The Lung Root Pull the anterior edge of the right lung laterally to expose the lung root. Holding the lung in this position, divide the lung root with a sharp knife close to the mediastinum. Remove the lung from the thoracic cavity, dividing any tethers to avoid tearing the lung. Remove the left lung in the same way. Examine the cut surfaces of the lung roots and note that they are' comma-shaped'. The roots are surrounded by pleural membrane and numerous fine nerves (pulmonary plexus). The pulmonary ligaments form the downward elongation of the commas. The left root is a 'mirror-image' of the right. Identify and compare the positions of the structures in the roots (Fig. 4.12): â¢ the bronchus (air tube) is always the most posterior structure in both roots and may be identified by its hardness due to the presence of hyaline cartilage; â¢ the most anterior structure in the root is the pulmonary artery; and â¢ the inferior structures are the superior and inferior pulmonary veins. position of superior lobe '. bronchus on right side .. ::::......... 0:''':-; p\"'mo,\",>, art''>''6;;;;''';~'' . main bronchus --------------_~--@ superior pulmonary vein -------------- \\_\\J j i \" ---- \\ i' inferior pulmonary vein --------------- A 1 pulmonary ligament ---------------------- - FIGURE 4.12 COMMON PATTERN OF LUNG ROOTS There are, inevitably, variations in the positions of the arteries and veins. The right root may have two bronchi lying posterior to the pulmonary artery; the upper one is called the eparterial bronchus, and the lower one is called the hyparterial bronchus. This situation is explained by the fact that the right main bronchus is shorter than the left main bronchus (Fig. 4.15), and if the right root is cut at the same distance from the mediastinal surface as the left, then the right main bronchus will have divided while the left, being longer, will not yet have divided. There are also lymph nodes and branches of the autonomic nervous system in the lung roots. The nodes are part of the tracheo-bronchial and broncho-pulmonary lymphatic system, and the nerves are part of the pulmonary plexus emanating from the cervical sympathetic chain and from the vagus. 4.5.2 Study of the Lungs Examine the lungs and note that they may be speckled with black spots. These are either due to the deceased person having smoked tobacco during life, or to the person having worked in a carbon polluted atmosphere such as in a coal mine. This condition is called pneumoconiosis. Place the two lungs together, with the roots facing downwards so that the lateral surfaces may be examined. Both lungs are roughly pyramidal in shape, with the right lung being larger than the left. The lung surfaces are named according to the structures with which they are in contact. The lungs have a broad base (the diaphragmatic surface) which is hollow due to the upward projection of the dome of the diaphragm, and a narrow apex which may be demarcated by a groove produced by the first rib. They also have a convex lateral (costal) surface and a bluntly rounded posterior surface which fits into the angle of the ribs. Both lungs have a sharp anterior edge which overlaps the pericardium to a varying degree. The Thorax 75 When the bronchi have reached their tertiary division they give branches which supply pulmonary segments within the lobes of each lung. Thus, each lung is divided into lobes which, in turn, are divided into bronchopulmonary segments (Fig. 4.15). Each bronchopulmonary segment is 'supplied' with a small bronchus, an artery and one or more veins, lymph channels and nerves. It is important to have a knowledge of the bronchopulmonary segments because when a patient has an accumulation of fluid or blood in the bronchial tree, it is necessary to place the patient in a special position to allow gravity to assist its removal. This is called postural drainage. 4.5.4 The Neurovascular Components The pulmonary arteries supply de-oxygenated blood to the lungs. They arise from the pulmonary trunk. Within each lung, the pulmonary arteries descend posterolateral to the main bronchus, and send branches to accompany the branches of the bronchi. The bronchial arteries supply blood to the connective tissue of the bronchial tree. The two left bronchial arteries arise from the upper part of the descending aorta, and the single right bronchial artery may arise either from the upper right bronchial artery or from the 3rd right posterior intercostal artery. Two pulmonary veins, superior and inferior, convey oxygenated blood from each lung to the left atrium of the heart. The right bronchial vein ends in vena azygos, the left bronchial vein ends in the left superior intercostal vein or the accessory hemiazygos vein. The right and left pulmonary plexuses innervate the respective lungs and visceral pleura. They are mixed plexuses, containing vagal (parasympathetic) and sympathetic fibres. 4.6 THE MEDIASTINUM The mediastinum is the collection of anatomical structures lying between the two pleural cavities. It may be conveniently divided into four parts (Fig. 4.16): â¢ the area above the pericardium, between the suprasternal notch Uugular notch) and the sternomanubrial joint, is the superior mediastinum; â¢ the pericardium and its contents (heart and great vessels) occupy the middle mediastinum; â¢ the anterior mediastinum is the narrow cleft between the pericardium and the anterior chest wall and may contain the thymus gland (or remnants thereof) and â¢ the posterior mediastinum is the interval anterior to the vertebrae and posterior to pericardium and diaphragm. Carefully remove the costal pleura from the ribs by peeling it off around the back and over on to the mediastinum. Go upwards as far as the apical pleura and downwards to the diaphragm. This may be somewhat difficult because of the restricted access to the thoracic cavity. Wipe away the endothoracic fascia with a cloth to expose the underlying structures on the interior of the posterior thoracic wall. Since there is no clearly defined anatomical boundary between the end of the posterior chest wall and the beginning of the mediastinum, this text will regard the position of the sympathetic trunk to be the descriptive boundary of these two regions. The neurovascular structures of the posterior chest wall are included in the description of the mediastinum as their origins fall within the defined boundary. Since the left and right aspects of the mediastinum are asymmetrical, both sides must be examined. 76 Practical Anatomy .......... ______ plane of thoracic Inlet ___ ------ superior mediastinum ________ ----- sternomanubrial plane ----------- anterior mediastinum ------------- middle mediastinum -------- posterior mediastinum ----- diaphragm FIGURE 4.16 DIVISIONS OF THE MEDIASTINUM 4.6.1 Structures in the Right Mediastinum Trace the posterior intercostal arteries backwards to the vertebral column. Note that they disappear over the vertebral surface, to enter the thoracic aorta_ Their attachment cannot clearly be seen from the right side at this stage of the dissection because the thoracic aorta lies over to the left side. Proceed to the posterior aspect of the upper two intercostal spaces and wipe away the endothoracic fascia to expose the intercostal structures. Note that the first two intercostal arteries do not come from the aorta but from the supreme intercostal artery, a branch of the subclavian artery (Fig. 4.17). renal branch or least splanchnic nerve i lesser splanchnic nerve greater splanchnic nerve FIGURE 4.17 MEDIASTINUM FROM THE RIGHT i right superior intercostal vein i 3rd posterior intercostal artery ------------------------------- ----- right brachiocephalic vein ----------------------- left brachiocephalic vein ------------------ superior vena cava ------------------- right phrenic nerve ---------------- pericardium inferior vena cava vena azygos The Thorax 77 Locate the superior vena cava fonned by the fusion of the right and lift brachiocephalic veins. Further down, just above the mediastinal part of the lung root, find the arch of the azygos vein entering the superior vena cava. Follow the azygos arch backwards and downwards to where it forms the azygos vein. Note that the right posterior intercostal veins enter it throughout its entire length. In the same way that the arterial supply to the upper two intercostal spaces comes from a source different from the lower ones, so the venous drainage of the upper intercostal spaces is different from those lower down. The drainage of the 1st space is into the right brachiocephalic vein; that of the 2nd, 3rd and usually the 4th spaces run together to form the right superior intercostal vein which drains into the azygos arch (Fig. 4.17). Continue to reflect the mediastinal pleura until the right phrenic nerve (C3,4,S) is encountered lying upon the right side of the pericardium. The nerve is accompanied by the pericardiacophrenic artery, a branch of the internal thoracic artery. From the pericardium, trace the phrenic nerve upwards to the lateral side of the superior vena cava, until it disappears behind the right subclavian vein, where it enters the neck. Trace the nerve downwards to the diaphragm, and note that it pierces this structure together with the inferior vena cava. The phrenic nerve lies anterior to the lung root. Return to the superior vena cava, and behind it feel the cartilaginous ridges of the trachea with the overlying right vagus nerve. Dissect away the surrounding areolar tissue to expose trachea and nerve, the latter passing deep to the arch of the azygos vein. Now displace the lung root forwards, and feel between the root and the azygos vein a soft structure - this is the oesophagus. Follow the vagus nerve as it emerges below the azygos vein on to the surface of the oesophagus, where it divides into a number of branches, many of which pass to the posterior surface of the oesophagus to fonn the posterior oesophageal plexus. Note that the vagus nerve lies posterior to the lung root. Having dissected the right surface of the mediastinum, it is possible to reconcile the positions of the various structures with the indentations on the medial surface of the right lung (Fig. 4.14). 4.6.2 Structures in the Left Mediastinum Now consider the left surface of the mediastinum. Trace the lift phrenic nerve and accompanying artery downwards to the diaphragm, and note that it pierces this structure through an aperture of its own (c.f the right side). At its upper end, the nerve enters the thorax by passing in front of the left subclavian artery and posterior to the left brachiocephalic vein. Just above the aortic arch it crosses the vagus nerve, and then descends over the aortic arch to reach the pericardial surface (Fig. 4.18). The left phrenic nerve also lies anterior to the lung root. The phrenic nerve is a motor and sensory nerve, the motor part supplying the muscle of the diaphragm including the crura, and the sensory part supplying the diaphragmatic pleura and the peritoneum on the under-surface of the diaphragm. It also has a number of autonomic connections. The vagus nerve crosses the aortic arch and, as it does so, it gives the recurrent laryngeal nerve which turns around the aortic arch and 'recurs' upwards between the trachea and oesophagus to reach the interior of the larynx. The peritoneal supply of the phrenic nerve is of interest because in cases where this part of the peritoneum is irritated by the presence of blood or pus, the patient may exhibit pain in the shoulder-tip, as this area of skin is also supplied by C4 nerve. A classic example is in the case of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. 78 Practical Anatomy left common carotid artery left superior intercostal vein aortic arch -___ _ --- , , o H-l ! : : greater splanchnic nerve iii sympathetic trunk lesser splanchnic nerve i i renal branch of least splanchnic nerve FIGURE 4.18 MEDIASTINUM FROM THE LEFT While the right side of the mediastinum may be called the side of the 'venous arch' because of the azygos vein, the left side may be called the side of the 'arterial arch' because of the presence of the aortic arch and the descending aorta (Fig_ 4.18). The aorta arches over the root of the lung and continues down the thoracic cavity giving off posterior intercostal arteries. It also gives bronchial arteries to supply the lung substance of both lungs_ Note the lift superior intercostal vein as it passes on the lateral side of the aortic arch. The thoracic duct is situated on the lateral side of the oesophagus. Once again, reconcile the structures in the left mediastinum with the indentations on the medial side of the left lung. 4.6.3 Structures Common to Both Aspects of the Mediastinum Use a cloth to wipe away the areolar tissue at the costovertebral junction (i.e. where the heads of the ribs articulate with the bodies of the vertebrae) and find, lying upon the heads of the ribs, a longitudinal strand of nerve tissue with enlargements on it - this is the thoracic sympathetic trunk or chain and the enlargements are ganglia. The trunk usually has eleven ganglia, and gives off lateral and medial branches. By definition, a ganglion is a group of nerve cells lying outside the central nervous system, whereas a nucleus is a group of nerve cells lying inside the central nervous system. Follow the trunk upwards to the head of the 1st rib, to find a large ganglion with numerous branches emanating from it, giving it a 'star-shaped' appearance. This is the so-called stellate ganglion and it is usually formed from a combination of the inferior cervical ganglion and the first thoracic ganglion. The lateral branches connect the ganglia to the intercostal nerves and comprise white and grey rami communicantes. Some of the nerves enter the trunk from the intercostal nerves (preganglionic nerves or white rami), while others leave the trunk (postganglionic nerves or grey rami). 80 Practical Anatomy Clear away all the connective tissue surrounding the fibrous pericardium to determine its extent. It is attached to the diaphragm below, and above, a number of large blood vessels emerge from it. These are collectively known as the great vessels of the thorax. Anteriorly, the pericardium is tethered to the back of the sternum by condensations of areolar tissue called sternopericardialligaments . Pick up the anterior surface of the pericardium near its attachment to the diaphragm and with scissors make a transverse cut through it from one side to the other. At the right and left sides make vertical cuts up to where the great vessels emerge. Lift up the flap thus created to expose the smooth and glistening serous pericardium. The sac may contain some coagulated material (pericardial fluid) which should be removed by sponging with water and wiping dry with a cloth. Examine the outer and inner surfaces of the sac. The serous pericardium has parietal and visceral layers (Fig. 4.19). The smooth visceral layer or epicardium is closely adherent to the heart, while the parietal layer is fused to the fibrous pericardium. Explore the sac by passing the fingers around to the back of the heart, and up to its upper extremity in the front and the back. Note that the parietal serous pericardium becomes continuous with the epicardium (c.Â£ the pleural cavity). These reflections surround the great vessels entering and leaving the heart in the pericardial cavity. There is no 'root' of the heart comparable to the root of the lung. Instead there is an arterial root and a venous root of the heart, i.e. the veins are in one sleeve of reflected pericardium, and the arteries are in another (Fig. 4.19) Lift the heart out of the pericardial sac and note that it is anchored in three places: â¢ at its lower right corner, where the inferior vena cava passes through the diaphragm; â¢ at the back, where the pulmonary veins enter the left atrium; and â¢ at the base, where the superior vena cava enters and the pulmonary trunk and aorta leave. Locate the superior vena cava, the pulmonary trunk and the ascending aorta. Separate the superior vena cava from the aorta and pass the left index finger between the superior vena cava and the aorta and then under the pulmonary trunk.

The finger is in the oblique pericardia I sinus. Reinsert the left index finger into the transverse sinus and note the proximity of the two fingers; they are separated only by a thin membrane (Fig. 4.20). 4.7.2 The External Features of the Heart Fold back the pericardial membrane to view the whole heart. The heart may be regarded as an inverted pyramid. The lower, pointed end of the heart lies upon the diaphragm; this is the. apex. 84 Practical Anatomy venae cavae. Make a vertical incision in the atrial wall about 1,Scm to the left of the sulcus terminalis; clear out any clotted blood. Insert the left index finger into the cavity and up into its left extremity. The finger will enter a small pocket, the right auricular appendage. At the upper and lower ends of the incision make transverse incisions to the right, to create a flap in the atrial wall. Turn the flap outwards and inspect the inner surface of the wall. Find the crista terminalis, the 'inner marker' of the division between definitive atrium and sinus venosus, on the deep surface of the sulcus terminalis. Note that the right and posterior walls are smooth and the anterior wall is rough and muscular due to the presence of musculi pectinati (atrial myocardium). The smooth part has been developed from the sinus venosus, and the rough part from the definitive atrium. IdentifY the apertures of structures entering the atrium: the superior vena cava, the inferior vena cava and the coronary sinus. Note that there are a some folds of endocardium related to these openings - these are embryonic valve flaps. Turn the heart over and locate the lift atrium with its four pulmonary veins. Make a vertical incision through the wall midway between the veins and clear out any clotted blood. Pass the left index finger into the cavity, upwards and to the left; the finger enters the lift auricular appenda$e which is smaller than that of the right atrium. With the finger in situ, rotate the heart to look at it from the front; note that the appendage peeps over the left edge of the pulmonary trunk. Insert the left thumb into the right atrium and locate the interatrial septum between the two fingers. Note that it lies obliquely between the two atria. On its anterior surface feel the shallow depression of the fossa ovalis which is formed from the fusion of the embryonic septa between the two atria. The wall of the left atrium is smooth for the most part, the musculi pectinati being confined to the appendage. Visualise the edge of the fossa ovalis and try to pass a probe between the two fused flaps - in a proportion of cases the probe will pass through into the left atrium indicating that the septum has not completely fused. This does not cause any physiological disturbance unless the opening is overt. Failure of the opening to close completely, or if the atrial septa are too short for complete coverage of the openings, means that the infant is left with an interatrial septal difect. To open the ventricles place the heart on a dissecting board with the left ventricle against the surface of the board, and the right ventricle face up. The first incision is parallel to the anterior interventricular artery, curving down towards the apex of the ventricles. The second incision is parallel to and left of the coronary sulcus, extending to the base of the ventricle (Fig. 4.25). ascending aorta i i / pulmonary trunk :fvY( ./ : -,- : /' 1 / : right ventricle FIGURE 4.25 INCISION LINES FOR OPENING THE VENTRICLES Turn the heart over so that the left ventricle is exposed, and make similar incisions in the wall of the left ventricle. The upper incision is parallel to the anterior interventricular groove and begins close to the atrioventricular sulcus and extends to the apex of the ventricle. The other incision The Thorax 85 begins with the first, and runs parallel to the atrioventricular sulcus to reach the base of the ventricle (Fig. 4.25). Again, make sure that the entire thickness of the ventricular wall has been cut through. Open the two 'ventricular flaps' to expose the interior of the ventricular cavities and carefully clear out any clotted blood making sure not to damage the internal structures. Note that the left ventricular wall is at least twice as thick as the right ventricular wall; this tends to make entry into the left ventricle somewhat more difficult than entry into the right. Place the right thumb in the right cavity and the right index finger in the left cavity - note that they are separated from one another by the thick interventricular septum. At the very top of the septum, locate the fibrous plaque of the pars membranacea septi, the final embryonic closure point of the ventricular septum. If this part of the septum fails to close the infant is left with an interventricular septal difect. Study the right ventricle. Examine the surface of the flap, and note the coarse muscular bands on its interior. These are the trabeculae carneae. The largest of these bands, the septomarginal trabecula crosses the cavity from the interventricular septum to the wall. The position of this thick muscular band indicates that it is designed to prevent over-distension of the ventricle and has thus been termed the moderator band. When examined microscopically, it is found to contain conducting fibres of Purkinje. Other projections from the apical part of the ventricular wall are the papillary muscles with the fine tendinous bands, the chordae tendineae, which attach to the cusps of the right atrioventricular valve. They are designed to prevent the valve cusps from turning 'inside-out' when subjected to pressure. Pass the left index finger from the right atrium through the atrioventricular valve, and feel around its periphery the strong fibrous ring to which the valve cusps are attached. Do the same on the left side. Note that on the inner sides the fibrous rings are attached to the membranous part of the interventricular septum. This is the fibrous skeleton of the heart. The right atrioventricular valve has three flaps (tricuspid valve) which are attached at their bases to the fibrous ring. With the heart in its anatomical position, note that the flaps are anterior, posterior and septal (attached to the interventricular septum). The free edges of the valve flaps are secured to the heart wall by the tendinous cords via the papillary muscles. Keeping the heart in its anatomical position, open the right atrium and pass the left index finger into the cavity, and then into the right ventricle. Note that this passage is horizontal. Thus, the blood enters the right atrium from above and below (vertically) and leaves it horizontally. Now place the right index finger in the right ventricular outlet (pulmonary conus) and feel the supraventricular crest separating it from the ventricular cavity. The angle between the inflow tract and outflow tract of the right heart is normally about 55-60 o. Turn the heart around to examine the lift ventricular cavity. Open the myocardial flap and note the presence of trabeculae carneae as well as a number of delicate muscular bands crossing the cavity. These are the lift trabeculae septomarginales which contain the conducting fibres ofPurkinje. After examining the contents, and dividing restraining trabeculae and papillary muscles, cut away the left ventricular wall with a horizontal incision joining the ends of the previous incisions. Pass a finger from the cavity of the atrium to the ventricle through the lift atrioventricular valve. There are only two major flaps attached by their upper ends to the fibrous skeleton, the lower ends being attached to the papillary muscles by chordae tendineae. They are in anterior and posterior positions, the anterior being close to the interventricular septum and therefore sometimes called the septal cusp. This bicuspid valve has been likened to a bishop's mitre (hat) and is frequently referred to as the mitral valve. To see the left inflow-outflow angle, pass the right index finger from the left atrium through the mitral valve and into the left ventricle. Insert the left index finger up along the aortic outflow channel which is directly next to the interventricular septum. Note the the angle is very narrow. 86 Practical Anatomy 4.7.5 The Flow of Blood Through the Heart The heart is a 'double muscular pump', the myocardium providing the motive force while the valves are responsible for the uni-directional flow. The ventricles contract and relax, driving the blood out in spurts. The blood comes in through the atria to the ventricles when the atrioventricular valves are open and the ventricles are relaxed; when the ventricles contract these valves are forced by pressure to close and the blood is forced out through the pulmonary trunk and aorta. When the ventricles relax again, the high pressure in the outflow channels could result in blood flowing back into the ventricles. To prevent this, there are valves in these tracts which close in response to the pressure changes. These valves are visible by looking into the open ends of the pulmonary trunk and aorta. Clear out any coagulated blood or other detritus which may be present in these vessels and note that there are three flaps (cusps) in each, and when closed (as they usually are) they obstruct the entire lumen of the channels. These are the aortic and pulmonary semilunar valves. Note also that they are in a special relationship to one another and this is brought about by their embryonic development. The developing truncus arteriosus, which gives rise to the pulmonary trunk and the ascending aorta has four endocardial cushions (Fig. 4.26a). The spiral septum of the truncus splits the right and left cushions into anterior and posterior halves, so that each comes to possess a right and left cusp. The pulnlOnary trunk subsequently comes to lie to the left of and anterior to the ascending aorta, but its cusps retain the name, right, left and anterior. The ascending aorta also retains the names, right, left and posterior (Fig. 4.26c). R I G H T truncus arteriosus: (a) POSTERIOR (b) ANTERIOR aorta (c) FIGURE 4.26 DIAGRAM TO EXPIAIN NOMENCIATURE OF ARTERIAL CUSPS L E F T The free edges of the flaps are thickened, and in the centre of the thickening is a small knot, the nodule; on either side of this, the thickening is slightly curved forming the lunule. Locate the openings of the coronary arteries into the aorta. These openings are strategically placed in the sense that when blood is being forced out of the aorta, the valve flaps close off the coronary openings to prevent loss of pressure into these vessels. At the same time, the myocardial vessels are compressed by the contracting myocardium, so that blood would not be able to enter them. When the myocardium relaxes, its blood vessels are released from compression, the aortic semilunar valve closes and the coronary arteries are subjected to the full force of aortic pressure. Thus, the heart is supplied with blood during ventricular diastole. 4.7.6 The Great Vessels of the Thorax The aorta is the systemic arterial trunk that carries oxygenated blood to all parts of the body. It is divisible into the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending aorta. The ascending aorta arises from the upper end of the left ventricle (Fig. 4.22). It runs upwards and to the right within the fibrous pericardium, and emerges from the pericardium to become the aortic arch. The right and left coronary arteries come off the ascending aorta. The aortic arch proceeds upwards, backwards and to the left, across the left side of the bifurcation 88 Practical Anatomy 4.8 THE TRACHEA The trachea (windpipe) is the main conduit conveying air to the lungs. The trachea is continuous above with the larynx. It begins at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage where it is attached by the cricothyroid membrane, at the vertebral level C6 , and ends at the bifurcation into the right and left main bronchi at the level of the sterno manubrial joint (T4-5). It may be divided into a cervical part (discussed in detail when the neck is dissected) and a thoracic part (Fig. 4.29), each of which constitutes about half of its length. In the adult, it is about 12,5cm in length and about 2,5cm in diameter. ----------- -------------------- - trachea -------------------------- pulmonary trunk ------------------------------- oesophagus FIGURE 4.29 THE THORACIC PART OF THE TRACHEA In cross-section it is 'horse-shoe' shaped with a flattened posterior surface which abuts upon the oesophagus. The horse-shoe shape is maintained by a series of about 12 to 15 bars or plates of hyaline cartilage held together by fibrous bands (anular ligaments) which are continuous with the perichondrium. The 'flattened' posterior surface is filled with smooth muscle, the trachealis muscle. The fibres of this muscle are disposed transversely so that on contraction, they are capable of reducing the lumen of the trachea. Since the fibres are of smooth muscle, they will be supplied by the autonomic nervous system. In the thoracic part, define the relations of the trachea: â¢ in front, there is the beginning of the aortic arch, manubrium sterni, above the aortic arch is the left brachiocephalic vein with its thyroid tributaries crossing the trachea; â¢ on the right, the right vagus nerve and the arch of the azygos vein, both covered by pleura; â¢ on the left the trachea is separated from the pleura by the common carotid and subclavian arteries and the vagus and phrenic nerves; and â¢ posterior to the trachea is the oesophagus. With a sharp knife, cut across the trachea about 2cm above the bifurcation. Look downwards into the lumen and note the presence of the carina. This is the antero-posterior bar across the lumen which is on the inside of the bifurcation, and is indicative of the fact that the right and left main bronchi are coming off the trachea. The blood supply of the trachea is from the inferior thyroid artery and the bronchial arteries; the tracheal veins empty into the inferior thyroid plexus. The nerve supply is from the vagus and the recurrent laryngeal nerve which is a branch of the cranial part of the accessory nerve; it supplies the mucosa of the trachea with sensation and is responsible for the cough reflex. 4.9 THE OESOPHAGUS The oesophagus is a narrow fibromuscular tube, flattened anteroposteriorly. It connects the pharynx with the stomach, and is about 25-30cm long. Pass a finger behind the trachea at the bifurcation to separate it from the underlying oesophagus. The Thorax 89 Follow the oesophagus downwards to where it passes through the diaphragm and upwards as far as possible. The oesophagus may be divided into three parts: the cervical, thoracic and abdominal sections (Fig. 4.30). The cervical and abdominal sections will be discussed in detail later . .. -------------------------------- cervical part --------------------------------- thoracic part ------------------- abdominal part FIGURE 4.30 THE OESOPHAGUS The thoracic oesophagus, lying more or less in the midline, enters the superior mediastinum at the level of the 1st thoracic vertebra. It lies behind the trachea and upon the anterior longitudinal ligament of the vertebral column and the longus coli muscles. At the level of the sternomanubrial plane it enters the posterior mediastinum and is crossed by the left main bronchus; just below this the pericardium separates it from the left atrium. At this level it slopes to the left and is separated from the vertebrae by the anterior longitudinal ligament, the thoracic duct, the right posterior intercostal arteries, the hemiazygos and accessory hemiazygos veins, and the descending thoracic aorta. It passes through the oesophageal hiatus of the diaphragm at the level of the 10th thoracic vertebra, about Scm from the midline. The vagus nerves are closely related to the thoracic part of the oesophagus, forming a plexus around it and entering the abdominal cavity with the oesphagus. The oesophagus is lined on the inside with thick stratified epithelium which is thrown up into folds, except when it is distended with food. The epithelium is surrounded by a thin muscularis mucosae which in turn, is surounded by two layers of smooth muscle, an inner circular and an outer longitudinal layer. Beyond this is the tunica adventitia which is continuous with the tissue of the mediastinum. The blood supply of the thoracic oesophagus is from the segmental branches of the descending thoracic aorta, while the general venous drainage is into the hemiazygos systems. The lymphatic drainage is to the posterior mediastinal nodes. 4.10 THE THORACIC DUCT Carefully elevate the oesophagus and search for the thoracic duct under its right border (Fig. 4.18). The duct is a thin and flimsy structure with a beaded appearance. It begins in the abdominal cavity as the cisterna chyli, and passes through the posterior opening of the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity where becomes the thoracic duct. The duct passes upwards between the azygos vein and the right side of the oesophagus until it reaches the 5th or 6th thoracic vertebra, where it passes to the left side over the distance of one or two vertebral bodies. 90 Practical Anatomy It then ascends in the posterior mediastinum and into the neck where it loops to the left behind the carotid sheath and subclavian vein to enter the junction between the internal jugular and subclavian veins. At its termination there is a valve which prevents blood from entering the duct in a retrograde fashion. In its course it receives numerous lymphatic tributaries from lymph nodes in the abdomen, pelvis and lower limbs. In the thorax it receives tributaries from the left mediastinal nodes and from the nodes draining the left side of the head, face and neck. The right lymphatic duct drains lymph from the right side of the head, face, neck and thorax. 4.11 THE DIAPHRAGM On the cadaver, replace the anterior chest wall temporarily to establish the continiuty between the thorax and the abdomen. Turning it downwards again to expose the lower chest, note that the thorax is separated from the abdomen by the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a fibro-muscular septum. Trim away any excess of the pericardium which may be present to expose the central tendon of the diaphragm upon which the heart originally sat. Pass the hands into the recesses at the sides, between the diaphragm and the ribs. The peripheral part of the diaphragm consists of a thin layer of muscle covered with parietal pleura. Follow the muscle downwards to discover that it arises from the internal surfaces of the lower 6 ribs at the sides and back and from costal cartilages towards the front. At the front, it is attached by two narrow slips of muscle to the interior of the xiphisternum. There is a third attachment of the diaphragm to the lumbar vertebral column inside the abdominal cavity, by the crura. These will be seen later. Note also that the phrenic nerves pass through the diaphragm and, in fact, supply it from below. On its upper surface is a network of blood vessels and nerves. The nerves supply sensation to the overlying pleura. 4.12 THE POSTERIOR THORACIC WALL On the right side, insert a finger between the oesophagus and the vertebral column at the level of T2 and separate the oesophagus from the vertebral column for a short distance upwards and downwards. Observe the longus coli muscle situated on the anterior aspect of the bodies of the upper three thoracic vertebrae. Clear away the connective tissue over the vertebral column to reveal the lower tendinous attachment of the muscle. The muscle continues upwards into the neck, and will be studied further during the dissection of the head and neck. The intercostal neurovascular bundle has already been traced backwards from an intercostal space in the midaxillary line to the posterior pleural reflection. On the cadaver, study the costovertebral joints from the front. Each typical rib articulates with the vertebral column at two joints: â¢ the costotransverse joint between the tubercle of the rib and the tip of the transverse process; and â¢ the joint of the head of the rib, where the head of the rib articulates with the upper part of the body of the corresponding vertebra, the adjacent intervertebral disc, and the lower part the vertebral body above. Each joint of the head of the rib has a fibrous capsule, uniting the margins of the articular facets. The fibrous capsule is lined with a synovial membrane. In addition, the radiate ligament of the head of the rib connects from the front of the head to the body above, the body below, and the disc between them. An intra-articular ligament joins the transverse crest on the head of the rib to the disc, dividing the joint cavity into upper and lower compartments. Chapter Five The Abdomen Study a living model and note that the abdomen is in continuity with the thorax. It has a soft anterior wall, soft lateral walls on either side and a hard posterior wall, made up of the central vertebral column covered with skin and muscle. The infrasternal angle is wide, and the abdomen looks as if it is a large region. However, if the lower rib margin and the iliac crest are located, it is discovered that the so- called 'thoraco-abdominal gap' barely admits the width of the palm of the hand. Now study the articulated skeleton and see that in the front the part below the thorax is 'empty' and that the abdominal cavity is supported entirely by the lumbar vertebral column. A further point to note is that the ribs slope downwards and forwards. Place a finger in the 7th intercostal space and trace the space downwards and across to where the anterior abdominal wall would be. The 7th intercostal nerve supplies not only the structures in the 7th space, but also the upper part of the abdominal wall. Do the same with successive spaces and note that the lower nerves also supply segments of the abdominal wall. On the living model, count the intercostal spaces and follow the lower ones on to the abdominal wall; note that the 10th space slopes towards the umbilicus. Thus, the 10th intercostal nerve will supply the dermatome (skin segment) and myotome (muscle segment) containing the umbilicus. It should now be obvious that the abdominal wall is segmented in the same way as the thoracic wall and that the nerve supply of any part of the abdominal wall may be determined from the intercostal nerves, by following their slope on to the abdominal wall (Fig. 5.1). 5.1 THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL Make an incision in the midline, from the xiphisternum to the centre of the symphysis pubis, skirting the umbilicus (Fig. 5.2). Make two further incisions (one on either side) in the midaxillary line extending from the costal margin to Scm below the iliac crest. Elevate the skin and subcutaneous tissue downwards by blunt dissection by pulling it from the underlying deep fascia covering the abdominal muscles. This will display the emerging cutaneous nerves (Fig. 5.3). The fat of the anterior abdominal wall is contained within the superficial fascia (of Camper*), the deep fascia * Pieter Camper (1722-1789), Dutch anatomist and physiCian. 94 Practical Anatomy tendinous intersection rectus abdominis pyramidalis FIGURE 5.4 RECTUS ABDOMINIS AND PYRAMIDALIS attached to the ribs. Identity the 10th costal cartilage on either side and make a transverse incision (in the subcostal plane) through the whole thickness of the abdominal wall at this level. Examine the cross-section carefully noting that the rectus abdominis muscle is surrounded by an aponeurotic tube. Dissect the sectioned sheath carefully and note that to the lateral side there are three flat muscles - the most superficial is external oblique, the next, on its deep surface, the internal abdominal oblique and the deepest is transversus abdominis. Note from the cut edge that each ends in an aponeurosis. It will also be obvious that the aponeurosis of internal oblique splits to enclose ------------------------ fleshy fibres of external oblique linea alba aponeurosis of external oblique intercrural fibres reflex inguinal ligament ------------- inguinal ligament ------- superficial inguinal nng FIGURE 5.5 OBUQUUS EXTERNUS ABDOMINIS 102 Practical Anatomy If any fibres of corrugator cutis ani muscle are visible, follow them into the substance of the sphincter. Although their termination cannot be seen at this stage, they will ultimately reach the outer longitudinal n1.uscle layer of the rectum (Fig. 5.11). Pass a gloved finger into the anal canal to determine if it contains faecaJ material. If so, remove the material by water lavage through a wide bore rubber tube and a funnel. When the returning water is clear, the canal is ready for visualisation. Clean the external surface of the muscle and dissect away the skin internally until mucous membrane is visible. With scissors, cut through the lateral wall of the anal canal until the cut enters the lower part of the levator ani muscle. With an assistant, hold the cut edges apart and examine the internal lining of the canal. The upper lining consists of mucous membrane which is thrown into folds known as the anal columns (Fig. 5.13). Between the columns are grooves which terminate in thin flaps of mucous membrane called anal valves. The 'pockets' thus created are called anal sinuses. The whole arrangement resembles the spikes of an inverted comb and has thus been called the pectinate line . Microscopic examination of the anal sinuses reveals that the ducts of glands lying in the submucous plane open into the sinuses through small depressions, the anal crypts. This arrangement has clinical implications since obstruction and infection of the glands may produce painful abscesses. About lcm below the pectinate line is a smooth area of non-keratinised stratified epithelium (a transitional zone) which ends in whit,ish line - the white line (of Hilton*) (Fig. 5.13). Below this, the lining of the anus is proper skin containing hair follicles, sebaceous glands, sweat glands and other viscera of skin. Because of the embryonic development of the anal canal, it has been likened to an anatomical 'watershed'. The upper part is derived from the hindgut and the lower part from the somatic proctodaeum; these components were originally separated by the cloacal membrane. This membrane normally breaks down to establish continuity between the two parts. Failure of the membrane to break down results in the condition of imperforate anus. The 'watershed' is brought about by the elements of the upper part being different to those of the lower part. Upper Lower Lining mucous membrane skin Muscle smooth striated Arterial blood supply rectal vessels internal pudendal artery Venous damage via the rectal veins into the portal system via the internal pudendal veins to the caval system Nerve supply autonomic, therefore relatively insensitive somatic, therefore very sensitive Lymphatic drainage via the rectal and sigmoid nodes to the paraortic group the inguinal nodes Cancer of the rectum is relatively common. When restricted to the upper part it may spread to the regional and paraortic nodes. If the growth invades the lower part of the anal canal, treatment and outlook for cure are lessened by the involvement of the inguinal nodes. 5.3.2 The Male Urogenital Triangle The spermatic cord consists of two groups of elements - the coverings and the contents. The coverings are best understood by considering the descent of the testis. At an early stage in â¢ James Hilton (1804-1878), English surgeon The Abdomen 103 embryonic development the gonads form in the urogenital ridge. From there they descend into the scrotum, passing through the inguinal canal. In passing through the anterior abdominal wall, the testis negotiates the transversalis fascia and the transversus, internal oblique and external oblique muscles. From each of these it obtains a layer of tissue (Fig. 5.14): â¢ the internal spermatic fascia is continuous with the transversalis fascia; â¢ the cremasteric fascia contains fasciculi of muscle from the conjoined muscles, extending for a variable distance down the cord; and â¢ the external spermatic fascia is continuous with the aponeurosis of the external oblique. aponeurosis of external oblique i conjoint tendon rectus abdominis transversalis fascia i extra peritoneal fat transversus abdominis internal oblique .---- external oblique ---- skin ------------ external spermatic fascia ------------------- cremasteric coat ---------------. internal spermatic fascia ------------- parietal tunica --- ------ visceral tunica testis FIGURE 5.14 SCHEMATIC SECTION OF INGUINAL CANAL AND SCROTUM On the anterior or lateral surface of the spermatic cord lies the ilioinguinal nerve (branch of L 1) which has entered the inguinal canal from the neurovascular plane of the abdominal wall. After identifYing the coverings of the cord, strip them away to find the structures within (the contents). The easiest structure to find is the vas (ductus) diferens. It is recognised by its firm cord- like structure. In close relation to it is the artery to the vas diferens which is a small branch from the inferior vesical artery. Close to these is a sympathetic plexus of nerves. The testicular veins form a plexus (pampiniform plexus) between which lies the testicular artery, a branch from the abdominal aorta. The veins exhibit a difference on the right and left sides; as the spermatic cord passes through the internal ring, the venous plexus reduces to a single vein which, on the right side enters the inferior vena cava high up, and on the left side enters the lift renal vein. Within the substance of the cord lies the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve which supplies the cremaster muscle and the tunica vaginalis testis (see below). Occasionally a remnant of the processus vaginalis may also be present in the spermatic cord. During descent, the testis is accompanied by a tube of peritoneum (processus vagina lis testis) which lies in the anterior part of the cord and covers the anterior surface and sides of the testis. The part of the processus which is in the cord undergoes obliteration and exists only as a fine fibrous strand. 104 Practical Anatomy If part or the whole of the processus remams patent, this predisposes the subject to an indirect inguinal hernia. Examine the skin of the scrotum, noting that it is covered with creases and a certain amount of hair. The creases are due to the underlying smooth (involuntary) muscle fibres of the dartos muscle; this muscle is responsible for the maintenance of a steady temperature within the scrotum by causing thickening or thinning of the wall. It is, therefore, supplied by the autonomic nervous system. The right and left sides of the scrotum are united by a raphe which extends in the midline from the anal verge, over the scrotum to the under surface of the penis. Its presence is due to the union of the embryonic genital swellings. Make a vertical incision through the entire thickness of the scrotal wall on both sides. Identify the testis in both sides of the scrotum and note that the scrotum is divided into right and left sides by a thin but well defined septum. The walls of the scrotum (Fig. 5.14) are continuous with the coverings of the spermatic cord, but are not always easy to define. The tunica vaginalis testis (the remains of the processus vaginalis testis) lies on the surface of the testis. The lower pole of the testis may be attached to the base of the scrotum by a flimsy band of connective tissue, which is said to be the remains of the gubernaculum which draws the testis down into the scrotum. Free the testis from its surroundings and extract it from the scrotum. Open the tunica vaginalis by an incision in its anterior wall (parietal tunica) and explore its cavity. Note that the cavity extends upwards. as far as the lower part of the the spermatic cord and that the tunica encloses the anterior, lateral and medial sides of the testis. Note also that on the lateral side, the cavity passes between the testis and the epididymis forming the sinus of the epididymis. On its posterior surface there is a bulge, the epididymis, which has an enlarged upper end, the head, a middle portion, the body and a lower part the tail (Fig. 5.15). The visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis covers the epididymis as well as the testis. The testis is enclosed in a thick fibrous envelope, the tunica albuginea. . .......... head of epididymis .......... testis .......... body of epididymis FIGURE 5.15 POSTEROLATERAL ASPECT OF TESTIS AND EPIDIDYMIS Dissect out the ductus deferens to note that it emerges from the 'tail-end' of the epididymis. By careful dissection, separate the epididymis from the testis, beginning at the tail and working upwards. At the head of the epididymis expose the tifferent ductules which are the tubes connecting the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis. The separation leaves a bare thickened longitudinal ridge on the posterior surface of the testis called the mediastinum testis. From here fibrous septa radiate into the substance of the gland to join the interior of the tunica albuginea (Fig. 5.16). Finally, make a transverse section through the lower third of the testis itself and examine the septa and the seminiferous tubules with a handlens (Fig. 5.17). Make an incision along the upper surface of the penis, from the region of the symphysis pubis to the end of the prepuce, and reflect the skin laterally around the entire organ. Note that the skin is The Abdomen 105 (Jf.1:fe~i---------- lobule of epididymis mediastinum testis ----::--(Â·~ii~~~ l'_\"\":~~_' _________ ductuli efferentes straight seminiferous tubule --- ~~~~1Jtl(i5~r---------- rete testis convoluted seminiferous tubule ----- -------- duct of epididymis forming body of epididymis tunica albuginea ------- -- ductus deferens FIGURE 5.16 SAGITTAL SECTION OF TESTIS skin dartos and tela ductus deferens FIGURE 5.17 HORIZONTAL SECTION OF RIGHT HALF OF SCROTUM ,\"Xlr\"rn\"\" spermatic fascia cremasteric coat internal spermatic fascia ---------- parietal tunica cavity of tunica visceral tunica sinus of the epididymis ------- body of epididymis attached to the underlying fascia by loose areolar tissue devoid of fat_ This allows the skin to move freely over the penis_ This skin extends over the end of the penis as the prepuce (foreskin) and is attached inferiorly by a frenulum_ In the dorsal midline of the penis identifY the superficial vein lying in the superficial perineal fascia_ At the base of the pendulous part of the penis is the suspensory ligament which is attached above to the front of the symphysis pubis_ The ligament splits to surround the penis, blending with the fascial sheath of the organ. Remove the superficial fascia to expose the strong deep fascial layer surrounding the constituents of the shaft of the penis. Divide the deep fascia in the midline and reflect it sideways to expose the unpaired deep dorsal vein of the penis in the midline, the dorsal arteries of the penis on each side of the vein, and the dorsal nerves of the penis lateral to each artery (Fig. 5.18). Also within the deep fascia are the three elongated erectile bodies, the paired dorsal bodies of the corpus cavernosum, and ventral body of the unpaired corpus spongiosum containing the urethra. The two corpora cavernosa are enclosed in a common fibrous envelope, the tunica albuginea of corpora cavernosa, and are partially separated by an incomplete vertical septum penis. Each corpus cavernosum arises by an elongated crus penis from the bony ischial ramus, just in front of the tuberosity, The lower aspect of each crus is covered by ischiocavernosus (Fig. 5.19). The corpus spongiosum contains the urethra and the arteries of the bulb. Corpus spongiosum expands distally and forms a flange, the glans penis, which fits over the blunt ends of the corpora The Abdomen 107 urogenital triangle (perineal membrane or triangular ligament), the posterior, the anal triangle. Note also that the ischial spines protrude into the anal triangle. Now fix a triangular piece of paper into the urogenital triangle region. This represents the urogenital diaphragm, in which there is one aperture (urethra) in the male and two in the female (urethra and vagina). The impression is created by Figure 5.10 that the perineum is flat. Hold the pelvis in its anatomical postion, i.e. when viewed from the side, the imaginary line joining the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic tubercle (inguinal ligament) is in a vertical position. Note now that the urogenital triangle is tilted slightly upwards while the anal triangle is acutely angled. 5.3.3 Dissection of the Male Perineum Place a wooden block under the sacrum of the supine cadaver and spread the lower limbs as much as possible, but not so far as to damage the adductor muscles. Extend the skin incisions from the inguinal regions around the sides of the scrotum to meet at the raphe. Extend the central incision backwards to reach the anus. The incision should then skirt the anus and end at the tip of the coccyx. With the fingers in the subcutaneous plane, peel the perineal skin away laterally, being particularly careful around the anus where it may be possible to display the radiating muscle fibres of corrugator cutis ani and the circular fibres of the subcutaneous part of the external anal sphincter (Fig. 5.11). The scrotal sac may be completely removed, leaving the testes in position. Remove any fat and tissue to expose the surfaces of corpora spongiosum and cavernosa completely. Over the bulb of the corpus spongiosum identify the bulbospongiosus muscle, the fibres of which pass laterally over the bulb to disappear between bulb and corpus cavernosus (Fig. 5.19). Divide bulbospongiosus in the midline and elevate it completely, noting that it attaches deeply alongside the bulb. Bulbospongiosus is the ejaculatory muscle. It has a three-fold attachment: â¢ posterior fibres. to the perineal membrane; â¢ middle fibres between corpus spongiosum and corpus cavernosum; and â¢ anterior fibres encircle the penis. Coming in posteriorly and on the medial side of bulbospongiosus insinuate the finger between bulbospongiosus and bulb, lifting the corpus spongiosum away from the underlying lower surface of the urogenital membrane. The judicious use of scissors or sharp-pointed scalpel will assist the elevation. If this procedure is performed carefully it is found finally that the bulb is anchored to the membrane by the membranous urethra passing from membrane to bulb. Division of the urethra releases the bulb. On the lateral side of bulbospongiosus, between it and corpus cavernosum find the scrotal and penile branches of the pudendal nerve and internal pudendal artery. With a cloth-covered finger, wipe the surface of corpus cavernosus to expose its fascial covering clearly. Divide the fascia longitudinally to expose the ischiocavernosus muscle which overlies the corpus cavernosus. Follow ischiocavernosus forward to find it blending with the fibrous sheath of the corpora (Fig. 5.20). Follow the nerves and vessels backwards to where they pass deep to a slip of muscle lying across the region. The supeificial transverse perineal muscle attaches to the medial surface of the ischial tuberosity and the perineal body (Fig. 5.19). Pull the proximal part of the penis downwards and divide the sides of the suspensory ligament to release the root of the penis from the under surface of the symphysis pubis. Clear away the fat and 108 Practical Anatomy ------------------------------- glans penis ----------------------------- corpus cavernosum --------------------------------- corpus spongiosum ------------------------------ bulbospongiosus -------------------------- ischicavernosus --------------------- median raphe of bulbospongiosus 111111~I~fl-----------------inferior fascia of urogenital diaphragm ~ (perineal membrane) FIGURE 5.20 MUSCLES OF THE PENIS (INFERIOR ASPECT) areolar tissue to discover that the anterior end of the urogenital membrane stops short of the symphysis, creating a gap through which the nerves and vessels to the shaft of the penis pass. The under surface of the symphysis pubis is supported by the inferior (arcuate) pubic ligament (Fig. 5.10). Now the lower surface of the urogenital diaphragm is completely exposed. The opening of the urethra is obvious, but seek for the small hole through which the arteries to the bulb emerge and two openings for the ducts of the bulbourethral glands. Strip away the corpora cavernosa from the inferior pubic rami on both sides to reveal the attachment of the urogenital diaphragm. Carefully detach the lower thick layer of the diaphragm from the bone and note that above it lies a thin layer of muscular tissue. This muscle consists of two parts: â¢ the external sphincter urethrae muscle, arising from the bone, surrounds the 'membranous' urethra; and â¢ the deep transverse perineal muscle, arising from the bone and inserting into the perineal body (Fig. 5.21). ------------\\----------------------------- deep dorsal vein 111j1~jll~-~--:-.---------------------------membranous urethra -~---- ,,-------------- sphincter urethrae ~~~~-.--~----------deep transverse perineal muscle : perineal body FIGURE 5.21 MALE UROGENITAL DISPHRAGM (FROM BELOW) The bulbo-urethral glands are situated posterolateral to the membranous urethra, embedded in the sphincter urethrae. A slender duct from the bulbo-urethral gland descends through the perineal membrane, to enter the spongy urethra in the bulb of the penis. Remove some of the muscle and note that above it is another thinner layer of fascia. The deep perineal pouch (space) lies between the inferior and superior fasciae of the urogenital diaphragm. The Abdomen 109 The contents of the urogentital space are: â¢ the three muscles comprising the urogenital diaphragm; â¢ the membranous urethra; â¢ the bulbo-urethral glands and ducts; â¢ the internal pudendal vessels and dorsal nerves of the penis; and â¢ the terminal branches of the perineal nerves. 5.3.4 The Female Urogenital Triangle Examine a prepared articulated female pelvis, noting the morphological differences between the male and the female. The differences are primarily intended to facilitate parturition (child-bearing). The differences may be listed as follows: â¢ male generally larger, more robust and with more prominent muscular markings than female; â¢ lumbosacral joint more robust in male than female; â¢ acetabulum larger in male than female; â¢ subpubic angle greater in female than male; â¢ sacrum straighter and more backward tilted in female than in male; â¢ this results in a wider sciatic notch in female; â¢ ischial spines tilted inwards in male and outwards in female. The general arrangement of the female urogenital triangle is the same as in the male. The main points of difference arise from the fact that both the deep and superficial perineal spaces are traversed and divided by the vagina and contain the female homologues of external genitalia: â¢ the clitoris is a diminutive version of the penis; â¢ labia minora (embryonic genital folds) meet to enclose the spongy urethra; â¢ labia majora represent the sides of the united scrotum; â¢ vestibular gland represents the bulbo-urethral gland. With the cadaver lying supine with a block under the sacrum, abduct the thighs as far as possible without damaging the muscles. Note the distribution of the pubic hair over the mons pubis and the outer sides of the labia majora. The urogenital cleft (pudendal or vulvar cleft) extends from the pubis to about 2cm anterior to the anus. The cleft is bounded by the smooth opposed surfaces of the labia majora. They meet anteriorly in the anterior commissure over the pubic prominence. Posteriorly, they diminish in size until they disappear into the surrounding tissues. At the posterior ends, there is a ridge of skin, the posterior commissure. The labia majora consists of fibrofatty tissue continuous with that of the mons pubis. The round ligaments of the uterus end in the labia. Pull the labia majora to the sides to expose two smaller folds of skin, the labia minora. Each labium minus splits anteriorly to enclose the clitoris. Posteriorly they diminish in size and are joined by a small transverse fold of skin called the fourchette (frenulum labiorum). The cavity between the labia minora is the vestibule and contains the orifices of the urethra anteriorly and the vagina posteriorly. Locate the urethral opening and pass a probe along it into the bladder. Pass a gloved finger into the vagina and feel, high up, the cervix of the uterus. Note that in some cases the deceased female may have had a hysterectomy, in which case the cervix will be absent. Two other openings will be found on the labia minora, opposite the posterior edge of the vaginal orifice. These are the openings of the greater vestibular glands (ofBartholin*).

It lies on either side of the vaginal introitus (entrance) and is attached to the urogenital membrane (perineal membrane). Anteriorly, the two bulbs are joined by the commissure of the bulbs. The bulbs consist of erectile tissue and are covered and surrounded by the bulbocavernosus muscles, some fibres of which meet posterior to the vaginal opening and thus constitute the sphincter vaginae. The greater vestibular gland is found as a small 'pea-shaped' structure on the posteromedial aspect of the bulb. Detach the crura and clitoris and remove them to display the urogenital membrane. As in the male, it houses the deep perineal pouch containing the sphincter urethrae and the deep transverse muscle of the perineum. Some of the posterior fibres of sphincter urethrae cross behind the vaginal orifice and some cross between the vagina and urethra and also constitute a form of sphincter of the vagma. During dissection of this region, the nerves and vessels of the perineum will be encountered. They are provided, as in the male, by the pudendal nerve (S 2, 3, 4) and the internal pudendal artery. Substantially, their branches supply the homologous parts supplied in the male. In the male the supeificial perineal pouch is a single potential space beginning in the anterior abdominal wall and extending through the scrotum to end at the posterior edge of the urogenital membrane. In the female, it has the same extent except that in the perineum it is bilateral, being split in the midline by the urethra and vagina. It lies in the labia majora which are the homologous parts of the scrotum. 5.4 THE DEEP SURFACE OF THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL At the lateral edge of the rectus sheath identify the aponeuroses of the three flat muscles. Divide the aponeuroses vertically to the pubis, to expose rectus abdominis throughout its entire length. Separate the external oblique from the internal oblique for a short distance downwards. Continue the separation backwards, noting that external oblique becomes progressively more attached to internal oblique until, at about the midaxillary line, the two are almost inseparable. On the outer surface, note that the external oblique has a posterior free edge. Use a similar procedure to separate internal oblique and transversus. Note the presence of the segmental neurovascular bundles between the two muscle planes. Posteriorly, they are attached to the layers of the thoracolumbar fascia. Locate the anterior superior iliac spine and make an incision through the whole thickness of the 112 Practical Anatomy anterior abdominal wall from the end of the transverse incision to a point about 1 cm behind the anterior superior iliac spine. From this point continue the incision backwards, parallel to the iliac crest for about Scm. Note the attachments of the flat muscles to the iliac crest (Fig. 5.25). LATERAL MEDIAL ....... --------- transversus abdominis -------------.----- internal oblique ---------------- external oblique ANTERIOR FIGURE 5.25 RIGHT IUAC CREST FROM ABOVE, SHOWING ATTACHMENTS OF THE THREE FIAT MUSCLES OF THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL This frees the anterior abdominal wall so that it can be turned downwards as a flap. The abdominal wall is tethered in the midline by the falciform ligament. Lift the abdominal flap to examine the ligament. Divide it at the lower edge of the liver to allow the anterior wall to flap downwards. The deep surface of the anterior abdominal wall is covered with a smooth glistening membrane - the parietal peritoneum. Towards the centre is a puckered scar - the position of the umbilicus. A number of peritoneal ridges or folds converge on it: â¢ the falciform ligament radiates to it from the liver. Feel for the ligamentum teres in the lower free edge of the ligament. The falciform ligament represents the embryonic ventral mesogastrium, and the ligamentum teres represents the remnant of the embryonic lift umbilical vein. â¢ the median umbilical fold emanates from the upper extremity of the urinary bladder. It contains the median umbilical ligament, a fibrous remnant of the urachus, which connected the foetal bladder to the umbilicus. The urachus represents the fibrous remnant of the chorio-allantoic duct of the embryo. â¢ on either side of the median fold are the medial umbilical folds, which contain the obliterated umbilical arteries. â¢ more laterally, locate the smaller lateral umbilical folds containing the inferior epigastric arteries. These do not reach the umbilicus. There are a series of 'hollows' or recesses between the folds: â¢ the supravesical fossae are located between the median and medial folds; â¢ the medial inguinal fossae are between the medial and lateral folds; and â¢ lateral to the lateral fold, are the lateral inguinal fossae. By blunt dissection, elevate the peritoneal membrane from the muscles to find the arcuate line on the posterior surface of the rectus abdominis muscle. Below this line the muscles are devoid of posterior sheath but have the inferior epigastric arteries on their surface. The Abdomen 113 5.5 TII.E PERITONEUM The peritoneum is the smooth glistening membrane which covers all the abdominal viscera and lines the abdominal cavity. The so-called peritoneal cavity or greater peritoneal sac is a potential cavity containing a small quantity of serous fluid. The viscera which appear to be within the cavity are, in fact, outside it. The reason for this is shown in Fig. 5.26 where all the organs originally lie outside the coelomic cavity of the embryo. Because they will be required to move upon one another, they invaginate into the cavity from behind. The invagination may be incomplete or complete, but whatever the case, the organ remains outside the coelomic cavity. When the organ hangs on a band of peritoneum, this is called a mesentery (Fig.5.27). Original state in which all organs lie outside the coelomic cavity FIGURE 5.26 FORMATION OF MESENTERY AND UGAMENTS A Gut tube drops into coelom forming mesentery C Mesentery swings to left resulting in adherence to form splenorenal ligament. Arrows in Band C indicate places of separation to re-establish original mesenteries. FIGURE 5.27 FORMATION OF MESENTERY AND UGAMENTS B Mesentery swings to right with formation of lesser peritoneal sac and adherence of duodenum to posterior peritoneum D Mesentery swings to right (ascending colon) and left (descending colon) with obliteration of posterior peritoneal space so that colon becomes 'retroperitoneal' This matter requires some clarification because there are places where one side of the mesentery fuses with an adjacent part of the peritoneum to obliterate the cleft between them (Fig. 5.27). When this situation occurs, the organ is said to be retroperitoneal in position. It is questionable if this is truly correct as it implies destruction of the two adjacent layer of peritoneum. The Abdomen 115 The small intestine, occupying the central area of the abdomen, is surrounded by the large intestine. Below the small intestine, just above the symphysis pubis, the upper part of the urinary bladder may be seen. Push the small intestine to the left to expose the large intestine (colon) on the right side. At its lower end find a blind pocket, the caecum to which the vermiform appendix is attached. Note also that the termination of the small intestine (terminal ileum) also enters the upper part of the caecum. Follow the ascending colon upwards to the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, where it suddenly turns to the left. This acute bend is called the hepatic flexure. At the hepatic flexure the colon becomes the transverse colon. The transverse colon is suspended from the posterior abdominal wall by the transverse mesocolon. Follow the transverse colon to the left until, again, it takes an acute bend downwards. At this flexure, pass the hand around its left side, to the back. There, feel the firm, almost spherical structure, the spleen. This bend in the colon is called the splenic flexure. Pull the small intestine to the right to explore the remainder of the colon. Follow the colon downwards as the descending colon until it forms a loop which often has an S-shape and is thus called the sigmoid colon. Holding the small intestine upwards, follow the colon into the pelvis. As the termination of the sigmoid colon enters the pelvis, it assumes a more or less vertical and straight shape. This part of the large intestine is called the rectum. The rectum joins the anal canal. Identity the lower pole of each kidney, just medial to the right or left colic flexure respectively. Recall from the study of the thoracic contents that the oesophagus passes through the diaphragm into the abdomen. Displace the lower edge of the liver upwards and pull the stomach downwards to display the abdominal oesophagus. Follow the stomach to the right to where it narrows to form the pylorus and then the duodenum. The spleen lies behind the stomach on the left side, in contact with the diaphragm. With the organs maintained in this position, locate a fragile membrane passing from the lower surface of the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach and the adjoining upper region of the duodenum. This is the lesser omentum (Fig.5.28). The lesser omentum comprises the hepatogastric and the hepatoduodenal ligaments. It is a useful landmark because it contains three important structures which will be dissected later: the bile duct, hepatic artery, and portal vein. Behind the right free edge of the lesser omentum (at the level of the duodenum), locate the epiploic foramen (ofWinslow*). The foramen is the entrance to the lesser peritoneal sac (Fig. 5.28), which lies behind the lesser omentum. Follow the duodenum by palpation over the right kidney and then downwards. This procedure may be difficult as the duodenal loop is retroperitoneal in this position. Release the hold on the liver and stomach and turn the transverse colon upwards to expose the horizontal and ascending parts of the duodenum. Withdraw the coils of the small gut from the upper left quadrant of the abdominal cavity to find the first coil of the jejunum. Follow the jejunum upwards until it comes to an abrupt end at the duodeno-jejunal junction ( or flexure), just to the left of the vertebral column. Follow the jejunum downwards to ileum, with which it merges. The ileum terminates at the ileo- caecal junction in the right iliac fossa. The jejunum and ileum are suspended from the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery. Replace the small intestine, and pull the transverse colon forwards and upwards, putting the mesocolon on the stretch. Palpate the root of the mesocolon where it attaches posteriorly. Feel for an elongated, firm structure, the pancreas, lying more or less transversely across the posterior abdominal wall. The anterior margin of the pancreas is attached to the transverse mesocolon, and the tail passes to the spleen. * Jacob Winslow (1669-1760), Dutch anatomist. 118 Practical Anatomy â¢ the largest recess is the splenic recess, extending leftwards to the hilum of the spleen; â¢ the inferior recess , of varying size, extends between the layers of the greater omentum (Fig. 5.28); and â¢ the small superior recess, passing upwards behind the caudate lobe of the liver. As is evident from Fig. 5.28, the upper surface of the pancreas lies immediately posterior to the vestibule of the lesser sac. In the condition of acute pancreatitis or of trauma to the pancreas, irritative enzymes from the organ may cause inflammation in the lesser sac, with obstruction of the omental foramen. This may ultimately result in a chronic accumulation of fluid in the lesser sac and is known as a pseudocyst of the lesser sac. Identity the boundaries of the omental foramen: â¢ anteriorly, the structures in the right free edge of the lesser omentum; â¢ posteriorly, the inferior vena cava; â¢ superiorly, the caudate lobe of the liver; and â¢ inferiorly, the upper surface of first. part of the duodenum. Tilt the lower edge of the liver upwards and note again the lesser omentum with its right free edge. With the right index finger in the omental foramen and the thumb on the anterior surface, palpate the structures in the right free edge. Then, with an assistant holding the liver edge upwards , pick up the peritoneum covering the right free edge and with a sharp blade incise it over its entire length. Burrow into the free edge to expose the three enclosed structures: â¢ the bile duct is on the right side of the group and is usually stained green in colour. â¢ the hepatic artery is on the left side of the group and runs more or less parallel to the bile duct until it veers to the left towards the lesser curvature of the stomach. â¢ the portal vein lies posterior to the bile duct and hepatic artery. The region of the porta hepatis and the structures in the free edge of the lesser omentum have been dubbed by surgeons as 'tiger country'. This is because these structures are easily damaged in surgery. Damage to the bile duct may result in a stricture (narrowing) which predisposes the patient to lifelong jaundice. The large blood vessels are difficult of access and difficult to repair if they are damaged. 5.8 THE LIVER The liver is a large organ of reddish-brown colour, located mostly under cover of the diaphragm. The inferior edge of the liver crosses the subcostal angle (epigastrum) in an oblique direction. For descriptive purposes the liver has four surfaces: â¢ the superior surface constitutes the whole area related to the diaphragm, except the bare area. It shows two convexities with a central depression accommodating the pericardium and heart which is above the diaphragm; â¢ the anterior surface is triangular in shape, with the base on the right side, and the apex being the tip of the left lobe. The anterior and superior surfaces are connected to the anterior abdominal wall and diaphragm by the falciform ligament. The Abdomen 119 â¢ the posterior suiface is the bare area which is devoid of peritoneum. It is attached directly to a corresponding surface of the diaphragm. â¢ the inferior (visceral ) suiface faces downwards and backwards. This surface shows the lobes, fissures and structures of the organ (Fig. 5.31). falciform ligament left triangular ligament --.--. gastric (body) impression ----- __ _ fissure for ligamentum ---------------- venosum ligamentum teres gastric (pyloric) impression gallbladder j FIGURE 5.31 VISCERAL AND POSTERIOR ASPECTS OF LIVER .-------------------------- inferior vena cava ---------- bare area ------ suprarenal impression --------- renal impression -------------- right triangular ligament duodenal impression Divide the structures in the right free edge of the lesser omentum transversely through their middle. Retract these upwards and downwards to expose the inferior vena cava posteriorly. Divide this as high up under the liver as possible. This may present some difficulty as it is usually filled with clotted blood. Pass the hand over the superior surface of the liver and divide the falciform ligament attaching the liver to the diaphragm. As the division is carried backwards, the left and right layers of the ligament diverge: the right-going layer forms the upper layer of the coronary ligament, and the left-going layer forms the left triangular ligament (Fig. 5.31). Identify the inferior vena cava as it comes through the diaphragm, a little to the right of the midline. Divide the vena cava close to the upper surface of the liver. Continue to pull the liver forward to display the lower layer of the coronary ligament; divide it. By progressively going manually around the liver and breaking or cutting the surrounding attachments, the liver, along with the gallbladder, and the embedded section of the vena cava, may be removed from the abdominal cavity. The liver is divided into four lobes (Fig. 5.31): â¢ the falciform ligament divides the liver into unequal right and left lobes; â¢ the gallbladder, porta hepatis and fissure for ligamentum teres demarcate the quadrate lobe; and â¢ the inferior vena cava, porta hepatis and fissure for ligamentum venosum demarcate the caudate lobe. The caudate lobe has a small caudate process (tail) which connects the lobe to the right lobe. The posterior and inferior aspects of the liver may now be fully examined. Within the bare area is a groove or sulcus for the inferior vena cava. The sulcus is often bridged by liver tissue (pons hepatis). To the left of the sulcus is the caudate lobe, and to the left of this is deep fissure for ligamentum venosum. The fissure indicates the posterior division of right and left lobes. The cleft of ductus venosus passes deeply into the liver, between caudate and left lobes. Its layers enclose the upper part of the lesser omentum gastrohepatic omentum. Deep within the cleft is the obliterated ductus venosus (ligamentum venosum). 122 Practical Anatomy 5.10 THE ABDOMINAL OESOPHAGUS The abdominal oesophagus enters the abdomen by passing through the right crus of the diaphragm. It is covered with peritoneum in front and on the left; the right edge merges with the lesser curvature of the stomach. It enters the stomach at the cardio-oesophageal junction. 5.11 THE STOMACH The stomach may present a variety of shapes, depending upon its contents when death occurred. The stomach has five named parts: â¢ the cardiac part receives the abdominal oesophagus; â¢ largest part is the body (corpus ventriculi) â¢ the fundus , the bulge on the upper region of the body, is demarcated from the abdominal oesophagus by the cardiac notch; â¢ the pyloric part comprises the pyloric antrum and canal; and â¢ the pylorus, by which the stomach communicates with the duodenum. The anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach meet along a short concave border on the right, the lesser curvature of the stomach, and a long convex border on the left, the greater curvature. The lesser curvature, a sloping continuation of the abdominal oesophagus, ends at the angular notch. The greater curvature terminates in a shallow indentation, sulcus intermedius, near the lower end of the stomach (Fig. 5.34). cardiac notch ...................... ~ o\",oph\"\"\\ ' _____ ~~=~~\\ ............... fundus cardiac part .................................. . ........................... body lesser curvature ........................... . . ...... greater curvature angular notch \"\" pylorus \" '\" pyloric canal ...............

These attachments are called ligaments, but they are, in fact , folds of the greater omentum and of the peritoneum. 5.11.1 Vascular and Lymphatic Components of the Stomach Each curvature of the stomach has two main arteries, one coursing along the curvature from right to left, the other from left to right to anastomose with the former. On the lesser curvature are the 126 Practical Anatomy Replace the duodenum in its normal position. With scissors, open the second part along its right border. Holding the tube open with forceps, note that the mucous membrane lining is thrown into folds. In the upper and lower regions the folds tend to be horizontal, while on the medial wall in the region where the bile duct enters, the rugae tend to be vertical. Carefully separate these rugae to find a projection, the greater duodenal papilla. This is the point where the bile duct enters the duodenum. About 2cm above the papilla, locate the lesser duodenal papilla, the opening of the accessory pancreatic duct. Insert a flexible probe into the cut end of the bile duct, so that it emerges through the opening in the papilla. Cut down on to the probe with a sharp knife to cut through the duodenal wall, papilla and wall of the bile duct. Examine the interior of the duct system with a handlens. 5.13 T~ PANCREAS The pancreas is an exocrine (pancreatic juice) and endocrine (insulin and glucagon) organ situated retroperitoneally in the upper abdomen. The lobulated organ is soft and pale in colour; it is about 12-15cm long. There are five named regions: â¢ the head lies in the duodenal loop; â¢ the neck is the narrow part crossing the superior mesenteric vessels; â¢ the body lies to the left of the mesenteric vessels and crosses the left kidney to reach the hilus of the spleen; â¢ the tail is the narrow part of the body in the splenic hilus; and â¢ the uncinate process passes behind the mesenteric vessels (Fig. 5.38). Push the stomach upwards and pull the transverse colon downwards to place the upper leaf of the transverse mesocolon on the stretch. Carefully divide this membrane along its entire length to expose the upper surface of the pancreas from head to tail. Define the relations of the pancreas: â¢ the head lies in the duodenal loop and is therefore related to all four duodenal parts; â¢ the anterior surfaces of the neck and body lie posterior to the lesser peritoneal sac; â¢ the lower surfaces of the neck and body are related to the jejunum; â¢ the posterior surface is completely retroperitoneal with the head lying upon the inferior vena cava, right crus of the diaphragm, aorta and renal vessels. The neck covers the mesenteric vessels and portal vein. The body covers the abdominal aorta, the left crus of the diaphragm, left renal vessels, the left kidney, and left suprarenal gland. The splenic vessels pass to the left along the upper border of the pancreas. 5.13.1 Neurovascular Components The arterial supply to the pancreas is from: the gastroduodenal artery which divides to form the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery, gIvmg posterior and anterior arcades; â¢ the itiferior pancreaticoduodenal artery from the superior mesenteric artery; and â¢ the pancreatic branches of the splenic artery. The pancreatic veins drain into the splenic and superior mesenteric veins. Carefully dissect out the splenic vein from the body of the pancreas and follow it into the superior mesenteric vein. The pancreaticoduodenal veins drain into the superior mesenteric vein. There are lymph capillaries in the exocrine portion, but not in the endocrine portion. These The Abdomen 127 follow the blood vessels to end in the pancreaticoduodenal and preaortic nodes related to the superior mesenteric vessels. The nerve supply is via the autonomic plexuses on the arteries, emanating from the coeliac plexus. 5.14 THE SPLEEN The spleen is a solid organ about the size of a fist. Its size and shape may vary in life because it contains contractile components (myocytes and smooth muscle) and elastic tissue. The convex diaphragmatic suiface fits into the concavity of the diaphragm opposite the 9th, 10th and 11 th ribs on the left side. The concave visceral suiface is moulded on to the stomach, left kidney, and splenic flexure of the colon along with the phrenicocolic ligament (Fig. 5.40). The long axis corresponds to that of the 10th rib. The spleen has a notched superior margin, and a smooth inferior surface. The hilus is a fissure on the inferomedial part of the visceral surface and lies in the long axis of the spleen. It transmits splenic vessels and nerves, and gives attachment by its anterior and posterior lips to the gastrosplenic and splenorenalligaments respectively (Fig. 5.35). posterior extremityÂ·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â· inferior margin ____________ J ........ hilus -------- gastric surface renal surface ------------- -------- notch in superior margin pancreatic impression --------------------- colic surface ........................... . -------------- anterior extremity FIGURE 5.40 VISCERAL SURFACE OF SPLEEN Before removing the spleen, consider the embryonic development of the organ. The spleen develops in the posterior mesentery of the stomach, and with the rotation of the stomach and the formation of the lesser sac, it slides to the left. In this way it comes to overlie the developing left kidney, which is covered with peritoneum. The peritoneum covering the spleen fuses with that over the kidney; the posterior peritoneum becomes continuous with that over the spleen, forming the splenorenal ligament. Pass the right hand along the left side of the descending colon, in an upward direction, to reach the spleen. On reaching the spleen, pass the hand around it to find the indentation between the spleen and the left kidney. With a scalpel, divide the peritoneum in the indentation. Insinuate the fingers between the spleen and the kidney to separate the two. This procedure recreates the dorsal mesogastrium, in which the spleen originally developed (Fig. 5.41). Divide the phrenico colic ligament and pull the spleen and left colic flexure to the surface. This is, in fact, the way the surgeon 'delivers' the spleen when a splenectomy is to be performed. The spleen is 'delivered' by recreating its original mesentery. Carefully examine the exposed spleen. The peritoneal covering (serous coat) of the spleen overlies the fibrous coat (true capsule), which sends trabeculae into the splenic substance. The trabeculae form a reticulum enclosing the splenic pulp. The blood vessels enter and leave the trabeculae at the hilum, and in this way are distributed to the pulp lying between the trabeculae. There are a few non-striated myocytes in the capsule and trabeculae. 130 Practical Anatomy liver -------- gallbladder -------------------- caecum .----- _______ _ appendix ------ rectum ------------------------- anal canal -------------------------- _--- stomach spleen ---- coeliac trunk (foregut artery) ------- pancreas -------- superior mesenteric artery (midgut artery) ------------------ inferior mesenteric artery (hindgut artery) FIGURE 5.43 DIAGRAM OF THE MAIN AREAS SUPPUED BY EACH OF THE THREE ARTERIES OF THE GUT Display the superior mesenteric vein and its tributaries, which accompany the artery and its branches. The vein lies on the right side of the artery. Remove a 15cm segment of jejunum and a similar segment of ileum in order to examine their minute structure. The removal should be done between ligatures to avoid contaminating the abdominal cavity. Open the segments lengthwise; wash out any contents and examine the interior and cut edges. Note the structures as follows: â¢ the mucous membrane is thrown up as circular folds, plicae circulares; â¢ using a handlens, see that the mucous membrane has numerous villi on its surface; â¢ there are usually small, 'whitish' aggregations of lymphatic tissue between the plicae circulares; â¢ removal of the mucosa reveals a layer of soft areolar tissue, the submucosa; â¢ beneath the submucosa is a layer of circular smooth muscle; â¢ the outer serosal layer consists of a thin layer of visceral peritoneum. 5.16 THE HEPATIC PORTAL VENOUS SYSTEM (Fig. 5.44) This is a special system of veins which drains the gastrointestinal tract from the abdominal oesophagus to the upper part of the anal canal. Since the liver, biliary apparatus and pancreas are embryonic derivations of the foregut, they too, drain into the portal system. A portal system of veins is one which begins and ends in a capillary bed. The spleen, although it is not to be regarded as part of the digestive system, has an embryonic association with the stomach and also drains into the portal system. There are a few variations of the anatomical arrangements of the portal system: â¢ the cystic vein drains into the right portal branch; â¢ the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal veins drain directly into the portal vein; The Abdomen 133 The hepatic flexure lies on the lower part of the right kidney and the descending part of the duodenum. In front and above it is in contact with the colic impression on the right lobe of the liver. The transverse colon extends between the hepatic and splenic flexures. It is slung from the transverse mesocolon, and hangs downwards with its surface against the anterior abdominal wall. The greater omentum is attached to its anterior taenia, and the transverse mesocolon to its superior taenia. The greater part of its blood supply comes from the middle colic branch of the superior mesenteric artery. The right extremity is covered by the right lobe of the liver, the left extremity is covered by the stomach (Fig. 5.47). ---- ------- transpyloric plane (L 1-L2) - - ------ subcostal plane (L3) -- ---- anterior superior iliac spine A FIGURE 5.47A ABDOMINAL PLANES (ADDISON'S UNES) liverÂ·Â·-- gallbladder ----- ascending colon transverse -- colon terminal ileum caecum o stomach ------ costal margin ~--.,J;~:;q;~~~ ------ splenic flexure B descending colon --;1'-----10---\\--- space occupied by small intestine sigmoid colon ------- rectum FIGURE 5.47B ApPROXIMATE POSITIONS OF ABDOMINAL ORGANS IN RELATION TO TRANSVERSE AND VERTICAL PLANES The splenic flexure lies on the lower part of the left kidney and the diaphragm, behind the stomach and below the lower pole of the spleen.

From above downwards, it lies on the left kidney, quadratus lumborum, iliacus and psoas major. Posteriorly, it is crossed by the subcostal vessels and nerve, by the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves, the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh, femoral nerve and genitofemoral nerve as well as the gonadal vessels. Anteriorly, it is mostly in contact with the anterior abdominal wall, although it is sometimes separated from it by coils of small intestine. Follow the bowel inferiorly to identity the loop of the sigmoid (pelvic) colon. This part may require extraction from the pelvic cavity. In the male it occupies the rectovesical space and in the female, the recto-uterine space. Lift the sigmoid loop up to see its attachments to the pelvic wall (sigmoid mesocolon). The mesocolon has the shape of an inverted 'V', the limbs of which are attached to the pelvic walls. The medial limb of the 'V' passes to the midline, while the lateral limb extends for a variable distance along the left pelvic brim. When the mesocolon is relaxed, the two walls fall together, creating the intersigmoidal recess, which faces downwards and forwards (Fig. 5.49). left triangular ligament lower layer of coronary omental foramen FIGURE 5.49 PERITONEAL REFLECTIONS ON POSTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL superior recess of lesser sac oesophagus left gastropancreatic fold splenorenal ligament phrenicocolic ligament root of transverse mesocolon ureter inferior mesenteric artery The rectum commences at the rectosigmoid junction. It is distinguished from the sigmoid by its lack of mobility. The upper third is partially invested with peritoneum anteriorly and laterally, the middle third anteriorly only, and the lower third lies below the peritoneal reflection and is, therefore, devoid of a peritoneal covering. The lower third follows the curvature of the sacrum, and ends below the level of the coccyx by becoming continuous with the anal canal. 5.17.1 Neurovascular Components The proximal part of the large bowel - caecum, appendix, ascending colon and two-thirds of the transverse colon - is supplied by branches of the superior mesenteric artery. The superior mesenteric artery has already been dissected and described. The distal part of the large bowel - left third of the transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid The Abdomen 135 colon and rectum - is supplied by the iriferior mesenteric artery (Fig. 5.48). The inferior mesenteric artery arises from the aorta at about the level of the body of L3. It is surrounded by the inferior mesenteric sympathetic plexus. The first branch is the lift colic artery, which in turn splits into an upper branch joining the left (marginal) branch of the middle colic artery, and a lower branch which forms a series of arcades and marginal arteries for the descending colon. Near the sigmoid loop the artery gives off two or three sigmoid arteries. Each divides into ascending and descending branches which contribute to the marginal artery. The inferior mesenteric artery continues downwards as the superior rectal artery. The artery further divides into anterior and posterior branches around the rectum. These arteries form an anastomosis with the inferior rectal artery, a branch of the internal pudendal artery. The inferior mesenteric vein begins as the continuation of the superior rectal vein. It leaves the sigmoid mesocolon to enter the retroperitoneal plane, ascending in that plane, medial to the left ureter and crossing over the left gonadal vessels to pass behind the pancreas, where it joins the splenic vein. The tributaries correspond to the branches of the artery. 5.18 THE RETROPERITONEAL SPACE All the dissected organs should now be removed. Pull the stomach downwards to obtain the full length of the abdominal oesophagus. Apply two ligatures to it and divide it between the ligatures. Divide any remaining tethers to the stomach. Follow the pylorus to the elevated duodenum which, together with the head of the pancreas should be carefully elevated from the underlying right kidney. It may also be necessary to divide the coeliac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery to release the pancreas. At that time, divide any tethers to the hepatic flexure of the large intestine and divide the vessel entering the ascending colon on its medial side. Carry the dissection to the left, releasing tethers as the dissection proceeds. Divide the vessels entering the medial side of the descending colon to release it completely. At the sacral promontory, elevate the sigmoid colon and pass two ligatures around it. Divide the sigmoid colon between the ligatures. Remove the released organs. The central structures of the retroperitoneal space are surrounded by tough elements of the autonomic nervous system. It is important to remove the nerves carefully lest underlying structures be damaged. Carefully cut away the plexiform mass of fibres around the aorta as it emerges between the diaphragmatic crura. The exposure and 'cleaning' of the central structures requires time and care. It should be noted that since all of the abdominal viscera contain smooth muscle, this will be driven by autonomic nerves. Likewise the glands will be driven by autonomic nerves. 5.19 THE KmNEYS The kidneys are surrounded by a fine areolar membrane, the renal fascia (of Gerota*) containing varying quantities of fat. Deep to the fatty layer, the kidneys are covered by a finely adherent proper capsule (Fig. 5.49). The fat-laden fascia is said to support the kidneys, although the support may also be due to pressure by surrounding structures. If the transversalis fascia is followed from front to back, the kidneys and suprarenal glands lie in this layer (the organ layer of the body). Peel away the surrounding fascia to expose the anterior surface of the kidneys and suprarenal glands. The right kidney lies at a slightly lower level than the left kidney. The kidneys are normally * Dumitru Gerota (1867-1939). Romanian surgeon.

The glands are soft, yellowish bodies about 4cm long situated at the upper pole of each kidney (Fig. 5.53). The right suprarenal lies close to the inferior vena cava, while the left is away from the aorta. The lower part of the left suprarenal gland is covered by the tail of the pancreas. The greater part of the right gland is related to the caudate lobe of the liver, while the left is related to the posterior wall of the stomach. The glands often have a triple arterial supply - from the superior suprarenal artery (off the inferior phrenic artery), the middle suprarenal artery (off the aorta), and the inferior suprarenal artery (off the renal artery). The venous drainage is different on the two sides; on the right the gland drains by a short vein directly into the inferior vena cava, while on the left it drains into the left renal vein (Fig. 5.53). 138 Practical Anatomy right greater splanchnic nerve coeliac ganglion : superior suprarenal artery inferior phrenic artery ::: ' : : left suprarenal gland / middle suprarenal artery suprarenal vein suprarenal vein inferior suprarenal artery \"\" FIGURE 5.53 THE SUPRARENAL GLANDS 5.19.2 Neurovascular Components of the Kidney Study the right and left renal vessels noting that they are backed by bone (the vertebral column). This explains their relationships; since the vessels are backed by bone which is unyielding, the low pressure channels (veins) must be anterior to the high pressure arteries, otherwise they would be compressed and obliterated between high pressure structures (arteries and bone). The right and lift renal arteries arise from the aorta a short distance below the superior mesenteric artery. Each is surrounded by sympathetic fibres arising from the coeliac plexus. The arteries enter the hilum of the kidney between the veins and renal pelvis; occasionally one or two accessory renal arteries may be present. Each renal artery gives off a suprarenal branch and a few ureteric branches before dividing into renal branches in the hilum. The renal veins on each side are formed from tributaries within the hilum. The veins enter the inferior vena cava on both sides, the left crossing the aorta (Fig. 5.50). The left vein also receives the lift suprarenal vein and the lift gonadal vein. Lymph from the kidneys drains into the coeliac and paraortic lymph nodes. The renal innervation is supplied by autonomic fibres from the coeliac and renal plexuses, and is mainly vasomotor in function. 5.19.3 The Structure of the Kidney and Ureter Separate the suprarenal gland from each kidney but do not remove it. Burrow behind each kidney to release it from its posterior bed and clear away any adherent fat from the kidney. Turn the kidney medially on its pedicle to observe the renal pelvis (of the kidney) on the posterior surface. The pelvis emerges from the hilus as a dilatation, but soon narrows to form the ureter passing downwards (Fig. 5.54). Make a small hole in the pelvis of the ureter from behind and pass a probe into the ureter. Turn the kidney back into its normal position and identifY the ureter from the front, using the probe as a guide. Trace the ureter down the posterior abdominal wall until it crosses the bifurcation of the common iliac artery. It lies on psoas major and the genitofemoral nerve. On the left side, the inferior mesenteric arterial vessels lie medial to the ureter throughout its course, so the arterial branches must cross the ureter to reach their destinations. The inferior mesenteric vein lies lateral to the ureter. On both sides, the gonadal vessels lie over the ureter. The The Abdomen 139 renal column ! cortex ,/\" pyramid (part of medulla) ------ ------------- minor calyx --------------- major calyx ------------- pelvis of kidney ------ ureter FIGURE 5.54 LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF KIDNEY ureters are supplied by a network of autonomic nerves fibres emanating mainly from plexuses surrounding the gonadal vessels. Hold the right kidney with its lateral edge facing anteriorly, and divide the kidney capsule with a scalpel from top to bottom. Peel the capsule off the kidney in a medial direction. Note that it passes over the hilar margins and lines the sinus of the kidney. The capsule also becomes continuous with the adventitia of the vessels and the renal pelvis. Make a longitudinal incision through the kidney from its lateral border to the sinus, splitting it into anterior and posterior portions. Examine the cut surface using a handlens. The pale cortex forms the external one-third of the organ, and the darker medulla forms the inner two-thirds. The medulla consists of about 20 pyramids with the apices projecting into the renal sinuses as the renal papillae. Between the pyramids are 'rays' of tissue, the renal columns. The renal pelvis forms 2-3 major indentations, the major calyces, each of which divides into 2-3 minor calyces (Fig. 5.54). 5.20 THE ABDOMINAL AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM The major parasympathetic nerves leave the thorax and enter the abdomen with the oesophagus as the anterior and posterior vagal trunks. The sympathetic trunks leave the thorax and enter the abdomen by passing under the medial arcuate ligament and coming to lie in the groove between psoas major and the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae. The splanchnic branches of the thoracic sympathetic trunk enter the abdomen by passing through the fibres of the crura of the diaphragm to converge on the coeliac (semilunar) ganglion around the coeliac arterial trunk. The coeliac plexus is a conglomerate of sympathetic and parasympathetic (from the vagi) fibres. In general, fibres reach the various organs by forming plexiform branches along the feeder arteries. Thus, these plexuses are continued along the hepatic, gastric, splenic, suprarenal, renal, and superior mesenteric arteries. The main plexus continues downwards as the aortic plexus, and gives off fibres along the inferior mesenteric artery. At about the level of the body of the 5th lumbar vertebra, the superior hypogastric plexus is formed from the lower aortic branches which are reinforced by branches from the lumbar ganglia. The inferior hypogastric plexus is formed in the curvature of the sacrum; it surrounds the rectum and pelvic viscera, being reinforced by fibres from the pelvic splanchnic nerves (S 2, 3, 4). 140 Practical Anatomy 5.21 THE ABDOMINAL AORTA The abdominal aorta begins in the midline at the level of the body of the T12, by passing under the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm. It passes downwards, slightly to the left of the vertebral column, to the level of the 4th lumbar vertebrae, where it divides into right and lift common iliac arteries. The branches of the abdominal aorta may be classified as paired or unpaired (Fig. 5.55): â¢ the paired branches are inferior phrenic, middle suprarenal, renal, gonadal, lumbar arteries (four on each side), and common iliac; â¢ the unpaired branches are coeliac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, and the median sacral artery. ! superior mesenteric artery coeliac trunk : eft middle suprarenal artery right inferior phrenic artery! inferior vena cava: right inferior phrenic vein __________________ _ right suprarenal vein __________________ _ right gonadal vein _____________ _ right 4th lumbar vein _______________ _ nght 4th lumbar artery ___________ _ right gonadal artery ____________ _ median sacral vein : superior suprarenal artery i left inferior phrenic artery _----- left Inferior phrenic vein _------ left Inferior suprarenal artery ----------- left renal artery -------- left renal vein -------- left gonadal vein --------- inferior mesentenc artery --- left gonadal artery median sacral artery FIGURE 5.55 SUBSIDL4RIES OF ABDOMINAL AORTA AND INFERIOR VENA CAVA The first three unpaired arteries have already been described, as have the middle suprarenal and gonadal arteries. At about the level of the coeliac trunk, locate the paired inferior phrenic arteries. Each passes upwards and laterally on the corresponding crus of the diaphragm to supply the posterior part of the diaphragm. Each gives off a few small suprarenal branches (Fig. 5.53). IdentifY and follow the small gonadal arteries arising from its anterior surface close to the renal arteries. In the female, the gonadal arteries will descend into the pelvis, while in the male they will meet with the ductus deferens to disappear into the spermatic cord. Clear the left side of the aorta and note the presence of the four left lumbar arteries (homologous with the intercostal arteries) passing around the sides of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae. On the right side, ease the inferior vena cava away from the aorta to visualise the right lumbar arteries. The median sacral artery represents the primitive continuation of the dorsal aorta to the coccyx. The common iliac arteries arise at the bifurcation of the aorta. On each side, the artery passes downwards, and, at about the level of the lumbosacral disc, the common iliac artery divides into its The Abdomen 141 terminal branches - the external and internal iliac arteries. The ureter crosses the common iliac artery at its bifurcation. Just above the inguinal ligament, the external iliac artery forms two main branches: â¢ the inferior epigastric artery, which enters the rectus sheath to form an anastomosis with the superior epigastric artery within the muscle. The inferior epigastric artery gives off the cremasteric and the pubic branches; and â¢ the deep circuniflex iliac artery, which runs laterally along the deep aspect of the inguinal ligament. On reaching the anterior superior iliac spine it gives off a large ascending branch to the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. The trunk continues along the iliac crest, becoming more superficial and eventually anastomosing with the iliac branch of the iliolumbar artery. The internal iliac artery will be studied when the pelvic cavity is dissected. 5.22 THE INFERIOR VENA CAVA The inferior vena cava is formed by the union of the common iliac veins. Follow the inferior vena cava upwards, noting that it ascends to the right of the aorta. It pierces the central tendon of the diaphragm at the level of T8. Carefully clear away any overlying tissue taking care to preserve all tributaries. The tributaries should be studied with reference to the corresponding branches of the abdominal aorta (Fig. 5.55). Each of the common iliac veins is formed at the level of the lumbosacral disc by the union of the external and internal iliac veins. The left vein is longer, and also receives the unpaired median sacral vein. The tributaries of the external iliac vein correspond to the branches of the external iliac artery. Two pairs of large veins and two pairs of small veins enter the inferior vena cava on both sides: â¢ the renal veins; â¢ the hepatic veins enter the inferior vena cava as it lies in its sulcus behind the liver (there is often a middle hepatic vein from the caudate lobe; and â¢ the 3rd and 4th lumbar veins. Of the remaining paired veins, those on the right side enter the inferior vena cava directly (right inferior phrenic, right suprarenal and right gonadal veins), while those on the left side utilise the left renal vein to convey their blood to the inferior vena cava. The left suprarenal and the left inferior phrenic vein often form a common trunk before entering the left renal vein. 5.23 MUSCLES OF THE POSTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL IdentifY the muscles of the posterior abdominal wall through their fascial coverings. Define the surfaces and borders of quadratus lumborum, iliacus, psoas major and, if present, psoas minor (Fig. 5.56). The fascia in front of quadratus lumborum forms the anterior layer of a three-ply formation, the thoracolumbar fascia (Fig. 6.3 p. 162). Traced laterally, it helps to form the aponeurosis of the origin of transversus abdominis. Divide the suprarenal and renal vessels, remove the suprarenal glands, and dislocate the kidneys medially. Define the fascial thickenings over the upper ends of psoas major and quadratus lumborum. The thickening over psoas forms the medial arcuate ligament, and that over quadratus forms the lateral arcuate ligament. Remove the fascial coverings of these muscles, taking care to preserve the nerves and vessels related to them (Fig 5.57). Locate the following major nerves: â¢ on quadratus, the subcostal vessels and nerve, the ilio-hypogastric nerve, and the ilio-inguinal nerve; 142 Practical Anatomy â¢ on psoas major, the genitofemoral nerve and, deeply between psoas and iliacus, the femoral nerve; â¢ on iliacus, the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh.

Be especially careful to preserve the three diaphragmatic ligaments: â¢ median arcuate ligament, over the structures emerging through the fibro-osseous tunnel at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra; â¢ medial arcuate ligament over psoas major, extending from the median ligament to the tip of the transverse process of L 1; â¢ lateral arcuate ligament over quadratus lumborum (Fig. 5.56) and extending from the transverse process of L 1 to the tip of the 12th rib. Return the anterior chest wall to its original situation to visualise the attachments of the diaphragm (Fig. 5.58): â¢ sternal attachments - by two slips from the posterior aspect of the xiphisternum; â¢ costal attachments - from the inner surfaces of the lower six ribs and costal cartilages by slips which interdigitate with slips of transversus abdominis; and â¢ lumbar attachments - by two crura from the anterior surfaces of the bodies L 1, 2, 3 on the right side and L 1, 2 on the left side, and from the medial and lateral arcuate ligaments. The fibres converge radially to a central tendon, a thin aponeurosis which is fused with the lower surface of the fibrous pericardium.

The nerve supplies the diaphragm from below. Minor pathways include: â¢ the splanchnic nerves emerging through the substance of the crura; â¢ the sympathetic trunks emerging from under the medial arcuate ligament; â¢ superior epigastric vessels passing between the attachments of the diaphragm to the xiphoid and the 7th costal cartilage; â¢ intercostal nerves 7-11 with their vessels and the musculophrenic vessels, passing between the costal slips of origin; â¢ subcostal nerve emerging below the lateral arcuate ligament; and â¢ the branches of the left phrenic nerve piercing the diaphragm to supply it from below. 5.25 THE LUMBAR PLEXUS The lumbar plexus is a plexus of nerves formed by the anterior primary rami of the nerves L 1, 2, 3 and 4 within the substance of psoas major. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th rami divide into anterior and posterior divisions, to supply the anterior and posterior derivatives in the lower limb respectively. On one side of the cadaver, identifY and isolate the genitofemoral nerve lying on the surface of psoas major. If the nerve is embedded within psoas major, extract it by picking away the muscle substance. Continue this process until the whole of the abdominal part of psoas has been removed and the lumbar plexus of nerves exposed (Fig. 5.59). iliohypogastric nerve .............. . ilio-inguinal nerve .............. . lateral femoral cutaneous nerve .............. . femoral nerve ................... . accessory obturator nerve i genitofemoral nerve FIGURE 5.59 THE LUMBAR PLEXUS III IV contribution from L4 to lumbosacral trunk i obturator nerve Most of the branches of the lumbar plexus have already been identified: â¢ the iliohypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerve both originate frOlTl L 1; â¢ the genitofemoral nerve has its origins from L 1 and L 2.

It is a nerve to the adductor muscles of the thigh; â¢ the femoral nerve originates from the posterior divisions ofL 2, 3 and 4. It is a nerve of the flexor muscles of the thigh and extensors of the knee; â¢ the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh originates from the posterior divisions of L 2 and L 3; and â¢ the accessory obturator nerve (only present is about 30% of subjects) originates from the posterior divisions of L 3 and 4. 5.26 THE LUMBOSACRAL TRIANGLE Before beginning the dissection of the pelvis, study an articulated skeleton and, on the cadaver, the pelvic brim and the nerves and vessels passing from the posterior abdominal wall on each side into the pelvis. The so-called neurovascular gateway to the pelvis takes the form of the lumbosacral triangle. The lateral side of the triangle is the medial border of psoas major; the medial side is the side of the body ofL 5; and the base is the ala of the sacrum (Fig. 5.60). The floor of the triangle is the transverse process of L 5, the iliolumbar ligament and the lumbosacral ligament. The following structures cross or traverse the triangle: â¢ vessels: common iliac vessels, iliolumbar vessels, inferior mesenteric vein and artery (left triangle), commencement of inferior vena cava (right triangle); â¢ nerves: sympathetic trunk, lumbosacral trunk, obturator nerve; â¢ the ureter. psoas major .................... .. ureter ......... . internal iliac artery ..... external iliac artery obturator nerve i right sympathetic trunk i FIGURE 5.60 THE GATEWAY TO THE PELVIS 5.27 THE PELVIS .----Ii i left ala of sacrum superior rectal artery ganglion impar The pelvis may be regarded as a downward extension of the abdominal cavity, enclosed posteriorly by the sacrum and coccyx and laterally and anteriorly by the two hip bones. The part above the iliopectineal line and its arcuate line extension to the sacro-iliac joint is the pelvis major (false pelvis), constituting the lower part of the abdominal cavity. 146 Practical Anatomy The cavity below these lines is the pelvis minor (true pelvis). Reference to pelvic structures refers to those in the true pelvis. Below it is bounded by the muscular pelvic diaphragm, while the posterior and lateral limits are formed by the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments. The peritoneal membrane of the abdominal cavity has been elevated as far as the brim of the pelvis to expose the structures passing from abdomen to pelvis. The pelvic peritoneum is separated from the pelvic diaphragm by an interval in which the pelvic viscera are situated. The peritoneum gives partial investment to the bladder and rectum in the male, and the bladder, uterus and rectum in the femal e. Before elevating the peritoneum further, note the various reflections and fossae formed by the pelvic peritoneum (Figs. 5.61, 5.62, 5.28) â¢ the paravesical fossae (both sexes); â¢ the pararectal fossae (both sexes); â¢ the recto-uterine pouch and sacrogenital folds (male) â¢ the recto-uterine pouch, recto-uterine folds and the vesico-uterine pouch (female); and â¢ the broad ligaments (female). paravesical fossa ...... ductus deferens ureter .............. sacrogenital fold FIGURE 5.61 MALE PELVIC VISCERA (FROM ABOVE) .:' vesico-uterine pouch \" paravesical fossa round ligament of uterus .- uterus .- uterine tube _-- ovary --\" broad ligament proper ligament of ovary ureter recto-uterine pouch rectum FIGURE 5.62 FEMALE PELVIC VISCERA (FROM ABOVE) The Abdomen 147 5.28 TIlE PELVIC FASCIA Strip the pelvic peritoneum off the pelvic brim and side walls of the pelvic cavity. Continue the elevation medially to separate it from pelvic floor and viscera. This displays the upper two-thirds of the rectum in both sexes. In the female, continue the reflection into the cleft between rectum and uterus (recto-uterine pouch), proceeding over the uterus and uterine tubes to the shallow cleft between uterus and urinary bladder (vesico-uterine pouch). Continue over the bladder until the anterior abdominal wall is reached, thus exposing the bladder surface. Extend the separation laterally from the uterus to expose the broad ligament to which the ovary is attached to the posterior surface. In the male cadaver, follow the peritoneum over the rectum and on to the bladder to expose these structures. In both male and female cadavers, removal of the peritoneum reveals the delicate pelvic fascia, which contains fat in places. The pelvic viscera are enveloped in loose connective tissue, the visceral pelvic fascia. The parietal pelvic fascia is blended with the epimysium of the muscles lining the pelvic cavity: piriformis, obturator internus and levator ani. The visceral fascia contains varying amounts of smooth muscle which helps to support the pelvic floor. In various places the fascia becomes condensed to form ligaments, for example, the lateral ligaments of the bladder, connecting the bladder to the parietal fascia on the levator ani. 5.29 TIlE PELVIC VISCERA After demonstrating the pelvic fascia, remove it completely in order to identifY the pelvic viscera: â¢ the rectum and urinary bladder in both sexes; â¢ the ductus diferens, seminal vesicles and the prostate comprising the internal genitalia in the male; and â¢ the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes comprising the internal genitalia of the female. 5.30 TIlE BLADDER The bladder is pyramidal in shape, with the apex pointing forwards towards the upper end of the pubic symphysis. The empty bladder in the adult lies behind and slightly above the pubic bones. The back of the bladder (fundus) is posterior, and is related to the seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia in the male. In the female the fundus is related to the anterior wall of the vagina (Figs. 5.63, 5.64). The inferolateral surface forms part of the wall of the retropubic space (Fig. 5.65). ~ i peritoneum covering front and ~ ,'d\" of \"PP\" thl,d of \",,\"m ~~\\ middle thl,d of ,oct\"m oov\",ed anterior abdominal wall ------.. -.. -------- . ~ __ oj ~ \\ only in front ,,,-,. --r--------------:l!----------- rectovesical pouch . bladd~r --------------------'-)~.~.-----:~~- .~.\" T-~--------!,f------)----seminal vesicle pubiC symphYSIS ------------------------'@ vv ~v i\\ ( i:\",-, / , ~ v, ~~v '\\.

The lowest part of the bladder is the neck. It surrounds the internal urethral orifice, and is fused with the upper part of the prostate in the male. To view the interior of the bladder, make an anteroposterior cut in the superior surface of the bladder and cut away the sides of the upper surface. Sponge away any contents and wash out the interior to remove debris. The mucous membrane is thick and soft, and loosely attached to the subjacent muscular coat by a submucous layer. The mucous membrane is rugose, except over a triangular area between the internal urethral and ureteric orifices. The triangular area is the trigone (Fig. 5.66). In the male, there may be a small 'bump' at the posterior edge of the internal urethral orifice; this is the uvula vesicae, and is created by the underlying middle lobe of the prostate gland. The Abdomen 149 Pass a blunt probe into the opening of the cut end of each ureter until the point emerges through the ureteric opening. The flaps oflining membrane form efficient valves to prevent retrograde flow of urine up the ureter when the bladder is distended. Between the ureteric openings there is a transverse ridge, the interureteric crest (transverse ureteric bar). The muscular coat of the bladder consists of three layers of smooth muscle: the outer and inner coat comprise longitudinal fibres, the middle coat circular fibres. rugose mucosa ----------- right ureteric orifice ------ trigone ------ uvula vesicae -------- cut edge of bladder--------- FIGURE 5.66 THE INTERIOR OF THE URINARY BLADDER interureteric fold internal urethral orifice 5.31 THE NEUROVASCULAR COMPONENTS The arterial supply is from superior and itiferior vesical arteries from the internal iliac artery. In the female, the inferior vesical artery is replaced by the vaginal artery. The vesical venous plexus (combined in the male with the prostatic plexus) drains into the internal iliac vein on each side. Lymphatic drainage is to the iliac nodes. The sympathetic innervation is from the inferior hypogastric plexus, and the parasympathetic supply is from pelvic splanchnic nerves (S 2, 3, 4). 5.32- THE MALE INTERNAL GENITALIA With a finger, separate the lower part of the prostate completely from the urogenital membrane, until it is attached only by the urethra. Divide the urethra and extract the bladder, prostate and seminal vesicles as a block. Study these structures serially. 5.32.1 The Seminal Vesicles The seminal vesicles are situated at the back of the bladder, one on either side of the midline. Each lies below the corresponding ductus deferens and slopes upwards and laterally so that its upper end lies in the sacrogenital fold. Each vesicle is a single coiled tube, the coils are held together by connective tissue. The excretory duct emerging from the lower end of the vesicle joins with the ductus deferens to form the ejaculatory duct, which passes through the prostate to open in the prostatic urethra. The blood supply is derived from the inferior vesical and middle rectal vessels. 5.32.2 The Prostate Gland The prostate gland is a solid mass of musculoglandular tissue which embraces the neck of the bladder and the proximal part of the urethra (prostatic urethra). It is conical in shape, with the truncated apex below, resting on the superior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm (Fig. 5.67). The Abdomen 151 From the internal urethral orifice, pass a fairly stout probe along the length of the prostatic urethra. With a sharp knife, cut down on to the probe anteriorly through the isthmus to open the urethra; extend the cut upwards into the bladder. If necessary, cut away the overhanging lateral edges of the bladder and prostate to expose the interior of the urethra properly. With the aid of a handlens, locate the following features in the prostatic urethra (Fig. 5.70): â¢ a longitudinal central posterior crest which begins at the internal urethral orifice; â¢ at about the middle of the urethra, the crest enlarges to form a median bulge, the colliculus seminalis; â¢ the prostatic sinus on either side of the colliculus seminalis; â¢ three openings on the summit of the colliculus: the central prostatic utricle and, on either side, the ostia of the ejaculatory ducts. The neurovascular components are the same as those of the bladder. FIGURE 5.70 POSTERIOR WALL OF THE PROSTATIC URETHRA (SEEN FROM THE FRONT) 5.32.3 The Urethra Review the previous dissection of the urethra, and consider the structure as a whole. The urethra has three parts: â¢ the prostatic part within the prostate gland, extending from the bladder opening to the apex of the prostate; â¢ the membranous part pierces the urogenital diaphragm. It is thin-walled and narrow and surrounded by the external sphincter urethrae. Its passage through the urogenital diaphragm restricts its ability to dilate, thereby resisting the passage of a catheter; â¢ the spongy part within the corpus spongiosum. It presents two dilatations, the first in the bulb of the corpus spongiosum and the other in the glans penis, the navicular fossa. The ducts of the bulbo-urethral glands open into it towards its posterior end. Along its length are numerous mucosal pits, the lacunae, for the production of mucus. 5.33 THE FEMALE INTERNAL GENITALIA Revise the structures in the pelvis: bladder anteriorly, rectum posteriorly, uterus between the two, with uterine tubes passing to either side in the upper edge of the broad ligament and fimbriated end pointing posteriorly. More lateral to the uterine tube and ovary, the broad ligament extends to the pelvic wall as the infundibulopelvic ligament. 152 Practical Anatomy Identify and follow the round ligament of the uterus from the internal inguinal ring, to the uterus. Traction on the ovary laterally reveals that the ligament continues at the back of the broad ligament and becomes continuous with the ovary (ligament to the ovary). The round ligament of the uterus and the proper ligament of the ovary are continous through the cornu uteri (uterine horn) and are said to be modifications of the gubernaculum. The gubernaculum, attached to the ovary, is crossed by the paramesonephric duct which will ultimately encircle the gubernaculum to form the cornu uteri. This may prevent further descent of the ovary (Fig. 5.71). ovary proper ligament of ovary testis .......... . . ................ uterus FIGURE 5.71 THE MALE GUBERNACULUM AND ITS FEMALE HOMOLOGUES Divide the round ligament as it crosses the brim of the pelvis and the broad ligament, preserving the uterine tube and ovary. Carefully separate the uterus and vagina completely from their surroundings, divide the uterine arteries and divide the vagina circumferentially, leaving a fringe protuding above the urogenital diaphragm. Extract the uterus, adnexae and vagina from the pelvis as a block, dividing any tethers as may be necessary. Study these organs together. 5.33.1 The Uterus The uterus is a pear-shaped organ situated between the bladder and the rectum. In its normal position the uterus has its long axis directed upwards and forwards. The dimensions of the adult, non-pregnant uterus are: 8cm long, Scm wide above and 2,5cm wide below, and about 2cm thick in places. The upper two-thirds constitutes the body, and the lower third, the cervix or neck. A slight constriction, the isthmus, marks the junction. Each uterine tube enters the lateral border of the uterus near the upper end of the body (cornual openings). The region above that level is the fundus. The round ligament of the uterus is attached in front just below the cornual openings, and the proper ligament of the ovary behind (Fig. 5.62). The lateral margins of the body of the uterus are connected to the side walls of the pelvis by the broad ligament. Each broad ligament has an antero-inferior and a postero-superior surface. The broad ligament encloses the uterine tube in its upper free edge. The uterus is supplied by the uterine artery and the ovarian artery on each side. The uterine venous plexus in the broad ligament on each side drains into the uterine and ovarian veins. The uterine vein drains into the internal iliac veins, and the ovarian veins into the left renal vein and the inferior vena cava. Slice the uterus open in a coronal plane to display the uterine cavity and its continuation as the cervical canal. Note the presence of the cornual openings to the uterine tubes and the internal os and external os of the cervical canal. The Abdomen 155 of the tip of the coccyx the rectum makes a sharp posterior bend to form the anal canal (Fig. 5.74). The rectum is the terminal part of the embryonic hindgut. It begins at the level of the second sacral piece and ends at the level of the tip of the coccyx. It is curved posteriorly following the curvature of the sacrum. At the junction with the anal canal it is dilated, forming the rectal ampulla. In the male, the rectum is related anteriorly to the rectovesical fossa containing the small and large intestine above (upper third), the vasa deferentia, seminal vesicles and small piece of the bladder between (middle third), and the prostate (lower third). In the female, the rectum occupies the hollow of the sacrum and at about the level of the coccyx, it turns abruptly posteriorly to join the anal canal. Above the peritoneal reflection it is related to the uterus in the midline and to the ovaries laterally. Below the peritoneal reflection it is related to the vaginal vault. third piece of sacrum _. __ ._._ .. _._. __ ._._ .. _.-._. __ ._ .... _._._ .. _._ .. _.- rectum --_._._ .. _._ .... _._ .. _._._. __ ._._ .. _.-.-_._._. longitudinal muscle of rectum ._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._. puborectal sling ...... . membranous urethra surrounded .--.-.. -.. -.--.-.--.--~'k]~ by sphincter urethrae perineal body: i recto-urethral muscle i FIGURE 5.74 THE ANORECTAL FLEXURE anococcygeal ligament spincter ani extern us anal canal sphincter ani externus The wall is composed of mucous membrane, circular muscle, longitudinal muscle and areolar adventitia. The interior presents a variable number of folds. The arterial supply is from superior rectal branch of the inferior mesenteric artery which splits into two postero-lateral branches, by middle rectal arteries from the interior iliac arteries, by the inferior rectal branch of the internal pudendal artery. Venous drainage is from the perirectal plexus to the portal system via the superior rectal veins, and to the caval system via the middle and inferior rectal veins. Lymphatic drainage is to nodes related to the aorta and inferior mesenteric vein. Nerve supply is autonomic from inferior hypogastric plexus (sympathetic) and pelvic splanchnic nerves (S 2, 3, 4) (parasympathetic) . 5.35 THE PELVIC WALLS To study the internal wall of the true pelvis effectively it is necessary to remove the rectum and bladder completely. Remove these by blunt dissection and by cutting through the female urethra at the level of the urogenital diaphragm and the anal canal at the level of levator ani. This clears the pelvis of viscera. 156 Practical Anatomy By blunt dissection elevate the blood vessels and nerves crossing the lumbosacral triangle on one side only. Divide the iliolumbar ligament and the anterior sacroiliac ligaments. With a broad bladed knife, cut completely through the symphysis pubis. With the cadaver lying on its back, exert force upon the anterior superior iliac spines, sufficient to disrupt the sacroiliac joint on the required side. This opens the pelvis to give greater access to the interior. Clear away all connective tissue and fat from the intact side of the pelvis and the contained structures. If necessary, remove the veins to study the arteries and nerves more effectively. The ureter may be separated and turned away. 5.35.1 Neurovascular Components After entering the true pelvis, the internal iliac artery splits into anterior (mainly visceral branches) and posterior (mainly parietal branches) divisions. The branches of the anterior division are: â¢ the umbilical artery giving off two superior vesical arteries, supplying the upper part of the bladder, the ureter and ductus deferens, and the artery of the ductus diferens. â¢ the obturator artery, supplies the bladder and obturator muscles and then passes through the obturator canal (upper part of obturator foramen). It gives a pubic branch which forms an anastomosis behind the pubis with the pubic branch of the inferior epigastric artery. Enlargement of this anastomosis results in the formation of the abnormal obturator artery from the inferior epigastric. It lies close to the lacunar ligamentous extension of the inguinal ligament; â¢ the inferior vesical artery runs forward to supply the base of the bladder, seminal vesicle, prostate and ureter. In the female it supplies the vagina, bladder, and rectum and is called the vaginal artery; â¢ the middle rectal artery often arises in common with the inferior vesical, sending branches to the rectum, prostate, seminal vesicale and ductus deferens; â¢ the uterine artery (female) passes medially in the broad ligament to the region of the cervix uteri, from where it runs up the lateral uterine wall to form an anastomosis with the ovarian artery; â¢ the inferior gluteal artery supplies the muscles of the buttock and back of the thigh; â¢ the internal pudendal artery exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen and enters the pudendum through the lesser foramen, to supply the perineal membrane and penis or clitoris. contribution from L4! ventral ramus of L5 --------------- internal iliac artery ..... lateral sacral artery ----------- supenor gluteat artery ---------- piriformis ---------- sciatic nerve ---- inferior glueal artery ------- ..- internal pudendal artery---- coccygeus FIGURE 5.75 THE BACK-WALL OF THE PELVIS !:: median sacral vein median sacral artery i media limb of root of sigmoid mesocolon : lateral limb of root of sigmoid mesocolc i ganglion impar The Abdomen 157 The branches of the posterior division are (Fig. 5.75): â¢ iliolumbar artery, running upwards and laterally over the lumbosacral trunk to pass behind the obturator nerve and psoas major where it gives an iliac branch to the iliac fossa and a lumbar branch passing into the vertebral canal, at the lumbosacral joint. â¢ superior gluteal artery, the largest branch, passing between lumbosacral trunk and first sacral nerve to pass into the buttock, over the upper edge of pyriformis; â¢ lateral sacral arteries often two on each side, passing lateral to the anterior sacral foramina and sending in spinal branches. In the pelvis the veins usually correspond closely with the arteries. Identity the lumbosacral trunk (L 4, 5) crossing the lumbosacral triangle, medial to psoas major. Follow it to where it joins the first sacral nerve. Then on the surface of pyriformis, dissect out the remaining sacral nerves, the nerve coming from the 4th sacral foramen often consisting of two nerves. These all join together to form the sciatic trunk which passes into the buttock under the lower edge of piriformis. Follow the ganglionated sympathetic trunks, which hug the medial borders of the sacral foramina and gives small branches to each of the sacral nerves. At the front of the coccyx, the sympathetic trunks join to form a common ganglion, the ganglion impar. Follow the obturator nerve into the obturator canal where it usually lies above the artery, with the vein below the artery. 5.35.2 Museular Components Identity the attachment of piriformis to the anterior surface of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th sacral pieces. It passes through the greater sciatic notch, gaining additional attachments from the upper margin of the greater sciatic notch and from the sacrotuberous ligament. It is inserted into the greater trochanter of the femur (Fig. 5.76). FIGURE 5.76 THE PIRIFORMIS MUSCLE (FROM BEHIND) Obturator internus arises from the obturator membrane; its tendon passes out of the pelvis into the buttock via the lesser sciatic foramen. It is attached to the medial surface of the greater trochanter (Fig. 5.77). The Abdomen 159 insert into the anococcygealligament immediately behind the anorectal junction. It is responsible for the angulation of the junction and is called puborectalis or the 'puborectal sling'. In the female, the fibres form a sphincter around the vagina; these fibres are called the pubovaginalis. â¢ iliococcygeus is the middle component and arises from a fascial condensation over obturator internus, extending as far back as the ischial spine. It inserts into the anococcygealligament. â¢ ischiococcygeus, is the posterior component of the muscle and is often not wholly distinct from iliococcygeus. It arises from the interior surface of the ischial spine and inserts into the lateral margin of the coccyx and adjacent sacral edge. It nearly always has an attachment to the sacrospinous ligament. The levator ani muscle provides support for the pelvic organs, and is concerned with defaecation and partruition. It is supplied from below by the pudendal nerve (S 2, 3, 4). 164 Practical Anatomy -------------------------------------- semispinalis capitis ----------------------------------- semispinalis cervicis ----------------------------------- semispinalis thoracis FIGURE 6.6 SEMISPINALIS 6.3 THE SUBOCCIPITAL TRIANGLE Define the medial border of semispinalis capitis, and detach the muscle completely. Removal of semispinalis allows for the nuchal ligament to be examined. The ligament is a powerful fibrous structure extending superficially between the external occipital protuberance and the spines of all the cervical vertebrae (Fig. 6.7). It functions as a fibrous strut between skull and vertebral column, and gives attachment to muscle. ligamentum nuchae -------------------- interspinous ligament --------------------------- I supraspinous ligament --------------------------- FIGURE 6.7 LIGAMENTUM NUCHAE 168 Practical Anatomy â¢ the anterior longitudinal ligament, attached below to the body of the axis and above to the anterior arch of the atlas; â¢ the ligamentum flavum, on each side, connects the lamina of the axis to the posterior arch of the atlas; â¢ the transverse ligament of the atlas, attached on each side to the lateral mass of the atlas; â¢ the inferior longitudinal fasciculus of the cruciform ligament is a narrow band passing from the transverse ligament to the body of the axis. The four accessory ligaments (three unpaired, one paired) extend between the axis and the occipital bone, thus by-passing the atlas (Figs. 6.11 & 6.12): â¢ the apical ligament extends from the tip of the dens to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum; â¢ the alar ligament extends from each side of the dens to the medial aspect of the occipital condyle; â¢ the superior longitudinal fasciculus of the cruciform ligament extends from the upper edge of the transverse ligament, passes behind the apical ligament, to attach to the occipital bone close to the edge of the foramen magnum; â¢ membrana tectoria is a broad ligamentous sheet continuous below with the posterior longitudinal ligament, and attached above to the upper surface of the basilar part of the occipital bone.

The costotransverse joints should be dissected from behind. Distract the scapulae as widely as possible, and remove all the back muscles from the region of the middle four thoracic vertebrae. Remove the intercostal muscles and membrane from the posterior parts of the 6th and 7th spaces. IdentifY and carefully examine the 7th costotransverse joint on each side. There are three ligaments to be identified (Fig. 6.13): 170 Practical Anatomy Define the cord-like intertransverse ligament on either side and divide it. Cut through the strong supraspinous ligament between the tips of the spines of the vertebrae; continue the incision deeply to divide the membranous interspinous ligament connecting successive spinous processes (Fig. 6.7). Now try and separate the two vertebrae. They are held together by the strong ligamentum jlavum (interlaminar ligament) between successive laminae on each side (Fig. 6.14). ligamentum flavum attached to ............................... . consecutive laminae POSTERIOR ANTERIOR FIGURE 6.14 SAGITTAL SECTION THROUGH VERTEBRAE TO SHOW LIGAMENTA FL4VA To visualise the joints between the bodies, locate the posterior longitudinal ligament. The ligament is continuous with the membrane tectoria above (Fig. 6.11), and terminates at the sacrum. The ligament attaches to the disc and adjacent bony margins of the vertebrae. To visualise the posterior longitudinal ligament, it is necessary to remove one or more laminae and spines in the lumbar region. This may be performed with a small saw or bone-cutting forceps. This exposes the dura mater and the spinal nerves of the cauda equina. Divide the dura longitudinally, and pull the cauda equina nerves and dura to one side to expose the posterior ligament. Remove any fat and blood vessels present; note the broad nature of the ligament and its lateral extensions over the intervertebral discs. Divide the ligament transversely over a disc and examine the disc from the posterior view. The intervertebral discs are plates of fibrocartilage, corresponding in shape to the articulating surfaces of the vertebral bodies. They are interposed between layers of hyaline cartilage which coat adjacent surfaces of the bodies. The anterior longitudinal ligament covers and connects the anterior aspects of the vertebral column from atlas to sacrum. It is thickest opposite the intervertebral discs, where it is firmly attached to the discs and the margins of the adjacent vertebral bodies. Each disc consists of an anulus fibrosis surrounding a 'soft centre', the nucleus pulposus. The anulus fibrosus consists oflaminae of fibrous tissue, the directions of which vary from layer to layer. The nucleus pulposus consists of a gelatinous material containing connective tissue cells and collagen fibres . The lowest cartilaginous intervertebral joint is between that between the sacrum and the coccyx, the sacrococcygeal joint. There are four ligaments associated with this joint: â¢ the anterior sacrococcygeal ligament is continuous above with the anterior longitudinal ligament; â¢ the supeificial posterior sacrococcygeal ligament which is attached above to the margin of the sacral hiatus, and below to the back of the coccyx; â¢ the deep posterior sacrococcygeal ligament connecting the posterior surfaces of the two bones on a deeper plane; and â¢ the lateral sacrococcygeal ligament connecting the inferolateral angle of the sacrum to the transverse process of the coccyx on each side, thus completing the foramen for the 5th sacral nerve. Chapter Seven The Pelviu Girdle and Lower Limb The lower limb is composed of three regions: the thigh which is linked to the trunk by the pelvic girdle; the leg which extends from the knee to the ankle; and the foot. The calf is the term applied to the fleshy, posterior part of the leg. The regions of the limb are artificial, and the hip, knee, and ankle are areas of transition. The pelvic girdle consists of the hip bones attached posteriorly to the sacrum (not part of the girdle) and anteriorly to one another by the symphysial (secondary cartilaginous) joint. Study a prepared articulated pelvis, and note the following bony landmarks: â¢ the anterior superior and inferior iliac spines; â¢ the iliopubic crest and pubic tubercle; â¢ the obturator foramen and canal; â¢ the ischial tuberosity and spine; â¢ the posterior superior and inferior iliac spines; â¢ the iliac crest and tuberosity; â¢ the anterior and posterior gluteal lines on the outer surface of the iliac blade; and â¢ the greater trochanter of femur.

Now remove the fascia overlying gluteus maximus together with the gluteal aponeurosis and the fascia covering the tensor fasciallatae. Tensor fasciae latae arises from the anterior part of the iliac crest and the surface of the ilium between the tubercle and the anterior superior iliac spine. It is inserted into the iliotibial tract (the tendon of the muscle). Note that gluteus maximus has an upper and lower free edge, and that the muscle is roughly quadrangular in shape (Fig. 7.1). Free the upper and lower borders of the muscle and separate it from the underlying structures. From below, feel for the thick sacrotuberous ligament passing from the sacrum to the ischial tuberosity. Gluteus maximus is attached to the posterior surface of the ligament and care should be taken when reflecting the muscle, lest the ligament be removed with the muscle. Detach the muscle from its iliac and sacral attachments and elevate it laterally. Note that the distal attachment of the muscle is separated from the ischial tuberosity by a bursa. The reflection exposes the inferior gluteal vessels and nerve, which supply gluteus maximus. These neurovascular components emerge from the lower border of piriformis. It may be necessary to divide the vessels and nerve. 7.1.2 Deep Structures of the Gluteal Region Gluteus maximus may be regarded as the cover for the gluteal region. Reflection of gluteus maximus reveals the deeper structures of the gluteal region, covered with fascia (Fig. 7.2). Gluteus medius is a triangular shaped muscle, with the base attached to the iliac crest and the adjacent iliac surface, and the apex attached by a flat tendon to the outer surface of the greater trochanter of the femur (Fig. 7.3). Note that it has a posterior free edge around which branches of the inferior gluteal nerve pass to supply gluteus maximus. Gluteus medius is supplied by the superior gluteal nerve (L4,5, S1). Piriformis emerges from the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. It arises from the anterior surface of the middle three pieces of the sacrum and inserts into the posterior part of the greater trochanter. Obturator internus arises in the pelvis from the obturator membrane and surrounding bone. Its tendon emerges into the gluteal region through the lesser sciatic foramen and attaches to the medial aspect of the greater trochanter just above the trochanteric pit. Gemellus superior and gemellus itiferior accompany the tendon of obturator internus. Gemellus superior arises from the outer surface of the ischial spine and gemellus inferior from the adjacent surface of the ischial tuberosity. The tendons of insertion are closely associated with that of obturator internus and are often not distinguishable from it. Quadratus femoris arises from a ridge on the lateral surface of the ischial tuberosity. The greater part of the muscle inserts into the quadrate tubercle of the posterior intertrochanteric crest but also extends slightly above and below the tubercle. 174 Practical Anatomy adductor mag nus long head of biceps semitendinosus semimembranosus FIGURE 7.2 THE GLUTEAL REGION upper deep branch of superior gluteal artery ..... upper branch of superior gluteal nerve ........... gluteus minimus lower deep branch of superior gluteal artery .... , lower branch of superior gluteal nerve ..... gluteus medius I I ....... inferior gluteal artery and :1 nerve I I ....... tendon of obturator internus ........ ascending branch of medial circumflex femoral artery ~g~Â§~.'f .... ) ............ quadratus femoris / ................... transverse branch of medial circumflex femoral artery .............................. posterior cutaneous nerve of thigh ..................... sciatic nerve Lift the posterior border of gluteus medius and pull it forwards to expose the upper border of piriformis, noting that the superior gluteal artery and nerve emerge above this border. Isolate the lower border of piriformis and note that both the inferior gluteal artery and nerve and the sciatic nerve emerge from this border. For these reasons, piriformis has been regarded as the 'key' to the buttock (cÂ£ pectoralis minor, Fig. 3.9 p. 21).

By blunt dissection separate the muscle from the bone completely and turn it downwards, preserving (if possible) its nerve supply. Gluteus minimus arises from the ilium below and in front of gluteus medius, and inserts into the anterior surface of the greater trochanter, usually over a bursa. Having reflected gluteus medius, define clearly the muscles mentioned above using the point of the forceps or the handle of a scalpel. The gemelli may be left attached to obturator internus. Trace' out the superior gluteal artery and nerve emerging at the upper border of piriformis. Trace the structures appearing from the lower border of piriformis in a medio-lateral order: â¢ pudendal nerve and artery, crossing the ischial spine; â¢ nerve to obturator internus crossing the spine more laterally; â¢ inferior gluteal nerve and vessels supplying gluteus maximus; â¢ posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh; â¢ sciatic nerve; â¢ nerve to quadratus femoris, lying deep to the sciatic, on bone. IdentifY the inferior gluteal artery and follow its branches downwards to find the cruciate anastomosis at the lower border of quadratus femoris. This anastomosis is composed of the: â¢ upper component - descending branches of inferior gluteal artery; â¢ transverse components - branches of medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries; â¢ lower component - ascending branch from first perforating artery of the profunda femoris artery. Clinical note: In cases of vascular obstruction this anastomosis forms a connection between the internal iliac and femoral arteries. 176 Practical Anatomy 7.2 THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE THIGH Continue the skin incision down the centre of thigh and across the back of the knee to the back of the heel. Remove the skin well to the sides of the limb. Scrape away the subcutaneous fat to expose the cutaneous nerves and vein on the posterior surface of the lower limb (Fig. 7.4). The small saphenous vein passes upwards into the popliteal fossa together with the sural nerve.

The fascia lata forms a complete cover for the muscles, being thicker in front than at the back. It is also thinner on the medial side, and very substantial on the lateral side where it blends with the iliotibial tract. It is a continuation of the fascia of the gluteal region. 178 Practical Anatomy femur. Follow the biceps tendon to its attachment to the head of the fibula.

The nerve splits to form the tibial nerve bisecting the popliteal fossa, and the common fibular nerve which, hugging the lower part of the long head of biceps, proceeds laterally to pass around the neck of the fibula (Fig. 7.9). Occasionally, the sciatic nerve splits at a higher level, sometimes within the pelvis. When this occurs, one of the divisions may perforate the piriformis muscle. Feel for the ischial tuberosity and the greater trochanter of the femur and note that the sciatic nerve lies approximately midway between the two. This position places it at risk in posterior dislocation of the hip joint. Close to the medial side of the sciatic nerve, find the inferior gluteal artery descending into the thigh. 7.2.2 The Medial Compartment of the Thigh The medial compartment is a 'wedge-shaped' area which lies between the anterior and posterior compartments of the thigh. It contains most of the adductor muscles of the thigh, the obturator nerve and vessels, and the profunda femoral vessels. The muscles are arranged in three layers (Fig. 7.7): the anterior layer comprises pectineus and adductor longus, the intermediate layer comprises adductor brevis, and the posterior layer consists of adductor magnus. Obturator externis lies deep to the adductor group of muscles. Gracilis is the superficial muscle of the adductor compartment. Flex the knee to slacken the hamstrings. Pull and maintain semimembranosus and semitendinosus laterally to expose the mass of the adductor magnus muscle deep to the hamstrings on the medial side of the femur. The fibres of this muscle sweep laterally to become attached to the linea aspera and to the upper part of the medial supracondylar ridge of the femur. The medial part of the muscle forms a stout tendon which attaches to the adductor tubercle of the femur (Fig. 7.8). By blunt dissection, establish the upper attachment to the lateral part of the ischial tuberosity and the adjacent part of the ischiopubic ramus. 180 Practical Anatomy ------------- adductor component --------------- hamstring component ---------------- tendinous hiatus ---------------- adductor tubercle FIGURE 7.8 ADDUCTOR MAGNUS The superficial gracilis muscle arises from the inferior edge of the pubis and ischiopubic ramus and inserts by a narrow tendon into the upper part of the medial surface of the tibia, behind sartorius but above semimembranosus. Obturator ex tern us has a medial attachment to the obturator membrane and the obturator foramen, and a lateral attachment to the trochantic fossa of the femur. Separate these muscles as far as possible, but preserve the vessels and the nerves. 7.3 THE POPLITEAL FOSSA The popliteal fossa lies directly behind the knee joint with extensions upwards, between the hamstring muscles, and downwards between the heads of gastrocnemius. The space is 'diamond- shaped' and, although superficially it appears to be quite small, it extends for some distance under the muscles. The popliteal fascia, forming the roof of the fossa, is pierced by the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh and the small saphenous vein. As the fat is removed, the main vessels appear in the deeper reaches of the fossa, and the lower boundary of the two heads of gastrocnemius becomes clearly evident. The upper boundaries of the fossa are biceps laterally, semitendinosus and semimembranosus medially (reinforced by sartorius and gracilis) (Fig. 7.9). Pull the hamstring muscles apart to expose the floor of the fossa. Note that there is a well formed bursa between semimembranosus and the medial head of gastrocnemius. The popliteus muscle forms the floor of the space. Popliteus is covered by a layer of fascia, the popliteus fascia (cf. popliteal fascia), derived from a lateral extension of semimembranosus. Seek also The Pelvic Girdle and Lower Limb 181 for an up going lateral extension of semimembranosus lying on the capsule of the knee joint - the oblique posterior ligament of the knee joint. Having removed the fat and established the boundaries, it is now possible to identifY the contents of the fossa: the tibial and common fibular nerves and the popliteal artery and vein.

The tibial nerve bisects the fossa and provides innervation for posterior muscles of the lower limb, except the short head of biceps which is supplied by the common fibular nerve. The common fibular nerve runs along the upper outer border of the fossa in company with the tendon of biceps femoris. En route, it supplies the short head of biceps and then passes around the neck of the fibula to supply the anterior and peroneal (lateral) muscle groups of the leg. The common fibular nerve runs close to the tendon of biceps surrounded by a layer of facia, obscuring the nerve and rendering it at risk from being cut. The popliteal artery emerges through the adductor hiatus as the continuation of the femoral artery. It is closely associated with the tibial nerve. There are five genicular branches of the popliteal artery lying on the capsule of the knee joint, along with the corresponding articular branches of the tibial and common fibular nerves. The superior medial and lateral genicular arteries wind around the femur just above the condyles. The middle genicular artery is short and pierces the oblique popliteal ligament. The inferior medial and lateral genicular arteries wind around the tibia just below its upper end. In addition, there are two muscular branches: the upper muscular branch, supplying the hamstrings and adductor magnus and the lower muscular branch, supplying the heads of gastrocnemius, plantaris and soleus. At the lower edge of popliteus, the popliteal artery divides into the posterior and anterior tibial arteries. The effect of all these branches is to produce arterial circles above and below the joint. These arterial loops are joined to one another by vertical connections (Fig. 7.10).

Locate the tibial nerve as it dips deeply between the heads of gastrocnemius, and under the fibrous arch of soleus. It inclines medially in the plane between soleus and flexor digitorum longus. Proximally, it is medial to the posterior tibial vessels, but it crosses them superficially, and thereafter is lateral to them. The two terminal branches of the nerve, the medial and lateral plantar nerves, form deep to the flexor retanaculum. Follow the posterior tibial artery down the leg until it becomes superficial in the medial calcaneo- malleolar groove. Here it lies under the flexor retinaculum and divides into medial and lateral plantar arteries. Throughout its course the artery is accompanied by the tibial nerve. Before terminating in the lateral and medial plantar arteries, the posterior tibial artery gives off numerous branches: â¢ the fibular (peroneal) artery runs down at first on the aponeurotic surface of tibialis posterior and then enters the substance of flexor hallucis longus. It gives off a nutrient artery to the fibula, and a perforating branch. The artery ends by dividing into the lateral and medial malleolar arteries, which in turn give off calcaneal branches; â¢ muscular branches; â¢ nutrient artery to the tibia; and â¢ a communicating branch. Locate the common fibular (peroneal) nerve as it leaves the popliteal fossa by passing over plantaris and the lateral head of gastrocnemius. It passes over soleus and passes laterally around the neck of the fibula to reach and penetrate peroneus longus. It divides into the numerous branches: â¢ superficial - supplying the peroneal compartment of the leg; â¢ deep - supplying the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg; â¢ recurrent - supplying the knee joint; â¢ cutaneous twigs - supplying the lateral aspect of the leg. Passage of the common fibular nerve around the neck of the fibula renders it subcutaneous. In the average individual the height of the subcutaneous part of the nerve from the ground is approximately the same as the height of a motor car bumper - a bump from a motor vehicle may damage the nerve or fracture the fibula (bumper fracture). In either case the injury may result in temporary or permanent paralysis of the muscles supplied by the nerve. The patient is unable to dorsiflex the foot and toes ('foot-drop') and is also unable to evert the foot. 7.4.3 Deep Structures in the Posterior Compartment of the Leg The soleus, gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles constitute the superficial muscular component of the calf. Turn the soleus and the lower half of gastrocnemius downwards on the tendo calcaneus and maintain it there by hook and weight. This exposes the anterior surface of soleus and the structures of the calflying deep to the thin and transparent posterior intermuscular septum. Remove the septum completely to expose the deep muscles. On the medial side of the ankle find the thick 'ligamentous' flexor retinaculum extending from the medial tibial malleolus to the calcaneus (Fig. 7.14). Under the retinaculum locate three tendons, from medial to lateral: the tendon of tibialis posterior; the tendon of flexor digitorum longus; and the tendon of flexor hallucis longus. The two medial tendons are overlain by the posterior tibial 190 Practical Anatomy reveal the cutaneous nerves lying in the fat. These nerves consist mainly of branches from the medial and lateral plantar branches of the tibial nerve (Fig. 7.20). The structures underlying the skin and fascia in the sole of the foot are generally arranged in four muscular layers and two neurovascular planes. The first (superficial) neurovascular plane is located between the first and second muscular layers, and the second (deep) neurovascular plane is situated between the third and fourth muscular layers. After viewing the superficial nerves, remove the fat of the sole to display the underlying plantar aponeurosis, which consist of strands of silvery collagen extending longitudinally along the sole. The aponeurosis is attached posteriorly to the medial and lateral calcaneal tuberosities and extends forwards to the bases of the toes. The greater part of the exposed aponeurosis attaches to the larger medial plantar calcaneal tubercle, while a separate slip arises from the smaller lateral tubercle and proceeds forwards to be attached to the plantar surface of the 5th metatarsal. In line with the clefts between the toes and between the slips of the aponeurosis, locate the nerves and vessels which divide to supply the adjacent surfaces of the toes (Fig. 7.20). Follow the aponeurotic slips forwards on to the toes to find that they are attached to the fibrous flexor sheaths containing the flexor tendons. tibial nerve .... ~.1 ....... 1 .. l( ~j\" : calcaneal branch of medialÂ·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·; malleolar artery ~ ................. calcaneus FIGURE 7.20 THE PL4NTAR APONEUROSIS AND SUPERFICL4L NERVES AND ARTERIES 7.5.1 The First Muscle Layer The superficial or first muscle layer consists of abductor hallucis and abductor digiti minimi underlying the thin medial and lateral expansions of the plantar aponeurosis respectively, and the central flexor digitorum brevis (Fig. 7.21). Beginning at abductor digiti minimi elevate the aponeurosis medially. Locate the lateral and medial intermuscular septa between the muscles. Note that some of the fibres of abductor digiti minimi arise from the lateral intermuscular septum, the overlying aponeurosis, and from the medial intermuscular septum. Remove the fat and tissue from between the tendons of the muscles and follow them into the toes.

Follow these backwards to confirm that they are branches of the tibial nerve and posterior tibial artery. Follow the neurovascular structures distally to see that the lateral plantar nerve supplies the lateral and medial side of the little toe as well as the lateral surface of the 4th toe. Its cutaneous distribution resembles that of the ulnar nerve. The nerve usually lies medial to its companion artery and, at about the level of the 5th metatarsal base, it divides into superficial and deep components. The superficial branch supplies the skin on the lateral side of the foot and and flexor digitorum minimi brevis (a small muscle in the third layer). The deep branch turns medially and disappears under quadratus plantae. tendon of flexor hallucis longus ---------------------------1 tibial nerve ----------------------: posterior tibial artery -------------------- tendon of flexor digitorum longus ------------------ tendon of tibialis posterior ________________ f' FIGURE 7.22 THE PLANTAR ARTERIES AND NERVES The Pelvic Girdle and Lower Limb 193 Clean quadratus plantae, noting that it arises mostly from the medial and slightly from the lateral side of calcaneus, and from the long plantar ligament which is visible between the two heads of the muscle. The two heads converge to be attached by an aponeurosis to the lateral edge of the tendon of flexor digitorum longus. The alleged action of the muscle is to prevent the sloping tendon from becoming 'more sloped' during action, thus rendering it less efficient in flexing the toes. There is no comparable muscle in the palm. As with flexor digitorum profundus in the hand, the tendons of flexor digitorum longus in the foot pass between the split ends of flexor digitorum brevis to reach the bases of the terminal phalanges. The lumbrical muscles arise from the tendons of flexor digitorum longus and are inserted into the extensor expansions of the toes. The first lumbrical (the most medial) arises from the medial side of the tendon of the 2nd toe, passing forwards and dorsally onto the lateral side of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the 2nd toe. Carefully separate the second, third and fourth lumbricals from the sides of adjacent tendons.

Divide the tendons of flexor hallucis longus and flexor digitorum longus at their tendinous tether so that the tendons remain together. Pull the distal ends downwards, freeing them from the underlying muscles. Preserve the lateral plantar nerve and artery as they lie deep to the tendons. The reflection of flexor digitorum longus necessarily involves reflection of the lumbrical muscles. This procedure exposes the next (third) layer of muscles. Clear away any fat to see the muscles clearly. The third layer consists of the flexor hallucis brevis (medially), flexor digiti minimi brevis (laterally), and the two heads of adductor hallucis between them (Fig. 7.24). Flexor hallucis brevis lies deep to the tendon of flexor hallucis longus. Follow the short flexor to the big toe, note that it splits into medial and lateral parts, each ending in a short tendon which inserts into the base of the proximal phalanx of the big toe and each containing a sesamoid bone. Identity flexor digiti minimi brevis distally. The muscle arises from the base of the 5th metatarsal and its tendon joins that of abductor digiti minimi to be inserted with it on the lateral side of the base of the proximal phalanx. The adductor hallucis muscle has a two-fold origin by transverse and oblique heads. The transverse head arises from the deep transverse metatarsal ligament, and passes laterally to join with the lateral part of flexor hallucis brevis. The oblique head arises from the ligamentous coverings of the shafts of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th metatarsals and the fibrous sheath of peroneus longus. The bellies slope distally, coalesce, and form a short tendon which also joins with the lateral part of flexor hallucis brevis.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
