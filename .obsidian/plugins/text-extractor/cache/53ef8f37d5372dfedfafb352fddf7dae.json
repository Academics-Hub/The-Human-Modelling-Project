Only reports in PDF format will be accepted. The simulation .m files should also be submitted separately in Ulwazi and care should be taken to ensure that the scripts execute successfully and produce the results documented in the accompanying report. All reports must be handed in on the date specified. Late submissions will be penalised according to School policy. Please be aware that large files may take some time to upload. The deadline for the project is midnight on Friday 20 October 2023. This assignment is an individual project; plagiarism will not be tolerated in any form. All questions, except the explanatory ones, must be answered using Octave or MATLAB. The code should be adequately commented and included in the report appendices. The reports must conform to the communication standards as set by the School in the School of Electrical and Information Engineering communications manual i.e. the “Blue Book”. Please ensure that all images not created by you, are correctly referenced. Each report must be no longer than 6 pages, including references (but excluding appendices, which should contain only additional information. All key results, tables and graphs must appear in the main body of the report). The reports must be submitted in .pdf format and adhere to the following naming convention: <Name> <Surname> <student number>Control.pdf For example: JohnDoe123456Control.pdf The .m files which are to be submitted should follow the same format: JohnDoe123456Control.m School of Electrical and Information Engineering University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg ELEN3014 – Biomedical Signals, Systems and Control School of Electrical and Information Engineering University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg ELEN2005 – Signals and Systems I ELEN3014 – Project 2023 2 Should it be necessary to submit multiple .m files, you may append numbers onto the end of the filename. For example: JohnDoe123456Control01.m 4 Referencing Referencing of any and all material that is not your own needs to be carried out correctly. Only referencing using the Numerical System will be accepted. Read Section 5 of the “Blue Book” thoroughly. Poor referencing will be severely penalised. Plagiarism will NOT be tolerated. In addition, use of assistive tools such as ChatGPT should be made with caution, and any and all code or text written using these tools must be identified and referenced accordingly. Modelling the Human Circulatory System 1. Develop a second-order electrical circuit model that can be used to describe a normal human blood pressure waveform in terms of blood flow through the heart and aorta. (Hint: for this particular exercise, it would be helpful to research the Windkessel effect). Describe how your model is derived, and justify and explain all your component choices and assumptions. Remember to include all circuit diagrams. Note: you do not need to include numerical values at this stage. [15 marks] 2. Derive the transfer function for the model developed above. [10 marks] 3. Using the component values provided in Table 1 below [1], plot the impulse response of the transfer function. Table 1: Model component values r aortic resistance to blood flow 0.056 mmHg.s/cm^3 R peripheral resistance to blood flow 0.79 mmHg.s/cm^3 C arterial compliance 1.22 cm^3.mmHg^-1.s^2.cm^-3 L inertia of blood in the aorta 0.0051 mmHg.s^2/cm^3 [5 marks] 4. Consider the input signal parameter values given in Table 2 below: Table 2: Input signal parameter values Stroke Volume 500 ml/beat Heart Rate 65 beats/minute a. Generate 2 input signals for your model, namely an impulse train and a half- rectified sine wave. In each case, identify what each parameter represents and plot both the input signal and the output signal from your model. [15 marks] b. Which of the input signals used provides the best approximation to an actual physiological signal? Justify your answer. [5 marks] ELEN3014 – Project 2023 3 5. Consider the special case of hypertension (high blood pressure). a. Could your model be used to simulate this condition? What adjustments would need to be made to your model and/or the input signal? Describe and implement these changes, and run the simulation. Provide plots of all necessary signals. (Hint: it may help to consider some of the physiological causes of hypertension, and how those are represented in your model) [10 marks] b. What kind of controller could be included in your adjusted model to correct for the simulated hypertension? Select appropriate values for your chosen controller design and implement it. [10 marks] 6. Taking into account all you have done with your model so far, what improvements, if any, can you suggest to improve it? What about the controller?
