Lightfoot, Edwin N., 1925- 111. Title. QA929.B5 2001 530.13'86~21 2001023739 ISBN 0-471-41077-2 Printed in the United States of America Preface While momentum, heat, and mass transfer developed independently as branches of classical physics long ago, their unified study has found its place as one of the funda- mental engineering sciences. This development, in turn, less than half a century old, con- tinues to grow and to find applications in new fields such as biotechnology, microelectronics, nanotechnology, and polymer science. Evolution of transport phenomena has been so rapid and extensive that complete coverage is not possible. While we have included many representative examples, our main emphasis has, of necessity, been on the fundamental aspects of this field. More- over, we have found in discussions with colleagues that transport phenomena is taught in a variety of ways and at several different levels. Enough material has been included for two courses, one introductory and one advanced. The elementary course, in turn, can be divided into one course on momentum transfer, and another on heat and mass trans- fer, thus providing more opportunity to demonstrate the utility of this material in practi- cal applications. Designation of some sections as optional (0) and other as advanced (a) may be helpful to students and instructors. Long regarded as a rather mathematical subject, transport phenomena is most impor- tant for its physical significance. The essence of this subject is the careful and compact statement of the conservation principles, along with the flux expressions, with emphasis on the similarities and differences among the three transport processes considered. Often, specialization to the boundary conditions and the physical properties in a specific prob- lem can provide useful insight with minimal effort. Nevertheless, the language of trans- port phenomena is mathematics, and in this textbook we have assumed familiarity with ordinary differential equations and elementary vector analysis. We introduce the use of partial differential equations with sufficient explanation that the interested student can master the material presented. Numerical techniques are deferred, in spite of their obvi- ous importance, in order to concentrate on fundamental understanding. Citations to the published literature are emphasized throughout, both to place trans- port phenomena in its proper historical context and to lead the reader into further exten- sions of fundamentals and to applications. We have been particularly anxious to introduce the pioneers to whom we owe so much, and from whom we can still draw useful inspiration. These were human beings not so different from ourselves, and per- haps some of our readers will be inspired to make similar contributions. Obviously both the needs of our readers and the tools available to them have changed greatly since the first edition was written over forty years ago. We have made a serious effort to bring our text up to date, within the limits of space and our abilities, and we have tried to anticipate further developments. Major changes from the first edition include: transport properties of two-phase systems use of \"combined fluxes\" to set up shell balances and equations of change angular momentum conservation and its consequences complete derivation of the mechanical energy balance expanded treatment of boundary-layer theory Taylor dispersion improved discussions of turbulent transport iii iv Preface Fourier analysis of turbulent transport at high Pr or Sc more on heat and mass transfer coefficients enlarged discussions of dimensional analysis and scaling matrix methods for multicomponent mass transfer ionic systems, membrane separations, and porous media the relation between the Boltzmann equation and the continuum equations use of the \"Q+W convention in energy discussions, in conformity with the lead- ing textbooks in physics and physical chemistry However, it is always the youngest generation of professionals who see the future most clearly, and who must build on their imperfect inheritance. Much remains to be done, but the utility of transport phenomena can be expected to increase rather than diminish. Each of the exciting new technologies blossoming around us is governed, at the detailed level of interest, by the conservation laws and flux expres- sions, together with information on the transport coefficients. Adapting the problem for- mulations and solution techniques for these new areas will undoubtedly keep engineers busy for a long time, and we can only hope that we have provided a useful base from which to start. Each new book depends for its success on many more individuals than those whose names appear on the title page. The most obvious debt is certainly to the hard-working and gifted students who have collectively taught us much more than we have taught them. In addition, the professors who reviewed the manuscript deserve special thanks for their numerous corrections and insightful comments: Yu-Ling Cheng (University of Toronto), Michael D. Graham (University of Wisconsin), Susan J. Muller (University of California-Berkeley), William B. Russel (Princeton University), Jay D. Schieber (Illinois Institute of Technology), and John F. Wendt (Von Kdrm6n Institute for Fluid Dynamics). However, at a deeper level, we have benefited from the departmental structure and tra- ditions provided by our elders here in Madison. Foremost among these was Olaf An- dreas Hougen, and it is to his memory that this edition is dedicated.

It is important to have some idea about the struc- ture of the field before plunging into the details; without this perspective it is not possi- ble to appreciate the unifying principles of the subject and the interrelation of the various individual topics. A good grasp of transport phenomena is essential for under- standing many processes in engineering, agriculture, meteorology, physiology, biology, analytical chemistry, materials science, pharmacy, and other areas. Transport phenom- ena is a well-developed and eminently useful branch of physics that pervades many areas of applied science. 0. WHAT ARE THE TRANSPORT PHENOMENA? The subject of transport phenomena includes three closely related topics: fluid dynam- ics, heat transfer, and mass transfer. Fluid dynamics involves the transport of momenfum, heat transfer deals with the transport of energy, and mass transfer is concerned with the transport of mass of various chemical species. These three transport phenomena should, at the introductory level, be studied together for the following reasons: They frequently occur simultaneously in industrial, biological, agricultural, and meteorological problems; in fact, the occurrence of any one transport process by it- self is the exception rather than the rule. The basic equations that describe the three transport phenomena are closely re- lated. The similarity of the equations under simple conditions is the basis for solv- ing problems \"by analogy.\" The mathematical tools needed for describing these phenomena are very similar. Although it is not the aim of this book to teach mathematics, the student will be re- quired to review various mathematical topics as the development unfolds. Learn- ing how to use mathematics may be a very valuable by-product of studying transport phenomena. The molecular mechanisms underlying the various transport phenomena are very closely related. All materials are made up of molecules, and the same molecular 2 Chapter 0 The Subject of Transport Phenomena motions and interactions are responsible for viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion. The main aim of this book is to give a balanced overview of the field of transport phe- nomena, present the fundamental equations of the subject, and illustrate how to use them to solve problems. There are many excellent treatises on fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and mass trans- fer. In addition, there are many research and review journals devoted to these individual subjects and even to specialized subfields. The reader who has mastered the contents of this book should find it possible to consult the treatises and journals and go more deeply into other aspects of the theory, experimental techniques, empirical correlations, design methods, and applications. That is, this book should not be regarded as the complete presentation of the subject, but rather as a stepping stone to a wealth of knowledge that lies beyond. 50.2 THREE LEVELS AT WHICH TRANSPORT PHENOMENA CAN BE STUDIED In Fig. 0.2-1 we show a schematic diagram of a large system-for example, a large piece of equipment through which a fluid mixture is flowing. We can describe the transport of mass, momentum, energy, and angular momentum at three different levels. At the macroscopic level (Fig. 0.2-la) we write down a set of equations called the \"macroscopic balances,\" which describe how the mass, momentum, energy, and angular momentum in the system change because of the introduction and removal of these enti- ties via the entering and leaving streams, and because of various other inputs to the sys- tem from the surroundings. No attempt is made to understand all the details of the system. In studying an engineering or biological system it is a good idea to start with this macroscopic description in order to make a global assessment of the problem; in some instances it is only this overall view that is needed. At the microscopic level (Fig. 0.2-lb) we examine what is happening to the fluid mix- ture in a small region within the equipment. We write down a set of equations called the \"equations of change,\" which describe how the mass, momentum, energy, and angular momentum change within this small region. The aim here is to get information about ve- locity, temperature, pressure, and concentration profiles within the system. This more detailed information may be required for the understanding of some processes. At the molecular level (Fig. 0.2-lc) we seek a fundamental understanding of the mech- anisms of mass, momentum, energy, and angular momentum transport in terms of mol- 1 Q = heat added to syst -- W,,, = Work done on the system by the surroundings by means of moving parts Fig. 0.2-1 (a) A macro- scopic flow system contain- ing N2 and 0,; (b) a microscopic region within the macroscopic system containing N, and 02, which are in a state of flow; (c) a collision between a molecule of N, and a mole- cule of 0,. 50.2 Three Levels At Which Transport Phenomena Can Be Studied 3 ecular structure and intermolecular forces. Generally this is the realm of the theoretical physicist or physical chemist, but occasionally engineers and applied scientists have to get involved at this level. This is particularly true if the processes being studied involve complex molecules, extreme ranges of temperature and pressure, or chemically reacting systems. It should be evident that these three levels of description involve different \"length scales\": for example, in a typical industrial problem, at the macroscopic level the dimen- sions of the flow systems may be of the order of centimeters or meters; the microscopic level involves what is happening in the micron to the centimeter range; and molecular- level problems involve ranges of about 1 to 1000 nanometers. This book is divided into three parts dealing with Flow of pure fluids at constant temperature (with emphasis on viscous and con- vective momentum transport)--Chapters 1-8 Flow of pure fluids with varying temperature (with emphasis on conductive, con- vective, and radiative energy transport)-Chapters 9-16 Flow of fluid mixtures with varying composition (with emphasis on diffusive and convective mass transport)-Chapters 17-24 That is, we build from the simpler to the more difficult problems. Within each of these parts, we start with an initial chapter dealing with some results of the molecular theory of the transport properties (viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusivity). Then we proceed to the microscopic level and learn how to determine the velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles in various kinds of systems. The discussion concludes with the macroscopic level and the description of large systems. As the discussion unfolds, the reader will appreciate that there are many connec- tions between the levels of description. The transport properties that are described by molecular theory are used at the microscopic level. Furthermore, the equations devel- oped at the microscopic level are needed in order to provide some input into problem solving at the macroscopic level. There are also many connections between the three areas of momentum, energy, and mass transport. By learning how to solve problems in one area, one also learns the techniques for solving problems in another area. The similarities of the equations in the three areas mean that in many instances one can solve a problem \"by analogy\"-that is, by taking over a solution directly from one area and, then changing the symbols in the equations, write down the solution to a problem in another area. The student will find that these connections-among levels, and among the various transport phenomena-reinforce the learning process. As one goes from the first part of the book (momentum transport) to the second part (energy transport) and then on to the third part (mass transport) the story will be very similar but the \"names of the players\" will change. Table 0.2-1 shows the arrangement of the chapters in the form of a 3 x 8 \"matrix.\" Just a brief glance at the matrix will make it abundantly clear what kinds of interconnec- tions can be expected in the course of the study of the book. We recommend that the book be studied by columns, particularly in undergraduate courses. For graduate stu- dents, on the other hand, studying the topics by rows may provide a chance to reinforce the connections between the three areas of transport phenomena. At all three levels of description-molecular, microscopic, and macroscopic-the conservation laws play a key role. The derivation of the conservation laws for molecu- lar systems is straightforward and instructive. With elementary physics and a mini- mum of mathematics we can illustrate the main concepts and review key physical quantities that will be encountered throughout this book. That is the topic of the next section. 4 Chapter 0 The Subject of Transport Phenomena Table 0.2-1 Organization of the Topics in This Book Type of transport Momentum Energy Mass Transport by 1 Viscosity 9 Thermal 17 Diffusivity molecular motion and the stress conductivity and the (momentum flux) and the heat-flux mass-flux tensor vector vectors Transport in one 2 Shell momentum 10 Shell energy 18 Shell mass dimension (shell- balances and balances and balances and balance methods) velocity temperature concentration distributions distributions distributions Transport in 3 Equations of 11 Equations of 19 Equations of arbitrary continua change and their change and change and (use of general use their use their use transport equations) [isothermal] [nonisothermall [mixtures] Transport with two 4 Momentum 12 Energy transport 20 Mass transport independent transport with with two with two variables (special two independent independent independent methods) variables variables variables Transport in 5 Turbulent 13 Turbulent 21 Turbulent turbulent flow, and momentum energy transport; mass transport; eddy transport transport; eddy eddy thermal eddy properties viscosity conductivity diffusivity Transport across 6 Friction factors; 14 Heat-transfer 22 Mass-transfer phase boundaries use of empirical coefficients; use coefficients; use correlations of empirical of empirical correlations correlations Transport in large 7 Macroscopic 15 Macroscopic 23 Macroscopic systems, such as balances balances balances pieces of equipment [isothermal] [nonisothermall [mixtures] or parts thereof Transport by other 8 Momentum 16 Energy 24 Mass transport mechanisms transport in transport by in multi- polymeric radiation component liquids systems; cross effects 50.3 THE CONSERVATION LAWS: AN EXAMPLE The system we consider is that of two colliding diatomic molecules. For simplicity we as- sume that the molecules do not interact chemically and that each molecule is homonu- clear-that is, that its atomic nuclei are identical. The molecules are in a low-density gas, so that we need not consider interactions with other molecules in' the neighborhood. In Fig. 0.3-1 we show the collision between the two homonuclear diatomic molecules, A and B, and in Fig. 0.3-2 we show the notation for specifying the locations of the two atoms of one molecule by means of position vectors drawn from an arbitrary origin. Actually the description of events at the atomic and molecular level should be made by using quantum mechanics. However, except for the lightest molecules (H, and He) at 90.3 The Conservation Laws: An Example 5 Molecule A before collision I I Fig. 0.3-1 A collision between homonuclear diatomic molecules, / such as N, and 02. / / Molecule A is made up / Molecule B before collision of two atoms A1 and \\ A2. Molecule B is made \\ \\ up of two atoms B1 'b and B2. Molecule B after collision Molecule A after collision temperatures lower than 50 K, the kinetic theory of gases can be developed quite satis- factorily by use of classical mechanics. Several relations must hold between quantities before and after a collision. Both be- fore and after the collision the molecules are presumed to be sufficiently far apart that the two molecules cannot \"feel\" the intermolecular force between them; beyond a dis- tance of about 5 molecular diameters the intermolecular force is known to be negligible. Quantities after the collision are indicated with primes. (a) According to the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the molecules enter- ing and leaving the collision must be equal: Here m, and mB are the masses of molecules A and B. Since there are no chemical reac- tions, the masses of the individual species will also be conserved, so that m, = mi and rn, = mf, (0.3-2) (b) According to the law of conservation of momentum the sum of the momenta of all the atoms before the collision must equal that after the collision, so that in which r,, is the position vector for atom 1 of molecule A, and i,, is its velocity. We now write r,, = r, + RA, so that r,, is written as the sum of the position vector for the of molecule A 0 Arbitrary origin fixed in space Fig. 0.3-2 Position vectors for the atoms A1 and A2 in molecule A. 6 Chapter 0 The Subject of Transport Phenomena center of mass and the position vector of the atom with respect to the center of mass, and we recognize that RA2 = -RA,; we also write the same relations for the velocity vectors. Then we can rewrite Eq. 0.3-3 as That is, the conservation statement can be written in terms of the molecular masses and velocities, and the corresponding atomic quantities have been eliminated. In getting Eq. 0.3-4 we have used Eq. 0.3-2 and the fact that for homonuclear diatomic molecules 1 mAl = mA2 = 5 mA. (c) According to the law of conservation of energy, the energy of the colliding pair of molecules must be the same before and after the collision. The energy of an isolated mol- ecule is the sum of the kinetic energies of the two atoms and the interatomic potential en- ergy, +,, which describes the force of the chemical bond joining the two atoms 1 and 2 of molecule A, and is a function of the interatomic distance lrA2 - rA,l. Therefore, energy conservation leads to Note that we use the standard abbreviated notation that el = (fAl . iAl). We now write the velocity of atom 1 of molecule A as the sum of the velocity of the center of mass of A and the velocity of 1 with respect to the center of mass; that is, r,, = iA + RA,. Then Eq. 0.3-5 becomes in which MA = $mA1~il + $nA2~;, + 4, is the sum of the kinetic energies of the atoms, re- ferred to the center of mass of molecule A, and the interatomic potential of molecule A. That is, we split up the energy of each molecule into its kinetic energy with respect to fixed coordinates, and the internal energy of the molecule (which includes its vibra- tional, rotational, and potential energies). Equation 0.3-6 makes it clear that the kinetic energies of the colliding molecules can be converted into internal energy or vice versa. This idea of an interchange between kinetic and internal energy will arise again when we discuss the energy relations at the microscopic and macroscopic levels. (dl Finally, the law of conservation of angular momentum can be applied to a collision to give in which X is used to indicate the cross product of two vectors. Next we introduce the center-of-mass and relative position vectors and velocity vectors as before and obtain in which 1, = [R,, x m,,~~,] + [R~~ x mA2~A2] is the sum of the angular momenta of the atoms referred to an origin of coordinates at the center of mass of the molecule-that is, the \"internal angular momentum.\" The important point is that there is the possibility for interchange between the angular momentum of the molecules (with respect to the origin of coordinates) and their internal angular momentum (with respect to the center of mass of the molecule). This will be referred to later in connection with the equation of change for angular momentum. s0.4 Concluding Comments 7 The conservation laws as applied to collisions of monatomic molecules can be ob- tained from the results above as follows: Eqs. 0.3-1, 0.3-2, and 0.3-4 are directly applica- ble; Eq. 0.3-6 is applicable if the internal energy contributions are omitted; and Eq. 0.3-8 may be used if the internal angular momentum terms are discarded. Much of this book will be concerned with setting up the conservation laws at the mi- croscopic and macroscopic levels and applying them to problems of interest in engineer- ing and science. The above discussion should provide a good background for this adventure. For a glimpse of the conservation laws for species mass, momentum, and en- ergy at the microscopic and macroscopic levels, see Tables 19.2-1 and 23.5-1. 50.4 CONCLUDING COMMENTS To use the macroscopic balances intelligently, it is necessary to use information about in- terphase transport that comes from the equations of change. To use the equations of change, we need the transport properties, which are described by various molecular the- ories. Therefore, from a teaching point of view, it seems best to start at the molecular level and work upward toward the larger systems. All the discussions of theory are accompanied by examples to illustrate how the the- ory is applied to problem solving, Then at the end of each chapter there are problems to provide extra experience in using the ideas given in the chapter. The problems are grouped into four classes: Class A: Numerical problems, which are designed to highlight important equa- tions in the text and to give a feeling for the orders of magnitude. Class B: Analytical problems that require doing elementary derivations using ideas mainly from the chapter. Class C: More advanced analytical problems that may bring ideas from other chap- ters or from other books. Class D: Problems in which intermediate mathematical skills are required. Many of the problems and illustrative examples are rather elementary in that they in- volve oversimplified systems or very idealized models. It is, however, necessary to start with these elementary problems in order to understand how the theory works and to de- velop confidence in using it. In addition, some of these elementary examples can be very useful in making order-of-magnitude estimates in complex problems. Here are a few suggestions for studying the subject of transport phenomena: Always read the text with pencil and paper in hand; work through the details of the mathematical developments and supply any missing steps. Whenever necessary, go back to the mathematics textbooks to brush up on calculus, differential equations, vectors, etc. This is an excellent time to review the mathemat- ics that was learned earlier (but possibly not as carefully as it should have been). Make it a point to give a physical interpretation of key results; that is, get in the habit of relating the physical ideas to the equations. Always ask whether the results seem reasonable. If the results do not agree with intuition, it is important to find out which is incorrect. Make it a habit to check the dimensions of all results. This is one very good way of locating errors in derivations. We hope that the reader will share our enthusiasm for the subject of transport phe- nomena. It will take some effort to learn the material, but the rewards will be worth the time and energy required. 8 Chapter 0 The Subject of Transport Phenomena QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION What are the definitions of momentum, angular momentum, and kinetic energy for a single particle? What are the dimensions of these quantities? What are the dimensions of velocity, angular velocity, pressure, density, force, work, and torque? What are some common units used for these quantities? Verify that it is possible to go from Eq. 0.3-3 to Eq. 0.3-4. Go through all the details needed to get Eq. 0.3-6 from Eq. 0.3-5. Suppose that the origin of coordinates is shifted to a new position. What effect would that have on Eq. 0.3-7? Is the equation changed? Compare and contrast angular velocity and angular momentum. What is meant by internal energy? Potential energy? Is the law of conservation of mass always valid? What are the limitations?

For fluids of low molecu- lar weight, the physical property that characterizes the resistance to flow is the viscosity. Anyone who has bought motor oil is aware of the fact that some oils are more \"viscous\" than others and that viscosity is a function of the temperature. We begin in 31.1 with the simple shear flow between parallel plates and discuss how momentum is transferred through the fluid by viscous action. This is an elementary ex- ample of molecular momentum transport and it serves to introduce \"Newton's law of vis- cosity\" along with the definition of viscosity p. Next in 31.2 we show how Newton's law can be generalized for arbitrary flow patterns. The effects of temperature and pressure on the viscosities of gases and liquids are summarized in 51.3 by means of a dimension- less plot. Then 51.4 tells how the viscosities of gases can be calculated from the kinetic theory of gases, and in 51.5 a similar discussion is given for liquids. In 51.6 we make a few comments about the viscosity of suspensions and emulsions. Finally, we show in 31.7 that momentum can also be transferred by the bulk fluid motion and that such convective momentum transport is proportional to the fluid density p. 51.1 NEWTON'S LAW OF VISCOSITY (MOLECULAR TRANSPORT OF MOMENTUM) In Fig. 1.1-1 we show a pair of large parallel plates, each one with area A, separated by a distance Y. In the space between them is a fluid-either a gas or a liquid. This system is initially at rest, but at time t = 0 the lower plate is set in motion in the positive x direc- tion at a constant velocity V. As time proceeds, the fluid gains momentum, and ulti- mately the linear steady-state velocity profile shown in the figure is established. We require that the flow be laminar (\"laminar\" flow is the orderly type of flow that one usu- ally observes when syrup is poured, in contrast to \"turbulent\" flow, which is the irregu- lar, chaotic flow one sees in a high-speed mixer).

Common sense suggests that this force may be expressed as follows: That is, the force should be proportional to the area and to the velocity, and inversely proportional to the distance between the plates. The constant of proportionality p is a property of the fluid, defined to be the viscosity. We now switch to the notation that will be used throughout the book. First we re- place F/A by the symbol T,,, which is the force in the x direction on a unit area perpen- dicular to the y direction. It is understood that this is the force exerted by the fluid of lesser y on the fluid of greater y. Furthermore, we replace V/Y by -dvx/dy. Then, in terms of these symbols, Eq. 1.1-1 becomes This equation, which states that the shearing force per unit area is proportional to the negative of the velocity gradient, is often called Newton's law of visco~ity.~ Actually we Some authors write Eq. 1.1-2 in the form in which ryx [=] lbf/ft2, v, [=] ft/s, y [=I ft, and p [=] lb,/ft. s; the quantityg, is the \"gravitational conversion factor\" with the value of 32.174 poundals/lbf. In this book we will always use Eq. 1.1-2 rather than Eq. 1.1-2a. Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727), a professor at Cambridge University and later Master of the Mint, was the founder of classical mechanics and contributed to other fields of physics as well. Actually Eq. 1.1-2 does not appear in Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematics, but the germ of the idea is there. For illuminating comments, see D. J. Acheson, Elementary Fluid Dynamics, Oxford University Press, 1990,§6.1. 51.1 Newton's Law of Viscosity (Molecular Transport of Momentum) 13 should not refer to Eq. 1.1-2 as a \"law,\" since Newton suggested it as an empiricism3- the simplest proposal that could be made for relating the stress and the velocity gradi- ent. However, it has been found that the resistance to flow of all gases and all liquids with molecular weight of less than about 5000 is described by Eq. 1.1-2, and such fluids are referred to as Newtonian fluids. Polymeric liquids, suspensions, pastes, slurries, and other complex fluids are not described by Eq. 1.1-2 and are referred to as non-Newtonian fluids. Polymeric liquids are discussed in Chapter 8. Equation 1.1-2 may be interpreted in another fashion. In the neighborhood of the moving solid surface at y = 0 the fluid acquires a certain amount of x-momentum. This fluid, in turn, imparts momentum to the adjacent layer of liquid, causing it to remain in motion in the x direction. Hence x-momentum is being transmitted through the fluid in the positive y direction. Therefore r,, may also be interpreted as the flux of x-momentum in the positive y direction, where the term \"flux\" means \"flow per unit area.\" This interpre- tation is consistent with the molecular picture of momentum transport and the kinetic theories of gases and liquids. It also is in harmony with the analogous treatment given later for heat and mass transport. The idea in the preceding paragraph may be paraphrased by saying that momentum goes \"downhill\" from a region of high velocity to a region of low velocity-just as a sled goes downhill from a region of high elevation to a region of low elevation, or the way heat flows from a region of high temperature to a region of low temperature. The veloc- ity gradient can therefore be thought of as a \"driving force\" for momentum transport. In what follows we shall sometimes refer to Newton's law in Eq. 1.1-2 in terms of forces (which emphasizes the mechanical nature of the subject) and sometimes in terms of momentum transport (which emphasizes the analogies with heat and mass transport). This dual viewpoint should prove helpful in physical interpretations. Often fluid dynamicists use the symbol v to represent the viscosity divided by the density (mass per unit volume) of the fluid, thus: This quantity is called the kinematic viscosity. Next we make a few comments about the units of the quantities we have defined. If we use the symbol [=I to mean \"has units of,\" then in the SI system r,, [=I N/m2 = Pa, v, [= J m/s, and y [=I m, so that since the units on both sides of Eq. 1.1-2 must agree. We summarize the above and also give the units for the c.g.s. system and the British system in Table 1.1-1. The conversion tables in Appendix F will prove to be very useful for solving numerical problems involv- ing diverse systems of units. The viscosities of fluids vary over many orders of magnitude, with the viscosity of air at 20°C being 1.8 x Pa . s and that of glycerol being about 1 Pa . s, with some sili- cone oils being even more viscous. In Tables 1.1-2,l. 1-3, and 1.1-4 experimental data4 are A relation of the form of Eq. 1.1-2 does come out of the simple kinetic theory of gases (Eq. 1.4-7). However, a rigorous theory for gases sketched in Appendix D makes it clear that Eq. 1.1-2 arises as the first term in an expansion, and that additional (higher-order) terms are to be expected. Also, even an elementary kinetic theory of liquids predicts non-Newtonian behavior (Eq. 1.5-6).

Note that for gases at low density, the viscosity increases with increasing temperature, whereas for liquids the viscosity usually decreases with increasing temperature. In gases the momentum is transported by the molecules in free flight between collisions, but in liquids the transport takes place predominantly by virtue of the intermoIecular forces that pairs of molecules experience as they wind their way around among their neighbors. In g51.4 and 1.5 we give some elementary kinetic theory arguments to explain the temperature dependence of viscosity.

Usually we are interested in more complicated flows in which the three velocity compo- nents may depend on all three coordinates and possibly on time. Therefore we must have an expression more general than Eq. 1.1-2, but it must simplify to Eq. 1.1-2 for steady-state shearing flow. This generalization is not simple; in fact, it took mathematicians about a century and a half to do this. It is not appropriate for us to give all the details of this development here, since they can be found in many fluid dynamics books.' Instead we explain briefly the main ideas that led to the discovery of the required generalization of Newton's law of viscosity. To do this we consider a very general flow pattern, in which the fluid velocity may be in various directions at various places and may depend on the time t. The velocity components are then given by In such a situation, there will be nine stress components ril (where i and j may take on the designations x, y, and z), instead of the component T~ that appears in Eq. 1.1-2. We therefore must begin by defining these stress components. In Fig. 1.2-1 is shown a small cube-shaped volume element within the flow field, each face having unit area. The center of the volume element is at the position x, y, z. At Fig. 1.2-1 Pressure and viscous forces acting on planes in the fluid perpendicular to the three coordinate systems. The shaded planes have unit area. W. Prager, Introduction to Mechanics of Continua, Ginn, Boston (1961), pp. 89-91; R.

Lev Davydovich Landau (1908-1968) received the Nobel prize in 1962 for his work on liquid helium and superfluid dynamics. 12 Generalization of Newton's Law of Viscosity 17 any instant of time we can slice the volume element in such a way as to remove half the fluid within it. As shown in the figure, we can cut the volume perpendicular to each of the three coordinate directions in turn. We can then ask what force has to be applied on the free (shaded) surface in order to replace the force that had been exerted on that sur- face by the fluid that was removed. There will be two contributions to the force: that as- sociated with the pressure, and that associated with the viscous forces. The pressure force will always be perpendicular to the exposed surface. Hence in (a) the force per unit area on the shaded surface will be a vector p6,-that is, the pressure (a scalar) multiplied by the unit vector 6, in the x direction. Similarly, the force on the shaded surface in (b) will be p6,, and in (c) the force will be p6,. The pressure forces will be exerted when the fluid is stationary as well as when it is in motion. The viscous forces come into play only when there are velocity gradients within the fluid. In general they are neither perpendicular to the surface element nor parallel to it, but rather at some angle to the surface (see Fig. 1.2-1). In (a) we see a force per unit area T, exerted on the shaded area, and in (b) and (c) we see forces per unit area T, and 7,. Each of these forces (which are vectors) has components (scalars); for example, T, has components T,,, T,~, and T,,. Hence we can now summarize the forces acting on the three shaded areas in Fig. 1.2-1 in Table 1.2-1. This tabulation is a summary of the forces per unit area (stresses) exerted within a fluid, both by the thermodynamic pressure and the viscous stresses. Sometimes we will find it convenient to have a symbol that includes both types of stresses, and so we define the molecular stresses as follows: r . = paii + rii where i and j may be x, y, or z 'I (1.2-2) Here Sij is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if i = j and zero if i # j. Just as in the previous section, the r,j (and also the 'rr$ may be interpreted in two ways: rZi = pa,, + ril = force in the j direction on a unit area perpendicular to the i direction, where it is understood that the fluid in the region of lesser xi is exerting the force on the fluid of greater xi 'rrY = paij + rij = flux of j-momentum in the positive i direction-that is, from the region of lesser xi to that of greater xi Both interpretations are used in this book; the first one is particularly useful in describ- ing the forces exerted by the fluid on solid surfaces. The stresses .rr,, = p + T,,, 5, = p + ryy, 'rrzz = p + T,, are called normal stresses, whereas the remaining quantities, IT,, = T,,, 5, = T~~, . . . are called shear stresses. These quantities, which have two subscripts associ- ated with the coordinate directions, are referred to as \"tensors,\" just as quantities (such as velocity) that have one subscript associated with the coordinate directions are called Table 1.2-1 Summary of the Components of the Molecular Stress Tensor (or Molecular Momentum-Flux Tensor)\" Direction normal to the shaded Vector force per unit area on the shaded face (momentum face flux through shaded face) X Tr, = pajx + Tw Y n, = p6, + T, z m, = p6, + T, Components of the forces (per unit area) acting on the shaded face (components of the momentum flux through the shaded face) x-component y-component z-component \" These are referred to as components of the \"molecular momentum flux tensor\" because they are associated with the molecular motions, as discussed in g1.4 and Appendix D. The additional \"convective momentum flux tensor\" components, associated with bulk movement of the fluid, are discussed in 51.7. 18 Chapter 1 Viscosity and the Mechanisms of Momentum Transport I, vectors.\" Therefore we will refer to T as the z~iscous stress tensor (with components T~) and .rr as the molecular stress tensor (with components qj). When there is no chance for confusion, the modifiers \"viscous\" and \"molecular\" may be omitted. A discussion of vectors and tensors can be found in Appendix A. The question now is: How are these stresses rij related to the velocity gradients in the fluid? In generalizing Eq. 1.1-2, we put several restrictions on the stresses, as follows: The viscous stresses may be linear combinations of all the velocity gradients: dvk 7.. = -CkClp.. - where i, j, k, and 1 may be 1,2,3 (1.2-3) 11 vk' dx1 Here the 81 quantities pijkl are \"viscosity coefficients.\" The quantities x,, x,, x3 in the derivatives denote the Cartesian coordinates x, y, z, and v,, v,, v, are the same as v,, v,, v,. We assert that time derivatives or time integrals should not appear in the expres- sion. (For viscoelastic fluids, as discussed in Chapter 8, time derivatives or time in- tegrals are needed to describe the elastic responses.) We do not expect any viscous forces to be present, if the fluid is in a state of pure rotation. This requirement leads to the necessity that ri, be a symmetric combina- tion of the velocity gradients. By this we mean that if i and j are interchanged, the combination of velocity gradients remains unchanged. It can be shown that the only symmetric linear combinations of velocity gradients are If the fluid is isotropic-that is, it has no preferred direction-then the coefficients in front of the two expressions in Eq. 1.2-4 must be scalars so that We have thus reduced the number of \"viscosity coefficients\" from 81 to 2! Of course, we want Eq. 1.2-5 to simplify to Eq. 1.1-2 for the flow situation in Fig. 1.1-1. For that elementary flow Eq. 1.2-5 simplifies to T,, = A dv,/dy, and hence the scalar constant A must be the same as the negative of the viscosity p. Finally, by common agreement among most fluid dynamicists the scalar constant B is set equal to $p - K, where K is called the dilatational viscosity. The reason for writing B in this way is that it is known from kinetic theory that K is identically zero for monatomic gases at low density. Thus the required generalization for Newton's law of viscosity in Eq. 1.1-2 is then the set of nine relations (six being independent): Here T~~ = T,~, and i and j can take on the values 1,2,3. These relations for the stresses in a Newtonian fluid are associated with the names of Navier, Poisson, and ~tokes.~ If de- ' C.-L.-M.-H. Navier, Ann. Chimie, 19,244-260 (1821); S.-D. Poisson, I. ~cole Polytech., 13, Cahier 20,l-174 (1831); G. G. Stokes, Trans. Camb. Phil. Soc., 8,287-305 (1845). Claude-Louis-Marie-Henri Navier (1785-1836) (pronounced \"Nah-vyay,\" with the second syllable accented) was a civil engineer whose specialty was road and bridge building; George Gabriel Stokes (1819-1903) taught at Cambridge University and was president of the Royal Society. Navier and Stokes are well known because of the Navier-Stokes equations (see Chapter 3). See also D. J. Acheson, Elemazta y Fluid Mechanics, Oxford University Press (1990), pp. 209-212,218. 1.2 Generalization of Newton's Law of Viscosity 19 sired, this set of relations can be written more concisely in the vector-tensor notation of Appendix A as in which 6 is the unit tensor with components SV, Vv is the velocity gradient tensor with components (d/dxi)vj, (Vv)' is the \"transposer' of the velocity gradient tensor with com- ponents (d/dxj)vi, and (V . v) is the divergence of the velocity vector. The important conclusion is that we have a generalization of Eq. 1.1-2, and this gen- eralization involves not one but two coefficients3 characterizing the fluid: the viscosity p and the dilatational viscosity K. Usually, in solving fluid dynamics problems, it is not necessary to know K. If the fluid is a gas, we often assume it to act as an ideal monoatomic gas, for which K is identically zero. If the fluid is a liquid, we often assume that it is incompressible, and in Chapter 3 we show that for incompressible liquids (V v) = 0, and therefore the term containing K is discarded anyway. The dilational vis- cosity is important in describing sound absorption in polyatomic gases4 and in describ- ing the fluid dynamics of liquids containing gas bubble^.^ Equation 1.2-7 (or 1.2-6) is an important equation and one that we shall use often. Therefore it is written out in full in Cartesian (x, y, z), cylindrical (r, 8, z), and spherical (r, Of+) coordinates in Table B.1. The entries in this table for curvilinear coordinates are obtained by the methods outlined in 55A.6 and A.7. It is suggested that beginning stu- dents not concern themselves with the details of such derivations, but rather concen- trate on using the tabulated results. Chapters 2 and 3 will give ample practice in doing this. In curvilinear coordinates the stress components have the same meaning as in Carte- sian coordinates. For example, r,, in cylindrical coordinates, which will be encountered in Chapter 2, can be interpreted as: (i) the viscous force in the z direction on a unit area perpendicular to the r direction, or (ii) the viscous flux of z-momentum in the positive r direction. Figure 1.2-2 illustrates some typical surface elements and stress-tensor compo- nents that arise in fluid dynamics. The shear stresses are usually easy to visualize, but the normal stresses may cause conceptual problems. For example, T,, is a force per unit area in the z direction on a plane perpendicular to the z direction. For the flow of an incompressible fluid in the convergent channel of Fig. 1.2-3, we know intuitively that v, increases with decreas- ing z; hence, according to Eq. 1.2-6, there is a nonzero stress r,, = -2p(dv,/dz) acting in the fluid. Note on the Sign Convention for the Stress Tensor We have emphasized in connection with Eq. 1.1-2 (and in the generalization in this section) that T~~ is the force in the posi- tive x direction on a plane perpendicular to the y direction, and that this is the force ex- erted by the fluid in the region of the lesser y on the fluid of greater y. In most fluid dynamics and elasticity books, the words \"lesser\" and \"greater\" are interchanged and Eq. 1.1-2 is written as r,, = +p(dv,/dy). The advantages of the sign convention used in this book are: (a) the sign convention used in Newton's law of viscosity is consistent with that used in Fourier's law of heat conduction and Fick's law of diffusion; (b) the sign convention for rij is the same as that for the convective momentum flux pw (see Some writers refer to p as the \"shear viscosity,\" but this is inappropriate nomenclature inasmuch as p can arise in nonshearing flows as well as shearing flows. The term \"dynamic viscosity\" is also occasionally seen, but this term has a very specific meaning in the field of viscoelasticity and is an inappropriate term for p. L. Landau and E. M.

Clearly the sign convention in Eqs. 1.1-2 and 1.2-6 is arbitrary, and either sign convention can be used, provided that the physical meaning of the sign convention is clearly understood. 3 Pressure and Temperature Dependence of Viscosity 21 Fig. 1.2-3 The flow in a converging duct is an example of a situation in which the normal stresses are not zero. Since v, is a function of r and z, the normal-stress component T,, = -2p(dv,/dz) is nonzero. Also, since v, depends on r and z, the normal-stress component T,, = -2p(dvr/dr) is not equal to zero. At the wall, however, the 'z\") normal stresses all vanish far fluids described by Eq. 1.2-7 provided that the density is constant (see Example 3.1-1 and Problem 3C.2). 1.3 PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF VISCOSITY Extensive data on viscosities of pure gases and liquids are available in various science and engineering handbooks.' When experimental data are lacking and there is not time to obtain them, the viscosity can be estimated by empirical methods, making use of other data on the given substance. We present here a corresponding-states correlation, which fa- cilitates such estimates and illustrates general trends of viscosity with temperature and pressure for ordinary fluids. The principle of corresponding states, which has a sound scientific basis: is widely used for correlating equation-of-state and thermodynamic data. Discussions of this principle can be found in textbooks on physical chemistry and thermodynamics. The plot in Fig. 1.3-1 gives a global view of the pressure and temperature dependence of viscosity. The reduced viscosity pr = p/p, is plotted versus the reduced temperature T, = T/T, for various values of the reduced pressure p, = p/p,. A \"reduced quantity is one that has been made dimensionless by dividing by the corresponding quantity at the criti- cal point. The chart shows that the viscosity of a gas approaches a limit (the low-density limit) as the pressure becomes smaller; for most gases, this limit is nearly attained at 1 atm pressure. The viscosity of a gas at low density increases with increasing temperature, whereas the viscosity of a liquid decreases with increasing temperature. Experimental values of the critical viscosity p, are seldom available. However, p, may be estimated in one of the following ways: (i) if a value of viscosity is known at a given reduced pressure and temperature, preferably at conditions near to those of - - -- J. A.

Hence, the predicted value of the viscosity is p = p,(p/p,) = (189 X 1OP6)(2.39) = 452 X poise (1.3-5) The measured value6 is 455 X lop6 poise. This is unusually good agreement. 1.4 MOLECULAR THEORY OF THE VISCOSITY OF GASES AT LOW DENSITY To get a better appreciation of the concept of molecular momentum transport, we exam- ine this transport mechanism from the point of view of an elementary kinetic theory of gases. We consider a pure gas composed of rigid, nonattracting spherical molecules of di- ameter d and mass m, and the number density (number of molecules per unit volume) is taken to be n. The concentration of gas molecules is presumed to be sufficiently small that the average distance between molecules is many times their diameter d. In such a gas it is known1 that, at equilibrium, the molecular velocities are randomly directed and have an average magnitude given by (see Problem 1C.1) 7 in which K is the Boltzmann constant (see Appendix F).

The concept is appropri- ate for the rigid-sphere molecular model considered here. To determine the viscosity of a gas in terms of the molecular model parameters, we consider the behavior of the gas when it flows parallel to the m-plane with a velocity gradient dvx/dy (see Fig. 1.4-1). We assume that Eqs. 1.4-1 to 4 remain valid in this non- equilibrium situation, provided that all molecular velocities are calculated relative to the average velocity v in the region in which the given molecule had its last collision. The flux of x-momentum across any plane of constant y is found by summing the x-momenta of the molecules that cross in the positive y direction and subtracting the x-momenta of those that cross in the opposite direction, as follows: In writing this equation, we have assumed that all molecules have velocities representa- tive of the region in which they last collided and that the velocity profile vx(y) is essen- tially linear for a distance of several mean free paths. In view of the latter assumption, we may further write By combining Eqs. 1.4-2,5, and 6 we get for the net flux of x-momentum in the positive y direction This has the same form as Newton's law of viscosity given in Eq. 1.1-2. Comparing the two equations gives an equation for the viscosity 1 p = nmiiA = ipiiA (1.4-8) Velocity profile vx(y) Fig. 1.4-1 Molecular transport of x-momentum from the plane at x (y - a) to the plane at y. 4 Molecular Theory of the Viscosity of Gases at Low Density 25 or, by combining Eqs. 1.4-1,3, and 8 This expression for the viscosity was obtained by Maxwell2 in 1860. The quantity d2 is called the collision cross section (see Fig. 1.4-2). The above derivation, which gives a qualitatively correct picture of momentum transfer in a gas at low density, makes it clear why we wished to introduce the term \"momentum flux\" for rp in §1 .l. The prediction of Eq. 1.4-9 that p is independent of pressure agrees with experimen- tal data up to about 10 atm at temperatures above the critical temperature (see Fig. 1.3-1). The predicted temperature dependence is less satisfactory; data for various gases indi- cate that p increases more rapidly than 1/T. To better describe the temperature depen- dence of p, it is necessary to replace the rigid-sphere model by one that portrays the attractive and repulsive forces more accurately. It is also necessary to abandon the mean free path theories and use the Boltzmann equation to obtain the molecular velocity dis- tribution in nonequilibrium systems more accurately.

In connection with the latter, see J. C. Maxwell, Phil. Mag., 19,19, Prop. XI11 (1860); S. G. Brush, Am. J. Phys, 30,269-281 (1962). There is some controversy concerning Eqs. 1.4-4 and 1.4-9 (see S.

Williams, Diffusion in Gases and Porous Media, Plenum Press, New York (1980), s6.4. Sydney Chapman (1888-1970) taught at Imperial College in London, and thereafter was at the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colorado; in addition to hs seminal work on gas kinetic theory, he contributed to kinetic theory of plasmas and the theory of flames and detonations. David Enskog (1884-1947) (pronounced, roughly, \"Ayn-skohg\") is famous for his work on kinetic theories of low- and highdensity gases.

The Chapman-Enskog theory gives expressions for the transport properties in terms of the intermolecular potential energy &), where r is the distance between a pair of molecules undergoing a collision. The intermolecular force is then given by F(r) = -dp/dr. The exact functional form of p(r) is not known; however, for nonpolar molecules a satisfac- tory empirical expression is the Lennard-Jones (6-12) potential6 given by in which a is a characteristic diameter of the molecules, often called the collision diameter and E is a characteristic energy, actually the maximum energy of attraction between a pair of molecules. This function, shown in Fig. 1.4-3, exhibits the characteristic features of intermolecular forces: weak attractions at large separations and strong repulsions at small separations. Values of the parameters a and E are known for many substances; a partial list is given in Table E.l, and a more extensive list is available el~ewhere.~ When u and E are not known, they may be estimated from properties of the fluid at the critical point (c), the liquid at the normal boiling point (b), or the solid at the melting point (m), by means of the following empirical relations:\" Here E/K and T are in K, a is in &tgstriim units (1 A = lop1' m), ?is in ~rn~/~-rnole, and p, is in atmospheres. The viscosity of a pure monatomic gas of molecular weight M may be written in terms of the Lennard-Jones parameters as Molecules repel Molecules attract one another at one another at separations r < r,, separations r > r, I I I Whenr -3u, llcp( I has dropped off to less than 0.01 E Fig. 1.4-3 Potential energy function 0 - p(r) describing the interaction of two r spherical, nonpolar molecules. The Lennard-Jones (6-12) potential, given in Eq. 1.4-10, is one of the many em- pirical equations proposed for fitting this curve. For r < Y, the molecules repel one another, whereas for r > r, the molecules attract one another. J. E. (Lennard-)Jones, Proc. Roy. Soc., A106,441462,463477 (1924). See also R. J. Silbey and R. A. Alberty, Physical Chemistry, Wiley, 2nd edition (2001), §§11.10,16.14, and 17.9; and R. S. Berry, S. A. Rice, and J. Ross, Physical Chemistry, Oxford University Press, 2nd edition (2000), g10.2. 1.4 Molecular Theory of the Viscosity of Gases at Low Density 27 In the second form of this equation, if T [=I K and a [=I A, then p [=I g/cm s. The di- mensionless quantity (n, is a slowly varying function of the dimensionless temperature KT/&, of the order of magnitude of unity, given in Table E.2. It is called the \"collision in- tegral for viscosity,\" because it accounts for the details of the paths that the molecules take during a binary collision. If the gas were made up of rigid spheres of diameter a (in- stead of real molecules with attractive and repulsive forces), then 0, would be exactly unity. Hence the function In, may be interpreted as describing the deviation from rigid- sphere behavior. Although Eq. 1.4-14 is a result of the kinetic theory of monatomic gases, it has been found to be remarkably good for polyatomic gases as well. The reason for this is that, in the equation of conservation of momentum for a collision between polyatomic mole- cules, the center of mass coordinates are more important than the internal coordinates [see §0.3(b)l. The temperature dependence predicted by Eq. 1.4-14 is in good agreement with that found from the low-density line in the empirical correlation of Fig. 1.3-1. The viscosity of gases at low density increases with temperature, roughly as the 0.6 to 1.0 power of the absolute temperature, and is independent of the pressure. To calculate the viscosity of a gas mixture, the multicomponent extension of the Chapman-Enskog theory can be used.\"j5 Alternatively, one can use the following very satisfactory semiempirical f~rmula:~ in which the dimensionless quantities Qap are Here N is the number of chemical species in the mixture, x, is the mole fraction of species a, pa is the viscosity of pure species a at the system temperature and pressure, and Ma is the molecular weight of species a. Equation 1.4-16 has been shown to reproduce mea- sured values of the viscosities of mixtures within an average deviation of about 2%. The dependence of mixture viscosity on composition is extremely nonlinear for some mix- tures, particularly mixtures of light and heavy gases (see Problem 1A.2). To summarize, Eqs. 1.4-14, 15, and 16 are useful formulas for computing viscosities of nonpolar gases and gas mixtures at low density from tabulated values of the intermol- ecular force parameters a and E/K. They will not give reliable results for gases consisting of polar or highly elongated molecules because of the angle-dependent force fields that exist between such molecules. For polar vapors, such as H20, NH,, CHOH, and NOCl, an angle-dependent modification of Eq. 1.4-10 has given good result^.^ For the light gases H, and He below about loOK, quantum effects have to be taken into acco~nt.~ Many additional empiricisms are available for estimating viscosities of gases and gas mixtures.

However this theory does not lead to easy-to-use results. An older theory, developed by Eyring2 and coworkers, although less well grounded theoretically, does give a qualitative picture of the mechanism of momentum transport in liquids and permits rough estimation of the viscosity from other physical properties. We discuss this theory briefly. In a pure liquid at rest the individual molecules are constantly in motion. However, because of the close packing, the motion is largely confined to a vibration of each mole- cule within a \"cage\" formed by its nearest neighbors. This cage is represented by an en- ergy barrier of height AG;/I;J, in which AG: is the molar free energy of activation for escape from the cage in the stationary fluid (see Fig. 1.5-1). According to Eyring, a liquid at rest continually undergoes rearrangements, in which one molecule at a time escapes from its \"cage\" into an adjoining \"hole,\" and that the molecules thus move in each of the Vacant lattice /site or \"hole\" aye c /'@ .i T 0 VXB Layer B -0- I Fig. 1.5-1 Illustration of an escape In fluid at rest process in the flow of a liquid.

The frequency is given by the rate equation In which K and h are the Boltzmann and Planck constants, fi is the Avogadro number, and R = NK is the gas constant (see Appendix F). In a fluid that is flowing in the x direction with a velocity gradient dv,/dy, the fre- quency of molecular rearrangements is increased. The effect can be explained by consid- ering the potential energy barrier as distorted under the applied stress T,, (see Fig. 1.5-11, so that where vis the volume of a mole of liquid, and 2 (a/S)(~,v/2) is an approximation to the work done on the molecules as they move to the top of the energy barrier, moving with the applied shear stress (plus sign) or against the applied shear stress (minus sign). We now define u+ as the frequency of forward jumps and u- as the frequency of backward jumps. Then from Eqs. 1.5-1 and 1.5-2 we find that The net velocity with which molecules in layer A slip ahead of those in layer B (Fig. 1.5-1) is just the distance traveled per jump (a) times the net frequency of forward jumps (v+ - u-); this gives The velocity profile can be considered to be linear over the very small distance S between the layers A and B, so that By combining Eqs. 1.5-3 and 5, we obtain finally KT exp(-~6,'/Rn 2 sinh - )( 2') This predicts a nonlinear relation between the shear stress (momentum flux) and the ve- locity gradient-that is, non-Newtonian pow. Such nonlinear behavior is discussed further in Chapter 8. The usual situation, however, is that ~T,~/~sRT << 1. Then we can use the Taylor series (see gC.2) sinh x = x + (1 /3!)x3 + (1 /5!)x5 + . and retain only one term. Equation 1.5-6 is then of the form of Eq. 1.1-2, with the viscosity being given by The factor S/a can be taken to be unity; this simplification involves no loss of accuracy, since A(?: is usually determined empirically to make the equation agree with experimen- tal viscosity data. It has been found that free energies of activation, AG:, determined by fitting Eq. 1.5-7 to experimental data on viscosity versus temperature, are almost constant for a given 1.6 Viscosity of Suspensions and Emulsions 31 fluid and are simply related to the internal energy of vaporization at the normal boiling point, as follow^:^ AS: - 0.408 A&,, (1.5-8) By using this empiricism and setting 6/a = 1, Eq. 1.5-7 becomes h p = T exp (0.408 AU,,/RT) v The energy of vaporization at the normal boiling point can be estimated roughly from Trouton's rule With this further approximation, Eq. 1.5-9 becomes Equations 1.5-9 and 11 are in agreement with the long-used and apparently successful empiricism p = A exp(B/T). The theory, although only approximate in nature, does give the observed decrease of viscosity with temperature, but errors of as much as 30% are common when Eqs. 1.5-9 and 11 are used. They should not be used for very long slender molecules, such as n-C,,H,. There are, in addition, many empirical formulas available for predicting the viscos- ity of liquids and liquid mixtures. For these, physical chemistry and chemical engineer- ing textbooks should be consulted.* Estimate the viscosity of liquid benzene, C,H,, at 20°C (293.2K). Estimation of the Viscosity of a Pure SOLUTION Liquid Use Eq. 1.5-11 with the following information: Since this information is given in c.g.s. units, we use the values of Avogadrofs number and Planck's constant in the same set of units. Substituting into Eq. 1.5-11 gives: 1.6 VISCOSITY OF SUSPENSIONS AND EMULSIONS Up to this point we have been discussing fluids that consist of a single homogeneous phase. We now turn our attention briefly to two-phase systems. The complete descrip- tion of such systems is, of course, quite complex, but it is often useful to replace the sus- pension or emulsion by a hypothetical one-phase system, which we then describe by J. F. Kincaid, H. Eyring, and A. E. Steam, Chem. Revs., 28,301-365 (1941). See, for example, J. R. Partington, Treatise on Physical Chemistry, Longmans, Green (1949); or R. C. Reid, J. M. Prausnitz, and B. E. Poling, The Properties of Gases and Liquids, McGraw-Hill, New York, 4th edition (1987). See also P. A.

This kind of theory is satisfactory as long as the flow involved is steady; in time-dependent flows, it has been shown that Newton's law of viscosity is inappropriate, and the two-phase systems have to be regarded as viscoelastic materials.' The first major contribution to the theory of the viscosity of suspensions of spheres was that of Einstein.' He considered a suspension of rigid spheres, so dilute that the move- ment of one sphere does not influence the fluid flow in the neighborhood of any other sphere. Then it suffices to analyze only the motion of the fluid around a single sphere, and the effects of the individual spheres are additive. The Einstein equation is in which po is the viscosity of the suspending medium, and C#I is the volume fraction of the spheres. Einstein's pioneering result has been modified in many ways, a few of which we now describe. For dilute suspensions of particles of various shapes the constant has to be replaced by a different coefficient depending on the particular shape. Suspensions of elongated or flexible particles exhibit non-Newtonian visc~sit~.~\"\"~ For concentrated suspensions of spheres (that is, 4 greater than about 0.05) particle in- teractions become appreciable. Numerous semiempirical expressions have been devel- oped, one of the simplest of which is the Mooney equation7 in which 4, is an empirical constant between about 0.74 and 0.52, these values corre- sponding to the values of 4 for closest packing and cubic packing, respectively. For dilute suspensions of rigid spheres, the linear viscoelastic behavior has been studied by H. Frohlich and R. Sack, Proc. Roy. Soc., A185,415430 (1946), and for dilute emulsions, the analogous derivation has been given by J. G. Oldroyd, Proc. Roy. Soc., A218,122-132 (1953). In both of these publications the fluid is described by the Jeffreys model (see Eq. 8.4-4), and the authors found the relations between the three parameters in the Jeffreys model and the constants describing the structure of the two- phase system (the volume fraction of suspended material and the viscosities of the two phases). For further comments concerning suspensions and rheology, see R. B. Bird and J. M. Wiest, Chapter 3 in Handbook of Fluid Dynamics and Fluid Machinery, J. A. Schetz and A. E. Fuhs (eds.), Wiley, New York (1996). Albert Einstein (1879-1955) received the Nobel prize for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, not for his development of the theory of special relativity. His seminal work on suspensions appeared in A. Einstein, Ann. Phys. (Leipzig), 19,289-306 (1906); erratum, ibzd., 24,591-592 (1911). In the original publication, Einstein made an error in the derivation and got 4 instead of :4. After experiments showed that his equation did not agree with the experimental data, he recalculated the coefficient. Einstein's original derivation is quite lengthy; for a more compact development, see L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, Fluid Mechanics, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 2nd edition (19871, pp. 73-75.

As an example of this kind of theory we cite the Graham equation8 \"ff - 1 +-,$, +- -- Po : : (@(I + ;$)(I l) + @)2 in which @ = 2[(1 - -)/-I, where +,,, is the volume fraction corre- sponding to the experimentally determined closest packing of the spheres. This expres- sion simplifies to Einstein's equation for ,$, + 0 and the Frankel-Acrivos equation9 when ,$, + ,$,mar For concentrated suspensions of nonspherical particles, the Krieger-Dougherty equation'' can be used: The parameters A and dm,, to be used in this equation are tabulated1' in Table 1.6-1 for suspensions of several materials. Non-Newtonian behavior is observed for concentrated suspensions, even when the suspended particles are spherical.\" This means that the viscosity depends on the veloc- ity gradient and may be different in a shear than it is in an elongational flow. Therefore, equations such as Eq. 1.6-2 must be used with some caution.

The viscosity of dilute emul- sions is then described by the Taylor equation:\" in which pl is the viscosity of the disperse phase. It should, however, be noted that surface-active contaminants, frequently present even in carefully purified liquids, can ef- fectively stop the internal circulation;13 the droplets then behave as rigid spheres. For dilute suspensions of charged spheres, Eq. 1.6-1 may be replaced by the Smolu- chowski equafion14 in which D is the dielectric constant of the suspending fluid, k, the specific electrical con- ductivity of the suspension, the electrokinetic potential of the particles, and R the parti- cle radius. Surface charges are not uncommon in stable suspensions. Other, less well understood, surface forces are also important and frequently cause the particles to form loose aggregate^.^ Here again, non-Newtonian behavior is encountered.'\" 1.7 CONVECTIVE MOMENTUM TRANSPORT Thus far we have discussed the molecular transport of momentum, and this led to a set of quantities .rri,, which give the flux of j-momentum across a surface perpendicular to the i direction. We then related the .rrij to the velocity gradients and the pressure, and we found that this relation involved two material parameters p and K. We have seen in Ss1.4 and 1.5 how the viscosity arises from a consideration of the random motion of the mole- cules in the fluid-that is, the random molecular motion with respect to the bulk motion of the fluid. Furthermore, in Problem 1C.3 we show how the pressure contribution to 'rrij arises from the random molecular motions. Momentum can, in addition, be transported by the bulk flow of the fluid, and this process is called convective transport. To discuss this we use Fig. 1.7-1 and focus our atten- tion on a cube-shaped region in space through which the fluid is flowing. At the center of the cube (located at x, y, z) the fluid velocity vector is v. Just as in 51.2 we consider three mutually perpendicular planes (the shaded planes) through the point x, y, z, and we ask how much momentum is flowing through each of them. Each of the planes is taken to have unit area. The volume rate of flow across the shaded unit area in (a) is v,. This fluid carries with it momentum pv per unit volume. Hence the momentum flux across the shaded area is v,pv; note that this is the momentum flux from the region of lesser x to the region - -- l2 G. I. Taylor, Proc. Roy. Soc., A138,4148 (1932).

Similarly the momentum flux across the shaded area in (b) is vp, and the momentum flux across the shaded area in (c) is v,pv. These three vectors-pv,v, pvyv, and pv,v-describe the momentum flux across the three areas perpendicular to the respective axes. Each of these vectors has an x-, y-, and z-component. These components can be arranged as shown in Table 1.7-1. The quantity pv,vy is the convective flux of y-momentum across a surface perpendicular to the x direc- tion. This should be compared with the quantity T~, which is the molecular flux of y-momentum across a surface perpendicular to the x direction. The sign convention for both modes of transport is the same. The collection of nine scalar components given in Table 1.7-1 can be represented as Since each component of pw has two subscripts, each associated with a coordinate di- rection, pw is a (second-order) tensor; it is called the convective momentum-flux tensor. Table 1.7-1 for the convective momentum flux tensor components should be compared with Table 1.2-1 for the molecular momentum flux tensor components. Table 1.7-1 Summary of the Convective Momentum Flux Components Direction Flux of momentum Convective momentum flux components normal to the through the shaded shaded surface surface x-component y-component z-component 36 Chapter 1 Viscosity and the Mechanisms of Momentum Transport z A Fig. 1.7-2 The convective momentum flux through a plane .C of arbitrary orientation n is (n v)pv = [n pw]. - Next we ask what the convective momentum flux would be through a surface ele- ment whose orientation is given by a unit normal vector n (see Fig. 1.7-2). If a fluid is flowing through the surface dS with a velocity v, then the volume rate of flow through the surface, from the minus side to the plus side, is (n v)dS. Hence the rate of flow of momentum across the surface is (n v)pvdS, and the convective momentum flux is (n - v)pv. According to the rules for vector-tensor notation given in Appendix A, this can also be written as [n . pwl-that is, the dot product of the unit normal vector n with the convective momentum flux tensor pvv. If we let n be successively the unit vectors point- ing in the x, y, and z directions (i.e., &,, &,, and &,), we obtain the entries in the second col- umn of Table 1.7-1,. Similarly, the total molecular momentum flux through a surface of orientation n is given by [n . IT] = pn + [n . TI. It is understood that this is the flux from the minus side to the plus side of the surface. This quantity can also be interpreted as the force per unit area exerted by the minus material on the plus material across the surface. A geometric interpretation of [n TI is given in Problem 1D.2. In this chapter we defined the molecular transport of momentum in 91.2, and in this section we have described the convective transport of momentum. In setting up shell mo- mentum balances in Chapter 2 and in setting up the general momentum balance in Chapter 3, we shall find it useful to define the combined momentum flux, which is the sum of the molecular momentum flux and the convective momentum flux: Keep in mind that the contribution p6 contains no velocity, only the pressure; the combi- nation pvv contains the density and products of the velocity components; and the contri- bution T contains the viscosity and, for a Newtonian fluid, is linear in the velocity gradients. All these quantities are second-order tensors. Most of the time we will be dealing with components of these quantities. For exam- ple the components of + are and so on, paralleling the entries in Tables 1.2-1 and 1.7-1. The important thing to re- member is that 4, = the combined flux of y-momentum across a surface perpendicular to the x direction by molecular and convective mechanisms. The second index gives the component of momentum being transported and the first index gives the direction of transport. The various symbols and nomenclature that are used for momentum fluxes are given in Table 1.7-2. The same sign convention is used for all fluxes.

In the simplified kmetic theory in s1.4, sev- eral statements concerning the equilibrium behavior of a gas were made without proof. In this problem and the next, some of these statements are shown to be exact consequences of the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distri- bution. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular ve- locities in an ideal gas at rest is f(u,, u,, u,) = n(rn/2n-~T)~'~ exp(-rnu2/2~T) (1C.1-1) in which u is the molecular velocity, n is the number density, and f(u,, u,, u,)du,du,du, is the number of mole- cules per unit volume that is expected to have velocities between u, and u, + du,, u, and u, + du,, u, and u, + du,.

It is desired to find the frequency Z with which the molecules in an ideal gas strike a unit area of a wall from one side only. The gas is at rest and at equilibrium with a temperature T and the num- ber density of the molecules is n. All molecules have a mass m. All molecules in the region x < 0 with u, > 0 will hit an area S in the yz-plane in a short time At if they are in the volume Su,At. The number of wall collisions per unit area per unit time will be J-30 Jpm JO z = SAt Verify the above development. 1C.3 Pressure of an ideal gas.\" It is desired to get the pressure exerted by an ideal gas on a wall by accounting for the rate of momentum transfer from the molecules to the wall. (a) When a molecule traveling with a velocity v collides with a wall, its incoming velocity components are u,, u,, u,, and after a specular reflection at the wall, its components are -u,, u,, u,. Thus the net momentum transmitted to the wall by a molecule is 2mux. The molecules that have an x- component of the velocity equal to u,, and that will collide with the wall during a small time interval At, must be within the volume Su,At. How many molecules with ve- locity components in the range from u,, uy, U, to u, + Au,, u, + Au,, u, + Au, will hit an area S of the wall with a ve- locity u, within a time interval At? It will be f(u,, u,, uJdu, du,/u, times Su,At. Then the pressure exerted on the wall by the gas will be 1-y /o+m(~ux~t)(2mu,)f(uI. u,, u,)du~u~u, P = S At (lC.3-1) Explain carefully how this expression is constructed.

Chapter 2 Shell Momentum Balances and Velocity Distributions in Laminar Flow 92.1 Shell momentum balances and boundary conditions 92.2 Flow of a falling film 92.3 Flow through a circular tube 92.4 Flow through an annulus 92.5 Flow of two adjacent immiscible fluids 92.6 Creeping flow around a sphere In this chapter we show how to obtain the velocity profiles for laminar flows of fluids in simple flow systems. These derivations make use of the definition of viscosity, the ex- pressions for the molecular and convective momentum fluxes, and the concept of a mo- mentum balance. Once the velocity profiles have been obtained, we can then get other quantities such as the maximum velocity, the average velocity, or the shear stress at a surface. Often it is these latter quantities that are of interest in engineering problems. In the first section we make a few general remarks about how to set up differential momentum balances. In the sections that follow we work out in detail several classical examples of viscous flow patterns. These examples should be thoroughly understood, since we shall have frequent occasions to refer to them in subsequent chapters. Although these problems are rather simple and involve idealized systems, they are nonetheless often used in solving practical problems. The systems studied in this chapter are so arranged that the reader is gradually in- troduced to a variety of factors that arise in the solution of viscous flow problems. In 52.2 the falling film problem illustrates the role of gravity forces and the use of Cartesian co- ordinates; it also shows how to solve the problem when viscosity may be a function of position. In 52.3 the flow in a circular tube illustrates the role of pressure and gravity forces and the use of cylindrical coordinates; an approximate extension to compressible flow is given. In 52.4 the flow in a cylindrical annulus emphasizes the role played by the boundary conditions. Then in 52.5 the question of boundary conditions is pursued fur- ther in the discussion of the flow of two adjacent immiscible liquids. Finally, in 92.6 the flow around a sphere is discussed briefly to illustrate a problem in spherical coordinates and also to point out how both tangential and normal forces are handled. The methods and problems in this chapter apply only to steady flow. By \"steady\" we mean that the pressure, density, and velocity components at each point in the stream do not change with time. The general equations for unsteady flow are given in Chapter 3. 2.1 Shell Momentum Balances and Boundary Conditions 41 Fluid containing I I tiny particles Fig. 2.0-1 (a) Laminar flow, in which fluid layers move smoothly over one another in the direction of flow, and (b) turbulent flow, in which the flow pattern is complex Direction (a) O-L~) of flow and time-dependent, with considerable motion perpendicular to the principal flow direction. This chapter is concerned only with laminar flow. \"Laminar flow\" is the orderly flow that is observed, for example, in tube flow at velocities sufficiently low that tiny particles injected into the tube move along in a thin line. This is in sharp contrast with the wildly chaotic \"turbulent flow\" at sufficiently high velocities that the particles are flung apart and dispersed throughout the entire cross section of the tube. Turbulent flow is the sub- ject of Chapter 5. The sketches in Fig. 2.0-1 illustrate the difference between the two flow regimes. 2.1 SHELL MOMENTUM BALANCES AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS The problems discussed in 52.2 through 52.5 are approached by setting up momentum balances over a thin \"shell\" of the fluid. For steady pow, the momentum balance is [te momentum of in ] - r of 1 + r of ] - [rate of 1 + momentum out momentum in momentum out force of gravity by convective by convective by molecular by molecular acting on system transport transport transport transport This is a restricted statement of the law of conservation of momentum. In this chapter we apply this statement only to one component of the momentum-namely, the component in the direction of flow. To write the momentum balance we need the expressions for the convective momentum fluxes given in Table 1.7-1 and the molecular momentum fluxes given in Table 1.2-1; keep in mind that the molecular momentum flux includes both the pressure and the viscous contributions. In this chapter the momentum balance is applied only to systems in which there is just one velocity component, which depends on only one spatial variable; in addition, the flow must be rectilinear. In the next chapter the momentum balance concept is ex- tended to unsteady-state systems with curvilinear motion and more than one velocity component. The procedure in this chapter for setting up and solving viscous flow problems is as follows: Identify the nonvanishing velocity component and the spatial variable on which it depends. Write a momentum balance of the form of Eq. 2.1-1 over a thin shell perpendicular to the relevant spatial variable. Let the thickness of the shell approach zero and make use of the definition of the first derivative to obtain the corresponding differential equation for the momentum flux. 42 Chapter 2 Shell Momentum Balances and Velocity Distributions in Laminar Flow Integrate this equation to get the momentum-flux distribution. Insert Newton's law of viscosity and obtain a differential equation for the velocity. Integrate this equation to get the velocity distribution. Use the velocity distribution to get other quantities, such as the maximum veloc- ity, average velocity, or force on solid surfaces. In the integrations mentioned above, several constants of integration appear, and these are evaluated by using \"boundary conditionsu-that is, statements about the velocity or stress at the boundaries of the system. The most commonly used boundary conditions are as follows: a. At solid-fluid interfaces the fluid velocity equals the velocity with which the solid surface is moving; this statement is applied to both the tangential and the normal component of the velocity vector. The equality of the tangential components is referred to as the \"no-slip condition.'' b. At a liquid-liquid interfacial plane of constant x, the tangential velocity compo- nents v, and v, are continuous through the interface (the \"no-slip condition\") as are also the molecular stress-tensor components p + T,,, rxy, and T,,. c. At a liquid-gas interfacial plane of constant x, the stress-tensor components T,, and T,, are taken to be zero, provided that the gas-side velocity gradient is not too large. This is reasonable, since the viscosities of gases are much less than those of liquids. In all of these boundary conditions it is presumed that there is no material passing through the interface; that is, there is no adsorption, absorption, dissolution, evapora- tion, melting, or chemical reaction at the surface between the two phases. Boundary con- ditions incorporating such phenomena appear in Problems 3C.5 and llC.6, and 518.1. In this section we have presented some guidelines for solving simple viscous flow problems. For some problems slight variations on these guidelines may prove to be appropriate. , 92.2 FLOW OF A FALLING FILM The first example we discuss is that of the flow of a liquid down an inclined flat plate of length L and width W, as shown in Fig. 2.2-1. Such films have been studied in connection with wetted-wall towers, evaporation and gas-absorption experiments, and applications of coatings. We consider the viscosity and density of the fluid to be constant. A complete description of the liquid flow is difficult because of the disturbances at the edges of the system (z = 0, z = L, y = 0, y = W). An adequate description can often be Entrance disturbance ,> Liquid FA- film Liquid in T I Keservoir Exit disturbance - 1 /A \" -66 Ld f Direction of gravity Fig. 2.2-1 Schematic diagram of the falling film experiment, show- ing end effects. g2.2 Flow of a Falling Film 43 obtained by neglecting such disturbances, particularly if W and L are large compared to the film thickness 6. For small flow rates we expect that the viscous forces will prevent continued acceleration of the liquid down the wall, so that v, will become independent of z in a short distance down the plate. Therefore it seems reasonable to postulate that v, = v,(x), v, = 0, and v, = 0, and further that p = p(x). From Table B.l it is seen that the only nonvanishing components of I are then T,, = T,, = -p(dv,/dx). We now select as the \"system\" a thin shell perpendicular to the x direction (see Fig. 2.2-2). Then we set up a z-momentum balance over this shell, which is a region of thick- ness Ax, bounded by the planes z = 0 and z = L, and extending a distance Win the y di- rection. The various contributions to the momentum balance are then obtained with the help of the quantities in the \"z-component\" columns of Tables 1.2-1 and 1.7-1. By using the components of the \"combined momentum-flux tensor\" + defined in 1.7-1 to 3, we can include all the possible mechanisms for momentum transport at once: rate of z-momentum in across surface at z = O (WAX)+~~L=O rate of z-momentum out across surface at z = L (WAX)&I,=L rate of z-momentum in across surface at x (LW(+xz)Ix rate of z-momentum out across surface at x + Ax (LW(4~~)I~+~~ gravity force acting on fluid in the z direction (L W Ax)(pg cos P) By using the quantities +,, and +,, we account for the z-momentum transport by all mechanisms, convective and molecular. Note that we take the \"in\" and \"out\" directions in the direction of the positive x- and z-axes (in this problem these happen to coincide with the directions of z-momentum transport). The notation I,,,, means \"evaluated at x + Ax,\" and g is the gravitational acceleration. When these terms are substituted into the z-momentum balance of Eq. 2.1-1, we get , / \\ y= W \\ Direction of z=L gravity Fig. 2.2-2 Shell of thickness Ax over which a z-momentum balance is made. Arrows show the momentum fluxes associated with the surfaces of the shell. Since v, and v, are both zero, pvxvz and pvp, are zero. Since v, does not depend on y and z, it follows from Table B.l that T,, = 0 and T,, = 0. Therefore, the dashed-underlined fluxes do not need to be considered. Both p and pv,v, are the same at z = 0 and z = L, and therefore do not appear in the final equation for the balance of z-momentum, Eq. 2.2-10. 44 Chapter 2 Shell Momentum Balances and Velocity Distributions in Laminar Flow When this equation is divided by L W Ax, and the limit taken as Ax approaches zero, we get The first term on the left side is exactly the definition of the derivative of 4,: with respect to x. Therefore Eq. 2.2-7 becomes At this point we have to write out explicitly what the components +,, and 4,: are, mak- ing use of the definition of + in Eqs. 1.7-1 to 3 and the expressions for rxz and T,, in Ap- pendix B.1. This ensures that we do not miss out on any of the forms of momentum transport. Hence we get In accordance with the postulates that v, = v,(x), v, = 0, v, = 0, and p = p(x), we see that (i) since v, = 0, the pup, term in Eq. 2.2-9a is zero; (ii) since v, = v,(x), the term -2,u(dv,/dz) in Eq. 2.2-9b is zero; (iii) since v, = v,(x), the term pv,v, is the same at z = 0 and z = L; and (iv) since p = p(x), the contribution p is the same at z = 0 and z = L. Hence T,, depends only on x, and Eq. 2.2-8 simplifies to I I 1% = pg cos p This is the differential equation for the momentum flux T,,. It may be integrated to give The constant of integration may be-evaluated by using the boundary condition at the gas-liquid interface (see 52.1): B.C. 1: atx=O, r,,=O (2.2-12) Substitution of this boundary condition into Eq. 2.2-11 shows that C, = 0. Therefore the momentum-flux distribution is as shown in Fig. 2.2-3. Next we substitute Newton's law of viscosity into the left side of Eq. 2.2-13 to obtain which is the differential equation for the velocity distribution. It can be integrated to give 52.2 Flow of a Falling Film 45 Momentum Fig. 2.2-3 Final results for the falling film problem, showing the momentum-flux distribution and the velocity distribution. The shell of thickness Ax, over \\ which the momentum balance was made, is also shown. The constant of integration is evaluated by using the no-slip boundary condition at the solid surface: B.C. 2 at x = 6, v, = 0 (2.2-17) Substitution of this boundary condition into Eq. 2.2-16 shows that C2 = (pg cos P/24a2. Consequently, the velocity distribution is I I This parabolic velocity distribution is shown in Fig. 2.2-3. It is consistent with the postu- lates made initially and must therefore be a possible solution. Other solutions might be possible, and experiments are normally required to tell whether other flow patterns can actually arise. We return to this point after Eq. 2.2-23. Once the velocity distribution is known, a number of quantities can be calculated: (i) The maximum velocity vZ,,,, is clearly the velocity at x = 0; that is, (ii) The average velocity (v,) over a cross section of the film is obtained as follows: 46 Chapter 2 Shell Momentum Balances and Velocity Distributions in Laminar Flow The double integral in the denominator of the first line is the cross-sectional area of the film. The double integral in the numerator is the volume flow rate through a differential element of the cross section, v,dx dy, integrated over the entire cross section. (iii) The mass rate of flow w is obtained from the average velocity or by integration of the velocity distribution p2g ws3 cos p w = low IO8 pv,dxdy = pWS(v,) = 3~ (iv) The film thickness S may be given in terms of the average rate of flow as follows: (2.2-21) velocity or the mass (v) The force per unit area in the z direction on a surface element perpendicular to the x direction is +T,, evaluated at x = 6. This is the force exerted by the fluid (re- gion of lesser x) on the wall (region of greater x). The z-component of the force F of the fluid on the solid surface is obtained by integrating the shear stress over the fluid-solid interface: This is the z-component of the weight of the fluid in the entire film-as we would have expected. Experimental observations of falling films show that there are actually three \"flow regimes,\" and that these may be classified according to the Reynolds number,' Re, for the flow. For falling films the Reynolds number is defined by Re = 4S(vz)p/p. The three flow regime are then: laminar flow with negligible rippling Re < 20 laminar flow with pronounced rippling 20 < Re < 1500 turbulent flow Re > 1500 The analysis we have given above is valid only for the first regime, since the analysis was restricted by the postulates made at the outset. Ripples appear on the surface of the fluid at all Reynolds numbers. For Reynolds numbers less than about 20, the ripples are very long and grow rather slowly as they travel down the surface of the liquid; as a re- sult the formulas derived above are useful up to about Re = 20 for plates of moderate length. Above that value of Re, the ripple growth increases very rapidly, although the flow remains laminar. At about Re = 1500 the flow becomes irregular and chaotic, and the flow is said to be t~rbulent.~,~ At this point it is not clear why the value of the 'This dimensionless group is named for Osbome ~e~nblds (1842-19121, professor of engineering at the University of Manchester. He studied the laminar-turbulent transition, turbulent heat transfer, and theory of lubrication. We shall see in the next chapter that the Reynolds number is the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces. G. D. Fulford, Adv. Chem. Engr., 5,151-236 (1964); S. Whitaker, Ind. Eng. Chem.

Chang, Phys. Fluids, 30,1259-1268 (1987). s2.2 Flow of a Falling Film 47 Reynolds number should be used to delineate the flow regimes. We shall have more to say about this in g3.7. This discussion illustrates a very important point: theoretical analysis of flow sys- tems is limited by the postulates that are made in setting up the problem. It is absolutely necessary to do experiments in order to establish the flow regimes so as to know when instabilities (spontaneous oscillations) occur and when the flow becomes turbulent. Some information about the onset of instability and the demarcation of the flow regimes can be obtained by theoretical analysis, but this is an extraordinarily difficult subject. This is a result of the inherent nonlinear nature of the governing equations of fluid dy- namics, as will be explained in Chapter 3. Suffice it to say at this point that experiments play a very important role in the field of fluid dynamics. An oil has a kinematic viscosity of 2 X m2/s and a density of 0.8 X 10%g/m3. If we want to have a falling film of thickness of 2.5 mm on a vertical wall, what should the mass rate of CalCulation of Film flow the liquid be? Velocity SOLUTION According to Eq. 2.2-21, the mass rate of flow in kg/s is To get the mass rate of flow one then needs to insert a value for the width of the wall in meters. This is the desired result provided that the flow is laminar and nonrippling. To determine the flow regime we calculate the Reynolds number, making use of Eqs. 2.2-21 and 24 This Reynolds number is sufficiently low that rippling will not be pronounced, and therefore the expression for the mass rate of flow in Eq. 2.2-24 is reasonable. Rework the falling film problem for a position-dependent viscosity p = which arises when the film is nonisothermal, as in the condensation of a vapor on a wall. Here po is the vis- Falling Film with cosity at the surface of the film and a is a constant that describes how rapidly p decreases as x Variable Viscosity increases. Such a variation could arise in the flow of a condensate down a wall with a linear temperature gradient through the film. SOLUTION The development proceeds as before up to Eq. 2.2-13. Then substituting Newton's law with variable viscosity into Eq. 2.2-13 gives This equation can be integrated, and using the boundary conditions in Eq. 2.2-17 enables us to evaluate the integration constant. The velocity profile is then As a check we evaluate the velocity distribution for the constant-viscosity problem (that is, when a is zero). However, setting a = 0 gives GO - in the two expressions within parentheses. 48 Chapter 2 Shell Momentum Balances and Velocity Distributions in Laminar Flow This difficulty can be overcome if we expand the two exponentials in Taylor series (see §C.2), as follows: - - pgs2 cos p .-[(-+-a+ 11 ..a)-( L~-II',+ Po 0-0 2 3 282 383 . . .)I which is in agreement with Eq. 2.2-18. From Eq. 2.2-27 it may be shown that the average velocity is pgs2 cos p (vz> = Po [.(A - -$ + 4) - 21 The reader may verify that this result simplifies to Eq. 2.2-20 when a goes to zero. s2.3 FLOW THROUGH A CIRCULAR TUBE The flow of fluids in circular tubes is encountered frequently in physics, chemistry, biol- ogy, and engineering. The laminar flow of fluids in circular tubes may be analyzed by means of the momentum balance described in 52.1. The only new feature introduced here is the use of cylindrical coordinates, which are the natural coordinates for describ- ing positions in a pipe of circular cross section. We consider then the steady-state, laminar flow of a fluid of constant density p and viscosity p in a vertical tube of length L and radius R. The liquid flows downward under the influence of a pressure difference and gravity; the coordinate system is that shown in Fig. 2.3-1. We specify that the tube length be very large with respect to the tube radius, so that \"end effects\" will be unimportant throughout most of the tube; that is, we can ig- nore the fact that at the tube entrance and exit the flow will not necessarily be parallel to the tube wall. We postulate that v, = v,(r), vr = 0, v, = 0, and p = p(z). With these postulates it may be seen from Table B.l that the only nonvanishing components of 7 are rrz = rZr = -p(dv,/dr). We select as our system a cylindrical shell of thickness Ar and length L and we begin by listing the various contributions to the z-momentum balance: rate of z-momentum in (2~Ar)(#41z=0 (2.3-1) across annular surface at z = 0 rate of z-momentum out (2~rAr)($,,)J,=~ (2.3-2) across annular surface at z = L rate of z-momentum in (2d)($,)(, = (2flL$,)(, (2.3-3) across cylindrical surface at r rate of 2-momentum out (2dr + Ar)L)(+J/r+Ar = (2mL$J/r+Ar (2.3-4) across cylindrical surface at r + Ar gravity force acting in (2wArL)pg (2.3-5) z direction on cylindrical shell Flow Through a Circular Tube 49 4zz),=o =flux of z-momentum of z-momentum outatz=L Fig. 2.3-1 Cylindrical shell of fluid over which the z-momentum bal- ance is made for axial flow in a cir- cular tube (see Eqs. 2.3-1 to 5). The z-momentum fluxes 4, and +,, are given in full in Eqs. 2.3-9a and 9b. 4rzI r + Ar = flux of z-momentum out at r + Ar + Tube wall The quantities +,, and +,, account for the momentum transport by all possible mecha- nisms, convective and molecular. In Eq. 2.3-4, (Y + Ar) and (r)l,+,, are two ways of writ- ing the same thing. Note that we take \"in\" and \"out\" to be in the positive directions of the Y- and z-axes. We now add up the contributions to the momentum balance: When we divide Eq. (2.3-8) by 2.irLAr and take the limit as Ar + 0, we get The expression on the left side is the definition of the first derivative of r4,, with respect to r. Hence Eq. 2.3-7 may be written as Now we have to evaluate the components 4, and +,, from Eq. 1.7-1 and Appendix B.l: Next we take into account the postulates made at the beginning of the problem-namely, that vz = v,(r), V, = 0, vg = 0, and p = p(z). Then we make the following simplifications: 50 Chapter 2 Shell Momentum Balances and Velocity Distributions in Laminar Flow (i) because v, = 0, we can drop the term pqv, in Eq. 2.3-9a; (ii) because v, = v,(r), the term pvzvz will be the same at both ends of the tube; and (iii) because vZ = vZ(r), the term -2pdv,/dz will be the same at both ends of the tube. Hence Eq. 2.3-8 simplifies to in which 9 = p - pgz is a convenient abbreviation for the sum of the pressure and gravi- tational terms.' Equation 2.3-10 may be integrated to give The constant C1 is evaluated by using the boundary condition B.C. 1: at r = 0, T,~ = finite (2.3-12) Consequently C1 must be zero, for otherwise the momentum flux would be infinite at the axis of the tube. Therefore the momentum flux distribution is 1 This distribution is shown in Fig. 2.3-2. Newton's law of viscosity for this situation is obtained from Appendix B.2 as follows: Substitution of this expression into Eq. 2.3-13 then gives the following differential equa- tion for the velocity: Parabolic velocity distribution uz(r) Linear momentum- flux distribution ~,,(r) Fig. 2.3-2 The momentum-flux distribution and velocity distribu- I tion for the downward flow in a circular tube. ' The quantity designated by 9 is called the modified pressure. In general it is defined by 9 = p + pgh, where h is the distance \"upwardv-that is, in the direction opposed to gravity from some preselected reference plane. Hence in this problem h = -z. 52.3 Flow Through a Circular Tube 51 This first-order separable differential equation may be integrated to give The constant C2 is evaluated from the boundary condition B.C. 2: at r = R, v, = 0 From this C, is found to be (Yo - 9,)~~/4pL. Hence the velocity distribution is We see that the velocity distribution for laminar, incompressible flow of a Newtonian fluid in a long tube is parabolic (see Fig. 2.3-2). Once the velocity profile has been established, various derived quantities can be obtained: (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) The maximum velocity v,,,,, occurs at r = 0 and is The average velocity (v,) is obtained by dividing the total volumetric flow rate by the cross-sectional area The mass rate of flow w is the product of the cross-sectional area ,rrR2, the density p, and the average velocity (v,) This rather famous result is called the Hagen-~oiseuille~ equation. It is used, along with experimental data for the rate of flow and the modified pressure difference, to determine the viscosity of fluids (see Example 2.3-1) in a \"capillary viscometer.\" The z-component of the force, F,, of the fluid on the wetted surface of the pipe is just the shear stress 7,, integrated over the wetted area This result states that the viscous force F, is counterbalanced by the net pres- sure force and the gravitational force. This is exactly what one would obtain from making a force balance over the fluid in the tube. G. Hagen, Ann. Phys. Chern., 46,423442 (1839); J. L. Poiseuille, Comptes Rendus, 11,961 and 1041 (1841). Jean Louis Poiseuille (1799-1869) (pronounced \"Pwa-zd-yuh,\" with d is roughly the \"00\" in book) was a physician interested in the flow of blood. Although Hagen and Poiseuille established the dependence of the flow rate on the fourth power of the tube radius, Eq. 2.3-21 was first derived by E. Hagenbach, Pogg. Annalen der Physik u. Chemie, 108,385-426 (1860). 52 Chapter 2 Shell Momentum Balances and Velocity Distributions in Laminar Flow The results of this section are only as good as the postulates introduced at the begin- ning of the section-namely, that v, = v,(r) and p = p(z). Experiments have shown that these postulates are in fact realized for Reynolds numbers up to about 2100; above that value, the flow will be turbulent if there are any appreciable disturbances in the sys- tem-that is, wall roughness or vibration^.^ For circular tubes the Reynolds number is defined by Re = D(V,)~/~, where D = 2R is the tube diameter. We now summarize all the assumptions that were made in obtaining the Hagen- Poiseuille equation. (a) The flow is laminar; that is, Re must be less than about 2100. (b) The density is constant (\"incompressible flow\"). (c) The flow is \"steady\" (i.e., it does not change with time). (d) The fluid is Newtonian (Eq. 2.3-14 is valid). (e) End effects are neglected. Actually an \"entrance length,\" after the tube entrance, of the order of L, = 0.035D Re, is needed for the buildup to the parabolic profile. If the section of pipe of interest includes the entrance region, a correction must be a~plied.~ The fractional correction in the pressure difference or mass rate of flow never exceeds L,/L if L > L,. (f) The fluid behaves as a continuum-this assumption is valid, except for very di- lute gases or very narrow capillary tubes, in which the molecular mean free path is comparable to the tube diameter (the \"slip flow region\") or much greater than the tube diameter (the \"Knudsen flow\" or \"free molecule flow\" regime).5 (g) There is no slip at the wall, so that B.C. 2 is valid; this is an excellent assumption for pure fluids under the conditions assumed in (0. See Problem 2B.9 for a dis- cussion of wall slip. Glycerine (CH20H . CHOH . CH20H) at 26.5\"C is flowing through a horizontal tube 1 ft long and with 0.1 in. inside diameter. For a pressure drop of 40 psi, the volume flow rate w/p is Determination of 0.00398 ft3/min. The density of glycerine at 26.5\"C is 1.261 g/cm3.

Furthermore, the entrance length is L, = 0.035D Re = (0.035)(0.1/12)(2.41) = 0.0007 ft Hence, entrance effects are not important, and the viscosity value given above has been calcu- lated properly. Obtain an expression for the mass rate of flow w for an ideal gas in laminar flow in a long cir- cular tube. The flow is presumed to be isothermal. Assume that the pressure change through the tube is not very large, so that the viscosity can be regarded a constant throughout. SOLUTION This problem can be solved approximately by assuming that the Hagen-Poiseuille equation (Eq. 2.3-21) can be applied over a small length dz of the tube as follows: To eliminate p in favor of p, we use the ideal gas law in the form plp = po/po, where po and po are the pressure and density at z = 0. This gives The mass rate of flow w is the same for all z. Hence Eq. 2.3-27 can be integrated from z = 0 to z = L to give where pa,, = + pL) is the average density calculated at the average pressure pa,, = 1 2@0 + PL). 52.4 FLOW THROUGH AN ANNULUS We now solve another viscous flow problem in cylindrical coordinates, namely the steady-state axial flow of an incompressible liquid in an annular region between two coaxial cylinders of radii KR and R as shown in Fig. 2.4-1. The fluid is flowing upward in L. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, Fluid Mechanics, Pergamon, 2nd edition (1987), 917, Problem 6. A perturbation solution of this problem was obtained by R. K. Prud'homme, T. W. Chapman, and J. R. Bowen, Appl. Sci. Res, 43,67-74 (1986). 54 Chapter 2 Shell Momentum Balances and Velocity Distributions in Laminar Flow Fig. 2.4-1 The momentum-flux distribution and velocity distribution for the upward flow in a cylindrical annulus. Note that the momentum flux changes sign at the same value of r for which the velocity has a Velocity distribution maximum. Shear stress or momentum- flux distribution the tubethat is, in the direction opposed to gravity. We make the same postulates as in 52.3: v, = v,(r), v, = 0, v, = 0, and p = p(z). Then when we make a momentum balance over a thin cylindrical shell of liquid, we arrive at the following differential equation: This differs from Eq. 2.3-10 only in that 9 = p + pgz here, since the coordinate z is in the direction opposed to gravity (i.e., z is the same as the h of footnote 1 in 52.3). Integration of Eq. 2.4-1 gives just as in Eq. 2.3-1 1. The constant C, cannot be determined immediately, since we have no information about the momentum flux at the fixed surfaces r = KR and r = R. All we know is that there will be a maximum in the velocity curve at some (as yet unknown) plane r = AR at which the momentum flux will be zero. That is, When we solve this equation for C, and substitute it into Eq. 2.4-2, we get The only difference between this equation and Eq. 2.4-2 is that the constant of integration C, has been eliminated in favor of a different constant A. The advantage of this is that we know the geometrical significance of A. We now substitute Newton's law of viscosity, T,, = -p(dv,/dr), into Eq. 2.4-4 to ob- tain a differential equation for v, 92.4 Flow Through an Annulus 55 Integration of this first-order separable differential equation then gives We now evaluate the two constants of integration, A and C,, by using the no-slip condi- tion on each solid boundary: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: Substitution of these boundary conditions into Eq. 2.4-6 then gives two simultaneous equations: o=K~-u~I~K+c~; O=1 +C2 (2.4-9, 10) From these the two integration constants A and C2 are found to be These expressions can be inserted into Eqs. 2.4-4 and 2.4-6 to give the momentum-flux distribution and the velocity distribution' as follows: Note that when the annulus becomes very thin (i.e., K only slightly less than unity), these results simplify to those for a plane slit (see Problem 2B.5). It is always a good idea to check \"limiting cases\" such as these whenever the opportunity presents itself. The lower limit of K + 0 is not so simple, because the ratio ln(R/r)/ln(l/~) will al- ways be important in a region close to the inner boundary. Hence Eq. 2.4-14 does not simplify to the parabolic distribution. However, Eq. 2.4-17 for the mass rate of flow does simplify to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. Once we have the momentum-flux and velocity distributions, it is straightforward to get other results of interest: (i) The maximum velocity is where h2 is given in Eq. 2.4-12. (ii) The average velocity is given by (iii) The mass rate offlow is w = ~\"~(1 - K~)~(V,), or H. Lamb, Hydrodynamics, Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition (1895), p. 522. 56 Chapter 2 Shell Momentum Balances and Velocity Distributions in Laminar Flow (iv) The force exerted by the fluid on the solid surfaces is obtained by summing the forces acting on the inner and outer cylinders, as follows: The reader should explain the choice of signs in front of the shear stresses above and also give an interpretation of the final result. The equations derived above are valid only for laminar flow. The laminar-turbulent transition occurs in the neighborhood of Re = 2000, with the Reynolds number defined as Re = 2R(1 - ~)(v,)p/p. 52.5 FLOW OF TWO ADJACENT IMMISCIBLE FLUIDS' Thus far we have considered flow situations with solid-fluid and liquid-gas boundaries. We now give one example of a flow problem with a liquid-liquid interface (see Fig. 2.5-1). Two immiscible, incompressible liquids are flowing in the z direction in a horizontal thin slit of length L and width W under the influence of a horizontal pressure gradient (po - p,)/L. The fluid flow rates are adjusted so that the slit is half filled with fluid I (the more dense phase) and half filled with fluid I1 (the less dense phase). The fluids are flow- ing sufficiently slowly that no instabilities occur-that is, that the interface remains ex- actly planar. It is desired to find the momentum-flux and velocity distributions. A differential momentum balance leads to the following differential equation for the momentum flux: This equation is obtained for both phase I and phase 11. Integration of Eq. 2.5-1 for the two regions gives Velocity distribution, Plane of zero shear stress - - - - - - - Shear stress or momentum- flux distribution Fig. 2.5-1 Flow of two immiscible fluids between a pair of horizontal plates under the influence of a pressure gradient. The adjacent flow of gases and liquids in conduits has been reviewed by A. E. Dukler and M. Wicks, 111, in Chapter 8 of Modern Chemical Engineering, Vol. 1, \"Physical Operations,\" A. Acrivos (ed.), Reinhold, New York (1963). 52.5 Flow of Two Adjacent Immiscible Fluids 57 We may immediately make use of one of the boundary conditions-namely, that the momentum flux T,, is continuous through the fluid-fluid interface: B.C. 1: at x = 0, 7', = ez (2.5-4) This tells us that C: = Cil; hence we drop the superscript and call both integration con- stants C,. When Newton's law of viscosity is substituted into Eqs. 2.5-2 and 2.5-3, we get These two equations can be integrated to give The three integration constants can be determined from the following no-slip boundary conditions: B.C. 2: atx = 0, v! = .i' (2.5-9) B.C. 3: atx = -b, v; = 0 (2.5-10) B.C. 4: atx = +b, v! = 0 (2.5-11) When these three boundary conditions are applied, we get three simultaneous equations for the integration constants: from B.C. 2: C: = C; (2.5-12) from B.C. 3: from B.C. 4: From these three equations we get The resulting momentum-flux and velocity profiles are I - = 'pa ;pJb [((X - ( )] ( (2.5-17) 58 Chapter 2 Shell Momentum Balances and Velocity Distributions in Laminar Flow These distributions are shown in Fig. 2.5-1. If both viscosities are the same, then the ve- locity distribution is parabolic, as one would expect for a pure fluid flowing between parallel plates (see Eq. 2B.3-2). The average velocity in each layer can be obtained and the results are From the velocity and momentum-flux distributions given above, one can also calculate the maximum velocity, the velocity at the interface, the plane of zero shear stress, and the drag on the walls of the slit. 52.6 CREEPING FLOW AROUND A SPHERE^^^^^^^ In the preceding sections several elementary viscous flow problems have been solved. These have all dealt with rectilinear flows with only one nonvanishing velocity compo- nent. Since the flow around a sphere involves two nonvanishing velocity components, v, and v,, it cannot be conveniently understood by the techniques explained at the begin- ning of this chapter. Nonetheless, a brief discussion of flow around a sphere is warranted here because of the importance of flow around submerged objects. In Chapter 4 we show how to obtain the velocity and pressure distributions. Here we only cite the results and show how they can be used to derive some important relations that we need in later dis- cussions. The problem treated here, and also in Chapter 4, is concerned with \"creeping flowu-that is, very slow flow. This type of flow is also referred to as \"Stokes flow.\" We consider here the flow of an incompressible fluid about a solid sphere of radius R and diameter D as shown in Fig. 2.6-1. The fluid, with density p and viscosity p, ap- Radius of sphere = R ' t At every point there are pressure and friction forces acting on the Fluid approaches from below with velocity v, I Point in space (x, y, z) or (r, 0,4) Projection of point on xy-plane Fig. 2.6-1 Sphere of radius R around which a fluid is flow- ing. The coordinates r, 8, and 4 are shown. For more informa- tion on spherical coordinates, see Fig. A.8-2. G. G. Stokes, Trans. Cambridge Phil. Soc., 9,8-106 (1851). For creeping flow around an object of arbitrary shape, see H. Brenner, Chem. Engr. Sci., 19,703-727 (1964). L. D. Landau and E. M.

Karrila, Microhydrodynamics: Principles and Selected Applications, Butterworth- Heinemann, Boston (1991), s4.2.3; this book contains a thorough discussion of \"creeping flow\" problems. 92.6 Creeping Flow Around a Sphere 59 proaches the fixed sphere vertically upward in the z direction with a uniform velocity v,. For this problem, \"creeping flow\" means that the Reynolds number Re = Dv,p/p is less than about 0.1. This flow regime is characterized by the absence of eddy formation downstream from the sphere. The velocity and pressure distributions for this creeping flow are found in Chapter 4 to be I 1 vB =..[-I + t(:) ++(:I sin, p =pa - pgz 2 R cos 8 In the last equation the quantity pa is the pressure in the plane z = 0 far away from the sphere. The term -pgz is the hydrostatic pressure resulting from the weight of the fluid, and the term containing v, is the contribution of the fluid motion. Equations 2.6-1,2, and 3 show that the fluid velocity is zero at the surface of the sphere. Furthermore, in the limit as r + a, the fluid velocity is in the z direction with uniform magnitude v,; this fol- lows from the fact that v, = v, cos 8 - v, sin 8, which can be derived by using Eq. A.6-33, and v, = vy = 0, which follows from Eqs. A.6-31 and 32. The components of the stress tensor T in spherical coordinates may be obtained from the velocity distribution above by using Table B.1. They are - rrB - TBr = - - pvm(~)I sin B 2R 7 and all other components are zero. Note that the normal stressks for this flow are nonzero, except at r = R. Let us now determine the force exerted by the flowing fluid on the sphere. Because of the symmetry around the z-axis, the resultant force will be in the z direction. There- fore the force can be obtained by integrating the z-components of the normal and tan- gential forces over the sphere surface. Integration of the Normal Force At each point on the surface of the sphere the fluid exerts a force per unit area -(p + T,,)[,=~ on the solid, acting normal to the surface. Since the fluid is in the region of greater r and the sphere in the region of lesser r, we have to affix a minus sign in accordance with the sign convention established in 51.2. The z-component of the force 60 Chapter 2 Shell Momentum Balances and Velocity Distributions in Laminar Flow is -(p + T,,)(,,~(cos 0). We now multiply this by a differential element of surface R2 sin 0 d0 d+ to get the force on the surface element (see Fig. A.8-2). Then we inte- grate over the surface of the sphere to get the resultant normal force in the z direction: According to Eq. 2.6-5, the normal stress r, is zero5 at r = R and can be omitted in the in- tegral in Eq. 2.6-7. The pressure distribution at the surface of the sphere is, according to Eq. 2.6-4, 3 PVw plr=R = po - pgR cos 8 - - - cos 0 2 R (2.6-8) When this is substituted into Eq. 2.6-7 and the integration performed, the term contain- ing p0 gives zero, the term containing the gravitational acceleration g gives the buoyant force, and the term containing the approach velocity v, gives the \"form drag\" as shown below: F'\"' = $d3pg + 2~,uRv, (2.6-9) The buoyant force is the mass of displaced fluid (~TR~~) times the gravitational accelera- tion (g). Integration of the Tangential Force At each point on the solid surface there is also a shear stress acting tangentially. The force per unit area exerted in the -0 direction by the fluid (region of greater r) on the solid (region of lesser r) is +rY8~,=,. The 2-component of this force per unit area is (T,&~) sin 0. We now multiply this by the surface element R2 sin 0 d0d+ and integrate over the entire spherical surface. This gives the resultant force in the z direction: The shear stress distribution on the sphere surface, from Eq. 2.6-6, is Substitution of this expression into the integral in Eq. 2.6-10 gives the \"friction drag\" Hence the total force F of the fluid on the sphere is given by the sum of Eqs. 2.6-9 and 2.6-12: F = $TR~~~ + 2~,uRv, + ~T~Rv, buoyant form friction force drag drag F = F, + F, = $rR3pg + 6r,uRv, buoyant kinetic force force -- In Example 3.1-1 we show that, for incompressible, Newtonian fluids, all three of the normal stresses are zero at fixed solid surfaces in all flows. s2.6 Creeping Flow Around a Sphere 61 The first term is the buoyant force, which would be present in a fluid at rest; it is the mass of the displaced fluid multiplied by the gravitational acceleration. The second term, the kinetic force, results from the motion of the fluid. The relation is known as Stokes' law.' It is used in describing the motion of colloidal particles under an electric field, in the theory of sedimentation, and in the study of the motion of aerosol particles. Stokes' law is useful only up to a Reynolds number Re = Dv,p/p of about 0.1. At Re = 1, Stokes' law predicts a force that is about 10% too low. The flow behavior for larger Reynolds numbers is discussed in Chapter 6. This problem, which could not be solved by the shell balance method, emphasizes the need for a more general method for coping with flow problems in which the stream- lines are not rectilinear. That is the subject of the following chapter. Derive a relation that enables one to get the viscosity of a fluid by measuring the terminal ve- locity v, of a small sphere of radius R in the fluid. Determination of Viscosity from the SOLUTION Terminal Velocity ,fa Falling Sphere If a small sphere is allowed to fall from rest in a viscous fluid, it will accelerate until it reaches a constant velocity-the terminal velocity. When this steady-state condition has been reached the sum of all the forces acting on the sphere must be zero. The force of gravity on the solid acts in the direction of fall, and the buoyant and kinetic forces act in the opposite direction: Here p, and p are the densities of the solid sphere and the fluid. Solving this equation for the terminal velocity gives This result may be used only if the Reynolds number is less than about 0.1. This experiment provides an apparently simple method for determining viscosity. How- ever, it is difficult to keep a homogeneous sphere from rotating during its descent, and if it does rotate, then Eq. 2.6-17 cannot be used. Sometimes weighted spheres are used in order to preclude rotation; then the left side of Eq. 2.6-16 has to be replaced by m, the mass of the sphere, times the gravitational acceleration.

Show that the ve- locity distribution is then given by and then use this to get the average velocity. Show how one can get Eq. 2B.1-1 from Eq. 2.2-18 by making a change of variable. Alternate procedure for solving flow problems. In this chapter we have used the following procedure: (i) derive an equation for the momentum flux, (ii) integrate this equation, (iii) insert Newton's law to get a first-order differential equation for the velocity, (iv) integrate the latter to get the velocity distribution. Another method is: (i) derive an equation for the momentum flux, (ii) insert Newton's law to get a second-order differential equation for the velocity profile, (iii) integrate the latter to get the velocity distribution. Apply this second method to the falling film problem by substituting Eq. 2.2-14 into Eq. 2.2-10 and continuing as directed until the ve- locity distribution has been obtained and the integration constants evaluated. 28.3 Laminar flow in a narrow slit (see Fig. 2B.3). Fluid in I Fig. 2B.3 Flow through a slit, with B << W << L. (a) A Newtonian fluid is in laminar flow in a narrow slit formed by two parallel walls a dis- tance 2B apart.

Draw carefully labeled sketches of these functions. 2B.5 Interrelation of slit and annulus formulas. When an annulus is very thin, it may, to a good approximation, be considered as a thin slit. Then the results of Problem 2B.3 can be taken over with suitable modifications. For example, the mass rate of flow in an annulus with outer wall of radius R and inner wall of radius (1 - s)R, where 8 is small, may be obtained from Problem 2B.3 by replacing 2B by EX, and W by 2dl - ;.SIR. In this way we get for the mass rate of flow: Show that this same result may be obtained from Eq. 2.4-17 by setting K equal to 1 - every- where in the formula and then expanding the expression for w in powers of &. This requires using the Taylor series (see 5C.2) and then performing a long division. The first term in the resulting series will be Eq. 2B.5-1. Cau- tion: In the derivation it is necessary to use the first four terms of the Taylor series in Eq. 2B.5-2. 2B.6 Flow of a film on the outside of a circular tube (see Fig. 2B.6).

Why? 2B.9 Low-density phenomena in compressible tube flodr3 (Fig. 2B.9). As the pressure is de- creased in the system studied in Example 2.3-2, deviations from Eqs. 2.3-28 and 2.3-29 arise. The gas behaves as if it slips at the tube wall. It is conventional2 to replace the customary \"no- slip\" boundary condition that v, = 0 at the tube wall by in which 5 is the slip coefficient. Repeat the derivation in Example 2.3-2 using Eq. 2B.9-1 as the boundary condition. Also make use of the experimental fact that the slip coefficient varies in- versely with the pressure ( = Jo/p, in which & is a constant. Show that the mass rate of flow is in which pa,, = $(po + p,). When the pressure is decreased further, a flow regime is reached in which the mean free path of the gas molecules is large with respect to the tube radius (Knudsen flow). In that regime3 in which m is the molecular mass and K is the Boltzmann constant. In the derivation of this re- sult it is assumed that all collisions of the molecules with the solid surfaces are diffuse and not specular.

The approximation used here that a flow between nonparallel surfaces can be regarded locally as flow between parallel surfaces is sometimes referred to as the lubri- cation approximation and is widely used in the theory of lubrication.

A cone-and-plate viscometer consists of a stationary flat plate and an inverted cone, whose apex just contacts the plate. The liquid whose viscosity is to be measured is placed in the gap between the cone and plate. The cone is rotated at a known angular velocity a, and the torque T, required to turn the cone is mea- sured.

You have received a manuscript to referee for a technical journal. The paper deals with heat transfer in tube flow. The authors state that, because they are concerned with nonisothermal flow, they must have a \"general\" expression for the veloc- ity distribution, one that can be used even when the viscosity of the fluid is a function of tem- perature (and hence position). The authors state that a \"general expression for the velocity distribution for flow in a tube\" is in which y = r/R. The authors give no derivation, nor do they give a literature citation.

Under the proper circumstances the simple apparatus shown in the figure can be used to measure the rate of climb of an airplane. The gauge pressure inside the Bourdon element is taken as proportional to the rate of climb. For the purposes of this problem the apparatus may be assumed to have the following properties: (i) the capillary tube (of radius R and length L, with R << L) is of negligible volume but ap- preciable flow resistance; (ii) the Bourdon element has a constant volume V and offers negli- gible resistance to flow; and (iii) flow in the capillary is laminar and incompressible, and the volumetric flow rate depends only on the conditions at the ends of the capillary.

The shell bal- ance approach was used to acquaint the novice with the notion of a momentum balance. Even though we made no mention of it in Chapter 2, at several points we tacitly made use of the idea of a mass balance. It is tedious to set up a shell balance for each problem that one encounters. What we need is a general mass balance and a general momentum balance that can be applied to any problem, including problems with nonrectilinear motion. That is the main point of this chapter. The two equations that we derive are called the equation of continuity (for the mass balance) and the equation of motion (for the momentum balance). These equations can be used as the starting point for studying all problems involving the isothermal flow of a pure fluid. In Chapter 11 we enlarge our problem-solving capability by developing the equa- tions needed for nonisothermal pure fluids by adding an equation for the temperature. In Chapter 19 we go even further and add equations of continuity for the concentra- tions of the individual species. Thus as we go from Chapter 3 to Chapter 11 and on to Chapter 19 we are able to analyze systems of increasing complexity, using the com- plete set of equations of change. It should be evident that Chapter 3 is a very important chapter-perhaps the most important chapter in the book-and it should be mastered thoroughly. In 53.1 the equation of continuity is developed by making a mass balance over a small element of volume through which the fluid is flowing. Then the size of this ele- ment is allowed to go to zero (thereby treating the fluid as a continuum), and the desired partial differential equation is generated. 76 Chapter 3 The Equations of Change for Isothermal Systems In 53.2 the equation of motion is developed by making a momentum balance over a small element of volume and letting the volume element become infinitesimally small. Here again a partial differential equation is generated. This equation of motion can be used, along with some help from the equation of continuity, to set up and solve all the problems given in Chapter 2 and many more complicated ones. It is thus a key equation in transport phenomena. In 53.3 and 53.4 we digress briefly to introduce the equations of change for mechani- cal energy and angular momentum. These equations are obtained from the equation of motion and hence contain no new physical information. However, they provide a conve- nient starting point for several applications in this book-particularly the macroscopic balances in Chapter 7. In 53.5 we introduce the \"substantial derivative.\" This is the time derivative follow- ing the motion of the substance (i.e., the fluid). Because it is widely used in books on fluid dynamics and transport phenomena, we then show how the various equations of change can be rewritten in terms of the substantial derivatives. In 53.6 we discuss the solution of flow problems by use of the equations of continu- ity and motion. Although these are partial differential equations, we can solve many problems by postulating the form of the solution and then discarding many terms in these equations. In this way one ends up with a simpler set of equations to solve. In this chapter we solve only problems in which the general equations reduce to one or more ordinary differential equations. In Chapter 4 we examine problems of greater complexity that require some ability to solve partial differential equations. Then in Chapter 5 the equations of continuity and motion are used as the starting point for discussing turbu- lent flow. Later, in Chapter 8, these same equations are applied to flows of polymeric liq- uids, which are non-Newtonian fluids. Finally, 53.7 is devoted to writing the equations of continuity and motion in di- mensionless form. This makes clear the origin of the Reynolds number, Re, often men- tioned in Chapter 2, and why it plays a key role in fluid dynamics. This discussion lays the groundwork for scale-up and model studies. In Chapter 6 dimensionless numbers arise again in connection with experimental correlations of the drag force in complex systems. At the end of 52.2, we emphasized the importance of experiments in fluid dynamics. We repeat those words of caution here and point out that photographs and other types of flow visualization have provided us with a much deeper understanding of flow prob- lems than would be possible by theory alone.' Keep in mind that when one derives a flow field from the equations of change, it is not necessarily the only physically admissi- ble solution. Vector and tensor notations are occasionally used in this chapter, primarily for the purpose of abbreviating otherwise lengthy expressions. The beginning student will find that only an elementary knowledge of vector and tensor notation is needed for reading this chapter and for solving flow problems. The advanced student will find Appendix A helpful in getting a better understanding of vector and tensor manipulations. With re- gard to the notation, it should be kept in mind that we use lightface italic symbols for scalars, boldface Roman symbols for vectors, and boldface Greek symbols for tensors. Also dot-product operations enclosed in ( ) are scalars, and those enclosed in I I are vectors. -- ' We recommend particularly M.

The arrows indicate the mass flux in and out \\I of the volume at the two shaded faces lo- x cated at x and x + Ax. 3.1 THE EQUATION OF CONTINUITY This equation is developed by writing a mass balance over a volume element Ax Ay Az, fixed in space, through which a fluid is flowing (see Fig. 3.1-1): rate of rate of rate of ] = [y] - (3.1-1) Now we have to translate this simple physical statement into mathematical language. We begin by considering the two shaded faces, which are perpendicular to the x-axis. The rate of mass entering the volume element through the shaded face at x is (pvx)lxAy Az, and the rate of mass leaving through the shaded face at x + Ax is (p~x)lx+AxAy Az. Similar expressions can be written for the other two pairs of faces. The rate of increase of mass within the volume element is Ax Ay Az(dp/dt). The mass balance then becomes By dividing the entire equation by Ax Ay Az and taking the limit as Ax, Ay, and Az go to zero, and then using the definitions of the partial derivatives, we get This is the equation of continuity, which describes the time rate of change of the fluid den- sity at a fixed point in space. This equation can be written more concisely by using vector notation as follows: ' rate of net rate of mass increase of addition per mass per unit volume unit volume by convection 78 Chapter 3 The Equations of Change for Isothermal Systems Here (V . pv) is called the \"divergence of pv,\" sometimes written as \"div pv.\" The vector pv is the mass flux, and its divergence has a simple meaning: it is the net rate of mass ef- flux per unit volume. The derivation in Problem 3D.1 uses a volume element of arbitrary shape; it is not necessary to use a rectangular volume element as we have done here. A very important special form of the equation of continuity is that for a fluid of con- stant density, for which Eq. 3.1-4 assumes the particularly simple form (incompressible fluid) (V . v) = 0 (3.1-5) Of course, no fluid is truly incompressible, but frequently in engineering and biological applications, the assumption of constant density results in considerable simplification and very little error.'r2 Show that for any kind of flow pattern, the normal stresses are zero at fluid-solid boundaries, for Newtonian fluids with constant density. This is an important result that we shall use Normal Stresses at often. Solid Surfaces for ~ncom~r~ssibl~ SOLUTION Newtonian Fluids We visualize the flow of a fluid near some solid surface, which may or may not be flat. The flow may be quite general, with all three velocity components being functions of all three co- ordinates and time. At some point P on the surface we erect a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at P. We now ask what the normal stress r,, is at P. According to Table B.l or Eq. 1.2-6, T,, = -2p(dv,/dz), because (V . v) = 0 for incompress- ible fluids. Then at point P on the surface of the solid First we replaced the derivative dv,/dz by using Eq. 3.1-3 with p constant. However, on the solid surface at z = 0, the velocity v, is zero by the no-slip condition (see §2.1), and therefore the derivative dv,/dx on the surface must be zero. The same is true of dv,/dy on the surface. Therefore T,, is zero. It is also true that T,, and ry, are zero at the surface because of the vanish- ing of the derivatives at z = 0. (Note: The vanishing of the normal stresses on solid surfaces does not apply to polymeric fluids, which are viscoelastic. For compressible fluids, the nor- mal stresses at solid surfaces are zero if the density is not changing with time, as is shown in Problem 3C.2.) 53.2 THE EQUATION OF MOTION To get the equation of motion we write a momentum balance over the volume element Ax Ay Az in Fig. 3.2-1 of the form rate of rate of rate of external momentum momentum + force on [of 2:E:Eud = [ in ] - [ out ] [the flUij (3'2-1) L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, Fluid Mechanics, Pergamon Press, Oxford (1987), p. 21, point out that, for steady, isentropic flows, commonly encountered in aerodynamics, the incompressibility assumption is valid when the fluid velocity is small compared to the velocity of sound (i.e., low Mach number). Equation 3.1-5 is the basis for Chapter 2 in G. K. Batchelor, An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics, Cambridge University Press (1967), which is a lengthy discussion of the kinematical consequences of the equation of continuity. 53.2 The Equation of Motion 79 z A Fig. 3.2-1. Fixed volume element Ax + Ax, y + Ay, z + Az) Ay Az, with six arrows indicating the directions of the fluxes of x-momen- turn through the surfaces by all mech- anisms. The shaded faces are located dx X~X+AX at x and x + Ax. Note that Eq. 3.2-1 is an extension of Eq. 2.1-1 to unsteady-state problems. Therefore we proceed in much the same way as in Chapter 2. However, in addition to including the unsteady-state term, we must allow the fluid to move through all six faces of the volume element. Remember that Eq. 3.2-1 is a vector equation with components in each of the three coordinate directions x, y, and z. We develop the x-component of each term in Eq. 3.2-1; the y- and z-components may be treated analogously.1 First, we consider the rates of flow of the x-component of momentum into and out of the volume element shown in Fig. 3.2-1. Momentum enters and leaves Ax Ay Az by two mechanisms: convective transport (see §1.7), and molecular transport (see 51.2). The rate at which the x-component of momentum enters across the shaded face at x by all mechanisms-both convective and molecular-is (4,,)IX Ay Az and the rate at which it leaves the shaded face at x + Ax is (t$xx)lx+Ax Ay Az. The rates at which x-momentum enters and leaves through the faces at y and y + Ay are ($,,)I, Az Ax and (~yx)Iy+Ay Az Ax, respectively. Similarly, the rates at which x-momentum enters and leaves through the faces at z and z + Az are (+,,)Iz Ax Ay and (+Zx)lz+Az AX Ay. When these contributions are added we get for the net rate of addition of x-momentum across all three pairs of faces. Next there is the external force (typically the gravitational force) acting on the fluid in the volume element. The x-component of this force is Equations 3.2-2 and 3.2-3 give the x-components of the three terms on the right side of Eq. 3.2-1. The sum of these terms must then be equated to the rate of increase of x-momentum within the volume element: Ax Ay Az d(pvx)/dt. When this is done, we have the x-component of the momentum balance. When this equation is divided by Ax Ay Az and the limit is taken as Ax, Ay, and Az go to zero, the following equation results: ' In this book all the equations of change are derived by applying the conservation laws to a region Ax Ay Az fixed in space. The same equations can be obtained by using an arbitrary region fixed in space or one moving along with the fluid. These derivations are described in Problem 3D.1. Advanced students should become familiar with these derivations. 80 Chapter 3 The Equations of Change for Isothermal Systems Here we have made use of the definitions of the partial derivatives. Similar equations can be developed for the y- and z-components of the momentum balance: By using vector-tensor notation, these three equations can be written as follows: That is, by letting i be successively x, y, and z, Eqs. 3.2-4,5, and 6 can be reproduced. The quantities pvi are the Cartesian components of the vector pv, which is the momentum per unit volume at a point in the fluid. Similarly, the quantities pgi are the components of the vector pg, which is the external force per unit volume. The term - [V $Ii is the ith com- ponent of the vector -[V . $1. When the ith component of Eq. 3.2-7 is multiplied by the unit vector in the ith direc- tion and the three components are added together vectorially, we get which is the differential statement of the law of conservation of momentum. It is the translation of Eq. 3.2-1 into mathematical symbols. In Eq. 1.7-1 it was shown that the combined momentum flux tensor + is the sum of the convective momentum flux tensor pw and the molecular momentum flux tensor m, and that the latter can be written as the sum of p8 and 7. When we insert $ = pw + p8 + T into Eq. 3.2-8, we get the following equation of rnoti~n:~ d zpv = -[V-pvv] -vp -[V.s] +pg rate of rate of momentum rate of momentum addition external force increase of addition by by molecular transport on fluid momentum convection per unit volume per unit per unit per unit volume volume volume In this equation Vp is a vector called the \"gradient of (the scalar) p\" sometimes written as \"grad p.\" The symbol [V TI is a vector called the \"divergence of (the tensor) 7\" and [V . pwl is a vector called the \"divergence of (the dyadic product) pw.\" In the next two sections we give some formal results that are based on the equation of motion. The equations of change for mechanical energy and angular momentum are not used for problem solving in this chapter, but will be referred to in Chapter 7. Begin- ners are advised to skim these sections on first reading and to refer to them later as the need arises. This equation is attributed to A.-L. Cauchy, Ex. de math., 2,108-111 (1827). (Baron) Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) (pronounced \"Koh-shee\" with the accent on the second syllable), originally trained as an engineer, made great contributions to theoretical physics and mathematics, including the calculus of complex variables. 53.3 The Equation of Mechanical Energy 81 53.3 THE EQUATION OF MECHANICAL ENERGY Mechanical energy is not conserved in a flow system, but that does not prevent us from developing an equation of change for this quantity. In fact, during the course of this book, we will obtain equations of change for a number of nonconserved quantities, such as internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy. The equation of change for mechanical en- ergy, which involves only mechanical terms, may be derived from the equation of mo- tion of g3.2. The resulting equation is referred to in many places in the text that follows. We take the dot product of the velocity vector v with the equation of motion in Eq. 3.2-9 and then do some rather lengthy rearranging, making use of the equation of conti- nuity in Eq. 3.1-4. We also split up each of the terms containing p and 7 into two parts. The final result is the equation of change for kinetic energy: d , ($pu2) = - (V . ;pv%) - (V . pv) - p( -v . v) rate of rate of addition rate of work rate of reversible increase of of kinetic energy done by pressure conversion of kinetic energy by convection of surroundings kinetic energy into per unit volume per unit volume on the fluid internal energy - (V (T v]) - (-T:VV) + p(v g) (3.34)' rate of work done rate of rate of work by viscous forces irreversible by external force on the fluid conversion on the fluid from kinetic to internal energy At this point it is not clear why we have attributed the indicated physical significance to the terms p(V . v) and (7:Vv). Their meaning cannot be properly appreciated until one has studied the energy balance in Chapter 11. There it will be seen how these same two terms appear with opposite sign in the equation of change f9r internal energy. A We now introduce the potential energy2 (per unit m%ss) @, defined-by g - -V@. Then the last term in Eq. 3.3-1 may be rewritten as -p(v V@) = -(V : pv@) + @(V -_pv). The equation of continuity in Eq. 3.1-4 m3y now be used to replace + @(V . pv) by -@(dp/dt). The latter may be written as -d(p@)/dt, if the potential energy is independent of the time. This is tru: for the gravitational field for systems that are located on the surface of the earth; then @ = gh, where g is the (constant) gravitational acceleration and h is the el- evation coordinate in the gravitational field. With the introduction of the potential energy, Eq. 3.3-1 assumes the following form: This is an equation of change for kinetic-plus-potential energy. Since Eqs. 3.3-1 and 3.3-2 con- tain only mechanical terms, they are both referred to as the equation of change for mechani- cal energy. The term p(V v) may be either positive or negative depending on whether the fluid is undergoing expansion or compression. The resulting temperature changes can be rather large for gases in compressors, turbines, and shock tubes. ' The interpretation under the (T:VV) term is correct only for Newtonian fluids; for viscoelastic fluids, such as polymers, this term may include reversible conversion to elastic energy. If g = _S,g is a vector of magnitude g in the negative z direction, then the potential energy per unit mass is @ = gz, where z is the elevation in the gravitational field. 82 Chapter 3 The Equations of Change for Isothermal Systems The term (-T:VV) is always positive for Newtonian fluids: because it may be written as a sum of squared terms: which serves to define the two quantities @, and 9,. When the index i takes on the val- ues 1, 2, 3, the velocity components vi become v,, vy, vz and the Cartesian coordinates xi become x, y, z. The symbol 6q is the Kronecker delta, which is 0 if i # j and 1 if i = j. The quantity (-T:VV) describes the degradation of mechanical energy into thermal energy that occurs in all flow systems (sometimes called the viscous dissipation heati~g).~ This heating can produce considerable temperature rises in systems with large viscosity and large velocity gradients, as in lubrication, rapid extrusion, and high-speed flight. (Another example of conversion of mechanical energy into heat is the rubbing of two sticks together to start a fire, which scouts are presumably able to do.) When we speak of \"isothermal systems,\" we mean systems in which there are no ex- ternally imposed temperature gradients and no appreciable temperature change result- ing from expansion, contraction, or viscous dissipation. The most important use of Eq. 3.3-2 is for the development of the macroscopic me- chanical energy balance (or engineering Bernoulli equation) in Section 7.8. 53.4 THE EQUATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM Another equation can be obtained from the equation of motion by forming the cross product of the position vector r (which has Cartesian components x, y, z) with Eq. 3.2-9. The equation of motion as derived in $3.2 does not contain the assumption that the stress (or momentum-flux) tensor T is symmetric. (Of course, the expressions given in $2.3 for the Newtonian fluid are symmetric; that is, rii = T~~.) When the cross product is formed, we get-after some vector-tensor manipula- tions-the following equation of change for angular momentum: Here E is a third-order tensor with components sijk (the permutation symbol defined in sA.2). If the stress tensor T is symmetric, as for Newtonian fluids, the last term is zero. According to the kinetic theories of dilute gases, monatomic liquids, and polymers, the tensor T is symmetric, in the absence of electric and magnetic torques.' If, on the other hand, T is asymmetric, then the last term describes the rate of conversion of bulk angular momentum to internal angular momentum. The assumption of a symmetric stress tensor, then, is equivalent to an assertion that there is no interconversion between bulk angular momentum and internal angular mo- mentum and that the two forms of angular momentum are conserved separately. This %n amusing consequence of the viscous dissipation for air is the study by H. K. Moffatt [Nature, 404,833434 (2000)l of the way in which a spinning coin comes to rest on a table. G. G.

Eq. 3.4-1 will be referred to only in Chapter 7, where we indicate that the macro- scopic angular momentum balance can be obtained from it. 53.5 THE EQUATIONS OF CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE SUBSTANTIAL DERIVATIVE Before proceeding we point out that several different time derivatives may be encoun- tered in transport phenomena. We illustrate these by a homely example--namely, the ob- servation of the concentration of fish in the Mississippi River. Because fish swim around, the fish concentration will in general be a function of position (x, y, z) and time (t). The Partial Time Derivative dldt Suppose we stand on a bridge and observe the concentration of fish just below us as a function of time. We can then record the time rate of change of the fish concentration at a fixed location. The result is (d~/dt)l,,~,,, the partial derivative of c with respect to t, at con- stant x, y, and z. The Total Time Derivative dldt Now suppose that we jump into a motor boat and speed around on the river, sometimes going upstream, sometimes downstream, and sometimes across the current. All the time we are observing fish concentration. At any instant, the time rate of change of the ob- served fish concentration is in which dx/dt, dy/dt, and dz/dt are the components of the velocity of the boat. The Substantial Time Derivative DIDt Next we climb into a canoe, and not feeling energetic, we just float along with the cur- rent, observing the fish concentration. In this situation the velocity of the observer is the same as the velocity v of the stream, which has components v,, vy, and v,. If at any instant we report the time rate of change of fish concentration, we are then giving The special operator D/Dt = d/dt + v . V is called the substantial derivative (meaning that the time rate of change is reported as one moves with the \"substance\"). The terms mater- ial derivative, hydrodynamic derivative, and derivative following the motion are also used. Now we need to know how to convert equations expressed in terms of d/dt into equations written with D/Dt. For any scalar function f (x, y, z, t) we can do the following manipulations: 84 Chapter 3 The Equations of Change for Isothermal Systems Table 3.5-1 The Equations of Change for Isothermal Systems in the D/Dt-Forma Note: At the left are given the equation numbers for the d/dt forms. D (3.4-1) p [r X vl = -[V . {r X p~J'] - [V . {r x T)'] + [r x pg] (DY \" Equations (A) through (C) are obtained from Eqs. 3.14,3.2-9, and 3.3-1 with no assumptions. Equation (D) is written for symmetrical 7 only. The quantity in the second parentheses in the second line is zero according to the equa- tion of continuity. Consequently Eq. 3.5-3 can be written in vector form as Similarly, for any vector function f(x, y, z, t), d D f - (pf) + [V . pvf] = p - dt Dt These equations can be used to rewrite the equations of change given in 553.1 to 3.4 in terms of the substantial derivative as shown in Table 3.5-1. Equation A in Table 3.5-1 tells how the density is decreasing or increasing as one moves along with the fluid, because of the compression [(V v) < 01 or expansion of the fluid [(V . v) > 01. Equation B can be interpreted as (mass) x (acceleration) = the sum of the pressure forces, viscous forces, and the external force. In other words, Eq. 3.2-9 is equivalent to Newton's second law of motion applied to a small blob of fluid whose en- velope moves locally with the fluid velocity v (see Problem 3D.1). We now discuss briefly the three most common simplifications of the equation of motion.' (i) For constant p and p, insertion of the Newtonian expression for 7 from Eq. 1.2-7 into the equation of motion leads to the very famous Navier-Stokes equation, first de- veloped from molecular arguments by Navier and from continuum arguments by Stokes:' In the second form we have used the \"modified pressure\" 9 = p + pgh introduced in Chapter 2, where h is the elevation in the gravitational field and gh is the gravitational For discussions of the history of these and other famous fluid dynamics relations, see H. Rouse and S. Ince, History of Hydraulics, Iowa Institute of Hydraulics, Iowa City (1959). L. M. H. Navier, Mkmoires de I'Acadkmie Royale des Sciences, 6,389-440 (1827); G. G. Stokes, Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc, 8,287-319 (1845). The name Navier is pronounced \"Nah-vyay.\" $3.5 The Equations of Change in Terms of the Substantial Derivative 85 Fig. 3.5-1.

Equation 3.5-6 is a standard starting point for describing isothermal flows of gases and liquids. It must be kept in mind that, when constant p is assumed, the equation of state (at constant T) is a vertical line on a plot of p vs. p (see Fig. 3.5-1). Thus, the absolute pres- sure is no longer determinable from p and T, although pressure gradients and instanta- neous differences remain determinate by Eq. 3.5-6 or Eq. 3.5-7. Absolute pressures are also obtainable if p is known at some point in the system. (ii) When the acceleration terms in the Navier-Stokes equation are neglected-that is, when p(Dv/Dt) = 0-we get which is called the Stokes flow equation. It is sometimes called the creeping flow equation, be- cause the term p[v . Vvl, which is quadratic in the velocity, can be discarded when the flow is extremely slow. For some flows, such as the Hagen-Poiseuille tube flow, the term p[v - Vvl drops out, and a restriction to slow flow is not implied. The Stokes flow equation is important in lubrication theory, the study of particle motions in suspension, flow through porous media, and swimming of microbes. There is a vast literature on this ~ubject.~ (iii) When viscous forces are neglected-that is, [V . TI = 0-the equation of motion becomes which is known as the Euler equation for \"inviscid\" fluid^.^ Of course, there are no truly \"inviscid\" fluids, but there are many flows in which the viscous forces are relatively unimportant. Examples are the flow around airplane wings (except near the solid boundary), flow of rivers around the upstream surfaces of bridge abutments, some prob- lems in compressible gas dynamics, and flow of ocean current^.^ \".

The Bernoulli Equation for the Steady Flow of SOLUTION Inviscid Fluids Omit the time-derivative term in Eq. 3.5-9, and then use the vector identity [v . Vvl = iV(v V) - [V X [V X v]] (Eq. A.4-23) to rewrite the equation as pV;v2 - p[v X [V X v]] = -Vp - pgVh (3.5-10) A In writing the last term, we have expressed g as -V@ = -gVh, where h is the elevation in the gravitational field. Next we divide Eq. 3.5-10 by p and then form the dot product with the unit vector s = v//vl in the flow direction. When this is done the term involving the curl of the velocity field can be shown to vanish (a nice exercise in vector analysis), and (s . V) can be replaced by d/ds, where s is the distance along a streamline. Thus we get When this is integrated along a streamline from point 1 to point 2, we get which is called the Bernoulli equafion. It relates the velocity, pressure, and elevation of two points along a streamline in a fluid in steady-state flow. It is used in situations where it can be assumed that viscosity plays a rather minor role. 53.6 USE OF THE EQUATIONS OF CHANGE TO SOLVE FLOW PROBLEMS For most applications of the equation of motion, we have to insert the expression for T from Eq. 1.2-7 into Eq. 3.2-9 (or, equivalently, the components of T from Eq. 1.2-6 or Ap- pendix B.l into Eqs. 3.2-5, 3.2-6, and 3.2-7). Then to describe the flow of a Newtonian fluid at constant temperature, we need in general The equation of continuity Eq. 3.1-4 The equation of motion Eq. 3.2-9 The components of T Eq. 1.2-6 The equation of state P = P(P) The equations for the viscosities p = K = ~(p) These equations, along with the necessary boundary and initial conditions, determine completely the pressure, density, and velocity distributions in the fluid. They are seldom used in their complete form to solve fluid dynamics problems. Usually restricted forms are used for convenience, as in this chapter. If it is appropriate to assume constant density and viscosity, then we use The equation of continuity Eq. 3.1-4 and Table B.4 The Navier-Stokes equation Eq. 3.5-6 and Tables B.5,6,7 along with initial and boundary conditions. From these one determines the pressure and velocity distributions. Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) was one of the early researchers in fluid dynamics and also the kinetic theory of gases. His hydrodynamical ideas were summarized in D. Bernoulli, Hydrodynarnica sive de uiribus et motibus fluidovum commentarii, Argentorati (1738), however he did not actually give Eq. 3.5-12. The credit for the derivation of Eq. 3.5-12 goes to L.

In Tables B.1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 we summarize these key equations in three much-used coordinate systems: Cartesian (x, y, z), cylindrical (r, 0, z), and spherical (r, 0, 4). Beginning students should not concern themselves with the derivation of these equa- tions, but they should be very familiar with the tables in Appendix B and be able to use them for setting up fluid dynamics problems. Advanced students will want to go through the details of Appendix A and learn how to develop the expressions for the var- ious V-operations, as is done in 55A.6 and A.7. In this section we illustrate how to set up and solve some problems involving the steady, isothermal, laminar flow of Newtonian fluids. The relatively simple analytical solutions given here are not to be regarded as ends in themselves, but rather as a prepa- ration for moving on to the analytical or numerical solution of more complex problems, the use of various approximate methods, or the use of dimensional analysis. The complete solution of viscous flow problems, including proofs of uniqueness and criteria for stability, is a formidable task. Indeed, the attention of some of the world's best applied mathematicians has been devoted to the challenge of solving the equations of con- tinuity and motion. The beginner may well feel inadequate when faced with these equa- tions for the first time. All we attempt to do in the illustrative examples in this section is to solve a few problems for stable flows that are known to exist. In each case we begin by making some postulates about the form for the pressure and velocity distributions: that is, we guess how p and v should depend on position in the problem being studied. Then we discard all the terms in the equations of continuity and motion that are unnecessary ac- cording to the postulates made. For example, if one postulates that v, is a function of y alone, terms like dv,/dx and d2v,/dz2 can be discarded. When all the unnecessary terms have been eliminated, one is frequently left with a small number of relatively simple equa- tions; and if the problem is sufficiently simple, an analytical solution can be obtained. It must be emphasized that in listing the postulates, one makes use of intuition. The latter is based on our daily experience with flow phenomena. Our intuition often tells us that a flow will be symmetrical about an axis, or that some component of the velocity is zero. Having used our intuition to make such postulates, we must remember that the final solution is correspondingly restricted. However, by starting with the equations of change, when we have finished the \"discarding process\" we do at least have a complete listing of all the assumptions used in the solution. In some instances it is possible to go back and remove some of the assumptions and get a better solution. In several examples to be discussed, we will find one solution to the fluid dynamical equations. However, because the full equations are nonlinear, there may be other solutions to the problem. Thus a complete solution to a fluid dynamics problem requires the specifi- cation of the limits on the stable flow regimes as well as any ranges of unstable behavior. That is, we have to develop a \"map\" showing the various flow regimes that are possible. Usually analytical solutions can be obtained for only the simplest flow regimes; the re- mainder of the information is generally obtained by experiment or by very detailed nu- merical solutions. In other words, although we know the differential equations that govern the fluid motion, much is yet unknown about how to solve them. This is a challenging area of applied mathematics, well above the level of an introductory textbook. When difficult problems are encountered, a search should be made through some of the advanced treatises on fluid dynamics.' R. Berker, Handbuch der Physik, Volume VIII-2, Springer, Berlin (1963), pp. 1-384; G. K. Batchelor, An Infroduction to Fluid Mechanics, Cambridge University Press (1967); L. Landau and E. M.

Johnson (ed.), The Handbook of Fluid Dynamics, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1998); C. Y. Wang, Ann. Revs. Fluid Mech., 23,159-177 (1991). 88 Chapter 3 The Equations of Change for Isothermal Systems We now turn to the illustrative examples. The first two are problems that were dis- cussed in the preceding chapter; we rework these just to illustrate the use of the equa- tions of change. Then we consider some other problems that would be difficult to set up by the shell balance method of Chapter 2. Rework the tube-flow problem of Example 2.3-1 using the equations of continuity and mo- tion. This illustrates the use of the tabulated equations for constant viscosity and density in in a Long cylindrical coordinates, given in Appendix B. Circular Tube SOLUTION We postulate that v = 6,v,(r, z). This postulate implies that there is no radial flow (v, = 0) and no tangential flow (v, = O), and that v, does not depend on 8. Consequently, we can discard many terms from the tabulated equations of change, leaving equation of continuity dv, -- - 0 dz (3.6-1) r-equation of motion d9 o=-- dr (3.6-2) &equation of motion d9 o=-- de (3.6-3) z-equation of motion The first equation indicates that v, depends only on r; hence the partial derivatives in the sec- ond term on the right side of Eq. 3.6-4 can be replaced by ordinary derivatives. By using the modified pressure 9 = p + pgh (where h is the height above some arbitrary datum plane), we avoid the necessity of calculating the components of g in cylindrical coordinates, and we ob- tain a solution valid for any orientation of the axis of the tube. Equations 3.6-2 and 3.6-3 show that 9 is a function of z alone, and the partial derivative in the first term of Eq. 3.6-4 may be replaced by an ordinary derivative. The only way that we can have a function of r plus a function of z equal to zero is for each term individually to be a constant-say, Co-so that Eq. 3.6-4 reduces to The 9 equation can be integrated at once. The v,-equation can be integrated by merely \"peel- ing off\" one operation after another on the left side (do not \"work out\" the compound deriva- tive there). This gives 9 = C+ + C, (3.6-6) The four constants of integration can be found from the boundary conditions: B.C. I B.C. 2 B.C. 3 B.C. 4 atz=O, 9=Y0 at z = L, 9 = 9[, at r = A, v, = 0 at r = 0, v, = finite The resulting solutions are: 9 = go - (yo - gL)(2/L) 53.6 Use of the Equations of Change to Solve Flow Problems 89 Equation 3.6-13 is the same as Eq. 2.3-18. The pressure profile in Eq. 3.6-12 was not obtained in Example 2.3-1, but was tacitly postulated; we could have done that here, too, but we chose to work with a minimal number of postulates. As pointed out in Example 2.3-1, Eq. 3.6-13 is valid only in the laminar-flow regime, and at locations not too near the tube entrance and exit. For Reynolds numbers above about 2100, a turbulent-flow regime exists downstream of the entrance region, and Eq. 3.6-13 is no longer valid. Set up the problem in Example 2.2-2 by using the equations of Appendix B. This illustrates the use of the equation of motion in terms of T. Falling Film with Variable Viscosity SOLUTION As in Example 2.2-2 we postulate a steady-state flow with constant density, but with viscosity depending on x. We postulate, as before, that the x- and y-components of the velocity are zero and that v, = v,(x). With these postulates, the equation of continuity is identically satisfied. According to Table B.l, the only nonzero components of .r are T,, = r,, = -,u(dv,/dx). The components of the equation of motion in terms of T are, from Table B.5, where /3 is the angle shown in Fig. 2.2-2. Integration of Eq. 3.6-14 gives p = pgx sin p + f ( y, z) (3.6-1 7) in which f(y, z) is an arbitrary function. Equation 3.6-15 shows that f cannot be a function of y. We next recognize that the pressure in the gas phase is very nearly constant at the prevailing atmospheric pressure pa,,. Therefore, at the gas-liquid interface x = 0, the pressure is also constant at the value pa,,. Consequently, f can be set equal to pa, and we obtain finally Equation 3.5-16 then becomes d - T,, = pg cos p dx which is the same as Eq. 2.2-10. The remainder of the solution is the same as in 52.2. We mentioned earlier that the measurement of pressure difference vs. mass flow rate through a cylindrical tube is the basis for the determination of viscosity in commercial capillary vis- Operation of a Couette cometers. The viscosity may also be determined by measuring the torque required to turn a Viscometer solid object in contact with a fluid. The forerunner of all rotational viscometers is the Couette instrument, which is sketched in Fig. 3.6-1. The fluid is placed in the cup, and the cup is then made to rotate with a constant angular velocity Ln, (the subscript \"0\" stands for outer). The rotating viscous liquid causes the sus- pended bob to turn until the torque produced by the momentum transfer in the fluid equals the product of the torsion constant kt and the angular displacement Ob of the bob. The angular displacement can be measured by observing the deflection of a light beam reflected from a mirror mounted on the bob. The conditions of measurement are controlled so that there is a steady, tangential, laminar flow in the annular region between the two coaxial cylinders 90 Chapter 3 The Equations of Change for Isothermal Systems 1- Torsion wire with torsion constant k, Fig. 3.6-1. (a)Tangential laminar flow of an incompressible fluid in the space between two cylinders; the outer one is moving with an angular velocity In,. (b) A diagram of a Couette viscometer. One measures the angular velocity Ino of the cup and the deflection oB of the bob at steady-state operation. Equation 3.6-31 gives the vis- cosity p in terms of a, and the torque T, = kt&. ve is a function of r shown in the figure. Because of the arrangement used, end effects over the region including the bob height L are negligible. To analyze this measurement, we apply the equations of continuity and motion for con- stant p and ,u to the tangential flow in the annular region around the bob. Ultimately we want an expression for the viscosity in terms of (the z-component of) the torque T, on the inner cylinder, the angular velocity a, of the rotating cup, the bob height L, and the radii KR and R of the bob and cup, respectively. Ir.\">- SOLUTION Fluid inside In the portion of the annulus under consideration the fluid moves in a circular pattern. Rea- sonable postulates for the velocity and pressure are: v, = v,(r), v, = 0, v, = 0, and p = p(r, 2). We expect p to depend on z because of gravity and on r because of the centrifugal force. For these postulates all the terms in the equation of continuity are zero, and the compo- nents of the equation of motion simplify to (a) r-component z-component The second equation gives the velocity distribution. The third equation gives the effect of gravity on the pressure (the hydrostatic effect), and the first equation tells how the centrifugal force affects the pressure. For the problem at hand we need only the 13-component of the equation of m~tion.~ See R. B. Bird, C. F. Curtiss, and W. E. Stewart, Chem. Eng. Sci., 11,114-117 (1959) for a method of getting p(r, z) for this system. The time-dependent buildup to the steady-state profiles is given by R. B. Bird and C. F. Curtiss, Chem. Eng. Sci., 11,108-113 (1959). 53.6 Use of the Equations of Change to Solve Flow Problems 91 A novice might have a compelling urge to perform the differentiations in Eq. 3.6-21 be- fore solving the differential equation, but this should not be done. All one has to do is \"peel off\" one operation at a time-just the way you undress-as follows: 1 rv, = - C,? + C2 2 (3.6-25) The boundary conditions are that the fluid does not slip at the two cylindrical surfaces: B.C. 1 B.C. 2 These boundary conditions can be used to get the constants of integration, which are then in- serted in Eq. 3.6-26. This gives By writing the result in this form, with similar terms in the numerator and denominator, it is clear that both boundary conditions are satisfied and that the equation is dimensionally consistent. From the velocity distribution we can find the momentum flux by using Table B.2: The torque acting on the inner cylinder is then given by the product of the inward momen- tum flux (-T,,), the surface of the cylinder, and the lever arm, as follows: The torque is also given by T, = kt&,. Therefore, measurement of the angular velocity of the cup and the angular deflection of the bob makes it possible to determine the viscosity. The same kind of analysis is available for other rotational viscometers.\" For any viscometer it is essential to know when turbulence will occur. The critical Reynolds number (LR$2p/p),,, above which the system becomes turbulent, is shown in Fig. 3.6-2 as a function of the radius ratio K. One might ask what happens if we hold the outer cylinder fixed and cause the inner cylinder to rotate with an angular velocity ili (the subscript \"i\" stands for inner). Then the velocity distribution is This is obtained by making the same postulates (see before Eq. 3.6-20) and solving the same differential equation (Eq. 3.6-21), but with a different set of boundary conditions.

However, when Ri reaches a critical value (C&, = 41.3(~/~'(1 - K)~\"~) for K = 1) the fluid develops a secondary flow, which is superimposed on the primary (tangential) flow and which is periodic in the axial direction. A very neat system of toroidal vortices, called Taylor vor- tices, is formed, as depicted in Figs. 3.6-3 and 3.6-4(b). The loci of the centers of these vor- tices are circles, whose centers are located on the common axis of the cylinders. This is still laminar motion-but certainly inconsistent with the postulates made at the begin- ning of the problem. When the angular velocity Ri is increased further, the loci of the centers of the vortices become traveling waves; that is, the flow becomes, in addition, pe- riodic in the tangential direction [see Fig. 3.6-4(c)I. Furthermore, the angular velocity of the traveling waves is approximately ;ai. When the angular velocity Ri is further in- creased, the flow becomes turbulent.

Further details may be found el~ewhere.~~~ The preceding discussion should serve as a stern warning that intuitive postulates may be misleading. Most of us would not think about postulating the singly and doubly periodic solutions just described. Nonetheless, this information is contained in the Navier-Stokes equations. However, since problems involving instability and transitions between several flow regimes are extremely complex, we are forced to use a combination of theory and experiment to describe them. Theory alone cannot yet give us all the an- swers, and carefully controlled experiments will be needed for years to come. A liquid of constant density and viscosity is in a cylindrical container of radius R as shown in Fig. 3.6-6. The container is caused to rotate about its own axis at an angular velocity a. The of the Su*face cylinder axis is vertical, so that g, = Or go = 0, and g, = -g, in which g is the magnitude of the of a Rotating Liquid gravitational acceleration. Find the shape of the free surface of the liquid when steady state has been established.

Rotating liquid with a free surface, the shape of which is a paraboloid of revolution. t for this problem, and the equations of change are given in Tables B.2 and B.6. At steady state we postulate that v, and viare both zero and that v, depends only on r. We also postulate that p depends on z because of the gravitational force and on r because of the centrifugal force but not on 6. These postulates give 0 = 0 for the equation of continuity, and the equation of motion gives: R-I Cylindrical coordinates are appropriate L P = Patm \\ surface I \\ r-component i z z-component -, p = p(r, z) within fluid The 6-component of the equation of motion can be integrated to give in which C1 and C2 are constants of integration. Because v, cannot be infinite at r = 0, the con- stant C2 must be zero. At r = R the velocity v, is Rfl. Hence C, = 2i2 and This states that each element of the rotating liquid moves as an element of a rigid body (we could have actually postulated that the liquid would rotate as a rigid body and written down Eq. 3.6-37 directly). When the result in Eq. 3.6-37 is substituted into Eq. 3.6-33, we then have these two equations for the pressure gradients: ap dP - = pf12r and - = -pg dr dz Each of these equations can be integrated, as follows: p = ;pi2'r2 + f,@, z) and p = -pgz + f2(r, 6) (3.6-40,41) where f, and f2 are arbitrary functions of integration. Since we have postulated that p does not depend on 8, we can choose fi = -pgz + C and f2 = $a2$ + C, where C is a constant, and sat- isfy Eqs. 3.6-38 and 39. Thus the solution to those equations has the form The constant C may be determined by requiring that p = pa,, at r = 0 and z = z,, the latter being the elevation of the liquid surface at r = 0. When C is obtained in this way, we get s3.6 Use of the Equations of Change to Solve Flow Problems 95 This equation gives the pressure at all points within the liquid. Right at the liquid-air inter- face, p = p,,,, and with this substitution Eq. 3.6-43 gives the shape of the liquid-air interface: This is the equation for a parabola. The reader can verify that the free surface of a liquid in a rotating annular container obeys a similar relation. A solid sphere of radius R is rotating slowly at a constant angular velocity R in a large body of quiescent fluid (see Fig. 3.6-7). Develop expressions for the pressure and velocity distribu- near a Slowly tions in the fluid and for the torque T, required to maintain the motion. It is assumed that the Rotating Sphere sphere rotates sufficiently slowly that it is appropriate to use the creeping flow version of the equation of motion in Eq. 3.5-8. This problem illustrates setting up and solving a problem in spherical coordinates. SOLUTION The equations of continuity and motion in spherical coordinates are given in Tables B.4 and B.6, respectively. We postulate that, for steady creeping flow, the velocity distribution will have the general form v = 6,v,(r, O), and that the modified pressure will be of the form 9 = 9 (r, 8). Since the solution is expected to be symmetric about the z-axis, there is no depen- dence on the angle 4. With these postulates, the equation of continuity is exactly satisfied, and the components of the creeping flow equation of motion become r-component d9 0 = -- dr (3.6-45) The boundary conditions may be summarized as B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: at r = R, v, = 0, v, = 0, v, = Rfl sin 8 asr+m, vr+O,v,+O,vd+O asr+m, 9+p0 where 9 = p + pgz, and p, is the fluid pressure far from the sphere at z = 0. Equation 3.6-47 is a partial differential equation for v,(r, 0). To solve this, we try a solu- tion of the form v, = f (r) sin 0. This is just a guess, but it is consistent with the boundary con- dition in Eq. 3.6-48. When this trial form for the velocity distribution is inserted into Eq. 3.6-47 we get the following ordinary differential equation for f (r): Torque T, is required to make the sphere rotate Fig. 3.6-7. A slowly rotating sphere in an infinite expanse of fluid. The primary flow is u, = OR(R/U)~ sin 8. 96 Chapter 3 The Equations of Change for Isothermal Systems This is an \"equidimensional equation,\" which may be solved by assuming a trial solution f = rn (see Eq. C.l-14). Substitution of this trial solution into Eq. 3.6-51 gives n = 1, -2. The so- lution of Eq. 3.6-51 is then ,- so that Application of the boundary conditions shows that C, = 0 and C2 = aR3. Therefore the final expression for the velocity distribution is v+ = OR , sin 0 (R)' Next we evaluate the torque needed to maintain the rotation of the sphere. This will be the in- tegral, over the sphere surface, of the tangential force (T,&=,)R~ sin 0dBd4 exerted on the fluid by a solid surface element, multiplied by the lever arm R sin 0 for that element: = J:' 1: (3161 sin B)(R sin B)R2 sin BdBd4 In going from the first to the second line, we have used Table B.l, and in going from the sec- ond to the third line we have done the integration over the range of the 4 variable. The inte- gral in the third line is $. As the angular velocity increases, deviations from the \"primary flow\" of Eq. 3.6-54 occur. Because of the centrifugal force effects, the fluid is pulled in toward the poles of the sphere and shoved outward from the equator as shown in Fig. 3.6-8. To describe this \"secondary flow,\" one has to include the [v Vvl term in the equation of motion. This can be done by the use of a stream-function meth~d.~ X Fig. 3.6-8.

An example of such a system is the flow of a fluid through an orifice meter in a pipe (this consists of a disk with a centered hole in it, placed in the tube, with a pressure- sensing device upstream and downstream of the disk). Suppose now that we want to scale up (or down) the experimental system, in order to build a new one in which exactly the same flow patterns occur [but appropriately scaled up (or down)]. First of all, we need to have geometric similarity: that is, the ratios of all dimensions of the pipe and ori- fice plate in the original system and in the scaled-up (or scaled-down) system must be the same. In addition, we must have dynamic similarity: that is, the dimensionless groups (such as the Reynolds number) in the differential equations and boundary conditions must be the same. The study of dynamic similarity is best understood by writing the equations of change, along with boundary and initial conditions, in dimensionless For simplicity we restrict the discussion here to fluids of constant density and vis- cosity, for which the equations of change are Eqs. 3.1-5 and 3.5-7 D p-v = -VY + iLV2v Dt In most flow systems one can identify the following \"scale factors\": a characteristic length I,, a characteristic velocity v,, and a characteristic modified pressure Po = p, + pgh, (for example, these might be a tube diameter, the average flow velocity, and the modified pressure at the tube exit). Then we can define dimensionless variables and dif- ferential operators as follows: We have suggested two choices for the dimensionless pressure, the first one being con- venient for high Reynolds numbers and the second for low Reynolds numbers. When the equations of change in Eqs. 3.7-1 and 3.7-2 are rewritten in terms of the dimension- less quantities, they become ' G. Birkhoff, Hydrodynamics, Dover, New York (1955), Chapter IV. Our dimensional analysis procedure corresponds to Birkhoff's \"complete inspectional analysis.\" R. W. Powell, An Elementary Text in Hydraulics and Fluid Mechanics, Macmillan, New York (19511, Chapter VIII; and H. Rouse and S. Ince, History of Hydraulics, Dover, New York (1963) have interesting historical material regarding the dimensionless groups and the persons for whom they were named. 98 Chapter 3 The Equations of Change for Isothermal Systems In these dimensionless equations, the four scale factors I,, v,, p, and ,u appear in one dimen- sionless group. The reciprocal of this group is named after a famous fluid dynamicist3 Re = - = Reynolds number ro7n The magnitude of this dimensionless group gives an indication of the relative impor- tance of inertial and viscous forces in the fluid system. From the two forms of the equation of motion given in Eq. 3.7-9, we can gain some perspective on the special forms of the Navier-Stokes equation given in 53.5. Equation 3.7-9a gives the Euler equation of Eq. 3.5-9 when Re + and Eq. 3.7-913 gives the creep- ing flow equation of Eq. 3.5-8 when Re << 1. The regions of applicability of these and other asymptotic forms of the equation of motion are considered further in s54.3 and 4.4. Additional dimensionless groups may arise in the initial and boundary conditions; two that appear in problems with fluid-fluid interfaces are Fr = - = Froude number n:n We = [L] = Weber number ~O~P The first of these contains the gravitational acceleration g, and the second contains the in- terfacial tension a, which may enter into the boundary conditions, as described in Prob- lem 3C.5. Still other groups may appear, such as ratios of lengths in the flow system (for example, the ratio of tube diameter to the diameter of the hole in an orifice meter). The flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid past a circular cylinder is to be studied exper- imentally. We want to know how the flow patterns and pressure distribution depend on the Transverse Flow cylinder diameter, length, the approach velocity, and the fluid density and viscosity. Show around a Circular how to organize the work so that the number of experiments needed will be minimized. Cylindefl SOLUTION For the analysis we consider an idealized flow system: a cylinder of diameter D and length L, submerged in an otherwise unbounded fluid of constant density and viscosity. Initially the fluid and the cylinder are both at rest. At time t = 0, the cylinder is abruptly made to move with velocity v, in the negative x direction. The subsequent fluid motion is analyzed by using coordinates fixed in the cylinder axis as shown in Fig. 3.7-1. The differential equations describing the flow are the equation of continuity (Eq. 3.7-1) and the equation of motion (Eq. 3.7-2). The initial condition for t = 0 is: I.C. ifx2+y2>~D20rifIzI>~~, v=ij,v, (3.7-13) The boundary conditions for t 2 0 and all z are: B.C. 1 B.C. 2 B.C. 3 asx2 + y2 + z2-+ 03, v -+ Zixvm v=O asx+ -03 aty = 0, Y+Y, See fn. 1 in s2.2. William Froude (1810-1879) (rhymes with \"food\") studied at Oxford and worked as a civil engineer concerned with railways and steamships. The Froude number is sometimes defined as the square root of the group given in Eq. 3.7-1 1. Moritz Weber (1871-1951) (pronounced \"Vayber\") was a professor of naval architecture in Berlin; another dimensionless group involving the surface tension in the capillary number, defined as Ca = [pvo/u].

Now we rewrite the problem in terms of variables made dimensionless with the characteristic length Dl velocity v,, and modified pressure 9,. The resulting dimensionless equations of change are 1 - (d.1) =Of and Y+ [+ad+] = -eO +-V2+ dt Re in which Re = Dv,p/p. The corresponding initial and boundary conditions are: I.C.

This completes the dimensional analysis of the problem. We have not solved the flow problem, but have decided on a convenient set of dimensionless variables to restate the prob- lem and suggest the form of the solution. The analysis shows that if we wish to catalog the flow patterns for flow past a cylinder, it will suffice to record them (e.g., photographically) for a series of Reynolds numbers Re = Dv,p/p and L/D values; thus, separate investigations into the roles of L, Dl v,, p, and p are unnecessary. Such a simplification saves a lot of time and expense. Similar comments apply to the tabulation of numerical results, in the event that one decides to make a numerical assault on the pr~blem.~,~ Analytical solutions of this problem at very small Re and infinite L/D are reviewed in L. Rosenhead (ed.), Laminar Boundary Layers, Oxford University Press (1963), Chapter IV. An important feature of this two-dimensional problem is the absence of a \"creeping flow\" solution. Thus the [v - Vvl- term in the equation of motion has to be included, even in the limit as Re + 0 (see Problem 3B.9). This is in sharp contrast to the situation for slow flow around a sphere (see g2.6 and g4.2) and around other finite, three-dimensional objects. For computer studies of the flow around a long cylinder, see F. H. Harlow and J. E. From, Scientific American, 212,104-110 (19651, and S. J. Sherwin and G. E. Kamiadakis, Comput. Math., 123,189-229 (1995). 100 Chapter 3 The Equations of Change for Isothermal Systems Experiments involve some necessary departures from the above analysis: the stream is finite in size, and fluctuations of velocity are inevitably present at the initial state and in the upstream fluid. These fluctuations die out rapidly near the cylinder at Re < 1. For Re approaching 40 the damping of disturbances gets slower, and beyond this approxi- mate limit unsteady flow is always observed. The observed flow patterns at large vary strongly with the Reynolds number as shown in Fig. 3.7-2. At Re << 1 the flow is orderly, as shown in (a). At Re of about 10, a pair of vortices appears behind the cylinder, as may be seen in (b). This type of flow per- sists up to about Re = 40, when there appear two \"separation points,\" at which the streamlines separate from the solid surface. Furthermore the flow becomes permanently unsteady; vortices begin to \"peel off\" from the cylinder and move downstream. With further increase in Re, the vortices separate regularly from alternate sides of the cylinder, as shown in (c); such a regular array of vortices is known as a \"von KArmtin vortex street.\" At still higher Re there is a disorderly fluctuating motion (turbulence) in the wake of the cylinder, as shown in (d). Finally, at Re near lo6, turbulence appears up- stream of the separation point, and the wake abruptly narrows down as shown in (e). Clearly, the unsteady flows shown in the last three sketches would be very difficult to compute from the equations of change. It is much easier to observe them experimentally and correlate the results in terms of Eqs. 3.7-23 and 24. Equations 3.7-23 and 24 can also be used for scale-up from a single experiment. Sup- pose that we wanted to predict the flow patterns around a cylinder of diameter D, = 5 ft, around which air is to flow with an approach velocity (v,), = 30 ft/s, by means of an ex- Stagnation point 7eparation point Separation point Separation point von Kbmin vortex street I Turbulent wake Separation point Fig. 3.7-2.

Re- gions of turbulent flow are shaded in gray. s3.7 Dimensional Analysis of the Equations of Change 101 periment on a scale model of diameter DII = 1 ft. To have dynamic similarity, we must choose conditions such that Re, = ReI. Then if we use the same fluid in the small-scale experiment as in the large system, so that p,/fi, = ,uI/pI, we find (v,),, = 150 ft/s as the required air velocity in the small-scale model. With the Reynolds numbers thus equal- ized, the flow patterns in the model and the full-scale system will look alike: that is, they are geometrically similar. Furthermore, if Re is in the range of periodic vortex formation, the dimensionless time interval t,v,/D between vortices will be the same in the two systems. Thus, the vor- tices will shed 25 times as fast in the model as in the full-scale system. The regularity of the vortex shedding at Reynolds numbers from about lo2 to lo4 is utilized commercially for precise flow metering in large pipelines. It is desired to predict the flow behavior in a large, unbaffled tank of oil, shown in Fig. 3.7-3, as a function of the impeller rotation speed. We propose to do this by means of model experi- Steady Flow in an ments in a smaller, geometrically similar system. Determine the conditions necessary for the Agitated Tank model studies to provide a direct means of prediction. SOLUTION We consider a tank of radius R, with a centered impeller of overall diameter D. At time t = 0, the system is stationary and contains liquid to a height H above the tank bottom. Immediately after time t = 0, the impeller begins rotating at a constant speed of N revolutions per minute. The drag of the atmosphere on the liquid surface is neglected. The impeller shape and initial position are described by the function Si,,(r, 6, z) = 0. The flow is governed by Eqs. 3.7-1 and 2, along with the initial condition and the following boundary conditions for the liquid region: tank bottom atz=OandO~r<R, v=O tank wall atr=R, v=O impeller surface at Simp(r, 0 - 27~Nt, z) = 0, v = 2n-Nr6, gas-liquid interface at Si&, 6, z, t) = 0, (n . v) = 0 and np + [n . TI = np,,, Initial liquid heights Fig. 3.7-3. Long-time average free-surface shapes, with ReI = Rell. 102 Chapter 3 The Equations of Change for Isothermal Systems Equations 3.7-26 to 28 are the no-slip and impermeability conditions; the surface S,,,(Y, 8 - 2~Nf, z) = O describes the location of the impeller after Nt rotations. Equation 3.7-29 is the condition of no mass flow through the gas-liquid interface, described by Sin&, 0, Z, t) = 0, which has a local unit normal vector n. Equation 3.7-30 is a force balance on an element of this interface (or a statement of the continuity of the normal component of the momentum flux ten- sor m) in which the viscous contributions from the gas side are neglected. This interface is ini- tially stationary in the plane z = H, and its motion thereafter is best obtained by measurement, though it is also predictable in principle by numerical solution of this equation system, which describes the initial conditions and subsequent acceleration Dv/Dt of every fluid element. Next we nondimensionalize the equations using the characteristic quantities v, = ND, 1, = D, and Po = pa, along with dimensionless polar coordinates = r/D, 19, and i = z/D. Then the equations of continuity and motion appear as in Eqs. 3.7-8 and 9, with Re = D2NpIP. The initial condition takes the form and the boundary conditions become: tank bottom ati=OandO<i< tank wall impeller surface at Simp(?, 6 - 2~i, i) = O, gas-liquid interface at Sint(i, 8,i, I) = 0, In going from Eq. 3.7-30 to 3.7-36 we have used Newton's law of viscosity in the form of Eq. 1.2-7 (but with the last term omitted, as is appropriate for incompressible liquids). We have also used the abbreviation j = Vv -+ (Vv)+ for the rate-of-deformation tensor, whose dimen- sionless Cartesian components are y = d4/dii) + (ai,/d;Fi). The quagtities in double brackets are known dimensionless quantities. -The function simp(;, 8 - 2rt, 2) is known for a given impeller design. The unknown function Sin,(< 13, i, t) is measurable photographically, or in principle is computable from the problem statement. By inspection of the dimensionless equations, we find that the velocity and pressure pro- files must have the form for a given impeller shape and location. The corresponding locus of the free surface is given by in which Re = D2NplP and Fr = DN2/g. For time-smoothed observations at large t, the depen- dence on t will disappear, as will the dependence on 6 for this axisymmetric tank geometry. These results provide the necessary conditions for the proposed model experiment: the two systems must be (i) geometrically similar (same values of R/D and H/D, same impeller geometry and location), and (ii) operated at the same values of the Reynolds and Froude numbers. Condition (ii) requires that s3.7 Dimensional Analysis of the Equations of Change 103 in which the kinematic viscosity v = p/p is used. Normally both tanks will operate in the same gravitational field gl = gII, so that Eq. 3.7-41 requires Substitution of this into Eq. 3.7-40 gives the requirement This is an important result-namely, that the smaller tank (11) requires a fluid of smaller kine- matic viscosity to maintain dynamic similarity. For example, if we use a scale model with DII = :D,, then we need to use a fluid with kinematic viscosity vl, = vI/V% in the scaled-down experiment. Evidently the requirements for dynamic similarity are more stringent here than in the previous example, because of the additional dimensionless group Fr. In many practical cases, Eq. 3.7-43 calls for unattainably low values of vl,. Exact scale-up from a single model experiment is then not possible. In some circumstances, however, the ef- fect of one or more dimensionless groups may be known to be small, or may be predictable from experience with similar systems; in such situations, approximate scale-up from a single experiment is still fea~ible.~ This example shows the importance of including the boundary conditions in a dimen- sional analysis. Here the Froude number appeared only in the free-surface boundary condi- tion Eq. 3.7-36. Failure to use this condition would result in the omission of the restriction in Eq. 3.7-42, and one might improperly choose vl, = vl. If one did this, with Re,, = ReI, the Froude number in the smaller tank would be too large, and the vortex would be too deep, as shown by the dotted line in Fig. 3.7-3. EXAMPLE 3.7-3 Show that the mean axial gradient of the modified pressure 9 for creeping flow of a fluid of constant p and p through a tube of radius R, uniformly packed for a length L >> D, with Pressure Drop for solid particles of characteristic size D, << R, is Creeping Flow in a Packed Tube -- A@') - P(%) L - K(geom) (3.7-44) D; Here (-. .) denotes an average over a tube cross section within the packed length L, and the function K(geom) is a constant for a given bed geometry (i.e., a given shape and arrangement of the particles). SOLUTION We choose D, as the characteristic length and (v,) as the characteristic velocity. Then the i~ter- stitial fluid motion is determined by Eqs. 3.7-8 and 3.7-913, with ; = v/(v,) and 9 = (9 - 90)Dp/p(v,), along with no-slip conditions on the solid syrfaces and the modified pres- sure difference A(9) = (9,) - (9,). The solutions for ; and 9 in creeping flow (D,(v,)p/p + 0) accordingly depend only on ;, 6, and i for a given particle arrangement and shape. Then the mean axial gradient depends only on the bed-geometry as long as R and L are large relative to D,. Inserting the foregoing expression for @, we immediately obtain Eq. 3.7-44.

When standing at the mouth of the Ontonagon River on the south shore of Lake Superior (602 ft above mean sea level), your portable barometer indicates a pressure of 750 mm Hg. Use the equation of motion to estimate the barometric pressure at the top of Government Peak (2023 ft above mean sea level) in the nearby Porcupine Mountains. Assume that the tem- perature at lake Level is 70°F and that the temperature de- creases with increasing altitude at a steady rate of 3°F per 1000 feet. The gravitational acceleration at the south shore of Lake Superior is about 32.19 ft/s2, and its variation with altitude may be neglected in this problem. Answer: 713 mm Hg = 9.49 X lo4 N/m2 3A.4 Viscosity determination with a rotating-cylinder viscometer. It is desired to measure the viscosities of su- crose solutions of about 60% concentration by weight at about 20°C with a rotating-cylinder viscometer such as that shown in Fig. 3.5-1. This instrument has an inner cylinder 4.000 cm in diameter surrounded by a rotating Problems 105 concentric cylinder 4.500 cm in diameter. The length L is 4.00 cm. The viscosity of a 60% sucrose solution at 20°C is about 57 cp, and its density is about 1.29 g/cm3. On the basis of past experience it seems possible that end effects will be important, and it is therefore decided to calibrate the viscometer by measurements on some known solutions of approximately the same viscosity as those of the unknown sucrose solutions. Determine a reasonable value for the applied torque to be used in calibration if the torque measurements are re- liable within 100 dyne/cm and the angular velocity can be measured within 0.5%. What will be the resultant angular velocity? 3A.5 Fabrication of a parabolic mirror. It is proposed to make a backing for a parabolic mirror, by rotating a pan of slow-hardening plastic resin at constant speed until it hardens.

Experiments with a small-scale agitated tank are to be used to design a geo- metrically similar installation with linear dimensions 10 times as large. The fluid in the large tank will be a heavy oil with p = 13.5 cp and p = 0.9 g/cm3. The large tank is to have an impeller speed of 120 rpm. (a) Determine the impeller speed for the small-scale model, in accordance with the criteria for scale-up given in Example 3.7-2.

A molasses storage tank 60 ft in diameter is to be built with a draw-off line 1 ft in diameter, 4 ft from the sidewall of the Fig. 3A.7. Draining of a molasses tank. tank and extending vertically upward 1 ft from the tank bottom. It is known from experience that, as molasses is withdrawn from the tank, a vortex will form, and, as the liquid level drops, this vortex will ultimately reach the draw-off pipe, allowing air to be sucked into the molasses. This is to be avoided. It is proposed to predict the minimum liquid level at which this entrainment can be avoided, at a draw-off rate of 800 gal/min, by a model study using a smaller tank. For convenience, water at 68OF is to be used for the fluid in the model study. Determine the proper tank dimensions and operating conditions for the model if the density of the molasses is 1.286 g/cm3 and its viscosity is 56.7 cp. It may be assumed that, in either the full-size tank or the model, the vortex shape is dependent only on the amount of the liquid in the tank and the draw-off rate; that is, the vortex establishes it- self very rapidly. 38.1 Flow between coaxial cylinders and concentric spheres.

A rod of radius KR moves upward with a constant velocity v, through a cylindrical container of inner radius R contain- ing a Newtonian liquid. The liquid circulates in the cylin- der, moving upward along the moving central rod and moving downward along the fixed container wall. Find the velocity distribution in the annular region, far from the end disturbances.

(a) First consider the problem where the annular region is quite narrow-that is, where K is just slightly less than unity. In that case the annulus may be approximated by a thin plane slit and the curvature can be neglected. Show that in this limit, the velocity distribution is given by where 6 = r/R. (b) Next work the problem without the thin-slit assump- tion. Show that the velocity distribution is given by 3B.7 Momentum fluxes for creeping flow into a slot (Fig. 3.B-7). An incompressible Newtonian liquid is flow- ing very slowly into a thin slot of thickness 2B (in the y di- rection) and width W (in the z direction). The mass rate of flow in the slot is w. From the results of Problem 2B.3 it can be shown that the velocity distribution within the slot is at locations not too near the inlet. In the region outside the slot the components of the velocity for creepingflow are Equations 3B.7-1 to 4 are only approximate in the region near the slot entry for both x 2 0 and x 5 0. Fig. 3B.7.

An incompressible Newtonian fluid approaches a stationary cylinder with a uniform, steady velocity v, in the positive x direction.

Penelope is staring at a beaker filled with a liquid, which for all practical purposes can be considered as incompress- ible; let its density be p,. She tells you she is trying to un- derstand how the pressure in the liquid varies with depth. She has taken the origin of coordinates at the liquid-air in- terface, with the positive z-axis pointing away from the liq- uid. She says to you: \"If I simplify the equation of motion for an incom- pressible liquid at rest, I get 0 = -dp/dz - p~. I can solve this and get p = pa,, - pgz. That seems reasonablethe pressure increases with increasing depth. \"But, on the other hand, the equation of state for any fluid is p = p(p, 79, and if the system is at constant temper- ature, this just simplifies to p = p(p). And, since the fluid is incompressible, p = p(po), and p must be a constant throughout the fluid! How can that be?\" Clearly Penelope needs help. Provide a useful expla- nation. 3B.13 Flow of a fluid through a sudden contraction.

Show that this leads to an efflux velocity v,,,,, = 1/2gh. This is known as Torricelli's equation. To get this result, one has to assume incompressibility (which is usually reasonable for most liquids), and that the height of the fluid surface is changing so slowly with time that the Bernoulli equation can be applied at any instant of time (the quasi-steady-state assumption). 3B.15 Shape of free surface in tangential annular flow.

A fluid flows in the positive x-direction through a long flat duct of length L, width W, and thickness B, where L >> W >> B. The duct has porous walls at y = 0 and y = B, so that a constant cross flow can be maintained, with v, = v,, a constant, everywhere. Flows of this type are important in connection with separation processes using the sweep- diffusion effect. By carefully controlling the cross flow, one can concentrate the larger constituents (molecules, dust particles, etc.) near the upper wall. ttttttttt 4, - R X y=o ttttttttt Fig. 38.16.

The bottom disk is fixed, and the upper disk is made to approach the lower one very slowly with a constant speed vo, starting from a height H, (and H, << R). The instantaneous height of the upper disk is H(t). It is de- sired to find the force needed to maintain the speed vo. This problem is inherently a rather complicated un- steady-state flow problem.

Problems 111 the equations of change: (i) we assume that the speed v, is so slow that all terms containing time derivatives can be omitted; this is the so-called \"quasi-steady-state\" assump- tion; (ii) we use the fact that Ho < < R to neglect quite a few terms in the equations of change by order-of-magnitude arguments. Note that the rate of decrease of the fluid vol- ume between the disks is n-R2v,, and that this must equal the rate of outflow from between the disks, which is z~TRH(v,)I,,~. Hence We now argue that v,(r, z) will be of the order of magni- tude of (~,)l,=~ and that v,(r, z) is of the order of magnitude of v,, so that and hence Iv,l << u,. We may now estimate the order of magnitude of various derivatives as follows: as r goes from 0 to R, the radial velocity v, goes from zero to approx- imately (R/H)v,.

(b) Show how to obtain Eq. 3C.4-1 from the equation of change for angular momentum given in Eq. 3.4-1. 3C.5 Two-phase interfacial boundary conditions. In 52.1, boundary conditions for solving viscous flow problems were given. At that point no mention was made of the role of inter- facial tension. At the interface between two immiscible fluids, I and 11, the following boundary condition should be used: This is essentially a momentum balance written for an in- terfacial element dS with no matter passing through it, and with no interfacial mass or viscosity. Here n' is the unit vector normal to dS and pointing into phase I. The quanti- ties R, and R, are the principal radii of curvature at dS, and each of these is positive if its center lies in phase I. The sum (l/R,) + (1/R2) can also be expressed as (V - n'). The quan- tity u is the interfacial tension, assumed constant. (a) Show that, for a spherical droplet of I at rest in a sec- ond medium 11, Laplace's equation relates the pressures inside and outside the droplet. Is the pressure in phase I greater than that in phase 11, or the re- verse? What is the relation between the pressures at a pla- nar interface? (b) Show that Eq. 3C.5-1 leads to the following dimension- less boundary condition in which hV = (k - ho)/lo is the dimensionless elevation of dS, and are dimensionless rate-of-deformation ten- sors, and I?, = R,/lo and R, = R2/lo are dimensionless radii of curvature. Furthermore In the above, the zero-subscripted quantities are the scale factors, valid in both phases. Idenhfy the dimensionless groups that appear in Eq. 3C.5-3. (c) Show how the result in (b) simplifies to Eq. 3.7-36 under the assumptions made in Example 3.7-2. 3D.1 Derivation of the equations of change by integral theorems (Fig. 3D.1). (a) A fluid is flowing through some region of 3-dimensional space. Select an arbitrary \"blob of this fluid-that is, a region that is bounded by some surface S(t) enclosing a volume V(t), whose elements move with the local fluid ve- locity. Apply Newton's second law of motion to this sys- tem to get in which the terms on the right account for the surface and volume forces acting on the system. Apply the Leibniz for- mula for differentiating an integral (see §A.5), recognizing that at all points on the surface of the blob, the surface ve- locity is identical to the fluid velocity. Next apply the Gauss theorem for a tensor (see 5A.5) so that each term in the equation is a volume integral. Since the choice of the \"blob\" is arbitrary, all the integral signs may be removed, and the equation of motion in Eq. 3.2-9 is obtained. (b) Derive the equation of motion by writing a momen- tum balance over an arbitrary region of volume V and sur- face S, fixed in space, through which a fluid is flowing. In doing this, just parallel the derivation given in 53.2 for a L. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, Fluid Mechanics, Pergamon, Oxford, 2nd edition (1987), Eq. 61.13. More general formulas including the excess density and viscosity have been developed by L. E. Scriven, Chern. Eng. Sci., 12,98-108 (1960). Fig. 3D.1.

Every element of the fluid surface dS(t) of the moving, deforming volume element V(t) moves with the local, instantaneous fluid velocity v(t). Problems 113 rectangular fluid element. The Gauss theorem for a tensor is needed to complete the derivation. This problem shows that applying Newton's second law of motion to an arbitrary moving \"blob of fluid is equivalent to setting up a momentum balance over an arbitrary fixed re- gion of space through which the fluid is moving. Both (a) and (b) give the same result as that obtained in 93.2. (c) Derive the equation of continuity using a volume ele- ment of arbitrary shape, both moving and fixed, by the methods outlined in (a) and (b). in which E is a third-order tensor whose components are the permutation symbol qjk (see 9A.2) and v = p/p is the kinematic viscosity.

In Chapter 3 we introduced the equations of continuity and motion, which provide a better way to set up problems. The method was illustrated in S3.6, but there we restricted ourselves to flow problems in which only ordinary differ- ential equations had to be solved. In this chapter we discuss several classes of problems that involve the solutions of partial differential equations: unsteady-state flow (94.11, viscous flow in more than one direction (§4.2), the flow of inviscid fluids (94.3), and viscous flow in boundary layers (s4.4). Since all these topics are treated extensively in fluid dynamics treatises, we pro- vide here only an introduction to them and illustrate some widely used methods for problem solving. In addition to the analytical methods given in this chapter, there is also a rapidly ex- panding literature on numerical methods.' The field of computational fluid dynamics is already playing an important role in the field of transport phenomena. The numerical and analytical methods play roles complementary to one another, with the numerical methods being indispensable for complicated practical problems. 4.1 TIME-DEPENDENT FLOW OF NEWTONIAN FLUIDS In 53.6 only steady-state problems were solved. However, in many situations the veloc- ity depends on both position and time, and the flow is described by partial differential equations. In this section we illustrate three techniques that are much used in fluid dynamics, heat conduction, and diffusion (as well as in many other branches of physics and engineering). In each of these techniques the problem of solving a partial differ- ential equation is converted into a problem of solving one or more ordinary differential equations. -- - R. W. Johnson (ed.), The Handbook of Fluid Dynamics, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1998); C. Pozrikidis, Introduction to Theoretical and Computational Fluid Dynamics, Oxford University Press (1997). 4. Time-Dependent Flow of Newtonian Fluids 115 The first example illustrates the method of combination of variables (or the method of similarity solutions). This method is useful only for semi-infinite regions, such that the ini- tial condition and the boundary condition at infinity may be combined into a single new boundary condition. The second example illustrates the method of separation of variables, in which the partial differential equation is split up into two or more ordinary differential equations. The so- lution is then an infinite sum of products of the solutions of the ordinary differential equations. These ordinary differential equations are usually discussed under the heading of \"Sturm-Liouville\" problems in intermediate-level mathematics textbooks.' The third example demonstrates the method of sinusoidal response, which is useful in describing the way a system responds to external periodic disturbances. The illustrative examples are chosen for their physical simplicity, so that the major focus can be on the mathematical methods. Since all the problems discussed here are lin- ear in the velocity, Laplace transforms can also be used, and readers familiar with this subject are invited to solve the three examples in this section by that technique. A semi-infinite body of liquid with constant density and viscosity is bounded below by a hor- izontal surface (the xz-plane). Initially the fluid and the solid are at rest. Then at time t = 0, Flow near a Wall the solid surface is set in motion in the positive x direction with velocity vo as shown in Fig. Suddenly Set in Motion 4.1-1. Find the velocity v, as a function of y and t. There is no pressure gradient or gravity force in the x direction, and the flow is presumed to be laminar. SOLUTION For this system v, = v,(y, t), v, = 0, and v, = 0. Then from Table B.4 we find that the equation of continuity is satisfied directly, and from Table B.5 we get t>O Fluid in unsteady flow Fig. 4.1-1.

The initial and boundary conditions are I.C.: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: at t 5 0, v, = 0 for ally at y = 0, v, = v, for all t > 0 at y = a, v, = 0 for all t > 0 Next we introduce a dimensionless velocity 4 = v,/v,, so that Eq. 4.4-1 becomes with +(y, 0) = 0, +(O, t) = 1, and +(a, t) = 0. Since the initial and boundary conditions con- tain only pure numbers, the solution to Eq. 4.1-5 has to be of the form + = +(y, t; v). However, since 4 is a dimensionless function, the quantities y, t, and v must always appear in a dimen- sionless combination. The only dimensionless combinations of these three quantities are y/V% or powers or multiples thereof. We therefore conclude that This is the \"method of combination of (independent) variables.\" The \"4 is included so that the final result in Eq. 4.1-14 will look neater; we know to do this only after solving the prob- lem without it. The form of the solution in Eq. 4.1-6 is possible essentially because there is no characteristic length or time in the physical system. We now convert the derivatives in Eq. 4.1-5 into derivatives with respect to the \"com- bined variable\" q as follows: *-dWrl-d4 1 d2+ A d24 1 and - dy dTdy d77G dy2 dq2 4vt Substitution of these expressions into Eq. 4.1-5 then gives This is an ordinary differential equation of the type given in Eq. C.l-8, and the accompanying boundary conditions are B.C. 1: B.C. 2: The first of these boundary conditions is the same as Eq. 4.1-3, and the second includes Eqs. 4.1-2 and 4. If now we let d#~/dq = $, we get a first-order separable equation for $, and it may be solved to give A second integration then gives The choice of 0 for the lower limit of the integral is arbitrary; another choice would lead to a different value of C,, which is still undetermined. Note that we have been careful to use an overbar for the variable of integration (7) to distinguish it from the q in the upper limit. 94.1 Time-Dependent Flow of Newtonian Fluids 117 Fig. 4.1-2. Velocity distribution, in dimensionless form, for flow in the neighborhood of a wall suddenly set in motion. Application of the two boundary conditions makes it possible to evaluate the two inte- gration constants, and we get finally The ratio of integrals appearing here is called the error function, abbreviated erf 77 (see 9C.6). It is a well-known function, available in mathematics handbooks and computer software pro- grams. When Eq. 4.1-14 is rewritten in the original variables, it becomes in which erfc 7 is called the complementa y mor function. A plot of Eq. 4.1-15 is given in Fig. 4.1-2. Note that, by plotting the result in terms of dimensionless quantities, only one curve is needed. The complementary error function erfc 7 is a monotone decreasing function that goes from 1 to 0 and drops to 0.01 when 77 is about 2.0. We can use this fact to define a \"boundary- layer thickness\" 6 as that distance y for which v, has dropped to a value of 0.01~~. This gives 6 = 46 as a natural length scale for the diffusion of momentum. This distance is a measure of the extent to which momentum has \"penetrated into the body of the fluid. Note that this boundary-layer thickness is proportional to the square root of the elapsed time. It is desired to re-solve the preceding illustrative example, but with a fixed wall at a distance b from the moving wall at y = 0. This flow system has a steady-state limit as t + m, whereas the Unsteady Laminar problem in Example 4.1-1 did not. Flow Between Two Parallel Plates SOLUTlON As in Example 4.1-1, the equation for the x-component of the velocity is The boundary conditions are now I.C.: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: att50, v,=O forOSySb at y = 0, v, = v, for all t > 0 at y = b, v, = 0 for all t > 0 118 Chapter 4 Velocity Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable It is convenient to introduce the following dimensionless variables: The choices for dimensionless velocity and position ensure that these variables will go from 0 to 1. The choice of the dimensionless time is made so that there will be no parameters occur- ring in the transformed partial differential equation: The initial condition is C$ = 0 at r = 0, and the boundary conditions are 4 = 1 at 77 = 0 and +=Oatq=l. We know that at infinite time the system attains a steady-state velocity profile +,(q) so that at 7 = a Eq. 4.1-21 becomes for the steady-state limiting profile. We then can write $47, 7) = +,(77) - 4t(77, 7) where 4, is the transient part of the solution, which fades out as time goes to infinity. Substi- tution of this expression into the original differential equation and boundary conditions then gives for 4, with 4, = 4, at T = 0, and 4, = 0 at q = 0 and 1. To solve Eq. 4.1-25 we use the \"method of separation of (dependent) variables,\" in which we assume a solution of the form Substitution of this trial solution into Eq. 4.1-25 and then division by the product fg gives The left side is a function of T alone, and the right side is a function of 77 alone. This means that both sides must equal a constant. We choose to designate the constant as -c2 (we could equally well use c or +c2, but experience tells us that these choices make the subsequent mathematics somewhat more complicated). Equation 4.1-27 can then be separated into two equations These equations have the following solutions (see Eqs. C.l-1 and 3): g = A~-~~~ f = B sin cv + C cos CV in which A, B, and C are constants of integration. 4. Time-Dependent Flow of Newtonian Fluids 119 We now apply the boundary and initial conditions in the following way: B.C. 1: Because 4, = 0 at q = 0, the function f must be zero at r] = 0. Hence C must be zero. B.C. 2: Because 4, = 0 at r] = 1, the function f must be zero at 77 = 1. This will be true if B = 0 or if sin c is zero. The first choice would lead to f = 0 for all r], and that would be physically unacceptable. Therefore we make the second choice, which leads to the requirement that c = 0, ?r, +2r, +3r, - - - - We label these various admissible values of c (called \"eigenvalues\") as c, and write c, = nr, with n = 0, 21, +2, +3, - . . (4.1-32) There are thus many admissible functions f, (called \"eigenfunctions\") that satisfy Eq. 4.1-29 and the boundary conditions; namely, f, = B, sin nrq, with n = 0, +I, -C2, k3, . . (4.1-33) The corresponding functions satisfying Eq. 4.1-28 are called gn and are given by I.C.: The combinations fng, satisfy the partial differential equation for 4, in Eq. 4.1-25, and so will any superposition of such products. Therefore we write for the solution of Eq. 4.1-25 +m $t = D, exp(-n2.rr2d sin nrr] n=-m in which the expansion coefficients D, = AnBn have yet to be determined. In the sum, the term n = 0 does not contribute; also since sin(-n)q = -sin(+n)q, we may omit all the terms with negative values of n. Hence, Eq. 4.1-35 becomes m +t = x Dn exp(-n2r2r) sin nrq n=l According to the initial condition, 4, = 1 - r] at r = 0, so that m 1 - r] = ,=I x D, sin nrr] We now have to determine all the Dn from this one equation! This is done by multiplying both sides of the equation by sin mrr], where m is an integer, and then integrating over the physically pertinent range from r] = 0 to r] = 1, thus: m 1 lo1 (1 - r]) sin mrqdr) = C D. sin nrr] sin rnrr]dr] n=l 0 The left side gives l/m.rr; the integrals on the right side are zero when n f m and when n = m. Hence the initial condition leads to The final expression for the dimensionless velocity profile is obtained from Eqs. 4.1-24, 36, and 39 as m +(r], r) = (1 - r]) - x exp(-n2r2r) sin nrr] n=l The solution thus consists of a steady-state-limit term minus a transient term, which fades out with increasing time. 120 Chapter 4 Velocity Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable Those readers who are encountering the method of separation of variables for the first time will have found the above sequence of steps rather long and complicated. However, no single step in the development is particularly difficult. The final solution in Eq. 4.1-40 looks rather involved because of the infinite sum. Actually, except for very small values of the time, only the first few terms in the series contribute appreciably. Although we do not prove it here, the solution to this problem and that of the pre- ceding problem are closely related.* In the limit of vanishingly small time, Eq. 4.1-40 be- comes equivalent to Eq. 4.1-15. This is reasonable, since, at very small time, in this problem the fluid is in motion only very near the wall at y = 0, and the fluid cannot \"feel\" the presence of the wall at y = b. Since the solution and result in Example 4.1-1 are far simpler than those of this one, they are often used to represent the system if only small times are involved. This is, of course, an approximation, but a very useful one. It is often used in heat- and mass-transport problems as well. A semi-infinite body of liquid is bounded on one side by a plane surface (the xz-plane). Ini- tially the fluid and solid are at rest. At time t = 0 the solid surface is made to oscillate sinu- Unsteady Laminar soidally in the x direction with amplitude Xo and (circular) frequency o. That is, the Flow near an displacement X of the plane from its rest position is Oscillating Plate X(t) = Xo sin ot (4.1-41) and the velocity of the fluid at y = 0 is then dX vx(O, t) = - = Xo w COS wt d t (4.1-42) We designate the amplitude of the velocity oscillation by vo = Xow and rewrite Eq. 4.1-42 as v,(O, t) = v, cos wt = vo%{eiUt} (4.1-43) where %{z] means \"the real part of z.\" For oscillating systems we are generally not interested in the complete solution, but only the \"periodic steady state\" that exists after the initial \"transients\" have disappeared. In this state all the fluid particles in the system will be executing sinusoidal oscillations with fre- quency w, but with phase and amplitude that are functions only of position. This \"periodic steady state\" solution may be obtained by an elementary technique that is widely used. Math- ematically it is an asymptotic solution for t + m. SOLUTION Once again the equation of motion is given by and the initial and boundary conditions are given by I.C.: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: at t 5 0, v, = 0 for all y at y = 0, v, = ~,%{e'\"~) for all t > 0 aty=m, v,=O for all t > 0 The initial condition will not be needed, since we are concerned only with the fluid response after the plate has been oscillating for a long time. We postulate an oscillatory solution of the form See H. S. Carslaw and J. C. Jaeger, Conduction of Heat in Solids, Oxford University Press, 2nd edition (1959), pp. 308-310, for a series solution that is particularly good for short times. s4.2 Solving Flow Problems Using a Stream Function 121 Here vO is chosen to be a complex function of y, so that v,(y, t) will differ from v,(O, t) both in amplitude and phase. We substitute this trial solution into Eq. 4.1-44 and obtain Next we make use of the fact that, if %{z,w) = %{z2w}, where 2, and 2, are two complex quan- tities and w is an arbitrary complex quantity, then z, = 2,. Then Eq. 4.1-49 becomes with the following boundary conditions: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: Equation 4.1-50 is of the form of Eq. C.1-4 and has the solution v0 = CleGy + cze-Gy Since = t (1 /V'?)(l + i), this equation can be rewritten as vO = CleGml+dY + c -v'iz(l+i)y 2e The second boundary condition requires that C1 = 0, and the first boundary condition gives C, = v,. Therefore the solution to Eq. 4.1-50 is From this result and Eq. 4.1-48, we get or finally vJy, t) = voe-t/w/2v~ cos (ot - l/o/2vy) (4.1-57) In this expression, the exponential describes the attenuation of the oscillatory motion-that is, the decrease in the amplitude of the fluid oscillations with increasing distance from the plate. In the argument of the cosine, the quantity -wy is called the phase shift; that is, it de- scribes how much the fluid oscillations at a distance y from the wall are \"out-of-step\" with the oscillations of the wall itself. Keep in mind that Eq. 4.1-57 is not the complete solution to the problem as stated in Eqs. 4.1-44 to 47, but only the \"periodic-steady-state\" solution. The complete solution is given in Problem 4D.1. $4.2 SOLVING FLOW PROBLEMS USING A STREAM FUNCTION Up to this point the examples and problems have been chosen so that there was only one nonvanishing component of the fluid velocity. Solutions of the complete Navier-Stokes equation for flow in two or three dimensions are more difficult to obtain. The basic pro- cedure is, of course, similar: one solves simultaneously the equations of continuity and motion, along with the appropriate initial and boundary conditions, to obtain the pres- sure and velocity profiles. However, having both velocity and pressure as dependent variables in the equation of motion presents more difficulty in multidimensional flow problems than in the sim- pler ones discussed previously. It is therefore frequently convenient to eliminate the 122 Chapter 4 Velocity Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable pressure by taking the curl of the equation of motion, after making use of the vector identity [v . Vv] = $V(V v) - [v x [V x v]], which is given in Eq. A.4-23. For fluids of constant viscosity and density, this operation gives This is the equation of change for the vorticity [V X vl; two other ways of writing it are given in Problem 3D.2. For viscous flow problems one can then solve the vorticity equation (a third-order vector equation) together with the equation of continuity and the relevant initial and boundary conditions to get the velocity distribution. Once that is known, the pressure distribution can be obtained from the Navier-Stokes equation in Eq. 3.5-6. This method of solving flow problems is sometimes convenient even for the one-dimensional flows previously discussed (see, for example, Problem 4B.4). For planar or axisymmetric flows the vorticity equation can be reformulated by in- troducing the stream function +. To do this, we express the two nonvanishing compo- nents of the velocity as derivatives of cC, in such a way that the equation of continuity is automatically satisfied (see Table 4.2-1). The component of the vorticity equation corre- sponding to the direction in which there is no flow then becomes a fourth-order scalar equation for +. The two nonvanishing velocity components can then be obtained after the equation for the scalar + has been found. The most important problems that can be treated in this way are given in Table 4.1-1.' The stream function itself is not without interest. Surfaces of constant + contain the streamlines: which in steady-state flow are the paths of fluid elements. The volumetric rate of flow between the surfaces + = and + = +2 is proportional to +2 - In this section we consider, as an example, the steady, creeping flow past a station- ary sphere, which is described by the Stokes equation of Eq. 3.5-8, valid for Re < < 1 (see the discussion right after Eq. 3.7-9). For creeping flow the second term on the left side of Eq. 4.2-1 is set equal to zero. The equation is then linear, and therefore there are many methods available for solving the pr~blem.~ We use the stream function method based on Eq. 4.2-1. Use Table 4.2-1 to set up the differential equation for the stream function for the flow of a Newtonian fluid around a stationary sphere of radius R at Re << 1. Obtain the velocity and around pressure distributions when the fluid approaches the sphere in the positive z direction, as in a Sphere Fig. 2.6-1.

Chang, Chem. Eng. Sci., 40,434447 (1985) dealt with high-Re flow through cubic arrays of spheres, including steady-state solutions and transition to turbulence. W. E. Stewart and M. A. McClelland, AICkE Journal, 29,947-956 (1983) gave matched asymptotic solutions for forced convection in three-dimensional flows with viscous heating. See, for example, G. K. Batchelor, An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics, Cambridge University Press (1967), S2.2. Chapter 2 of this book is an extensive discussion of the kinematics of fluid motion. The solution given here follows that given by L. M. Milne-Thomson, Theoretical Hydrodynamics, Macmillan, New York, 3rd edition (1955), pp. 555-557. For other approaches, see H. Lamb, Hydrodynamics, Dover, New York (1945), §§337,338. For a discussion of unsteady flow around a sphere, see R. Berker, in Handbuck der Pkysik, Volume VIII-2, Springer, Berlin (1963), §69; or H.

The problem of finding the forces and torques on objects of arbitrary shapes is discussed thoroughly by S. Kim and S. J. Karrila, Microkydrodynamics: Principles and Selected Applications, Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston (1991), Chapter 11. 54.2 Solving Flow Problems Using a Stream Function 123 124 Chapter 4 Velocity Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable SOLUTION For steady, creeping flow, the entire left side of Eq. D of Table 4.2-1 may be set equal to zero, and the equation for axisymmetric flow becomes or, in spherical coordinates [a2 -+-- sin 0 a ( -- I d )I2, = dr2 r2 do sin 0 do This is to be solved with the following boundary conditions: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: at r = R, 1 a* v,= +--=o r sin 9 dr The first two boundary conditions describe the no-slip condition at the sphere surface. The third implies that v, + v, far from the sphere (this can be seen by recognizing that v, = v, cos 8 and v, = -v, sin 8 far from the sphere). We now postulate a solution of the form since it will at least satisfy the third boundary condition in Eq. 4.2-6. When it is substituted into Eq. 4.2-4, we get The fact that the variable 0 does not appear in this equation suggests that the postulate in Eq. 4.2-7 is satisfactory. Equation 4.2-8 is an \"equidimensional\" fourth-order equation (see Eq. C.1-14). When a trial solution of the form f(r) = Crn is substituted into this equation, we find that n may have the values -1,1,2, and 4. Therefore f(r) has the form To satisfy the third boundary condition, C4 must be zero, and C3 has to be -$urn. Hence the stream function is The velocity components are then obtained by using Table 4.2-1 as follows: The first two boundary conditions now give C1 = -$V,X~ and CZ = :V,R, SO that v =v m( 1-- $1 - +- ;(:Y) - coso Vg = -V,(l - a (:) - a (:)') sin 0 These are the velocity components given in Eqs. 2.6-1 and 2 without proof. g4.2 Solving Flow Problems Using a Stream Function 125 To get the pressure distribution, we substitute these velocity components into the r- and 6-components of the Navier-Stokes equation (given in Table B.7). After some tedious manip- ulations we get These equations may be integrated (cf. Eqs. 3.6-38 to 41), and, when use is made of the bound- ary condition that as r -+ co the modified pressure 9 tends to po (the pressure in the plane z = 0 far from the sphere), we get This is the same as the pressure distribution given in Eq. 2.6-4. In g2.6 we showed how one can integrate the pressure and velocity distributions over the sphere surface to get the drag force. That method for getting the force of the fluid on the solid is general. Here we evaluate the \"kinetic force\" F, by equating the rate of doing work on the sphere (force X velocity) to the rate of viscous dissipation within the fluid, thus Fp, = - I:T 1; 1; (~:Vv)&r sin Od6d+ Insertion of the function (-~VV) in spherical coordinates from Table B.7 gives Then the velocity profiles from Eqs. 4.2-13 and 14 are substituted into Eq. 4.2-19. When the in- dicated differentiations and integrations (lengthy!) are performed, one finally gets which is Stokes' law. As pointed out in g2.6, Stokes' law is restricted to Re < 0.1. The expression for the drag force can be improved by going back and including the [v . Vvl term. Then use of the method of matched asymptotic expansions leads to the following result4 where y = 0.5772 is Euler's constant. This expression is good up to Re of about 1. ' I. Proudman and J. R. A.

Mech. 37,751-760 (1969). 126 Chapter 4 Velocity Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable 54.3 FLOW OF INVISCID FLUIDS BY USE OF THE VELOCITY POTENTIAL' Of course, we know that inviscid fluids (i.e., fluids devoid of viscosity) do not actually exist. However, the Euler equation of motion of Eq. 3.5-9 has been found to be useful for describing the flows of low-viscosity fluids at Re >> 1 around streamlined objects and gives a reasonably good description of the velocity profile, except very near the object and beyond the line of separation. Then the vorticity equation in Eq. 3D.2-1 may be simplified by omitting the term containing the kinematic viscosity. If, in addition, the flow is steady and two-dimen- sional, then the terms d/dt and [w . Vv] vanish. This means that the vorticity w = [Vx v] is constant along a streamline. If the fluid approaching a submerged object has no vortic- ity far away from the object, then the flow will be such that w = [V X vl will be zero throughout the entire flow field. That is, the flow will be irrotational. To summarize, if we assume that p = constant and [V X vl = 0, then we can expect to get a reasonably good description of the flow of low-viscosity fluids around sub- merged objects in two-dimensional flows. This type of flow is referred to as potential pow. Of course we know that this flow description will be inadequate in the neighbor- hood of solid surfaces. Near these surfaces we make use of a different set of assump- tions, and these lead to boundary-layer the0 y, which is discussed in s4.4. By solving the potential flow equations for the \"far field and the boundary-layer equations for the \"near field and then matching the solutions asymptotically for large Re, it is possible to develop an understanding of the entire flow field around a streamlined ~bject.~ To describe potential flow we start with the equation of continuity for an incom- pressible fluid and the Euler equation for an inviscid fluid (Eq. 3.5-9): (continuity) (V-v) = 0 (4.3-1) (motion) In the equation of motion we have made use of the vector identity [v . Vv] = v;v2 - [V X [V X v11 (see Eq. A.4-23). For the two-dimensional, irrotational flow the statement that [V x v] = 0 is (irrotational) and the equation of continuity is (continuity) The equation of motion for steady, irrotational flow can be integrated to give (motion) ip(vz + 4) + P = constant (4.3-5) That is, the sum of the pressure and the kinetic and potential energy per unit volume is constant throughout the entire flow field. This is the Bernoulli equation for incompress- ible, potential flow, and the constant is the same for all streamlines. (This has to be con- trasted with Eq. 3.5-12, the Bernoulli equation for a compressible fluid in any kind of flow; there the sum of the three contributions is a different constant on each streamline.)

(1975). s4.3 Flow of Inviscid Fluids by Use of the Velocity Potential 127 We want to solve Eqs. 4.3-3 to 5 to obtain v,, v,, and 9 as functions of x and y. We have already seen in the previous section that the equation of continuity in two-dimen- sional flows can be satisfied by writing the components of the velocity in terms of a stream function $(x, y). However, any vector that has a zero curl can also be written as the gradient of a scalar function (that is, [V x vl = 0 implies that v = -V+). It is very conve- nient, then, to introduce a velocity potential $(x, y). Instead of working with the velocity components v, and v,, we choose to work with +(x, y) and +(x, y). We then have the fol- lowing relations: (stream function) (velocity potential) Now Eqs. 4.3-3 and 4.3-4 will automatically be satisfied. By equating the expressions for the velocity components we get These are the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are the relations that must be satisfied by the real and imaginary parts of any analytic function3 w(z) = +(x, y) + i+(x, y), where z = x + iy. The quantity w(z) is called the complex potential. Differentiation of Eq. 4.3-10 with respect to x and Eq. 4.3-11 with respect to y and then adding gives V2$ = 0. Differentiat- ing with respect to the variables in reverse order and then substracting gives V2+ = 0. That is, both +(x, y) and +(x, y) satisfy the two-dimensional Laplace eq~ation.~ As a consequence of the preceding development, it appears that any analytic func- tion w(z) yields a pair of functions +(x, y) and +(x, y) that are the velocity potential and stream function for some flow problem. Furthermore, the curves $(x, y) = constant and +(x, y) = constant are then the equipotential lines and streamlines for the problem. The ve- locity components are then obtained from Eqs. 4.3-6 and 7 or Eqs. 4.3-8 and 9 or from dw - = -v, + ivy (4.3-12) dz in which dw/dz is called the complex velocity. Once the velocity components are known, the modified pressure can then be found from Eq. 4.3-5. Alternatively, the equipotential lines and streamlines can be obtained from the in- verse function z(w) = x(+, $) + iy($, $), in which z(w) is any analytic function of w. Be- tween the functions x($, $) and y($, +) we can eliminate cC/ and get - - - - - - Some knowledge of the analytic functions of a complex variable is assumed here. Helpful introductions to the subject can be found in V. L. Streeter, E. B. Wylie, and K. W. Bedford, Fluid Mechanics, McGraw-Hill, New York, 9th ed. (1998), Chapter 8, and in M. D. Greenberg, Foundations of Applied Mathematics, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. (1978), Chapters 11 and 12. Even for three-dimensional flows the assumption of irrotational flow still permits the definition of a velocity potential. When v = -V+ is substituted into (V . v) = 0, we get the three-dimensional Laplace equation V2+ = 0. The solution of this equation is the subject of \"potential theory,\" for which there is an enormous literature. See, for example, P. M. Morse and H. Feshbach, Methods of Theoretical Physics, McGraw-Hill, New York (19531, Chapter 11; and J. M. Robertson, Hydrodynamics in Theory and Application, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. (1965), which emphasizes the engineering applications. There are many problems in flow through porous media, heat conduction, diffusion, and electrical conduction that are described by Laplace's equation. 128 Chapter 4 Velocity Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable EXAMPLE 4.3-1 Potential Flow around a Cylinder SOLUTION Similar elimination of 4 gives Setting 4 = a constant in Eq. 4.3-13 gives the equations for the equipotential lines for some flow problem, and setting $ = constant in Eq. 4.3-14 gives equations for the stream- lines. The velocity components can be obtained from Thus from any analytic function w(z), or its inverse z(w), we can construct a flow net with streamlines $ = constant and equipotential lines 4 = constant. The task of finding w(z) or Z(W) to satisfy a given flow problem is, however, considerably more difficult. Some special methods are a~ailable\"~ but it is frequently more expedient to consult a table of conformal mapping^.^ In the next two illustrative examples we show how to use the complex potential w(z) to describe the potential flow around a cylinder, and the inverse function z(w) to solve the problem of the potential flow into a channel. In the third example we solve the flow in the neighborhood of a corner, which is treated further in s4.4 by the boundary-layer method. A few general comments should be kept in mind: The streamlines are everywhere perpendicular to the equipotential lines. This property, evident from Eqs. 4.3-10,11, is useful for the approximate construction of flow nets. Streamlines and equipotential lines can be interchanged to get the solution of another flow problem. This follows from (a) and the fact that both 4 and $ are solutions to the two-dimensional Laplace equation. Any streamline may be replaced by a solid surface. This follows from the boundary condition that the normal component of the velocity of the fluid is zero at a solid surface. The tangential component is not restricted, since in po- tential flow the fluid is presumed to be able to slide freely along the surface (the complete-slip assumption). (a) Show that the complex potential describes the potential flow around a circular cylinder of radius R, when the approach veloc- ity is v, in the positive x direction. (b) Find the components of the velocity vector. (c) Find the pressure distribution on the cylinder surface, when the modified pressure far from the cylinder is 9,. (a) To find the stream function and velocity potential, we write the complex potential in the form w(z) = +(x, y) + i$(x, y): J. Fuka, Chapter 21 in K.

In Fig. 4.3-1 the streamlines are plotted as the curves ? = constant. The streamline 9 = 0 gives a unit circle, which represents the surface of the cylinder. The streamline = -: goes through the point X = 0, Y = 2, and so on. (b) The velocity components are obtainable from the stream function by using Eqs. 4.3-6 and 7. They may also be obtained from the complex velocity according to Eq. 4.3-12, as follows: (COS 20 - i sin 20) Therefore the velocity components as function of position are (c) On the surface of the cylinder, v = R, and v2 = 7.7; + v; = v?[(l - cos 2012 + (sin 28)'] = 4v5 sin2 13 When 0 is zero or T, the fluid velocity is zero; such points are known as stagnation points. From Eq. 4.3-5 we know that Then from the last two equations we get the pressure distribution on the surface of the cylinder Fig. 4.3-1. The streamlines for the potential flow around a cylinder according to Eq. 4.3-19. 130 Chapter 4 Velocity Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable Note that the modified pressure distribution is symmetric about the x-axis; that is, for poten- tial flow there is no form drag on the cylinder (dfAlembert's para do^).^ Of course, we know now that this is not really a paradox, but simply the result of the fact that the inviscid fluid does not permit applying the no-slip boundary condition at the interface. Show that the inverse function Flow Into a Z(W) = - wb + + exp(m/bv,) 11, (4.3-26) Rectangular Channel represents the potential flow into a rectangular channel of half-width b. Here v, is the magni- tude of the velocity far downstream from the entrance to the channel. SOLUTION First we introduce dimensionless distance variables and the dimensionless quantities The inverse function of Eq. 4.3-26 may now be expressed in terms of dimensionless quantities and split up into real and imaginary parts Therefore We can now set q equal to a constant, and the streamline Y = Y(X) is expressed parametrically in @. For example, the streamline T = 0 is given by As @ goes from -a, to +a, X also goes from -m to + m; hence the X-axis is a streamline. Next, the streamline 9 = n- is given by X=@-e' Y=n- (4.3-34,35) As @ goes from - to + a,, X goes from - m to -1 and then back to -a; that is, the stream- line doubles back on itself. We select this streamline to be one of the solid walls of the rectan- gular channel. Similarly, the streamline ? = -T is the other wall. The streamlines q = C, where -n- < C < T, then give the flow pattern for the flow into the rectangular channel as shown in Fig. 4.3-2. Next, from Eq. 4.3-29 the derivative -dz/dw can be found: Comparison of this expression with Eq. 4.3-15 gives for the velocity components vyvm 35 = -(I + e'cos P) -- - - - (e@ sin *) (4.3-37) v2 v2 These equations have to be used in conjunction with Eqs. 4.3-30 and 31 to eliminate @ and ? in order to get the velocity components as functions of position. Hydrodynamic paradoxes are discussed in G. Birkhoff, Hydrodynamics, Dover, New York (1955). 94.3 Flow of Inviscid Fluids by Use of the Velocity Potential 131 Flow Near a Corner8 SOLUTION Figure 4.3-3 shows the potential flow in the neighborhood of two walls that meet at a cor- ner at 0. The flow in the neighborhood of this corner can be described by the complex potential YA Fig. 4.3-2. The streamlines for the in which c is a constant.

(c) The complex potential can be decomposed into its real and imaginary parts w = 4 + it,b = -cua(cos a6 + i sin a61 (4.3-44) Hence the stream function is 1C, = -cyn sin a0 (4.3-45) To get the streamlines, one selects various values for the stream function-say, $,, $,, t,b, . , -and then for each value one plots r as a function of 0. (d) Since for ideal flow any streamline may be replaced by a wall, and vice versa, the results found here for a > 0 describe the inviscid flow over a wedge (see Fig. 4.3-4). We make use of this in Example 4.4-3. A few words of warning are in order concerning the applicability of potential-flow theory to real systems: a. For the flow around a cylinder, the streamlines shown in Fig. 4.3-1 do not con- form to any of the flow regimes sketched in Fig. 3.7-2. b. For the flow into a channel, the predicted flow pattern of Fig. 4.3-2 is unrealistic inside the channel and just upstream from the channel entrance. A much better approximation to the actual behavior is shown in Fig. 4.3-5. Both of these failures of the elementary potential theory result from the phenomenon of separation: the departure of streamlines from a boundary surface. Separation tends to occur at sharp corners of solid boundaries, as in channel flow, and on the downstream sides of bluff objects, as in the flow around a cylinder. Gener- ally, separation is likely to occur in regions where the pressure increases in the direction s4.4 Flow near Solid Surfaces by Boundary-Layer Theory 133 Fig. 4.3-5. Potential flow into a rectangular channel with separation, as calculated by H. von Helmholtz, Phil. Mag., 36,337-345 (1868). The streamlines for !P = -+r separate from the inner surface of the channel. The velocity along this separated streamline is con- stant. Between the separated streamline and the wall X is an empty region. Y=-7r of flow. Potential-flow analyses are not useful in the separated region. They can, how- ever, be used upstream of this region if the location of the separation streamline is known. Methods of making such calculations have been highly developed. Sometimes the posi- tion of the separation streamline can be estimated successfully from potential-flow the- ory. This is true for flow into a channel, and, in fact, Fig. 4.3-5 was obtained in this way.9 For other systems, such as the flow around the cylinder, the separation point and separa- tion streamline must be located by experiment. Even when the position of the separation streamline is not known, potential flow solutions may be valuable. For example, the flow field of Ex. 4.3-1 has been found useful for estimating aerosol impaction coefficients on cylinders.1° This success is a result of the fact that most of the particle impacts occur near the forward stagnation point, where the flow is not affected very much by the position of the separation streamline. Valuable semiquantitative conclusions concerning heat- and mass-transfer behavior can also be made on the basis of potential flow calculations ig- noring the separation phenomenon. The techniques described in this section all assume that the velocity vector can be written as the gradient of a scalar function that satisfies Laplace's equation. The equation of motion plays a much less prominent role than for the viscous flows discussed previ- ously, and its primary use is for the determination of the pressure distribution once the velocity profiles are found. 54.4 FLOW NEAR SOLID SURFACES BY BOUNDARY-LAYER THEORY The potential flow examples discussed in the previous section showed how to predict the flow field by means of a stream function and a velocity potential. The solutions for the velocity distribution thus obtained do not satisfy the usual \"no-slip\" boundary con- dition at the wall. Consequently, the potential flow solutions are of no value in describ- ing the transport phenomena in the immediate neighborhood of the wall. Specifically, the viscous drag force cannot be obtained, and it is also not possible to get reliable de- scriptions of interphase heat- and mass-transfer at solid surfaces. To describe the behavior near the wall, we use boundary-layer the0 y. For the descrip- tion of a viscous flow, we obtain an approximate solution for the velocity components in a very thin boundary layer near the wall, taking the viscosity into account. Then we \"match this solution to the potential flow solution that describes the flow outside the H. von Helmholtz, Phil Mag. (4), 36,337-345 (1868).

The success of the method depends on the thinness of the boundary layer, a condition that is met at high Reynolds number. We consider the steady, two-dimensional flow of a fluid with constant p and p around a submerged object, such as that shown in Fig. 4.4-1. We assert that the main changes in the velocity take place in a very thin region, the boundary layer, in which the curvature effects are not important. We can then set up a Cartesian coordinate system with x pointing downstream, and y perpendicular to the solid surface. The continuity equation and the Navier-Stokes equations then become: dv, dvy -+--=o dx dy Some of the terms in these equations can be discarded by order-of-magnitude argu- ments. We use three quantities as \"yardsticks\": the approach velocity v,, some linear di- mension 1, of the submerged body, and an average thickness 60 of the boundary layer. The presumption that So << lo allows us to make a number of rough calculations of or- ders of magnitude. Since vx varies from zero at the solid surface to v, at the outer edge of the boundary layer, we can say that where 0 means \"order of magnitude of.\" Similarly, the maximum variation in v, over the length lo of the surface will be v,, so that Here we have made use of the equation of continuity to get one more derivative (we are concerned here only with orders of magnitude and not the signs of the quantities). Inte- gration of the second relation suggests that vy = 0((6,/1,)v,) << v,. The various terms in Eq. 4.4-2 may now be estimated as v--=O- v-=O-- d2vx d2v, (3; 2 ((r) - = O(t) - = O($) (4.4-6) \" dx dx2 dy2 Approximate outer limit of boundary layer where V, + VJX) Fig. 4.4-1. Coordinate system for the two-dimensional flow around a submerged object. The boundary-layer thickness is greatly exaggerated for pur- poses of illustration. Because the boundary layer is in fact quite thin, it is permissible to use rectangular coordinates lo- cally along the curved surface. 54.4 Flow near Solid Surfaces by Boundary-Layer Theory 135 This suggests that d2vX/dx2 << d2vx/dy2, SO that the former may be safely neglected. In the boundary layer it is expected that the terms on the left side of Eq. 4.4-2 should be of the same order of magnitude as those on the right side, and therefore The second of these relations shows that the boundary-layer thickness is small compared to the dimensions of the submerged object in high-Reynolds-number flows. Similarly it can be shown, with the help of Eq. 4.4-7, that three of the derivatives in Eq. 4.4-3 are of the same order of magnitude: Comparison of this result with Eq. 4.4-6 shows that d9/dy << dP/dx. This means that the y-component of the equation of motion is not needed and that the modified pressure can be treated as a function of x alone. As a result of these order-of-magnitude arguments, we are left with the Prandtl boundary layer equations:' (continuity) (motion) The modified pressure 9(x) is presumed known from the solution of the corresponding potential-flow problem or from experimental measurements. The usual boundary conditions for these equations are the no-slip condition (v, = 0 at y = O), the condition of no mass transfer from the wall (vy = 0 at y = O), and the statement that the velocity merges into the external (potential-flow) velocity at the outer edge of the boundary layer (vx(x, y) -, v,(x)). The function v,(x) is related to 9(x) according to the potential-flow equation of motion in Eq. 4.3-5. Consequently the term -(1 /p)(dY /dx) in Eq. 4.4-10 can be replaced by v,(dv,/dx) for steady flow. Thus Eq. 4.4-10 may also be written as dv, dv, dv, d2v, vx-+v -=v,-+ V- dx Y dy dx ay2 The equation of continuity may be solved for v, by using the boundary condition that v, = 0 at y = 0 (i.e., no mass transfer), and then this expression for v, may be substituted into Eq. 4.4-11 to give Y dv, dv, d2v, vX3- dx (/, iildy)%= veZ+ v2 This is a partial differential equation for the single dependent variable vx. ' Ludwig Prandtl(18751953) (pronounced \"Prahn-t'l), who taught in Hannover and Gottingen and later served as the Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Fluid Dynamics, was one of the people who shaped the future of his field at the beginning of the twentieth century; he made contributions to turbulent flow and heat transfer, but his development of the boundary-layer equations was his crowning achievement.

The quantity on the left side of Eq. 4.4-13 is the shear stress exerted by the fluid on the wall: -~,,l~=~. The original Prandtl boundary-layer equations, Eqs. 4.4-9 and 10, have thus been transformed into Eq. 4.4-11, Eq. 4.4-12, and Eq. 4.4-13, and any of these may be taken as the starting point for solving two-dimensional boundary-layer problems. Equation 4.4- 13, with assumed expressions for the velocity profile, is the basis of many \"approximate boundary-layer solutions\" (see Example 4.4-1). On the other hand, the analytical or nu- merical solutions of Eqs. 4.4-11 or 12 are called \"exact boundary-layer solutions\" (see Ex- ample 4.4-2). The discussion here is for steady, laminar, two-dimensional flows of fluids with con- stant density and viscosity. Corresponding equations are available for unsteady flow, turbulent flow, variable fluid properties, and three-dimensional boundary Although many exact and approximate boundary-layer solutions have been ob- tained and applications of the theory to streamlined objects have been quite successful, considerable work remains to be done on flows with adverse pressure gradients (i.e., positive dP/dx) in Eq. 4.4-10, such as the flow on the downstream side of a blunt object. In such flows the streamlines usually separate from the surface before reaching the rear of the object (see Fig. 3.7-2). The boundary-layer approach described here is suitable for such flows only in the region upstream from the separation point. Use the von K5rm6n momentum balance to estimate the steady-state velocity profiles near a semi-infinite flat plate in a tangential stream with approach velocity v, (see Fig. 4.4-2).

Hence we can guess a form for ux(y) and substitute it directly into the von Karmiin momentum balance. One reasonable choice is to let v,(y) by a function of y/6, where S(x) is the \"thickness\" of the boundary layer. The function is so chosen that u, = 0 at y = 0 and v, = v, at y = 6. This is tantamount to assuming geometrical similarity of the velocity profiles for various values of x. When this assumed pro- file is substituted into the von Khrman momentum balance, an ordinary differential equation for the boundary-layer thickness 6(x) is obtained. When this equation has been solved, the 6(x) so obtained can then be used to get the velocity profile and other quantities of interest. For the present problem a plausible guess for the velocity distribution, with a reasonable shape, is for 0 5 y r 6(x) (boundary-layer region) (4.4-14) ux -- - 1 for y r 6(x) (potential flow region) (4.4-15) urn This is \"reasonable\" because this velocity profile satisfies the no-slip condition at y = 0, and dv,/dy = 0 at the outer edge of the boundary layer. Substitution of this profile into the von KArmBn integral balance in Eq. 4.4-13 gives This first-order, separable differential equation can now be integrated to give for the bound- ary-layer thickness I 7 Therefore, the boundary-layer thickness increases as the square root of the distance from the up- stream end of the plate. The resulting approximate solution for the velocity distribution is then From this result we can estimate the drag force on a plate of finite size wetted on both sides. For a plate of width Wand length L, integration of the momentum flux over the two solid sur- faces gives: The exact solution, given in the next example, gives the same result, but with a numerical co- efficient of 1.328. Both solutions predict the drag force within the scatter of the experimental data. However, the exact solution gives somewhat better agreement with the measured veloc- ity profiles3 This additional accuracy is essential for stability calculations. Obtain the exact solution for the problem given in the previous example. Laminar Flow along SOLUTION a Flat Plate (Exact ~olution)' This problem may be solved by using the definition of the stream function in Table 4.2-1. In- serting the expressions for the velocity components in the first row of entries, we get -- - - This problem was treated originally by H. Blasius, Zeits. Math. Phys., 56,l-37 (1908). 138 Chapter 4 Velocity Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable The boundary conditions for this equation for $(x, y) are B.C. 1: a+ aty=O, -=v,=O for x 2 0 dx (4.4-21) B.C. 2: aty=O, -- d\" -u, = 0 forx2O (4.4-22) JY B.C. 3: a* - asy+m, -- -vx + -urn for x 2 0 (4.4-23) dy B.C. 4: a* - atx=O, -- -vx = -u, for y > 0 (4.4-24) JY Inasmuch as there is no characteristic length appearing in the above relations, the method of combination of independent variables seems appropriate. By dimensional argu- ments similar to those used in Example 4.1-1, we write The factor of 2 is included to avoid having any numerical factors occur in the differential equation in Eq. 4.4-27. The stream function that gives the velocity distribution in Eq. 4.4-25 is This expression for the stream function is consistent with Eq. 4.4-25 as may be seen by using the relation u, = -d+/dy (given in Table 4.2-1). Substitution of Eq. 4.4-26 into Eq. 4.4-20 gives Substitution into the boundary conditions gives B.C. 1 and 2: B.C. 3 and 4: atq=0, f=O and ft=O ass-+ m, fl+l Thus the determination of the flow field is reduced to the solution of one third-order ordinary differential equation. This equation, along with the boundary conditions given, can be solved by numerical in- tegration, and accurate tables of the solution are a~ailable.~,~ The problem was originally solved by Blasius7 using analytic approximations that proved to be quite accurate. A plot of his solution is shown in Fig. 4.4-3 along with experimental data taken subsequently. The agreement between theory and experiment is remarkably good. The drag force on a plate of width W and length L may be calculated from the dimen- sionless velocity gradient at the wall, f \"(0) = 0.4696 . . . as follows: This result has also been confirmed e~perimentally.~,~ Because of the approximations made in Eq. 4.4-10, the solution is most accurate at large local Reynolds numbers; that is, Re, = xv,/v >> 1. The excluded region of lower Reynolds numbers is small enough to ignore in most drag calculations. More complete 54.4 Flow near Solid Surfaces by Boundary-Layer Theory Fig. 4.4-3.

Schlichting, Boundary-Layer Theory, McGraw-Hill, New York, 7th edition (1979), p. 1371. analyses8 indicate that Eq. 4.4-30 is accurate to within 3% for Lv,/v 2 lo4 and within 0.3% for Lv,/v 2 lo6. The growth of the boundary layer with increasing x eventually leads to an unstable situation, and turbulent flow sets in. The transition is found to begin somewhere in the range of local Reynolds number of Re, = xv,/v 2 3 X 10' to 3 X loh, depending on the uniformity of the approaching streams8 Upstream of the transition region the flow re- mains laminar, and downstream it is turbulent. We now want to treat the boundary-layer problem analogous to Example 4.3-3, namely the flow near a corner (see Fig. 4.3-4). If cr > 1, the problem may also be interpreted as the flow near a Corner along a wedge of included angle Pn-, with a = 2/(2 - P). For this system the external flow v, is known from Eqs. 4.3-42 and 43, where we found that This was the expression that was found to be valid right at the wall (i.e., at y = 0). Here, it is assumed that the boundary layer is so thin that using the wall expression from ideal flow is adequate for the outer limit of the boundary-layer solution, at least for small values of x.

Velocity profile for wedge flow with included angle prr. Negative values of p correspond to the flow around an \"external corner\" [see Fig. 4.3-4(ii)I with slip at the wall upstream of the corner. We now have to solve Eq. 4.4-11, using Eq. 4.4-31 for v,(x). When we introduce the stream function from the first row of Table 4.2-1, we obtain the following differential equation for +: which corresponds to Eq. 4.4-20 with the term v,(dv,/dx) added. It was discovered9 that this equation can be reduced to a single ordinary differential equation by introducing a dimen- sionless stream function f(q) by *(x, y) = V'ZT~~X\"'~ (4.4-33) in which the independent variable is Then Eq. 4.4-32 becomes the Falkner-Skan equation9 This equation has been solved numerically with the appropriate boundary conditions, and the results are shown in Fig. 4.4-4. It can be seen that for positive values of p, which corresponds to the systems shown in Fig. 4.3-4(a) and Fig. 4.3-5, the fluid is accelerating and the velocity profiles are stable. For negative values of p, down to p = -0.199, the flows are decelerating but stable, and no sepa- ration occurs. However, if p > -0.199, the velocity gradient at the wall becomes zero, and separation of the flow occurs. Therefore, for the interior corner flows and for wedge flows, there is no separation, but for the exterior corner flows, separation may occur. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1.

The amplitude ratio (ratio of amplitude of output function to input function) and phase shift both depend on the viscosity of the fluid and hence can be used for determining the viscosity. It is assumed throughout that the oscillations are of small amplitude. Then the problem is a linear one, and it can be solved either by Laplace transform or by the method outlined in this problem. (a) First, apply Newton's second law of motion to the cylindrical bob for the special case that the annular space is completely evacuated.

(d) Simplify the starting equations, Eqs. 4C.2-1 to 6, by making the assumption that a is only slightly greater than unity, so that the curvature may be neglected (the problem can be solved without making this assumption4). This suggests that a suitable dimensionless distance vari- able is x = (r - R)/[(a - 1)Rl. Recast the entire problem in dimensionless quantities in such a way that 1 /o, = a is used as a characteristic time, and so that the viscosity appears in just one dimensionless group. The only choice turns out to be: time: T= $t (4C.2-7) velocity: viscosity: 2.rrR4Lp(a - 1) reciprocal of moment of inertia: A = I H. Markovitz, J. Appl.

The density and pressure are averaged over a region available to flow that is large with respect to the pore size. Equation 4C.3-2 was proposed empirically to describe the slow seepage of fluids through granular media. When Eqs. 4C.3-1 and 2 are combined we get for constant viscosity and permeability.

We have seen that the differential equations describing laminar flow are well understood and that, for a number of simple systems, the velocity distribution and various derived quantities can be obtained in a straightforward fashion. The limiting factor in applying the equations of change is the mathematical complexity that one encounters in problems for which there are several velocity components that are functions of several variables. Even there, with the rapid development of computational fluid dynamics, such problems are gradually yielding to numerical solution. In this chapter we turn our attention to turbulent flow. Whereas laminar flow is orderly, turbulent flow is chaotic. It is this chaotic nature of turbulent flow that poses all sorts of difficulties. In fact, one might question whether or not the equations of change given in Chapter 3 are even capable of describing the violently fluctuating mo- tions in turbulent flow. Since the sizes of the turbulent eddies are several orders of magnitude larger than the mean free path of the molecules of the fluid, the equations of change are applicable. Numerical solutions of these equations are obtainable and can be used for studying the details of the turbulence structure. For many purposes, however, we are not interested in having such detailed information, in view of the computational effort required. Therefore, in this chapter we shall concern ourselves primarily with methods that enable us to describe the time-smoothed velocity and pressure profiles. In s5.1 we start by comparing the experimental results for laminar and turbulent flows in several flow systems. In this way we can get some qualitative ideas about the main differences between laminar and turbulent motions. These experiments help to de- fine some of the challenges that face the fluid dynamicist. In 55.2 we define several fime-smoothed quantities, and show how these definitions can be used to time-average the equations of change over a short time interval. These equations describe the behavior of the time-smoothed velocity and pressure. The time- smoothed equation of motion, however, contains the turbulent momentum flux. This flux Velocity Distributions in Turbulent How 153 cannot be simply related to velocity gradients in the way that the momentum flux is given by Newton's law of viscosity in Chapter 1. At the present time the turbulent mo- mentum flux is usually estimated experimentally or else modeled by some type of em- piricism based on experimental measurements. Fortunately, for turbulent flow near a solid surface, there are several rather general results that are very helpful in fluid dynamics and transport phenomena: the Taylor se- ries development for the velocity near the wall; and the logarithmic and power law ve- locity profiles for regions further from the wall, the latter being obtained by dimensional reasoning. These expressions for the time-smoothed velocity distribution are given in s5.3. In the following section, 55.4, we present a few of the empiricisms that have been proposed for the turbulent momentum flux. These empiricisms are of historical interest and have also been widely used in engineering calculations. When applied with proper judgment, these empirical expressions can be useful. The remainder of the chapter is devoted to a discussion of two types of turbulent flows: flows in closed conduits (55.5) and flows in jets (55.6). These flows illustrate the two classes of flows that are usually discussed under the headings of wall turbulence and free turbulence. In this brief introduction to turbulence we deal primarily with the description of the fully developed turbulent flow of an incompressible fluid. We do not consider the theo- retical methods for predicting the inception of turbulence nor the experimental tech- niques devised for probing the structure of turbulent flow. We also give no discussion of the statistical theories of turbulence and the way in which the turbulent energy is distrib- uted over the various modes of motion. For these and other interesting topics, the reader should consult some of the standard books on turbulence.l4 There is a growing litera- ture on experimental and computational evidence for \"coherent structures\" (vortices) in turbulent flows.7 Turbulence is an important subject. In fact, most flows encountered in engineering are turbulent and not laminar! Although our understanding of turbulence is far from sat- isfactory, it is a subject that must be studied and appreciated. For the solution to indus- trial problems we cannot get neat analytical results, and, for the most part, such problems are attacked by using a combination of dimensional analysis and experimental data. This method is discussed in Chapter 6. ' S. Corrsin, \"Turbulence: Experimental Methods,\" in Handbuch der Physik, Springer, Berlin (19631, Vol. VIII/2. Stanley Corrsin (1920-1986), a professor at The Johns Hopkins University, was an excellent experimentalist and teacher; he studied the interaction between chemical reactions and turbulence and the propagation of the double temperature correlations.

Specifi- cally we consider the flow in conduits of circular and triangular cross section, flow along a flat plate, and flows in jets. The first three of these were considered for laminar flow in 52.3, Problem 3B.2, and 54.4. Circular Tubes For the steady, fully developed, laminar flow in a circular tube of radius R we know that the velocity distribution and the average velocity are given by vz 2 -- - 1 - (a) and - () - - - I (Re < 2100) Vz, ma, Vz,max 2 and that the pressure drop and mass flow rate w are linearly related: For turbulent flow, on the other hand, the velocity is fluctuating with time chaotically at each point in the tube. We can measure a \"time-smoothed velocity\" at each point with, say, a Pitot tube. This type of instrument is not sensitive to rapid velocity fluctuations, but senses the velocity averaged over several seconds. The time-smoothed velocity (which is defined in the next section) will have a z-component represented by G, and its shape and average value will be given very roughly by1 This $-power expression for the velocity distribution is too crude to give a realistic veloc- ity derivative at the wall. The laminar and turbulent velocity profiles are compared in Fig. 5.1-1. Tube wall Fig. 5.1-1. Qualitative comparison of lami- nar and turbulent velocity profiles.

Schlichting, Boundary-Layer Theory, McGraw-Hill, New York, 7th edition (1979), Chapter XX (tube flow), Chapters VII and XXI (flat plate flow), Chapters IX and XXIIV (jet flows). 5.1 Comparisons of Laminar and Turbulent Flows 155 Over the same range of Reynolds numbers the mass rate of flow and the pressure drop are no longer proportional but are related approximately by The stronger dependence of pressure drop on mass flow rate for turbulent flow results from the fact that more energy has to be supplied to maintain the violent eddy motion in the fluid. The laminar-turbulent transition in circular pipes normally occurs at a critical Reynolds number of roughly 2100, although this number may be higher if extreme care is taken to eliminate vibrations in the system.' The transition from laminar flow to turbu- lent flow can be demonstrated by the simple experiment originally performed by Reynolds. One sets up a long transparent tube equipped with a device for injecting a small amount of dye into the stream along the tube axis. When the flow is laminar, the dye moves downstream as a straight, coherent filament. For turbulent flow, on the other hand, the dye spreads quickly over the entire cross section, similarly to the motion of particles in Fig. 2.0-1, because of the eddying motion (turbulent diffusion). Noncircular Tubes For developed laminar flow in the triangular duct shown in Fig. 3B.2(b), the fluid parti- cles move rectilinearly in the z direction, parallel to the walls of the duct. By contrast, in turbulent flow there is superposed on the time-smoothed flow in the z direction (the pri- may pow) a time-smoothed motion in the xy-plane (the secondary flow). The secondary flow is much weaker than the primary flow and manifests itself as a set of six vortices arranged in a symmetric pattern around the duct axis (see Fig. 5.1-2). Other noncircular tubes also exhibit secondary flows. Flat Plate In s4.4 we found that for the laminar flow around a flat plate, wetted on both sides, the solution of the boundary layer equations gave the drag force expression F = 1.328- (laminar) 0 < Re, < 5 X lo5 (5.1-7) in which ReL = Lvmp/,x is the Reynolds number for a plate of length L; the plate width is W, and the approach velocity of the fluid is v,.

The stronger dependence on the approach velocity reflects the extra energy needed to maintain the irregular eddy motions in the fluid. Circular and Plane Jets Next we examine the behavior of jets that emerge from a flat wall, which is taken to be the xy-plane (see Fig. 5.6-1). The fluid comes out from a circular tube or a long narrow slot, and flows into a large body of the same fluid. Various observations on the jets can be made: the width of the jet, the centerline velocity of the jet, and the mass flow rate through a cross section parallel to the xy-plane. All these properties can be measured as functions of the distance z from the wall. In Table 5.1-1 we summarize the properties of the circular and two-dimensional jets for laminar and turbulent flow.' It is curious that, for the circular jet, the jet width, centerline velocity, and mass flow rate have exactly the same dependence on z in both laminar and turbulent flow. We shall return to this point later in 55.6. The above examples should make it clear that the gross features of laminar and tur- bulent flow are generally quite different. One of the many challenges in turbulence the- ory is to try to explain these differences. 55.2 TIME-SMOOTHED EQUATIONS OF CHANGE FOR INCOMPRESSIBLE FLUIDS We begin by considering a turbulent flow in a tube with a constant imposed pressure gradient. If at one point in the fluid we observe one component of the velocity as a func- tion of time, we find that it is fluctuating in a chaotic fashion as shown in Fig. 5.2-l(a). The fluctuations are irregular deviations from a mean value. The actual velocity can be regarded as the sum of the mean value (designated by an overbar) and the fluctuation (designated by a prime). For example, for the z-component of the velocity we write which is sometimes called the Reynolds decomposition. The mean value is obtained from v,(t) by making a time average over a large number of fluctuations 55.2 Time-Smoothed Equations of Change for Incompressible Fluids 157 t I Time t Time t Fig. 5.2-1.

For the system at hand, the quantity &, which we call the time-smoothed velocity, is independent of time, but of course depends on position. When the time-smoothed velocity does not depend on time, we speak of steadily driven turbulent pow. The same comments we have made for velocity can also be made for pressure. Next we consider turbulent flow in a tube with a time-dependent pressure gradient. For such a flow one can define time-smoothed quantities as above, but one has to under- stand that the period to must be small with respect to the changes in the pressure gradi- ent, but still large with respect to the periods of fluctuations. For such a situation the time-smoothed velocity and the actual velocity are illustrated in Fig. 5.2-l(b).' According to the definition in Eq. 5.2-2, it is easy to verify that the following rela- tions are true: The quantity 2 will not, however, be zero, and in fact the ratio -/(8,) can be taken to be a measure of the magnitude of the turbulent fluctuations. This quantity, known as the intensity of turbulence, may have values from 1 to 10% in the main part of a turbulent stream and values of 25% or higher in the neighborhood of a solid wall. Hence, it must be emphasized that we are not necessarily dealing with tiny disturbances; sometimes the fluc- tuations are actually quite violent and large. Quantities such as v,:.vi are also nonzero. The reason for this is that the local motions in the x and y directions are correlated. In other words, the fluctuations in the x direction are not independent of the fluctuations in the y direction. We shall see presently that these time-smoothed values of the products of fluctuating properties have an important role in turbulent momentum transfer. Later we shall find similar correlations arising in turbulent heat and mass transport. ' One can also define the \"overbar\" quantities in terms of an \"ensemble average.\" For most purposes the results are equivalent or are assumed to be so. See, for example, A. A. Townsend, The Structure of Turbulent Shear Flow, Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition (1976). See also P. K. Kundu, Fluid Mechanics, Academic Press, New York (1990), p. 421, regarding the last of the formulas given in Eq. 5.2-3. 158 Chapter 5 Velocity Distributions in Turbulent Flow Having defined the time-smoothed quantities and discussed some of the properties of the fluctuating quantities, we can now move on to the time-smoothing of the equations of change. To keep the development as simple as possible, we consider here only the equations for a fluid of constant density and viscosity. We start by writing the equations of continuity and motion with v replaced by its equivalent F + v' and p by its equivalent - p + p'. The equation of continuity is then (V . v) = 0, and we write the x-component of the equation of motion, Eq. 3.5-6, in the d/dt form by using Eq. 3.5-5: d a - d - p(vx + v;) = -- (p + p') - p(v, + v:)(v, + v:) + P(V, + vpv, + v:) d t dx dy The y- and z-components of the equation of motion can be similarly written. We next time-smooth these equations, making use of the relations given in Eq. 5.2-3. This gives + pV2E, + pg, (5.2-7) dz with similar relations for the y- and z-components of the equation of motion. These are then the time-smoothed equations of continuity and motion for a fluid with constant density and viscosity. By comparing them with the corresponding equations in Eq. 3.1-5 and Eq. 3.5-6 (the latter rewritten in terms of d/dt), we conclude that a. The equation of continuity is the same as we had previously, except that v is now replaced by i. b. The equation of motion now has i and p where we previously had v and p. In ad- dition there appear the dashed-underlined terms, which describe the momentum transport associated with the turbulent fluctuations. We may rewrite Eq. 5.2-7 by introducing the turbulent momentum flux tensor 7'') with components - - - I I - I I 7;:) = pvxvx T: = pvxvy 7:;) = Pm and so on (5.2-8) These quantities are usually referred to as the Reynolds stresses. We may also introduce a symbol @\" for the time-smoothed viscous momentum flux. The components of this ten- sor have the same appearance as the expressions given in Appendices B.l to 8.3, except that the time-smoothed velocity components appear in them: This enables us then to write the equations of change in vector-tensor form as (V . V) = 0 and (V . v') = 0 (5.2-10,ll) s5.3 The Time-Smoothed Velocity Profile near a Wall 159 Equation 5.2-11 is an extra equation obtained by subtracting Eq. 5.2-10 from the original equation of continuity. The principal result of this section is that the equation of motion in terms of the stress tensor, summarized in Appendix Table B.5, can be adapted for time-smoothed tur- bulent flow by changing all vi to Ei and p to P as well as T~ to Tij = 7:' + 7;' in any of the coordinate systems given. We have now arrived at the main stumbling block in the theory of turbulence. The Reynolds stresses 7;' above are not related to the velocity gradients in a simple way as are the time-smoothed viscous stresses 7v in Eq. 5.2-9. They are, instead, com- plicated functions of the position and the turbulence intensity. To solve flow prob- lems we must have experimental information about the Reynolds stresses or else resort to some empirical expression. In 55.4 we discuss some of the empiricisms that are available. Actually one can also obtain equations of change for the Reynolds stresses (see Prob- 111 lem 5D.1). However, these equations contain quantities like vivj vk. Similarly, the equa- ! I l tions of change for the vivjvk contain the next higher-order correlation v,!v!v;v;, and so on. That is, there is a never-ending hierarchy of equations that must be solved. To solve flow problems one has to \"truncate\" this hierarchy by introducing empiricisms. If we use empiricisms for the Reynolds stresses, we then have a \"first-order\" theory. If we in- r I I troduce empiricisms for the vivjv,, we then have a \"second-order theory,\" and so on. The problem of introducing empiricisms to get a closed set of equations that can be solved for the velocity and pressure distributions is referred to as the \"closure problem.\" The discussion in 55.4 deals with closure at the first order. At the second order the \"k-E empiricism\" has been extensively studied and widely used in computational fluid mechanics.' 55.3 THE TIME-SMOOTHED VELOCITY PROFILE NEAR A WALL Before we discuss the various empirical expressions used for the Reynolds stresses, we present here several developments that do not depend on any empiricisms. We are con- cerned here with the fully developed, time-smoothed velocity distribution in the neigh- borhood of a wall. We discuss several results: a Taylor expansion of the velocity near the wall, and the universal logarithmic and power law velocity distributions a little further out from the wall. The flow near a flat surface is depicted in Fig. 5.3-1. It is convenient to distinguish four regions of flow: the viscous sublayer very near the wall, in which viscosity plays a key role the buffer layer in which the transition occurs between the viscous and inertial sublayers the inertial sublayer at the beginning of the main turbulent stream, in which viscos- ity plays at most a minor role the main turbulent stream, in which the time-smoothed velocity distribution is nearly flat and viscosity is unimportant It must be emphasized that this classification into regions is somewhat arbitrary.

Flow regions for describing turbulent flow near a wall: @viscous sublayer, @buffer layer, @inertial sublayer, @ main turbulent stream. The Logarithmic and Power Law Velocity Profiles in the Inertial Sublayer14 Let the time-smoothed shear stress acting on the wall y = 0 be called 7, (this is the same as -7y.u)y=0). Then the shear stress in the inertial sublayer will not be very different from the value 7,. We now ask: On what quantities will the time-smoothed velocity gradient dv,/dy depend? It should not depend on the viscosity, since, out beyond the buffer layer, momentum transport should depend primarily on the velocity fluctuations (loosely re- ferred to as \"eddy motion\"). It may depend on the density p, the wall shear stress T,,, and the distance y from the wall. The only combination of these three quantities that has the dimensions of a velocity gradient is -ly. Hence we write - in which K is an arbitra dimensionless constant, which must be determined experi- mentally. The quantity 3-- ~,/p has the dimensions of velocity; it is called the friction veloc- ity and given the symbol v,.When Eq. 5.3-1 is integrated we get A' being an integration constant. To use dimensionless groupings, we rewrite Eq. 5.3-2 as in which A is a constant simply related to A'; the kinematic viscosity v was included in order to construct the dimensionless argument of the logarithm. Experimentally it has been found that reasonable values of the constants2 are K = 0.4 and A = 5.5, giving L. Landau and E. M.

Later we shall see (in Fig. 5.5-3) that this function describes moderately well the experimental data somewhat beyond the inertial sublayer. If Eq. 5.3-1 were correct, then the constants K and h would indeed be \"universal con- stants,\" applicable at any Reynolds number. However, values of K in the range 0.40 to 0.44 and values of A in the range 5.0 to 6.3 can be found in the literature, depending on the range of Reynolds numbers. This suggests that the right side of Eq. 5.3-1 should be multiplied by some function of Reynolds number and that y could be raised to some power involving the Reynolds number. Theoretical arguments have been advanced4 that Eq. 5.3-1 should be replaced by in which B, = ifi, B, = y, and PI = z. When Eq. 5.3-5 is integrated with respect to y, the Barenblatt-Chorin universal velocity distribution is obtained: Equation 5.3-6 describes regions @and @of Fig. 5.3-1 better than does Eq. 5.3-4.4 Region a is better described by Eq. 5.3-13. Taylor-Series Development in the Viscous Sublayer We start by writing a Taylor series for E, as a function of y, thus To evaluate the terms in this series, we need the expression for the time-smoothed shear stress in the vicinity of a wall. For the special case of the steadily driven flow in a slit of - thickness 2B, the shear stress will be of the form 7,, = 7:: + 7:; = - ~~[l - (y/B)I. Then from Eqs. 5.2-8 and 9, we have Now we examine one by one the terms that appear in Eq. 5.3-7:5 (i) The first term is zero by the no-slip condition. (ii) The coefficient of the second term can be obtained from Eq. 5.3-8, recognizing that both v: and v; are zero at the wall so that (iii) The coefficient of the third term involves the second derivative, which may be obtained by differentiating Eq. 5.3-8 with respect to y and then setting y = 0, as follows, 2 (5.3-10) dy y=O since both vi and v; are zero at the wall. A. A. Townsend, The Structure of Turbulent Shear Flow, Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition (1976), p. 163. 162 Chapter 5 Velocity Distributions in Turbulent Flow (iv) The coefficient of the fourth term involves the third derivative, which may be obtained from Eq. 5.3-8, and this is Here Eq. 5.2-1 1 has been used. There appears to be no reason to set the next coefficient equal to zero, so we find that the Taylor series, in dimensionless quantities, has the form The coefficient C has been obtained experimentally,' and therefore we have the final result: The y3 term in the brackets will turn out to be very important in connection with turbu- lent heat and mass transfer correlations in Chapters 13,14,21, and 22. For the region 5 < yvJv < 30 no simple analytical derivations are available, and empirical curve fits are sometimes used. One of these is shown in Fig. 5.5-3 for circular tubes. 55.4 EMPIRICAL EXPRESSIONS FOR THE TURBULENT MOMENTUM FLUX We now return to the problem of using the time-smoothed equations of change in Eqs. 5.2-11 and 12 to obtain the time-smoothed velocity and pressure distributions. As pointed out in the previous section, some information about the velocity distribution can be obtained without having a specific expression for the turbulent momentum flux F\"'. However, it has been popular among engineers to use various empiricisms for I\"' that involve velocity gradients. We mention a few of these, and many more can be found in the turbulence literature. The Eddy Viscosity of Boussinesq By analogy with Newton's law of viscosity, Eq. 1.1-1, one may write for a turbulent shear flow1 C. 5. Lin, R. W. Moulton, and G. L. Putnam, Ind. Eng. Chem., 45,636-640 (1953); the numerical coefficient was determined from mass transfer experiments in circular tubes. The importance of the yj term in heat and mass transfer was recognized earlier by E. V. Murphree, Ind. Eng. Chem., 24,726-736 (1932). Eger Vaughn Murphree (1898-1962) was captain of the University of Kentucky football team in 1920 and became President of the Standard Oil Development Company. ' J. Boussinesq, Mkm. prks. par diu. savants a I'acad. sci, de Paris, 23, #I, 1-680 (1877),24, #2,1-64 (1877). Joseph Valentin Boussinesq (1842-19291, university professor in Lille, wrote a two-volume treatise on heat, and is famous for the \"Boussinesq approximation\" and the idea of \"eddy viscosity.\" 55.4 Empirical Expressions for the Turbulent Momentum Flux 163 in which p\"' is the turbulent viscosity (often called the eddy viscosity, and given the symbol E). As one can see from Table 5.1-1, for at least one of the flows given there, the circular jet, one might expect Eq. 5.4-1 to be useful. Usually, however, p(\" is a strong function of position and the intensity of turbulence. In fact, for some systems2 p\"' may even be negative in some regions. It must be emphasized that the viscosity p is a property of the fluid, whereas the eddy viscosity p\"' is primarily a property of the flow. For two kinds of turbulent flows (i.e., flows along surfaces and flows in jets and wakes), special expressions for p't' are available: (i) Wall turbulence: YV* 0<,<5 14.5~ This expression, derivable from Eq. 5.3-13, is valid only very near the wall. It is of con- siderable importance in the theory of turbulent heat and mass transfer at fluid-solid interface^.^ in which K, is a dimensionless coefficient to be determined experimentally, b is the width of the mixing zone at a downstream distance z, and the quantity in parentheses represents the maximum difference in the z-component of the time-smoothed veloci- ties at that distance z. Prandt14 found Eq. 5.4-3 to be a useful empiricism for jets and wakes. The Mixing Length of Prandtl By assuming that eddies move around in a fluid very much as molecules move around in a low-density gas (not a very good analogy) prandt15 developed an expression for mo- mentum transfer in a turbulent fluid. The \"mixing length\" 1 plays roughly the same role as the mean free path in kinetic theory (see 51.4). This kind of reasoning led Prandtl to the following relation: If the mixing length were a universal constant, Eq. 5.4-4 would be very attractive, but in fact 1 has been found to be a function of position. Prandtl proposed the following expres- sions for I: (i) Wall turbulence: I = ~,y (y = distance from wall) (ii) Free turbulence: I = ~,b (b = width of mixing zone) in which K, and KZ are constants. A result similar to Eq. 5.4-4 was obtained by Taylor6 by his \"vorticity transport theory\" some years prior to Prandtl's proposal. J. 0. Hinze, Appl. Sci. Res., 22,163-175 (1970); V. Kruka and S.

Here we give a modification of the equation of van Drie~t.~ This is a formula for the mixing length of Eq. 5.4-4: This relation has been found to be useful for predicting heat and mass transfer rates in flow in tubes. In the next two sections and in several problems at the end of the chapter, we illus- trate the use of the above empiricisms. Keep in mind that these expressions for the Reynolds stresses are little more than crutches that can be used for the representation of experimental data or for solving problems that fall into rather special classes. Obtain an expression for 7:; = pv:vi as a function of y in the neighborhood of the wall. Development of the SOLUTION Reyno Ids Stress Expression in the (a) We start by making a Taylor series development of the three components of v': Vicinity of the Wall The first term in Eqs. 5.4-8 and 10 must be zero because of the no-slip condition; the first term in Eq. 5.4-9 is zero in the absence of mass transfer. Next we can write Eq. 5.2-11 at y = 0, The first and third terms in this equation are zero because of the no-slip condition. Therefore we have to conclude that the second term is zero as well. Hence all the dashed-underlined terms in Eqs. 5.4-8 to 10 are zero, and we may conclude that - $j? = PD:Z'j. = AY3 + BY4 + * . . (5.4-12) This suggests-but does not proves-that the lead term in the Reynolds stress near a wall should be proportional to y3.

This is in accord with Eq. 5.4-12. 55.5 TURBULENT FLOW IN DUCTS We start this section with a short discussion of experimental measurements for turbulent flow in rectangular ducts, in order to give some impressions about the Reynolds stresses. In Figs. 5.5-1 -- and 2 are - shown some experimental measurements of the time-smoothed quantities vL2, v:~, and v:vi for the flow in the z direction in a rectangular duct. In Fig. 5.5-1 note that quite close to the wall, is about 13% of the time-smoothed centerline velocity Z,,,,,, whereas is about 5%. This means that, near the wall, the velocity fluctuations in the flow direction are appreciably greater than those in the trans- verse direction. Near the center of the duct, the two fluctuation amplitudes are nearly equal and we say that the turbulence is nearly isotro~there. In Fig. 5.5-2 the turbulent shear stress 7:; = p:v; is compared with the total shear stress 7,, = 7:; + 7:? across the duct. It is evident that the turbulent contribution is the Fig. 5.5-1. Measurements of H. Reichardt [Naturwissensckaften, 404 (1938), Zeits. f. angew. Math. u.

Measurements of Reichardt (see Fig. 5.5-1) for the quantity in a rectangular duct. Note that this quan- tity differs from ?,,/p only near the duct wall. 166 Chapter 5 Velocity Distributions in Turbulent Flow more important over most of the cross section and that the viscous contribution is im- portant only in the vicinity of the wall. This is further illustrated in Example 5.5-3. Anal- ogous behavior is observed in tubes of circular cross section. Apply the results of 95.3 to obtain the average velocity for turbulent flow in a circular tube. Estimation of the Average Velocity SOLUTION in a Circular Tube We can use the velocity distribution in the caption to Fig. 5.5-3. To get the average velocity in the tube, one should integrate over four regions: the viscous sublayer (y+ < 51, the buffer zone 5 < y+ < 30, the inertial sublayer, and themain turbulent stream; which is roughly parabolic in shape. One can certainly do this, but it has been found that integrating the logarithmic pro- file of Eq. 5.3-4 (or the power law profile of Eq. 5.3-6) over the entire cross section gives results that are roughly of the right form. For the logarithmic profile one gets Fig. 5.5-3. Dimensionless velocity distribution for turbulent flow in circular tubes, presented as vf = 5,/u, vs. y+ = yv,p/~, where v, = and .r, is the wall shear stress. The solid curves are those suggested by Lin, Moulton, and Putnam [Ind. Eng. Chem., 45,636-640 (1953)l: The experimental data are those of J. Nikuradse for water (0) [VDI Forschungsheft, H356 (1932)l; Reichardt and Motzfeld for air (0); Reichardt and Schuh (A) for air [H. Reichardt, NACA Tech. Mem. 1047 (1943)l; and R. R. Rothfus, C. C. Monrad, and V. E. Seneca1 for air (H) [Ind. Eng. Chem., 42,2511-2520 (1950)). s5.5 Turbulent Flow in Ducts 167 If this is compared with experimental data on flow rate versus pressure drop, it is found that good agreement can be obtained by changing 2.5 to 2.45 and 1.75 to 2.0. This \"fudging\" of the constants would probably not be necessary if the integration over the cross section had been done by using the local expression for the velocity in the various layers. On the other hand, there is some virtue in having a simple logarithmic relation such as Eq. 5.5-1 to describe pres- sure drop vs. flow rate. In a similar fashion the power law profile can be integrated over the entire cross section to give (see Ref. 4 of 95.3) in which a = 3/(2 In Re). This relation is useful over the range 3.07 X lo3 < Re < 3.23 X lo6. Show how Eqs. 5.4-4 and 5 can be used to describe turbulent flow in a circular tube. Application of SOLUTION Prandtl's Mixing Length Formula to Equation 5.2-12 gives for the steadily driven flow in a circular tube, Turbulent Flow in a Circular Tube in which Tr, = 7:' + 72. Over most of the tube the viscous contribution is quite small; here we neglect it entirely. Integration of Eq. 5.5-3 then gives where ro is the wall shear stress and y = R - r is the distance from the tube wall. According to the mixing length theory in Eq. 5.4-4, with the empirical expression in Eq. 5.4-5, we have for d EJdr negative Substitution of this into Eq. 5.5-4 gives a differential equation for the time-smoothed velocity. If we follow Prandtl and extrapolate the inertial sublayer to the wall, then in Eq. 5.5-5 it is ap- propriate to replace 75; by 70. When this is done, Eq. 5.5-5 can be integrated to give - v* v, = - In y + constant K1 (5.5-6) Thus a logarithmic profile is obtained and hence the results from Example 5.5-1 can be used; that is, one can apply Eq. 5.5-6 as a very rough approximation over the entire cross section of the tube. Determine the ratio p't'/p at y = R/2 for water flowing at a steady rate in a long, smooth, round tube under the following conditions: Relative Magnitude of Viscosity and Eddy R = tube radius = 3 in. = 7.62 cm Viscosity r0 = wall shear stress = 2.36 X lop5 1bf/in.' = 0.163 Pa p = density = 62.4 lb,/ft3 = 1000 kg/m3 v = kinematic viscosity = 1.1 X lop5 ft2/s = 1.02 X lop7 m2/s SOLUTION The expression for the time-smoothed momentum flux is 168 Chapter 5 Velocity Distributions in Turbulent Flow This result may be solved for p'f'/p and the result can be expressed in terms of dimensionless variables: ,p) - - 1 7rz El. El. dE,/dy 1 where y+ = yv,p/~ and v' = &/v,. When y = R/2, the value of y+ is For this value of yt, the logarithmic distribution in the caption of Fig. 5.5-3 gives Substituting this into Eq. 5.5-8 gives This result emphasizes that, far from the tube wall, molecular momentum transport is negli- gible in comparison with eddy transport. g5.6 TURBULENT FLOW IN JETS In the previous section we discussed the flow in ducts, such as circular tubes; such flows are examples of wall turbulence. Another main class of turbulent flows is free turbulence, and the main examples of these flows are jets and wakes. The time-smoothed velocity in these types of flows can be described adequately by using Prandtl's expression for the eddy viscosity in Fig. 5.4-3, or by using Prandtl's mixing length theory with the empiri- cism given in Eq. 5.4-6. The former method is simpler, and hence we use it in the follow- ing illustrative example. A jet of fluid emerges from a circular hole into a semi-infinite reservoir of the same fluid as depicted in Fig. 5.6-1. In the same figure we show roughly what we expect the profiles of Time-Smoothed the z-component of the velocity to look like. We would expect that for various values of z Distribution in the profiles will be similar in shape, differing only by a scale factor for distance and veloc- a Circular Wall JeP4 ity. We also can imagine that as the jet moves outward, it will create a net radial inflow so that some of the surrounding fluid will be dragged along. We want to find the time- smoothed velocity distribution in the jet and also the amount of fluid crossing each plane of constant z. Before working through the solution, it may be useful to review the information on jets in Table 5.1-1. ' H.

Circular jet emerging from a plane wall. - In order to use Eq. 5.4-3 it is necessary to know how b and q,,,, - v,,, vary with z for the cir- cular jet. We know that the total rate of flow of z-momentum J will be the same for all values of z. We presume that the convective momentum flux is much greater than the viscous mo- mentum flux. This permits us to postulate that the jet width b depends on J, on the density p and the kinematic viscosity v of the fluid, and on the downstream distance z from the wall. The only combination of these variables that has the dimensions of length is b ~z/~v~, so that the jet width is proportional to z. We next postulate that the velocity profiles are \"similar,\" that is, which seems like a plausible proposal; here is the velocity along the centerline. When this is substituted into the expression for the rate of momentum flow in the jet (neglecting the contribution from 7,,) we find that Since J does not depend on z and since b is proportional to z, then G,,,,, has to be inversely proportional to z. The &,,, in Eq. 5.4-3 occurs at the outer edge of the jet and is zero. Therefore because b z and fi,,,, = z-', we find from Eq. 5.4-3 that /L(') is a constant. Thus we can use the equations of motion for laminar flow and replace the viscosity p by the eddy viscosity p(t), or v by dt). In the jet the main motion is in the z direction; that is I G, 1 < < I i& 1. Hence we can use a boundary layer approximation (see 54.4) for the time-smoothed equations of change and write continuity: motion: These equations are to be solved with the following boundary conditions: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: The last boundary condition is automatically satisfied, inasmuch as we have already found that %,,,, is inversely proportional to z. We now seek a solution to Eq. 5.6-5 of the form of Eq. 5.6-1 with b = z. 170 Chapter 5 Velocity Distributions in Turbulent Flow To avoid working with two dependent variables, we introduce the stream function as discussed in g.2. For axially symmetric flow, the stream function is defined as follows: This definition ensures that the equation of continuity in Eq. 5.6-4 is satisfied. Since we know that E, is z-' X some function of 5, we deduce from Eq. 5.6-9 that @ must be proportional to z. Furthermore + must have dimensions of (velocity) X (length)2, hence the stream function must have the form in which F is a dimensionless function of 5 = r/z. From Eqs. 5.6-9 and 10 we then get The first two boundary conditions may now be rewritten as B.C. 1: F at[=O, --F1=O 5 (5.6-14) B.C. 2: F\" ate=0, -- 5 If we expand F in a Taylor series about 5 = 0, then the first boundary condition gives a = 0, and the second gives b = d = 0. We will use this result presently. Substitution of the velocity expressions of Eqs. 5.6-12 and 13 into the equation of motion in Eq. 5.6-5 then gives a third-order differential equation for F, This may be integrated to give FF' F' -=FU--+C, 5 5 in which the constant of integration must be zero; this can be seen by using the Taylor series in Eq. 5.6-16 along with the fact that a, b, and d are all zero. Equation 5.6-18 was first solved by Schlichting.' First one changes the independent vari- able by setting 6 = In P. The resulting second-order differential equation contains only the de- pendent variable and its first two derivatives. Equations of this type can be solved by elementary methods. The first integration gives Once again, knowing the behavior of F near ( = 0, we conclude that the second constant of in- tegration is zero. Equation 5.6-19 is then a first-order separable equation, and it may be solved to give H. Schlichting, Zeits. f. angew. Math. u.

Substitution of this into Eqs. 5.6-12 and 13 then gives When the above expression for & is substituted into Eq. 5.6-2 for J, we get an expression for the third integration constant in terms of J: The last three equations then give the time-smoothed velocity profiles in terms of J, p, and v\"'. A measurable quantity in jet flow is the radial position corresponding to an axial velocity one-half the centerline value; we call this half-width b,,,. From Eq. 5.6-21 we then obtain Experiments indicate6 that blI2 = 0.08482. When this is inserted into Eq. 5.6-24, it is found that C, = 15.1. Using this value, we can get the turbulent viscosity v\"' as a function of J and p from Eq. 5.6-23. Figure 5.6-2 gives a comparison of the above axial velocity profile with experimental data.

Once the velocity profiles are known, the streamlines can be obtained. From the stream- lines, shown in Fig. 5.6-3, it can be seen how the jet draws in fluid from the surrounding mass of fluid. Hence the mass of fluid carried by the jet increases with the distance from the source. This mass rate of flow is This result corresponds to an entry in Table 5.1-1. The two-dimensional jet issuing from a thin slot may be analyzed sirnilarily. In that prob- lem, however, the turbulent viscosity is a function of position. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1. Compare and contrast the procedures for solving laminar flow problems and turbulent flow problems. 2. Why must Eq. 5.1-4 not be used for evaluating the velocity gradient at the solid boundary? 3. What does the logarithmic profile of Eq. 5.3-4 give for the fluid velocity at the wall? Why does this not create a problem in Example 5.5-1 when the logarithmic profile is integrated over the cross section of the tube? 4. Discuss the physical interpretation of each term in Eq. 5.2-12. 5. Why is the absolute value sign used in Eq. 5.4-4? How is it eliminated in Eq. 5.5-5? 6. In Example 5.6-1, how do we know that the momentum flow through any plane of constant z is a constant? Can you imagine a modification of the jet problem in which that would not be the case? 7. Go through some of the volumes of Ann. Revs. Fluid Mech. and summarize the topics in turbu- lent flow that are found there. 8.

Rewrite Eq. 5C.1-9 in terms of h rather than C. The value of h = 0.0102 gives good agreement with the experimental data.' The agreement is believed to be slightly better than that for the Prandtl mixing length empiricism.

At the end of 55.2 it was pointed out that there is an equation of change for the Reynolds stresses. This can be derived by (a) multiplying the ith component of the vector form of Eq. 5.2-5 by v; and time smoothing, (b) multiplying the jth component of the vector form of Eq. 5.2-5 by vi and time smoothing, and (c) adding the results of (a) and (b).

Chapter 6 Interphase Transport in Isothermal Systems 6.1 Definition of friction factors 56.2 Friction factors for flow in tubes 56.3 Friction factors for flow around spheres 56.4' Friction factors for packed columns In Chapters 2-4 we showed how laminar flow problems may be formulated and solved. In Chapter 5 we presented some methods for solving turbulent flow problems by dimen- sional arguments or by semiempirical relations between the momentum flux and the gradient of the time-smoothed velocity. In this chapter we show how flow problems can be solved by a combination of dimensional analysis and experimental data. The tech- nique presented here has been widely used in chemical, mechanical, aeronautical, and civil engineering, and it is useful for solving many practical problems. It is a topic worth learning well. Many engineering flow problems fall into one of two broad categories: flow in chan- nels and flow around submerged objects. Examples of channel flow are the pumping of oil through pipes, the flow of water in open channels, and extrusion of plastics through dies. Examples of flow around submerged objects are the motion of air around an air- plane wing, motion of fluid around particles undergoing sedimentation, and flow across tube banks in heat exchangers. In channel flow the main object is usually to get a relationship between the vol- ume rate of flow and the pressure drop and/or elevation change. In problems involv- ing flow around submerged objects the desired information is generally the relation between the velocity of the approaching fluid and the drag force on the object. We have seen in the preceding chapters that, if one knows the velocity and pressure dis- tributions in the system, then the desired relationships for these two cases may be ob- tained. The derivation of the Hagen-Poiseuille equation in 52.3 and the derivation of the Stokes equation in 52.6 and s4.2 illustrate the two categories we are discussing here. For many systems the velocity and pressure profiles cannot be easily calculated, par- ticularly if the flow is turbulent or the geometry is complicated. One such system is the flow through a packed column; another is the flow in a tube in the shape of a helical coil. For such systems we can take carefully chosen experimental data and then construct \"correlations\" of dimensionless variables that can be used to estimate the flow behavior in geometrically similar systems. This method is based on 53.7. 178 Chapter 6 Interphase Transport in Isothermal Systems We start in 56.1 by defining the \"friction factor,\" and then we show in 556.2 and 6.3 how to construct friction factor charts for flow in circular tubes and flow around spheres. These are both systems we have already studied and, in fact, several results from earlier chapters are included in these charts. Finally in 56.4 we examine the flow in packed columns, to illustrate the treatment of a geometrically complicated system. The more complex problem of fluidized beds is not included in this chapter.' 6.1 DEFINITION OF FRICTION FACTORS We consider the steadily driven flow of a fluid of constant density in one of two systems: (a) the fluid flows in a straight conduit of uniform cross section; (b) the fluid flows around a submerged object that has an axis of symmetry (or two planes of symmetry) parallel to the direction of the approaching fluid. There will be a force F+, exerted by the fluid on the solid surfaces. It is convenient to split this force into two parts: F,, the force that would be exerted by the fluid even if it were stationary; and Fk, the additional force associated with the motion of the fluid (see 52.6 for the discussion of F, and Fk for flow around spheres). In systems of type (a), Fk points in the same direction as the average ve- locity (v) in the conduit, and in systems of type (b), Fk points in the same direction as the approach velocity v,. For both types of systems we state that the magnitude of the force Fk is proportional to a characteristic area A and a characteristic kinetic energy K per unit volume; thus Fk = AKf (6.1-1)' in which the proportionality constant f is called the friction factor. Note that Eq. 6.1-1 is not a law of fluid dynamics, but only a definition for f. This is a useful definition, because the dimensionless quantity f can be given as a relatively simple function of the Reynolds number and the system shape. Clearly, for any given flow system, f is not defined until A and K are specified. Let us now see what the customary definitions are: (a) For flow in conduits, A is usually taken to be the wetted surface, and K is taken to be &v)~. Specifically, for circular tubes of radius R and length L we define f by Generally, the quantity measured is not Fk, but rather the pressure difference po - pL and the elevation difference ho - hL. A force balance on the fluid between 0 and L in the direc- tion of flow gives for fully developed flow Elimination of Fk between the last two equations then gives - -- - - - -- - - ' R. Jackson, The Dynamics of Fluidized Beds, Cambridge University Press (2000). For systems lacking symmetry, the fluid exerts both a force and a torque on the solid. For discussions of such systems see J. Happel and H. Brenner, Low Reynolds Number Hydrodynamics, Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague (1983), Chapter 5; H. Brenner, in Adv. Chem. Engr., 6,287438 (1966); S. Kim and S. J. Karrila, Microhydrodynarnics: Principles and Selected Applications, Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston (1991), Chapter 5. Cj6.2 Friction Factors for Flow in Tubes 179 in which D = 2R is the tube diameter. Equation 6.1-4 shows how to calculate f from ex- perimental data. The quantity f is sometimes called the Fanning friction f~ctor.~ (b) For flow around submerged objects, the characteristic area A is usually taken to be the area obtained by projecting the solid onto a plane perpendicular to the velocity of the approaching fluid; the quantity K is taken to be ipv:, where v, is the approach velocity of the fluid at a large distance from the object. For example, for flow around a sphere of radius R, we define f by the equation If it is not possible to measure Fb then we can measure the terminal velocity of the sphere when it falls through the fluid (in that case, v, has to be interpreted as the termi- nal velocity of the sphere). For the steady-state fall of a sphere in a fluid, the force F, is just counterbalanced by the gravitational force on the sphere less the buoyant force (cf. Eq. 2.6-14): Elimination of F, between Eqs. 6.1-5 and 6.1-6 then gives This expression can be used to obtain f from terminal velocity data. The friction factor used in Eqs. 6.1-5 and 7 is sometimes called the drag coefficient and given the symbol c,. We have seen that the \"drag coefficient\" for submerged objects and the \"friction fac- tor\" for channel flow are defined in the same general way. For this reason we prefer to use the same symbol and name for both of them. 86.2 FRICTION FACTORS FOR FLOW IN TUBES We now combine the definition off in Eq. 6.1-2 with the dimensional analysis of 53.7 to show what f must depend on in this kind of system. We consider a \"test section\" of inner radius R and length L, shown in Fig. 6.2-1, carrying a fluid of constant density and vis- cosity at a steady mass flow rate. The pressures 9, and YL at the ends of the test section are known. ' This friction factor definition is due to J. T. Fanning, A Practical Treatise on Hydraulic and Watu Supply Engineering, Van Nostrand, New York, 1st edition (1877), 16th edition (1906); the name \"Fanning\" is used to avoid confusion with the \"Moody friction factor,\" which is larger by a factor of 4 than the f - - used here [L. F. Moody, Trans. ASME, 66,671-684 (19441. If we use the \"friction velocity\" v, = = d(9, - YL)R/2Lp, introduced in s5.3, then Eq. 6.1-4 assumes the form John Thomas Fanning (1837-1911) studied architectural and civil engineering, served as an officer in the Civil War, and after the war became prominent in hydraulic engineering. The 14th edition of his book A Practical Treatise on Hydraulic and Water-Supply Engineering appeared in 1899. For the translational motion of a sphere in three dimensions, one can write approximately where n is a unit vector in the direction of v,. See Problem 6C.1. 180 Chapter 6 Interphase Transport in Isothermal Systems Pressure PL Fig. 6.2-1. Section of a circular pipe from z = 0 to z = L for the discussion of dimensional analysis. The system is either in steady laminar flow or steadily driven turbulent flow (i.e., turbulent flow with a steady total throughput). In either case the force in the z direction of the fluid on the inner wall of the test section is In turbulent flow the force may be a function of time, not only because of the turbulent fluctuations, but also because of occasional ripping off of the boundary layer from the wall, which results in some distances with long time scales. In laminar flow it is under- stood that the force will be independent of time. Equating Eqs. 6.2-1 and 6.1-2, we get the following expression for the friction factor: Next we introduce the dimensionless quantities from s3.7: i: = r/D, i. = z/D, ijz = vZ/(v,), = (v,)t/D, @ = (9 - 9,)/p(v,)2, and Re = D(v,)p/p. Then Eq. 6.2-2 may be rewritten as This relation is valid for laminar or turbulent flow in smooth circular tubes. We see that for flow systems in which the drag depends on viscous forces alone (i.e., no \"form drag\") the product of fRe is essentially a dimensionless velocity gradient averaged over the surface. Recall now that, in principle, dCZ/di can be evaluated from Eqs. 3.7-8 and 9 along with the boundary conditions1 B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: ' Here we follow the customary practice of neglecting the (d2/di2)v terms of Eq. 3.7-9, on the basis of order-of-magnitude arguments such as those given in s4.4. With those terms suppressed, we do not need an outlet boundary condition on v. s6.2 Friction Factors for Flow in Tubes 181 and appropriate initial conditions. The uniform inlet velocity profile in Eq. 6.2-5 is accu- rate except very near the wall, for a well-designed nozzle and upstream system. If Eqs. 3.7-8 and 9 could be solved with these boundary and initial conditions to get ir and @, the solutions would necessarily be of the form + = +(?, 6, 2, t; Re) $ = 9 (?, 0, 2, i; Re) That is, the functional dependence of + and 9 must, in general, include all the dimen- sionless variables and the one dimensionless group appearing in the differential equa- tions. No additional dimensionless groups enter via the preceding boundary conditions. As a consequence, &?Jd? must likewise depend on ?, 6, i, i, and Re. When deZ/d? is eval- uated at i. = and then integrated over 2 and 13 in Eq. 6.2-3, the result depends only on I, Re, and LID (the latter appearing in the upper limit in the integration over 5). Therefore we are led to the conclusion that f($ = f (Re, L/D, i), which, when time averaged, becomes f = f (Re, L/D) (6.2-9) when the time average is performed over an interval long enough to include any long- time turbulent disturbances. The measured friction factor then depends only on the Reynolds number and the length-to-diameter ratio. The dependence off on LID arises from the development of the time-average veloc- ity distribution from its flat entry shape toward more rounded profiles at downstream z values. This development occurs within an entrance region, of length L, = 0.030 Re for laminar flow or L, = 60D for turbulent flow, beyond which the shape of the velocity dis- tribution is \"fully developed.\" In the transportation of fluids, the entrance length is usu- ally a small fraction of the total; then Eq. 6.2-9 reduces to the long-tube form and f can be evaluated experimentally from Eq. 6.1-4, which was written for fully devel- oped flow at the inlet and outlet. Equations 6.2-9 and 10 are useful results, since they provide a guide for the system- atic presentation of data on flow rate versus pressure difference for laminar and turbu- lent flow in circular tubes. For long tubes we need only a single curve off plotted versus the single combination D(Qp/p. Think how much simpler this is than plotting pressure drop versus the flow rate for separate values of D, L, p, and p, which is what the uniniti- ated might do. There is much experimental information for pressure drop versus flow rate in tubes, and hence f can be calculated from the experimental data by Eq. 6.1-4. Then f can be plot- ted versus Re for smooth tubes to obtain the solid curves shown in Fig. 6.2-2. These solid curves describe the laminar and turbulent behavior for fluids flowing in long, smooth, cir- cular tubes. Note that the laminar curve on the friction factor chart is merely a plot of the Hagen-Poiseuille equation in Eq. 2.3-21. This can be seen by substituting the expression for (9, - 9,) from Eq. 2.3-21 into Eq. 6.1-4 and using the relation w = p(&)~R2; this gives 16 Re < 2100 stable f=-{ Re Re > 2100 usually unstable in which Re = D(&)p/p; this is exactly the laminar line in Fig. 6.2-2. Analogous turbulent curves have been constructed by using experimental data. Some analytical curve-fit expressions are also available. For example, Eq. 5.1-6 can be put into the form 0'0791 2.1 X lo3 < Re < lo5 f=~e'/' (6.2-12) 182 Chapter 6 Interphase Transport in Isothermal Systems 1 .0 0.5 0.2 0.1 u, 3 0.05 u Y1 G 0 .I i; 0.02 .d cL' 0.01 0.005 0.002 0.001 lo2 103 lo4 lo5 lo7 Reynolds number Re = D<F> p/p Fig. 6.2-2.

Of course, k has to enter into the correlation in a dimensionless fashion and hence appears via the ratio k/D. For turbulent flow in noncircular tubes it is common to use the following empiricism: First we define a \"mean hydraulic radius\" Rh as follows: in which S is the cross section of the conduit and Z is the wetted perimeter. Then we can use Eq. 6.1-4 and Fig. 6.2-2, with the diameter D of the circular pipe replaced by 4Rh. That is, we calculate pressure differences by replacing Eq. 6.1-4 by and getting f from Fig. 6.2-2 with a Reynolds number defined as For laminar flows in noncircular passages, this method is less satisfactory. EXAMPLE 6.2-1 What pressure gradient is required to cause diethylaniline, C,H,N(C,H,),, to flow in a horizontal, smooth, circular tube of inside diameter D = 3 cm at a mass rate of 1028 g/s at Pressure 20°C? At this temperature the density of diethylaniline is p = 0.935 g/cm3 and its viscosity is for a Given Flow Rate E, = 1.95 cp. SOLUTION The Reynolds number for the flow is From Fig. 6.2-2, we find that for this Reynolds number the friction factor f has a value of 0.0063 for smooth tubes. Hence the pressure gradient required to maintain the flow is (ac- cording to Eq. 6.1-4) Determine the flow rate, in pounds per hour, of water at 68OF through a 1000-ft length of hori- zontal 8-in. schedule 40 steel pipe (internal diameter 7.981 in.) under a pressure difference of Rate for a Given 3.00 psi. For such a pipe use Fig. 6.2-2 and assume that k/D = 2.3 X Pressure Drop SOLUTION We want to use Eq. 6.1-4 and Fig. 6.2-2 to solve for (v,) when po - pL is known. However, the quantity (v,) appears explicitly on the left side of the equation and implicitly on the right side in f, which depends on Re = D(v,)p/p. Clearly a trial-and-error solution can be found. 184 Chapter 6 Interphase Transport in Isothermal Systems However, if one has to make more than a few calculations of (u,), it is advantageous to de- velop a systematic approach; we suggest two methods here. Because experimental data are often presented in graphical form, it is important for engineering students to use their origi- nality in devising special methods such as those described here. Method A. Figure 6.2-2 may be used to construct a plot6 of Re versus the group Re*, which does not contain (u,): -- The quantity Re* can be computed for this problem, and a value of the Reynolds number can be read from the Re versus Re* plot. From Re the average velocity and flow rate can then be calculated. Method B. Figure 6.2-2 may also be used directly without any replotting, by devising a scheme that is equivalent to the graphical solution of two simultaneous equations. The two equations are f = f (Re, k/D) curve given in Fig. 6.2-2 (6.2-22) The procedure is then to compute ~e* according to Eq. 6.2-21 and then to plot Eq. 6.2-23 on the log-log plot off versus Re in Fig. 6.2-2. The intersection point gives the Reynolds number of the flow, from which (E,) can then be computed. For the problem at hand, we have Then according to Eq. 6.2-21, = 1.63 X lo4 (dimensionless) (6.2-24) The line of Eq. 6.2-23 for this value of Re* passes through f = 1.0 at Re = 1.63 X lo4 and through f = 0.01 at Re = 1.63 X 10\". Extension of the straight line through these points to the curve of Fig. 6.2-2 for k/D = 0.00023 gives the solution to the two simultaneous equations: Solving for w then gives w = (a/4)Dp Re = (0.7854)(0.665)(6.93 X 10-4)(36~~)(2.4 X lo5) = 3.12 X 105 lb,/hr = 39 kg/s A related plot was proposed by T. von K&rm&n, Nackr.

We have already studied the flow around a sphere in s2.6 and 54.2 for Re < 0.1 (the \"creeping flow\" re- gion). At Reynolds numbers above about 1 there is a significant unsteady eddy motion in the wake of the sphere. Therefore, it will be necessary to do a time average over a time interval long with respect to this eddy motion. Recall from 92.6 that the total force acting in the z direction on the sphere can be written as the sum of a contribution from the normal stresses (F,) and one from the tan- gential stresses (F,). One part of the normal-stress contribution is the force that would be present even if the fluid were stationary, F,. Thus the \"kinetic force,\" associated with the fluid motion, is Fk = (F, - FJ + Ft = Fform + Ffriction (6.3-1) The forces associated with the form drag and the friction drag are then obtained from Fform(t) = 12= la (-91 r=R cos B)R2 sin B dB d+ 0 0 Since v, is zero everywhere on the sphere surface, the term containing dv,/dB is zero. If now we split f into two parts as follows f = fform + ffriction then, from the definition in Eq. 6.1-5, we get fform(i) = ' 1'\" 1\" (-@ cos 8) sin B do d+ ?To 0 The friction factor is expressed here in terms of dimensionless variables and a Reynolds number defined as To evaluate f (i) one would have to know @ and 5, as functions of Y, 0, 4, and t. We know that for incompressible flow these distributions can in principle be ob- tained from the solution of Eqs. 3.7-8 and 9 along with the boundary conditions B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: atY=l, 5,=O and Ee=O at?= co, 5,=1 atY=m, @=O and some appropriate initial condition on ir. Because no additional dimensionless groups enter via the boundary and initial conditions, we know that the dimensionless pressure and velocity profiles will have the following form: @ = ~(i, HI+, t; Re) G = +(?, 0, 4, i; Re) (6.3-12) 186 Chapter 6 Interphase Transport in Isothermal Systems When these expressions are substituted into Eqs. 6.3-5 and 6, it is then evident that the friction factor in Eq. 6.3-4 must have the form f(i) = f(Re, i), which, when time aver- aged over the turbulent fluctuations, simplifies to f = f (Re) (6.3-13) by using arguments similar to those in 56.2. Hence from the definition of the friction fac- tor and the dimensionless form of the equations of change and the boundary conditions, we find that f must be a function of Re alone. Many experimental measurements of the drag force on spheres are available, and when these are plotted in dimensionless form, Fig. 6.3-1 results. For this system there is no sharp transition from an unstable laminar flow curve to a stable turbulent flow curve as for long tubes at a Reynolds number of about 2100 (see Fig. 6.2-2). Instead, as the ap- proach velocity increases, f varies smoothly and moderately up to Reynolds numbers of the order of lo5. The kink in the curve at about Re = 2 X lo5 is associated with the shift of the boundary layer separation zone from in front of the equator to in back of the equator of the sphere.' We have juxtaposed the discussions of tube flow and flow around a sphere to em- phasize the fact that various flow systems behave quite differently. Several points of dif- ference between the two systems are: Flow in Tubes Rather well defined laminar-turbulent transition at about Re = 2100 The only contribution to f is the friction . drag (if the tubes are smooth) No boundary layer separation Flow Around Spheres No well defined laminar-turbulent transition Contributions to f from both friction and form drag There is a kink in the f vs. Re curve associated with a shift in the separation zone The general shape of the curves in Figs. 6.2-2 and 6.3-1 should be carefully remembered. For the creeping flow region, we already know that the drag force is given by Stokes' law, which is a consequence of solving the continuity equation and the Navier-Stokes equation of motion without the pDv/Dt term. Stokes' law can be rearranged into the form of Eq. 6.1-5 to get Hence for creeping flow around a sphere f=- 24 for Re < 0.1 Re and this is the straight-line asymptote as Re + 0 of the friction factor curve in Fig. 6.3-1. For higher values of the Reynolds number, Eq. 4.2-21 can describe f accurately up to about Re = 1. However, the empirical expression' f = (p + 0.5409 for Re < 6000 Re R. K.

Friction factor (or drag coefficient) for spheres moving relative to a fluid with a velocity v,. The definition off is given in Eq. 6.1-5. [Curve taken from C. E. Lapple, \"Dust and Mist Collection,\" in Chemical Engineers' Handbook, (J. H. Perry, ed.), McGraw-Hill, New York, 3rd edition (1950), p. 1018.1 is both simple and useful. It is important to remember that f = 0.44 for 5 x lo2 < Re < 1 X lo5 (6.3-17) which covers a remarkable range of Reynolds numbers. Eq. 6.3-17 is sometimes called Newton's resistance law; it is handy for a seat-of-the-pants calculation. According to this, the drag force is proportional to the square of the approach velocity of the fluid. Many extensions of Fig. 6.3-1 have been made, but a systematic study is beyond the scope of this text. Among the effects that have been investigated are wall effectsvsee Prob. 6C.2), fall of droplets with internal circulation,4 hindered settling (i.e., fall of clus- ters of particles5 that interfere with one another), unsteady flow: and the fall of non- spherical particles7 Glass spheres of density p,,, = 2.62 g/cm\" are to be allowed to fall through liquid CC14 at 20°C in an experiment for studying human reaction times in making time observations with Detemination of the stopwatches and more elaborate devices.

Graphical procedure used in Example 6.3-1. To find the sphere diameter, we have to solve Eq. 6.1-7 for D. However, in this equation one has to know D in order to get f; and f is given by the solid curve in Fig. 6.3-1. A trial-and-error procedure can be used, taking f = 0.44 as a first guess. Alternatively, we can solve Eq. 6.1-7 for f and then note that f/Re is a quantity indepen- dent of D: The quantity on the right side can be calculated with the information above, and we call it C. Hence we have two simultaneous equations to solve: f = C Re from Eq. 6.3-18 f = f (Re) from Fig. 6.3-1 Equation 6.3-19 is a straight line with slope of unity on the log-log plot off versus Re. For the problem at hand we have Hence at Re = lo5, according to Eq. 6.3-19, f = 1.86. The line of slope 1 passing through f = 1.86 at Re = lo5 is shown in Fig. 6.3-2. This line intersects the curve of Eq. 6.3-20 (i.e., the curve of Fig. 6.3-1) at Re = Da,p/p = 2.4 X lo4. The sphere diameter is then found to be g6.4 FRICTION FACTORS FOR PACKED COLUMNS In the preceding two sections we have discussed the friction factor correlations for two simple flow systems of rather wide interest. Friction factor charts are available for a number of other systems, such as transverse flow past a cylinder, flow across tube 56.4 Friction Factors for Packed Columns 189 banks, flow near baffles, and flow near rotating disks. These and many more are sum- marized in various reference works.' One complex system of considerable interest in chemical engineering is the packed column, widely used for catalytic reactors and for separation processes. There have been two main approaches for developing friction factor expressions for packed columns. In one method the packed column is visualized as a bundle of tangled tubes of weird cross section; the theory is then developed by applying the previous re- sults for single straight tubes to the collection of crooked tubes. In the second method the packed column is regarded as a collection of submerged objects, and the pressure drop is obtained by summing up the resistances of the submerged particle^.^ The tube bundle theories have been somewhat more successful, and we discuss them here. Figure 6.4-l(a) depicts a packed column, and Fig. 6.4-l(b) illustrates the tube bundle model. A variety of materials may be used for the packing in columns: spheres, cylinders, Berl saddles, and so on. It is assumed throughout the following discussion that the pack- ing is statistically uniform, so that there is no \"channeling\" (in actual practice, channeling frequently occurs, and then the development given here does not apply). It is further as- sumed that the diameter of the packing particles is small in comparison to the diameter of the column in which the packing is contained, and that the column diameter is uniform. We define the friction factor for the packed column analogously to Eq. 6.1-4: in which L is the length of the packed column, D, is the effective particle diameter (de- fined presently), and v, is the superficial velocity; this is the volume flow rate divided by the empty column cross section, v, = w/pS. The pressure drop through a representative tube in the tube bundle model is given by Eq. 6.2-17 Fig. 6.4-1.

When this pressure difference is substituted into Eq. 6.4-1, we get In the second expression, we have introduced the void fraction, E, the fraction of space in the column not occupied by the packing. Then vo = (v)~, which results from the defini- tion of the superficial velocity. We now need an expression for Rh. The hydraulic radius can be expressed in terms of the void fraction E and the wetted surface a per unit volume of bed as follows: Rh=( cross section available for flow wetted perimeter = (volume available for flow total wetted surface volume of voids - volume of bed - - - wetted surface volume of bed The quantity a is related to the \"specific surface\" a, (total particle surface per volume of particles) by The quantity a, is in turn used to define the mean particle diameter Dp as follows: This definition is chosen because, for spheres of uniform diameter, Dp is exactly the di- ameter of a sphere. From the last three expressions we find that the hydraulic radius is Rh = DP&/6(1 - e). When this is substituted into Eq. 6.4-3, we get We now adapt this result to laminar and turbulent flows by inserting appropriate ex- pressions for ftube. (a) For laminar flow in tubes, fbbe = 16/Reh. This is exact for circular tubes only. To account for the noncylindrical surfaces and tortuous fluid paths encountered in typical packed-column operations, it has been found that replacing 16 by 100/3 allows the tube bundle model to describe the packed-column data. When this modified expression for the tube friction factor is used, Eq. 6.4-7 becomes in which Go = pv, is the mass flux through the system. When this expression for f is sub- stituted into Eq. 6.4-1 we get 56.4 Friction Factors for Packed Columns 191 which is the Blake-Kozeny equatiom3 Equations 6.4-8 and 9 are generally good for (DpG,/p(l - E)) < 10 and for void fractions less than E = 0.5. (b) For highly turbulent flow a treatment similar to the above can be given. We begin again with the expression for the friction factor definition for flow in a circular tube. This time, however, we note that, for highly turbulent flow in tubes with any appreciable roughness, the friction factor is a function of the roughness only, and is independent of the Reynolds number. If we assume that the tubes in all packed columns have similar roughness characteristics, then the value off,,, may be taken to be the same constant for all systems. Taking ftube = 7/12 proves to be an acceptable choice. When this is inserted into Eq. 6.4-7, we get When this is substituted into Eq. 6.4-1, we get which is the Burke-Plummer4 equation, valid for (DpGo/p(l - 8)) > 1000. Note that the dependence on the void fraction is different from that for laminar flow. (c) For the transition region, we may superpose the pressure drop expressions for (a) and (b) above to get For very small vo, this simplifies to the Blake-Kozeny equation, and for very large vo, to the Burke-Plummer equation. Such empirical superpositions of asymptotes often lead to satisfactory results. Equation 6.4-12 may be rearranged to form dimensionless groups: This is the Ergun equation: which is shown in Fig. 6.4-2 along with the Blake-Kozeny and Burke-Plummer equations and experimental data. It has been applied with success to gas flow through packed columns by using the density p of the gas at the arithmetic av- erage of the end pressures. Note that Go is constant through the column, whereas vo changes through the column for a compressible fluid. For large pressure drops, however, it seems more appropriate to apply Eq. 6.4-12 locally by expressing the pressure gradient in differential form. The Ergun equation is but one of many6 that have been proposed for describing packed columns. For example, the Tallmadge equation7 is reported to give good agreement with experimental (D,G,/~(I - EN < lo5. data over the range 0.1 < 9. C. Blake, Trans. Amer. Inst. Chem.

The above discussion of packed beds illustrates how one can often combine solu- tions of elementary problems to create useful models for complex systems. The constants appearing in the models are then determined from experimental data. As better data be- come available the modeling can be improved. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1.

A fluid is flowing with a mass flow rate w in a smooth horizontal pipe of length L and diameter D as the result of a pressure difference po - pL. The flow is known to be turbulent.

Show by dimensional analysis that the power, P, imparted by a rotating impeller to an incompressible fluid in an agitated tank may be correlated, for any specific tank and impeller shape, by the expression P 2N - = @(?, E, Nt) (6C.3-1) pN3D5 8 Here N is the rate of rotation of the impeller, D is the im- peller diameter, t is the time since the start of the opera- tion, and @ is a function whose form has to be determined experimentally. For the commonly used geometry shown in the figure, the power is given by the sum of two integrals represent- ing the contributions of friction drag of the cylindrical tank Impeller Baffle \\ body and bottom and the form drag of the radial baffles, respectively: Here T, is the tohue required to turn the impeller, S is the total surface area of the tank, A is the surface area of the baffles, (considered positive on the \"upstream\" side and negative on the \"downstream side\"), X is the radial dis- tance to any surface element dS or dA from the impeller axis of rotation, and n is the distance measured normally into the fluid from any element of tank surface dS. The desired solution may now be obtained by dimen- sional analysis of the equations of motion and continuity by rewriting the integrals above in dimensionless form. Here it is convenient to use D, DN, and pp~2 for the char- acteristic length, velocity, and pressure, respectively. 6D.1 Friction factor for a bubble in a clean liquid.'r8 When a gas bubble moves through a liquid, the bulk of the liquid behaves as if it were in potential flow; that is, the flow field in the liquid phase is very nearly given by Eqs. 4B.5-2 and 3.

These equations were obtained by writing conservation laws over a \"micro- scopic system\"-namely, a small element of volume through which the fluid is flowing. In this way partial differential equations were obtained for the changes in mass, momentum, angular momentum, and mechanical energy in the system. The microscopic system has no solid bounding surfaces, and the interactions of the fluid with solid surfaces in specific flow systems are accounted for by boundary conditions on the differential equations. In this chapter we write similar conservation laws for \"macroscopic systems\"-that is, large pieces of equipment or parts thereof. A sample macroscopic system is shown in Fig. 7.0-1. The balance statements for such a system are called the macroscopic balances; for in' Q = Heat added ,/ \\2 to system from surroundings ='I Fig. 7.0-1. Macroscopic flow system with fluid entering at plane 1 and leaving at plane 2. It may be neces- sary to add heat at a rate Q to main- tain the system temperature constant. The rate of doing work on the system by the surroundings by means of moving surfaces is W,. The symbols ul and u, denote unit vectors in the direction of flow at planes 1 and 2. The quantities r, and r, are position vectors giving the lo- cation of the centers of the inlet and outlet planes with respect to some designated origin of coordinates. W,,, = Work done on system by surroundings via moving parts 198 Chapter 7 Macroscopic Balances for Isothermal Flow Systems unsteady-state systems, these are ordinary differential equations, and for steady-state systems, they are algebraic equations. The macroscopic balances contain terms that ac- count for the interactions of the fluid with the solid surfaces. The fluid can exert forces and torques on the surfaces of the system, and the surroundings can do work W, on the fluid by means of moving surfaces. The macroscopic balances can be obtained from the equations of change by integrat- ing the latter over the entire volume of the flow I\",,, (eq. of continuity) dV = macroscopic mass balance L*o (eq. of motion) dV = macroscopic momentum balance I,, (eq. of angular momentum) dV = macroscopic angular momentum balance L, (eq. of mechanical energy) dV = macroscopic mechanical energy balance The first three of these macroscopic balances can be obtained either by writing the con- servation laws directly for the macroscopic system or by doing the indicated integra- tions. However, to get the macroscopic mechanical energy balance, the corresponding equation of change must be integrated over the macroscopic system. In ss7.1 to 7.3 we set up the macroscopic mass, momentum, and angular momentum balances by writing the conservation laws. In 57.4 we present the macroscopic mechani- cal energy balance, postponing the detailed derivation until 57.8. In the macroscopic me- chanical energy balance, there is a term called the \"friction loss,\" and we devote s7.5 to estimation methods for this quantity. Then in 57.6 and 57.7 we show how the set of macroscopic balances can be used to solve flow problems. The macroscopic balances have been widely used in many branches of engineering. They provide global descriptions of large systems without much regard for the details of the fluid dynamics inside the systems. Often they are useful for making an initial ap- praisal of an engineering problem and for making order-of-magnitude estimates of vari- ous quantities. Sometimes they are used to derive approximate relations, which can then be modified with the help of experimental data to compensate for terms that have been omitted or about which there is insufficient information. In using the macroscopic balances one often has to decide which terms can be omit- ted, or one has to estimate some of the terms. This requires (i) intuition, based on experi- ence with similar systems, (ii) some experimental data on the system, (iii) flow visualization studies, or (iv) order-of-magnitude estimates. This will be clear when we come to specific examples. The macroscopic balances make use of nearly all the topics covered thus far; there- fore Chapter 7 provides a good opportunity for reviewing the preceding chapters. 7. THE MACROSCOPIC MASS BALANCE In the system shown in Fig. 7.0-1 the fluid enters the system at plane 1 with cross section S, and leaves at plane 2 with cross section S,. The average velocity is (v,) at the entry plane and (v2) at the exit plane. In this and the following sections, we introduce two as- sumptions that are not very restrictive: (i) at the planes 1 and 2 the time-smoothed veloc- ' R. B. Bird, Chem. Eng. Sci., 6,123-131 (1957); Chem. Eng. Educ., 27(2), 102-109 (Spring 1993). J. C. Slattery and R. A. Gaggioli, Chem. Eng. Sci., 17,8934395 (1962). 7.1 The Macroscopic Mass Balance 199 ity is perpendicular to the relevant cross section, and (ii) at planes 1 and 2 the density and other physical properties are uniform over the cross section. The law of conservation of mass for this system is then rate of rate of rate of increase mass in mass out of mass at plane 1 at plane 2 Here m,, = JpdV is the total mass of fluid contained in the system between planes 1 and 2. We now introduce the symbol w = p(v)S for the mass rate of flow, and the notation Aw = w2 - wl (exit value minus entrance value). Then the unsteady-state macroscopic mass balance becomes If the total mass of fluid does not change with time, then we get the steady-state macro- scopic mass balance Aw=O (7.1-3) which is just the statement that the rate of mass entering equals the rate of mass leaving. For the macroscopic mass balance we use the term \"steady state\" to mean that the time derivative on the left side of Eq. 7.1-2 is zero. Within the system, because of the pos- sibility for moving parts, flow instabilities, and turbulence, there may well be regions of unsteady flow. A spherical tank of radius R and its drainpipe of length L and diameter D are completely filled with a heavy oil. At time t = 0 the valve at the bottom of the drainpipe is opened. How Draining of a S~heticaz long will it take to drain the tank? There is an air vent at the very top of the spherical tank. Ig- Tank nore the amount of oil that clings to the inner surface of the tank, and assume that the flow in the drainpipe is laminar. SOLUTION We label three planes as in Fig. 7.1-1, and we let the instantaneous liquid level above plane 2 be h(t). Then, at any time t the total mass of liquid in the sphere is Airvent $ur%j - - - plane 1 surface 4 ----- - Plane 2 LR -------- /I' Plane 3 Fig. 7.1-1. Spherical tank with drainpipe. 200 Chapter 7 Macroscopic Balances for Isothermal Flow Systems which can be obtained by using integral calculus. Since no fluid crosses plane 1 we know that w, = 0. The outlet mass flow rate w,, as determined from the Hagen-Poiseuille formula, is The Hagen-Poiseuille formula was derived for steady-state flow, but we use it here since the volume of liquid in the tank is changing slowly with time; this is an example of a \"quasi- steady-state\" approximation. When these expressions for mtOt and w, are substituted into Eq. 7.1-2, we get, after some rearrangement, We now abbreviate the constant on the right side of the equation as A. The equation is easier to integrate if we make the change of variable H = h + L so that We now integrate this equation between t = 0 (when h = 2R or H = 2R + L), and t = teffl,, (when h = 0 or H = L). This gives for the efflux time in which A is given by the right side of Eq. 7.1-6. Note that we have obtained this result with- out any detailed analysis of the fluid motion within the sphere. 57.2 THE MACROSCOPIC MOMENTUM BALANCE We now apply the law of conservation of momentum to the system in Fig. 7.0-1, using the same two assumptions mentioned in the previous section, plus two additional assump- tions: (iii) the forces associated with the stress tensor T are neglected at planes 1 and 2, since they are generally small compared to the pressure forces at the entry and exit planes, and (iv) the pressure does not vary over the cross section at the entry and exit planes. Since momentum is a vector quantity, each term in the balance must be a vector. We use unit vectors u, and u2 to represent the direction of flow at planes 1 and 2. The law of conservation of momentum then reads rate of rate of rate of pressure pressure force of force of increase of momentum momentum force on force on solid gravity momentum in at plane 1 out at plane 2 fluid at fluid at surface on fluid plane 1 plane 2 on fluid Here Pt,, = JpvdV is the total momentum in the system. The equation states that the total momentum within the system changes because of the convection of momentum into and out of the system, and because of the various forces acting on the system: the pressure forces at the ends of the system, the force of the solid surfaces acting on the fluid in the system, and the force of gravity acting on the fluid within the walls of the system. The subscript \"s f\" serves as a reminder of the direction of the force. By introducing the symbols for the mass rate of flow and the A symbol we finally get for the unsteady-state macroscopic momentum balance I I 57.2 The Macroscopic Momentum Balance 201 If the total amount of momentum in the system does not change with time, then we get the steady-state macroscopic momentum balance Once again we emphasize that this is a vector equation. It is useful for computing the force of the fluid on the solid surfaces, FPs, such as the force on a pipe bend or a turbine blade. Actually we have already used a simplified version of the above equation in Eq. 6.1-3. Notes regarding turbulent flow: (i) For turbulent flow it is customary to replace (v) by (5) and (v2) by (3); in the latter we are neglecting the term (?), which is generally small with respect to (3). (ii) Then we further replace ($)/(E) by (E). The error in doing this is uite small; for the empirical $ power law velocity profile given in Eq. 5.1-4, (C2)/(E) = Yo &), so that the error is about 2%. (iii) When we make this assumption we will normally drop the angular brackets and overbars to simplify the notation. That is, we will let (el) = v, and (8) = v:, with similar simplifications for quantities at plane 2. A turbulent jet of water emerges from a tube of radius R, = 2.5 cm with a speed v, = 6 m/s, as shown in Fig. 7.2-1. The jet impinges on a disk-and-rod assembly of mass m = 5.5 kg, Force Exerted a let which is free to move vertically. The friction between the rod and the sleeve will be neglected. (Part a) Find the height h at which the disk will \"float\" as a result of the jet.' Assume that the water is incompressible. SOLUTION To solve this problem one has to imagine how the jet behaves. In Fig. 7.2-l(a) we make the as- sumption that the jet has a constant radius, R,, between the tube exit and the disk, whereas in Fig. 7.2-l(b) we assume that the jet spreads slightly. In this example, we make the first as- sumption, and in Example 7.4-1 we account for the jet spreading. We apply the z-component of the steady-state momentum balance between planes 1 and 2. The pressure terms can be omitted, since the pressure is atmospheric at both planes. The z component of the fluid velocity at plane 2 is zero. The momentum balance then becomes When this is solved for h, we get (in SI units) Disk-rod assembly - Plane 3 Plane 2 Fig. 7.2-1.

Federhofer, Aufgaben aus der Hydrornechanik, Springer-Verlag, Vienna (1954), pp. 36 and 172. 202 Chapter 7 Macroscopic Balances for Isothermal Flow Systems 57.3 THE MACROSCOPIC ANGULAR MOMENTUM BALANCE The development of the macroscopic angular momentum balance parallels that for the (linear) momentum balance in the previous section. All we have to do is to replace \"mo- mentum'' by \"angular momentum\" and \"force\" by \"torque.\" To describe the angular momentum and torque we have to select an origin of coor- dinates with respect to which these quantities are evaluated. The origin is designated by \"0 in Fig. 7.0-1, and the locations of the midpoints of planes 1 and 2 with respect to this origin are given by the position vectors rl and r,. Once again we make assumptions (i)-(iv) introduced in ss7.1 and 7.2. With these as- sumptions the rate of entry of angular momentum at plane 1, which is J[r x pv](v . u)dS evaluated at that plane, becomes pl(v:)Sl[rl x ul], with a similar expression for the rate at which angular momentum leaves the system at 2. The unsteady-state macroscopic angular momentum balance may now be written as rate of rate of angular rate of angular increase of momentum momentum angular in at plane 1 out at plane 2 momentum + pISl[rl X u11 - p2S2[r2 X u21 + T,+ + Text torque due to torque due to torque external pressure on pressure on of solid torque fluid at fluid at surface on fluid plane 1 plane 2 on fluid Here L,,, = Jp[r X vldV is the total angular momentum within the system, and T,,, = J[r x pg] dV is the torque on the fluid in the system resulting from the gravitational force. This equation can also be written as Finally, the steady-state macroscopic angular momentum balance is This gives the torque exerted by the fluid on the solid surfaces. A mixing vessel, shown in Fig. 7.3-1, is being operated at steady state. The fluid enters tan- gentially at plane 1 in turbulent flow with a velocity v, and leaves through the vertical pipe Torque On a Mixing with a velocity u,. Since the tank is baffled there is no swirling motion of the fluid in the verti- Vessel cal exit pipe. Find the torque exerted on the mixing vessel. SOLUTION The origin of the coordinate system is taken to be on the tank axis in a plane passing through the axis of the entrance pipe and parallel to the tank top. Then the vector [r, X u,l is a vector pointing in the z direction with magnitude R. Furthermore [r, X up] = 0, since the two vectors are collinear. For this problem Eq. 7.3-3 gives Thus the torque is just \"force X lever arm,\" as would be expected. If the torque is sufficiently large, the equipment must be suitably braced to withstand the torque produced by the fluid motion and the inlet pressure. s7.4 The Macroscopic Mechanical Energy Balance 203 Side view Fig. 7.3-1.

Origin of coordinates is on tank axis in a plane passing through the axis of the entrance pipe and parallel to the tank top Plane 2 57.4 THE MACROSCOPIC MECHANICAL ENERGY BALANCE Equations 7.1-2,7.2-2, and 7.3-2 have been set up by applying the laws of conservation of mass, (linear) momentum, and angular momentum over the macroscopic system in Fig. 7.0-1. The three macroscopic balances thus obtained correspond to the equations of change in Eqs. 3.1-4,3.2-9, and 3.4-1, and, in fact, they are very similar in structure. These three macroscopic balances can also be obtained by integrating the three equations of change over the volume of the flow system. Next we want to set up the macroscopic mechanical energy balance, which corre- sponds to the equation of mechanical energy in Eq. 3.3-2. There is no way to do this di- rectly as we have done in the preceding three sections, since there is no conservation law for mechanical energy. In this instance we must integrate the equation of change of me- chanical energy over the volume of the flow system. The result, which has made use of the same assumptions (i-iv) used above, is the unsteady-state macroscopic mechanical energy balance (sometimes called the engineering Bernoulli equation). The equation is derived in 97.8; here we state the result and discuss its meaning: rate of increase rate at which kinetic rate at which kinetic of kinetic and and potential energy and potential energy potential energy enter system at plane 1 leave system at plane 2 in system + (pI(vl)S1 - p2(v2)S2) + W, + 1 p(V. v) dV + (T:W dV (7.4-1) V(t) V(t) net rate at which the rate of rate at which rate at which surroundings do doing mechanical mechanical work on the fluid work on energy increases energy at planes 1 and 2 by fluid by or decreases decreases the pressure moving because of expansion because of surfaces or compression viscous of fluid dissipation' - -- - - This interpretation of the term is valid only for Newtonian fluids; polymeric liquids have elasticity and the interpretation given above no longer holds. 204 Chapter 7 Macroscopic Balances for Isothermal Flow Systems Here Kt,, = Jipv2dv and a,,, = JP& dV are the total kinetic and potential energies within the system. According to Eq. 7.4-1, the total mechanical energy (i.e., kinetic plus poten- tial) changes because of a difference in the rates of addition and removal of mechanical energy, because of work done on the fluid by the surroundings, and because of com- pressibility effects and viscous dissipation. Note that, at the system entrance (plane I), the force p,S, multiplied by the velocity (v,) gives the rate at which the surroundings do work on the fluid. Furthermore, W,, is the work done by the surroundings on the fluid by means of moving surfaces. The macroscopic mechanical energy balance may now be written more compactly as I I in which the terms E, and E, are defined as follows: E, = - p(V . v) dV and E, = - (~VV) dV I I (7.4-3,4) V(t) V(t) The compression term E, is positive in compression and negative in expansion; it is zero when the fluid is assumed to be incompressible. The term E, is the viscous dissipation (or friction loss) term, which is always positive for Newtonian liquids, as can be seen from Eq. 3.3-3. (For polymeric fluids, which are viscoelastic, E, is not necessarily positive; these fluids are discussed in the next chapter.) If the total kinetic plus potential energy in the system is not changing with time, we get which is the steady-state macroscopic mechanical energy balance. Here h is the height above some arbitrarily chosen datum plane. Next, if we assume that it is possible to draw a representative streamline through the system, we may combine the A(p/p) and E, terms to get the following approximate re- lation (see 57.8) Then, after dividing Eq. 7.4-5 by w, = w, = w, we get I I Here & = W,,/w and i,, = E,/w. Equation 7.4-7 is the version of the steady-state me- chanical energy balance that is most often used. For isothermal systems, the integral term can be calculated as long as an expression for density as a function of pressure is available. Equation 7.4-7 should now be compared with Eq. 3.5-12, which is the \"classical\" Bernoulli equation for an inviscid fluid. If, to the right side of Eq. 3.5-12, we jyst add the work wrn done by the surroundings and subtract the viscous dissipation term E,, and rein- terpret the velocities as appropriate averages over the cross sections, then we get Eq. 7.4-7. This provides a \"plausibility argument\" for Eq. 7.4-7 and still preserves the fundamental idea that the macroscopic mechanical energy balance is derived from the equation of mo- tion (that is, from the law of conservation of momentum). The full derivation of the macro- scopic mechanical energy balance is given in g7.8 for those who are interested. Notes for turbulent flow: (i) For turbulent flows we replace (v3) by (v3), and ignore the contribution from the turbulent fluctuations. (ii) It is common practice to replace the $7.5 Estimation of the Viscous Loss 205 Force Exerted by a Jef (Part b) quotient (fi3)/(E) by (fi)2. For the empirical 3 power law velocity profile given in Eq. 5.1-4, 43200 it can be shown that (fi3)/(~) = z(0)2, SO that the error amounts to about 6%. (iii) We further omit the brackets and overbars to simplify the notation in turbulent flow. Continue the problem in Example 7.2-1 by accounting for the spreading of the jet as it moves upward. SOLUTION We now permit the jet diameter to increase with increasing z as shown in Fig. 7.2-l(b). It is convenient to work with three planes and to make balances between pairs of planes. The sep- aration between planes 2 and 3 is taken to be quite small. A mass balance between planes 1 and 2 gives Next we apply the mechanical energy balance of Eq. 7.4-5 or 7.4-7 between the same two planes. The pressures at planes 1 and 2 are both atmospheric, and there is no work done by moving parts W,. We assume that the viscous dissipation term E, can be neglected. If z is measured upward from the tube exit, then gAh = g(h, - h,) = g(h - O), since planes 2 and 3 are so close together. Thus the mechanical energy balance gives We now apply the z-momentum balance between planes 2 and 3. Since the region is very small, we neglect the last term in Eq. 7.2-3. Both planes are at atmospheric pressure, so the pressure terms do not contribute. The fluid velocity is zero at plane 3, so there are only two terms left in the momentum balance From the above three equations we get from Eq. 7.4-9 (mg'w2)2) from Eq. 7.4-10 v: = 3 (1 - () from Eq. 7.4-8 28 in which rng and v,w, = .rr~:~v: are known. When the numerical values are substituted into Eq. 7.4-10, we get h = 0.77 m. This is probably a better result than the value of 0.87 m obtained in Example 7.2-1, since it accounts for the spreading of the jet. We have not, however, consid- ered the clinging of the water to the disk, which gives the disk-rod assembly a somewhat greater effective mass. In addition, the frictional resistance of the rod in the sleeve has been neglected. It is necessary to run an experiment to assess the validity of Eq. 7.4-10. 57.5 ESTIMATION OF THE VISCOUS LOSS This section is devoted to methods for estimating the viscous loss (or friction loss), E,, which appears in the macroscopic mechanical energy balance. The general expression for E, is given in Eq. 7.4-4. For incompressible Newtonian fluids, Eq. 3.3-3 may be used to rewrite E, as 206 Chapter 7 Macroscopic Balances for Isothermal Flow Systems which shows that it is the integral of the local rate of viscous dissipation over the volume of the entire flow system. We now want to examine E, from the point of view of dimensional analysis. The quantity a, is a sum of squares of velocity gradients; hence it has dimensions of (~,/1,)~, where v, and 1, are a characteristic velocity and length, respectively. We can therefore write where 6, = (l,/v,)*@, and dp = li3dV are dimensionless quantities. If we make use of the dimensional arguments of 993.7 and 6.2, we see that the integral in Eq. 7.5-2 depends only on the various dimensionless groups in the equations of change and on various geometrical factors that enter into the boundary conditions. Hence, if the only significant dimensionless group is a Reynolds number, Re = l,v,p/p, then Eq. 7.5-2 must have the general form a dimensionless function of Re and various geometrical ratios (7.5-3) A In steady-state flow we prefer to work with the quantity E, = EJw, in which w = p(v)S is the mass rate of flow passing through any cross section of the flow system. If we select the reference velocity v, to be (v) and the reference length 1, to be %%, then in which e,, the friction loss factor, is a function of a Reynolds number and relevant di- mensionless geometrical ratios. The factor has been introduced in keeping with the form of several related equations. We now want to summarize what is known about the friction loss factor for the various parts of a piping system. For a straight conduit the friction loss factor is closely related to the friction factor. We consider only the steady flow of a fluid of constant density in a straight conduit of arbitrary, but constant, cross section S and length L. If the fluid is flowing in the z direc- tion under the influence of a pressure gradient and gravity, then Eqs. 7.2-2 and 7.4-7 become (mechanical energy) 1 EL, = p (PI - p2) + LgZ (7.5-6) Multiplication of the second of these by pS and subtracting gives If, in addition, the flow is turbulent then the expression for Ff+, in terms of the mean hy- draulic radius Rh may be used (see Eqs. 6.2-16 to 18) so that in which f is the friction factor discussed in Chapter 6. Since this equation is of the form of Eq. 7.5-4, we get a simple relation between the friction loss factor and the friction factor for turbulent flow in sections of straight pipe with uniform cross section. For a similar treatment for conduits of variable cross section, see Problem 7B.2. 57.5 Estimation of the Viscous Loss 207 Table 7.5-1 Brief Summary of Friction Loss Factors for Use with Eq. 7.5-10 (Approximate Values for Turbulent Flow)\" Disturbances e, Sudden changes in cross-sectional areab Rounded entrance to pipe 0.05 Sudden contraction Sudden expansionc Orifice (sharp-edged) Fittings and valves 90\" elbows (rounded) 0.4-0.9 90\" elbows (square) 1.3-1.9 45\" elbows 0.3-0.4 Globe valve (open) 610 Gate valve (open) 0.2 \" Taken from H.

See derivation from the macroscopic balances in Example 7.6-1. If P = 0, then E, = :(v)', where (v) is the velocity upstream from the enlargement. Most flow systems contain various \"obstacles,\" such as fittings, sudden changes in diameter, valves, or flow measuring devices. These also contribute to the friction loss ED. Such additional resistances may be written in the form of Eq. 7.5-4, with e, determined by one of two methods: (a) simultaneous solution of the macroscopic balances, or (b) experi- mental measurement. Some rough values of e, are tabulated in Table 7.5-1 for the conven- tion that (v) is the average velocity downstream from the disturbance. These e, values are for turbulent flow for which the Reynolds number dependence is not too important. Now we are in a position to rewrite Eq. 7.4-7 in the approximate form frequently used for turbulent flow calculations in a system composed of various kinds of piping and addi- tional resistances: 12L :(z$ - v:) + ~(1~ - zli + /C $ dp = hm - Z jiY Rif)i - (v2e) i (7.5-10) sum over all sum over all sections of fittings, valves, straight conduits meters, etc. Here Rh is the mean hydraulic radius defined in Eq. 6.2-16, f is the friction factor defined in Eq. 6.1-4, and e, is the friction loss factor given in Table 7.5-1. Note that the v, and v2 in the first term refer to the velocities at planes 1 and 2; the v in the first sum is the average velocity in the ith pipe segment; and the v in the second sum is the average velocity downstream from the ith fitting, valve, or other obstacle. What is the required power output from the pump at steady state in the system shown in Fig. 7.5-l? Water at 68OF (p = 62.4 lb,/ft3; p = 1.0 cp) is to be delivered to the upper tank at a rate Requirement of 12 ft3/min. All of the piping is 4-in. internal diameter smooth circular pipe. for Pipeline Flow 208 Chapter 7 Macroscopic Balances for Isothermal Flow Systems SOLUTION Fig. 7.5-1. Pipeline flow with friction losses be- cause of fittings. Planes 1 and 2 are just under - - Plane 2 the surface of the liquid. The average velocity in the pipe is and the Reynolds number is Hence the flow is turbulent. The contribution to i, from the various lengths of pipe will be The contribution to k, from the sudden contraction, the three 90\" elbows, and the sudden ex- pansion (see Table 7.5-1) will be 2 ($v2eJi = $(2.30)~(0.45 + 3(;) + 1) = 8 ft2/s2 (7.5-14) I Then from Eq. 7.5-10 we get 0 + (32.2)(105 - 20) + 0 = wrn - 85 - 8 (7.5-15) Solving for wrn we get This is the work (per unit mass of fluid) done on the fluid in the pump. Hence the pump does 2830 ft2/s2 or 2830/32.2 = 88 ft lbf/lbrn of work on the fluid passing through the system. The mass rate of flow is Consequently Wrn = W& = (12.5)(88) = 1100 ft lbf/s = 2 hp = 1.5 kW (7.5-18) which is the power delivered by the pump. s7.6 Use of the Macroscopic Balances for Steady-State Problems 209 Table 7.6-1 Steady-State Macroscopic Balances for Turbulent Flow in Isothermal Systems Mass: CW, - Zw2 = O (A) Momentum: X(vlwl + plS1)ul - C(v2~2 + p2S2h2 + mtot!4 = Ff-s (B) Mechanical energy: C w2 = - W, + E, + E, (D) Notes: (a) All formulas here assume flat velocity profiles.

(d) All equations are written for compressible flow; for incompressible flow, E, = 0. 57.6 USE OF THE MACROSCOPIC BALANCES FOR STEADY-STATE PROBLEMS In 53.6 we saw how to set up the differential equations to calculate the velocity and pres- sure profiles for isothermal flow systems by simplifying the equations of change. In this section we show how to use the set of steady-state macroscopic balances to obtain the al- gebraic equations for describing large systems. For each problem we start with the four macroscopic balances. By keeping track of the discarded or approximated terms, we automatically have a complete listing of the as- sumptions inherent in the final result. All of the examples given here are for isothermal, incompressible flow. The incompressibility assumption means that the velocity of the fluid must be less than the velocity of sound in the fluid and the pressure changes must be small enough that the resulting density changes can be neglected. The steady-state macroscopic balances may be easily generalized for systems with multiple inlet streams (called la, Ib, lc, . . .) and multiple outlet streams (called 2a, 2b, 2c, . . .). These balances are summarized in Table 7.6-1 for turbulent flow (where the ve- locity profiles are regarded as flat). An incompressible fluid flows from a small circular tube into a large tube in turbulent flow, as shown in Fig. 7.6-1. The cross-sectional areas of the tubes are S, and S2.

HOW through a sudden area S2 enlargement. 210 Chapter 7 Macroscopic Balances for Isothermal Flow Systems SOLUTION (a) Mass balance. For steady flow the mass balance gives For a fluid of constant density, this gives (b) Momentum balance. The downstream component of the momentum balance is The force Ff,, is composed of two parts: the viscous force on the cylindrical surfaces parallel to the direction of flow, and the pressure force on the washer-shaped surface just to the right of plane 1 and perpendicular to the flow axis. The former contribution we neglect (by intu- ition) and the latter we take to be p,(S2 - S,) by assuming that the pressure on the washer- shaped surface is the same as that at plane 1. We then get, by using Eq. 7.6-1, Solving for the pressure difference gives or, in terms of the downstream velocity, Note that the momentum balance predicts (correctly) a rise in pressure. (c) Angular momentum balance. This balance is not needed. If we take the origin of coor- dinates on the axis of the system at the center of gravity of the fluid located between planes 1 and 2, then [r, X u,l and [r2 X u21 are both zero, and there are no torques on the fluid system. (dl Mechanical energy balance. There is no compressive loss, no work done via moving parts, and no elevation change, so that * I 1 Ev = ,(v: - v:) + - P (p, - p2) Insertion of Eq. 7.6-6 for the pressure rise then gives, after some rearrangement, which is an entry in Table 7.5-1. This example has shown how to use the macroscopic balances to estimate the friction loss factor for a simple resistance in a flow system. Because of the assumptions mentioned after Eq. 7.6-3, the results in Eqs. 7.6-6 and 8 are approximate. If great accuracy is needed, a correc- tion factor based on experimental data should be introduced. A diagram of a liquid-liquid ejector is shown in Fig. 7.6-2. It is desired to analyze the mixing of the two streams, both of the same fluid, by means of the macroscopic balances. At plane 1 Petfowance of a the two fluid streams merge. Stream la has a velocity v, and a cross-sectional area is,, and LiPid-LiPid Ejector stream lb has a velocity iv, and a cross-sectional area $5,. Plane 2 is chosen far enough down- stream that the two streams have mixed and the velocity is almost uniform at v,. The flow is 57.6 Use of the Macroscopic Balances for Steady-State Problems 211 SOLUTION Stream lb Fig. 7.6-2. Flow in a liquid-liq- uid ejector pump. turbulent and the velocity profiles at planes 1 and 2 are assumed to be flat. In the following analysis F+, is neglected, since it is felt to be less important than the other terms in the mo- mentum balance. (a) Mass balance. At steady state, Eq. (A) of Table 7.6-1 gives Hence, since S, = S2, this equation gives for the velocity of the exit stream. We also note, for later use, that w,, = wlb = $w2. (b) Momentum balance. From Eq. (B) of Table 7.6-1 the component of the momentum bal- ance in the flow direction is or using the relation at the end of (a) from which 2 p2 - PI = $Po This is the expression for the pressure rise resulting from the mixing of the two streams. (c) Angular momentum balance. This balance is not needed. (d) Mechanical energy balance. Equation (D) of Table 7.6-1 gives or, using the relation at the end of (a), we get Hence is the energy dissipation per unit mass. The preceding analysis gives fairly good results for liquid-liquid ejector pumps. In gas-gas ejectors, however, the density varies significantly and it is necessary to include the macroscopic total energy balance as well as an equation of state in the analysis. This is discussed in Example 15.3-2. 212 Chapter 7 Macroscopic Balances for Isothermal Flow Systems EXAMPLE 7.6-3 Thrust on a Pipe Bend SOLUTION Water at 95°C is flowing at a rate of 2.0 ft3/s through a 60\" bend, in which there is a contrac- tion from 4 to 3 in. internal diameter (see Fig. 7.6-3). Compute the force exerted on the bend if the pressure at the downstream end is 1.1 atm. The density and viscosity of water at the con- ditions of the system are 0.962 g/cm3 and 0.299 cp, respectively. The Reynolds number for the flow in the 3-in. pipe is At this Reynolds number the flow is highly turbulent, and the assumption of flat velocity pro- files is reasonable. (a) Mass balance. For steady-state flow, w1 = w,. If the density is constant throughout, in which /3 is the ratio of the smaller to the larger cross section. (b) Mechanical energy balance. For steady, incompressible flow, Eq. (d) of Table 7.6-1 be- comes, for this problem, According to Table 7.5-1 and Eq. 7.5-4, we can take the friction loss as approximately g(4v:) = iv:. Inserting this into Eq. 7.6-20 and using the mass balance we get This is the pressure drop through the bend in terms of the known velocity v2 and the known geometrical factor P. (c) Momentum balance. We now have to consider both the x- and y-components of the mo- mentum balance. The inlet and outlet unit vectors will have x- and y-components given by ulw = 1, uly = 0, u2 = cos 8, and u,, = sin 8.

Whitaker, Introduction to Fluid Dynamics, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. (1968), p. 260. An application of the compressible impinging jet problem has been given by J. V. Foa, U.S. Patent 3,361,336 Uan. 2,1968). There, use is made of the fact that if the slot-shaped nozzle moves to the left in Fig. 7.6-4 (i.e., left with respect to the plate), then, for a compressible fluid, the right stream will be cooler than the jet and the left stream will be warmer. s7.6 Use of the Macroscopic Balances for Steady-State Problems 215 Now Eqs. 7.6-31 solved we find that ,32,33, and 36 are four equations with four unknowns. When these are Hence the velocities of all three streams are equal. The same result is obtained by applying the classical Bernoulli equation for the flow of an inviscid fluid (see Example 3.5-1). A common method for determining the mass rate of flow through a pipe is to measure the pres- sure drop across some \"obstacle\" in the pipe. An example of this is the orifice, which is a thin ~so~h~~al Flow of a plate with a hole in the middle. There are pressure taps at planes 1 and 2, upstream and dom- Liquid Through an stream of the orifice plate.

In highly turbu- lent flow this jet necks down to a minimum cross section at the vena con- tracts. The extent of this necking down can be given by the contraction coefficient, C, = (S,,,, c,,,ac,,/S,). According to inviscid flow theory, C, = T/(T + 2) = 0.611 if So/Sl = 0 [H.

(b) Approximate velocity profile at plane 2 used to estimate (vi)/(v2). 216 Chapter 7 Macroscopic Balances for Isothermal Flow Systems SOLUTION will be assumed to be flat. In Fig. 7.6-5(b) we show an approximate velocity profile at plane 2, which we use in the application of the macroscopic balances. The standard orifice meter equa- tion is obtained by applying the macroscopic mass and mechanical energy balances. (a) Mass balance. For a fluid of constant density with a system for which S, = S, = S, the mass balance in Eq. 7.1-1 gives With the assumed velocity profiles this becomes and the volume rate of flow is w = pv,S. (b) Mechanical energy balance. For a constant-density fluid in a flow system with no eleva- tion change and no moving parts, Eq. 7.4-5 gives The viscous loss E, is neglected, even though it is certainly not equal to zero. With the as- sumed velocity profiles, Eq. 7.6-43 then becomes P2 - P1 ;cv; - v:, + - = 0 P (7.6-44) When Eqs. 7.6-42 and 44 are combined to eliminate u,, we can solve for v, to get We can now multiply by pS to get the volume rate of flow. Then to account for the errors in- troduced by neglecting E, and by the assumptions regarding the velocity profiles we include a discharge coefficient, Cd, and obtain Experimental discharge coefficients have been correlated as a function of So/S and the Reynolds n~mber.~ For Reynolds numbers greater than lo4, Cd approaches about 0.61 for all practical values of So/S. This example has illustrated the use of the macroscopic balances to get the general form of the result, which is then modified by introducing a multiplicative function of dimensionless groups to correct for errors introduced by unwarranted assumptions. This combination of macroscopic balances and dimensional considerations is often used and can be quite useful. 57.7 USE OF THE MACROSCOPIC BALANCES FOR UNSTEADY-STATE PROBLEMS In the preceding section we have illustrated the use of the macroscopic balances for solv- ing steady-state problems. In this section we turn our attention to unsteady-state prob- lems. We give two examples to illustrate the use of the time-dependent macroscopic balance equations. G. L. Tuve and R. E. Sprenkle, Instruments, 6,202-205,225,232-234 (1935); see also R. H. Perry and C. H.

At time t = 0 the liquid is allowed to drain out through a small hole of radius X, at the bottom of the tank Acceleration Effects in (see Q. 7.7-1 )* Unsteady 'low from a (a) Find the efflux time by using the unsteady-state mass balance and by assuming Torri- Cylindrical Tank celli's equation (see Problem 3B.14) to describe the relation between efflux velocity and the in- stantaneous height of the liquid. SOLUTION (b) Find the efflux time using the unsteady-state mass and mechanical energy balances. (a) We apply Eq. 7.1-2 to the system in Fig. 7.7-1, taking plane 1 to be at the top of the tank (so that w, = 0). If the instantaneous liquid height is h(t), then Here we have assumed that the velocity profile at plane 2 is flat. According to Torricelli's equation v2 = a, so that Eq. 7.7-1 becomes -- 3 2@ \"- d t (R) When this is integrated from t = 0 to t= t,,,,, we get in which N = (R/Ro)4 >> 1. This is effectively a quasi-steady-state solution, since we have used the unsteady-state mass balance along with Torricelli's equation, which was derived for a steady-state flow. (b) We now use Eq. 7.7-1 and the mechanical energy balance in Eq. 7.4-2. In the latter, the terms W, and E, are identically zero, and we assume that E, is negligibly small, since the velocity gra- dients in the system will be small. We take the datum plane for the potential energy to be at the bottom of the tank, so that 6, = gz, = 0; at plane 1 no liquid is entering, and therefore the poten- tial energy term is not needed there. Since the top of the tank is open to the atmosphere and the tank is discharging into the atmosphere, the pressure contributions cancel one another. To get the total kinetic energy in the system at any time t, we have to know the velocity of every fluid element in the tank. At every point in the tank, we assume that the fluid is mov- ing downward at the same velocity, namely V~(R~/R)~ so that the kinetic energy per unit vol- ume is everywhere $~;(R,/R)~. To get the total potential energy in the system at any time t, we have to integrate the po- tential energy per unit volume pgz over the volume of fluid from 0 to h. This gives ~R~p~($h~). Therefore the mechanical energy balance in Eq. 7.4-2 becomes From the unsteady-state mass balance, v, = -(R/RJ2(dh/dt). When this is inserted into Eq. 7.7-4 we get (after dividing by dh/dt) &let of radius Ro Fig. 7.7-1. Flow out of a cylindrical tank. 218 Chapter 7 Macroscopic Balances for Isothermal Flow Systems This is to be solved with the two initial conditions: I.C. 1: at t = 0, h=H (7.7-6) I.C. 2: The second of these is Torricelli's equation at the initial instant of time. The second-order differential equation for h can be converted to a first-order equation for the function u(h) by making the change of variable (dh/dt)' = u. This gives The solution to this first-order equation can be verified to be' The second initial condition then gives C = -4g/[N(N - 2)HN-2] for the integration constant; since N >> 1, we need not concern ourselves with the special case that N = 2. We can next take the square root of Eq. 7.7-9 and introduce a dimensionless liquid height 7 = h/H; this gives in which the minus sign must be chosen on physical grounds. This separable, first-order equation can be integrated from t = 0 to t = t,,,, to give - The function +(N) gives the deviation from the quasi-steady-state solution obtained in Eq. 7.7-3. This function can be evaluated as follows: The integrations can now be performed. When the result is expanded in inverse powers of N, one finds that Since N = (R/RJ4 is a very large number, it is evident that the factor 4(N) differs only very slightly from unity. It is instructive now to return to Eq. 7.7-4 and omit the term describing the change in total kinetic energy with time. If this is done, one obtains exactly the expression for efflux time in Eq. 7.7-3 (or Eq. 7.7-11, with +(N) = 1. We can therefore conclude that in this type of problem, the change in kinetic energy with time can safely be neglected. See E.

Obtain an expres- Oscillations2 sion for the tube radius for which critical damping occurs. Neglect the motion of the gas above the manometer liquid. The notation is summarized in Fig. 7.7-2. SOLUTION We designate the manometric liquid as the system to which we apply the macroscopic bal- ances. In that case, there are no planes l and 2 through which liquid enters or exits. The free liquid surfaces are capable of performing work on the surroundings, W,, and hence play the role of the moving mechanical parts in 57.4. We apply the mechanical energy balance of Eq. 7.4-2, with E, set equal to zero (since the manometer liquid is regarded as incompressible). Be- cause of the choice of the system, both w, and w2 are zero, so that the only terms on the right side are - W, and - E,. To evaluate dKtOt/dt and E, it is necessary to make some kind of assumption about the ve- locity profile. Here we take the velocity profile to be parabolic: in which (v) = dh/dt is a function of time, defined to be positive when the flow is from left to right. The kinetic energy term may then be evaluated as follows: Fig. 7.7-2. Damped oscillations of a manometer fluid. For a summary of experimental and theoretical work on manometer oscillations, see J. C. Biery, AIChE Journal, 9,606-614 (1963); 10,551-557 (1964); 15,631-634 (1969). Biery's experimental data show that the assumption made in Eq. 7.7-14 is not very good. 220 Chapter 7 Macroscopic Balances for Isothermal Flow Systems Here 1 is a coordinate running along the axis of the manometer tube, and L is the distance along this axis from one manometer interface to the other-that is, the total length of the manometer fluid. The dimensionless coordinate 6 is r/R, and S is the cross-sectional area of the tube. The change of potential energy with time is given by = [(intFEril over portion K+H-h K+H+)I below z = 0, which ) + pgS lo z& + pgs lo z dz] dt is constant The viscous loss term can also be evaluated as follows: Furthermore, the net work done by the surroundings on the system is Substitution of the above terms into the mechanical energy balance and letting (v) = dh/dt then gives the differential equation for k(t) as which is to be solved with the initial conditions that h = 0 and dh/dt = 0 at t = 0. This second- order, linear, nonhomogeneous equation can be rendered new variable k defined by Then the equation for the motion of the manometer liquid is homogeneous by introducing a (7.7-20) This equation also arises in describing the motion of a mass connected to a spring and dash- pot as well as the current in an RLC circuit (see Eq. C.l-7). We now try a solution of the form k = em'. Substituting this trial function into Eq. 7.7-21 shows that there are two admissible values for m: and the solution is k = C+em-' + C-em-t when m+ # m- (7.7-23) k = Clemt + C2temf when m+ = m- = rn (7.7-24) with the constants being determined by the initial conditions. 57.8 Derivation of the Macroscopic Mechanical Energy Balance 221 The type of motion that the manometer liquid exhibits depends on the value of the dis- criminant in Eq. 7.7-22: (a) If (6p,/pR2I2 > (6g/L), the system is overdamped, and the liquid moves slowly to its final position. (b) If (6p,/p~~)~ < (6g/L), the system is underdamped, and the liquid oscillates about its final position, the oscillations becoming smaller and smaller. (c) If = (6g/L), the system is critically damped, and the liquid moves to its final position in the most rapid monotone fashion. The tube radius for critical damping is then If the tube radius R is greater than R,,, an oscillatory motion occurs. 57.8 DERIVATION OF THE MACROSCOPIC MECHANICAL ENERGY BALANCE' In Eq. 7.4-2 the macroscopic mechanical energy balance was presented without proof. In this section we show how the equation is obtained by integrating the equation of change for mechanical energy (Eq. 3.3-2) over the entire volume of the flow system of Fig. 7.0-1. We begin by doing the formal integration: I & (iPg + p6) d~ = - (V (iP9 + p6)v) d~ - (V pv) d~ - (V . [r . vl) d~ V(t) I V(t) I V(t) I V(t) + I p(V v) dV + 1 (.r:Vv) dV (7.8-1) V(t) V(t) Next we apply the 3-dimensional Leibniz formula (Eq. A.5-5) to the left side and the Gauss divergence theorem (Eq. A.5-2) to terms 1,2, and 3 on the right side. - I (n [T vl) + I p(v . v) d~ + I (.r:vv) d~ (7.8-2) S(t) V(t) V(t) The term containing v,, the velocity of the surface of the system, arises from the applica- tion of the Leibniz formula. The surface S(t) consists of four parts: the fixed surface Sf (on which both v and v, are zero) the moving surfaces S, (on which v = v, with both nonzero) the cross section of the entry port S1 (where v, = 0) the cross section of the exit port S2 (where vs = 0) Presently each of the surface integrals will be split into four parts corresponding to these four surfaces. We now interpret the terms in Eq. 7.8-2 and, in the process, introduce several as- sumptions; these assumptions have already been mentioned in $57.1 to 7.4, but now the reasons for them will be made clear. ' R. B. Bird, Korean J. Chem. Eng., 15,105-123 (1998), 93. 222 Chapter 7 Macroscopic Balances for Isothermal Flow Systems The term on the left side can be interpreted as the time rate of change of the total ki- netic and potential energy (K,, + a,,,) within the \"control volume,\" whose shape and volume are changing with time. We next examine one by one the five terms on the right side: Term I (including the minus sign) contributes only at the entry and exit ports and gives the rates of influx and efflux of kinetic and potential energy: The angular brackets indicate an average over the cross section. To get this result we have to assume that the fluid density and potential energy per unit mass are constant over the cross section, and that the fluid is flowing parallel to the tube walls at the entry and exit ports. The first term in Eq. 7.8-3 is positive, since at plane 1, (-n . v) = (ul * (ulv,)) = v,, and the second term is negative, since at plane 2, (-n v) = (-u, . (u2v2)) = -v2. Term 2 (including the minus sign) gives no contribution on Sf since v is zero there. On each surface element dS of S, there is a force -npdS acting on a surface moving with a velocity v, and the dot product of these quantities gives the rate at which the surround- ings do work on the fluid through the moving surface element dS. We use the symbol w:' to indicate the sum of all these surface terms. Furthermore, the integrals over the stationary surfaces S, and S, give the work required to push the fluid into the system at plane 1 minus the work required to push the fluid out of the system at plane 2. Therefore term 2 finally gives Term 2 = pl(vl)S, - p,(v2)S2 + w?) (7.8-4) Here we have assumed that the pressure does not vary over the cross section at the entry and exit ports. Term 3 (including the minus sign) gives no contribution on Sf since v is zero there. The integral over S,, can be interpreted as the rate at which the surroundings do work on the fluid by means of the viscous forces, and this integral is designated as w:'. At the entry and exit ports it is conventional to neglect the work terms associated with the vis- cous forces, since they are generally quite small compared with the pressure contribu- tions. Therefore we get Term 3 = WI;' (7.8-5) We now introduce the symbol W, = w!:) + w:' to represent the total rate at which the surroundings do work on the fluid within the system through the agency of the mov- ing surfaces. Terms 4 and 5 cannot be further simplified, and hence we define Term 4 = + p(V . v) dV = -E, V(f) Term 5 = + I (.r:Vv) dV = - E, (7.8-7) V(D For Newtonian fluids the viscous loss EL, is the rate at which mechanical energy is irre- versibly degraded into thermal energy because of the yiscosity of the fluid and is always a positive quantity (see Eq. 3.3-3). We have already discussed methods for estimating E, in 57.5. (For viscoelastic fluids, which we discuss in Chapter 8, E, has to be interpreted differently and may even be negative.) The compression term E, is the rate at which me- chanical energy is reversibly changed into thermal energy because of the compressiblity of the fluid; it may be either positive or negative. If the fluid is being regarded as incom- pressible, then E, is zero. s7.8 Derivation of the Macroscopic Mechanical Energy Balance 223 When all the contributions are inserted into Eq. 7.8-2 we finally obtain the macro- scopic mechanical energy balance: If, now, we introduce the symbols w1 = pl(vl)Sl and w2 = p2(u2)S2 for the mass rates of flow in and out, then Eq. 7.8-8 can be rewritten in the form of Eq. 7.4-2. Several assump- tions have been made in this development, but normally they are not serious. If the situ- ation warrants, one can go back and include the neglected effects. It should be noted that the above derivation of the mechanical energy balance does not require that the system be isothermal. Therefore the results in Eqs. 7.4-2 and 7.8-8 are valid for nonisothermal systems. To get the mechanical energy balance in the form of Eq. 7.4-7 we have to develop an approximate expression for E,. We imagine that there is a representative streamline run- ning through the system, and we introduce a coordinate s along the streamline. We as- sume that pressure, density, and velocity do not vary over the cross section. We further imagine that at each position along the streamline, there is a cross section S(s) perpendic- ular to the s-coordinate, so that we can write dV = S(s)ds. If there are moving parts in the system and if the system geometry is complex, it may not be possible to do this. We start by using the fact that (V . pv) = 0 at steady state so that Then we use the assumption that the pressure and density are constant over the cross section to write approximately Even though p, u, and S are functions of the streamline coordinate s, their product, w = pvS, is a constant for steady-state operation and hence may be taken outside the integral. This gives Then an integration by parts can be performed: When this result is put into Eq. 7.4-5, the approximate relation in Eq. 7.4-7 is obtained. Be- cause of the questionable nature of the assumptions made (the existence of a representative streamline and the constancy of p and p over a cross section), it seems preferable to use Eq. 7.4-5 rather than Eq. 7.47. Also, Eq. 7.45 is easily generalized to systems with multiple inlet and outlet ports, whereas Eq. 7.47 is not; the generalization is given in Eq. (D) of Table 7.6-1. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1.

The latter assumes that the flow is fully developed in the region between the two planes at which the pressure is measured. In an apparatus such as that shown in the figure, the pressure is known at the tube exit (2) and also above the fluid in the reservoir (1). However, in the entrance region of the tube, the velocity profiles are not yet fully developed. Hence the theoretical expression relating the pressure drop to the flow rate is not valid. There is, however, a method in which the Hagen-Poiseuille equation can be used, by making flow measurements in two tubes of different lengths, LA and LB; the shorter of the two tubes must be long enough so that the velocity profiles are fully developed at the exit. Then the end section of the long tube, of length L, - LA, will be a region of fully developed flow. If we knew the value of Po - 9, for this region, then we could apply the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. Show that proper combination of the mechanical energy balances, written for the sys- tems 1-2,34, and 04 gives the following expression for 9, - 9, when each viscometer has the same flow rate. where 60 = po + pgz,.

The corotational derivatives and the nonlinear viscoelastic models 58.6. Molecular theories for polymeric liquids In the first seven chapters we have considered only Newtonian fluids. The relations be- tween stresses and velocity gradients are described by Eq. 1.1-2 for simple shear flow and by Eq. 1.2-6 (or Eq. 1.2-7) for arbitrary time-dependent flows. For the Newtonian fluid, two material parameters are needed-the two coefficients of viscosity p and K- which depend on temperature, pressure, and composition, but not on the velocity gradi- ents. All gases and all liquids composed of \"small\" molecules (up to molecular weights of about 5000) are accurately described by the Newtonian fluid model. There are many fluids that are not described by Eq. 1.2-6, and these are called non- Newtonian fluids. These structurally complex fluids include polymer solutions, polymer melts, soap solutions, suspensions, emulsions, pastes, and some biological fluids. In this chapter we focus on polymeric liquids. Because they contain high-molecular-weight molecules with many internal degrees of freedom, polymer solutions and molten polymers have behavior qualitatively differ- ent from that of Newtonian fluids. Their viscosities depend strongly on the velocity gra- dients, and in addition they may display pronounced \"elastic effects.\" Also in the steady simple shear flow between two parallel plates, there are nonzero and unequal normal stresses (rxx, rYY, and T,,) that do not arise in Newtonian fluids. In 58.1 we describe some experiments that emphasize the differences between Newtonian and polymeric fluids. In dealing with Newtonian fluids the science of the measurement of viscosity is called viscomety, and in earlier chapters we have seen examples of simple flow systems that can be used as viscometers (the circular tube, the coneplate system, and coaxial cylin- ders). To characterize non-Newtonian fluids we have to measure not only the viscosity, but the normal stresses and the viscoelastic responses as well. The science of measurement of these properties is called rheometry, and the instruments are called rheometers. We treat this subject briefly in 58.2. The science of rheology includes all aspects of the study of deformation and flow of non-Hookean solids and non-Newtonian liquids. After the first two sections, which deal with experimental facts, we turn to the pre- sentation of various non-Newtonian \"models\" (that is, empirical expressions for the stress tensor) that are commonly used for describing polymeric liquids. In 58.3 we start with the generalized Newtonian models, which are relatively simple, but which can describe only the non-Newtonian viscosity (and not the viscoelastic effects). Then in s8.4 we give examples of linear viscoelastic models, which can describe the viscoelastic responses, but 232 Chapter 8 Polymeric Liquids only in flows with exceedingly small displacement gradients. Next in s8.5 we give several nonlinear viscoelastic models, and these are intended to be applicable in all flow situations. As we go from elementary to more complicated models, we enlarge the set of observed phenomena that we can describe (but also the mathematical difficulties). Finally in 58.6 there is a brief discussion about the kinetic theory approach to polymer fluid dynamics. Polymeric liquids are encountered in the fabrication of plastic objects, and as addi- tives to lubricants, foodstuffs, and inks. They represent a vast and important class of liq- uids, and many scientists and engineers must deal with them. Polymer fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and diffusion form a rapidly growing part of the subject of transport phe- nomena, and there are many textbooks,' treatises; and journals devoted to the subject. The subject has also been approached from the kinetic theory standpoint, and molecular theories of the subject have contributed much to our understanding of the mechanical, thermal, and diffusional behavior of these fluids3 Finally, for those interested in the his- tory of the subject, the reader is referred to the book by Tanner and Waltem4 8.1 EXAMPLES OF THE BEHAVIOR OF POLYMERIC LIQUIDS In this section we discuss several experiments that contrast the flow behavior of New- tonian and polymeric fluids.' Steady-State Laminar Flow in Circular Tubes Even for the steady-state, axial, laminar flow in circular tubes, there is an important dif- ference between the behavior of Newtonian liquids and that of polymeric liquids. For Newtonian liquids the velocity distribution, average velocity, and pressure drop are given by Eqs. 2.3-18,2.3-20, and 2.3-21, respectively. For polymeric liquids, experimental data suggest that the following equations are reasonable: where n is a positive parameter characterizing the fluid, usually with a value less than unity. That is, the velocity profile is more blunt than it is for the Newtonian fluid, for which n = 1. It is further found experimentally that The pressure drop thus increases much less rapidly with the mass flow rate than for Newtonian fluids, for which the relation is linear. A. S.

The symbols @ (Newtonian liquid) and @ (polymeric liquid) are used in this and the next six figures. In Fig. 8.1-1 we show typical velocity profiles for laminar flow of Newtonian and polymeric fluids for the same maximum velocity. This simple experiment suggests that the polymeric fluids have a viscosity that depends on the velocity gradient. This point will be elaborated on in s8.3. For laminar flow in tubes of noncircular cross section, polymeric liquids exhibit sec- ondary flows superposed on the axial motion. Recall that for turbulent Newtonian flows secondary flows are also observed-in Fig. 5.1-2 it is shown that the fluid moves toward the corners of the conduit and then back in toward the center. For laminar flow of poly- meric fluids, the secondary flows go in the opposite direction-from the corners of the conduit and then back toward the walls.' In turbulent flows the secondary flows result from inertial effects, whereas in the flow of polymers the secondary flows are associated with the \"normal stresses.\" Recoil after Cessation of Steady-State Flow in a Circular Tube We start with a fluid at rest in a circular tube and, with a syringe, we \"draw\" a dye line radially in the fluid as shown in Fig. 8.1-2. Then we pump the fluid and watch the dye def~rrn.~ For a Newtonian fluid the dye line deforms into a continuously stretching parabola. If the pump is turned off, the dye parabola stops moving. After some time diffusion oc- curs and the parabola begins to get fuzzy, of course. For a polymeric liquid the dye line deforms into a curve that is more blunt than a parabola (see Eq. 8.1-1). If the pump is stopped and the fluid is not axially constrained, the fluid will begin to \"recoil\" and will retreat from this maximum stretched shape; that - Pumping stopped here Fig. 8.1-2.

Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech., 39,217-237 (1991). For the details of this experiment see N. N. Kapoor, M.S. thesis, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (1964), as well as A. G. Fredrickson, Principles and Applications of Rheology, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. (1964), p. 120. 234 Chapter 8 Polymeric Liquids is, the fluid snaps back somewhat like a rubber band. However, whereas a rubber band returns to its original shape, the fluid retreats only part way toward its original configu- ration. If we permit ourselves an anthropomorphism, we can say that a rubber band has \"perfect memory,\" since it returns to its initial unstressed state. The polymeric fluid, on the other hand, has a \"fading memory,\" since it gradually \"forgets\" its original state. That is, as it recoils, its memory becomes weaker and weaker. Fluid recoil is a manifestation of elasticity, and any complete description of poly- meric fluids must be able to incorporate the idea of elasticity into the expression for the stress tensor. The theory must also include the notion of fading memory. \"Normal Stress\" Effects Other striking differences in the behavior of Newtonian and polymeric liquids appear in the \"normal stress\" effects. The reason for this nomenclature will be given in the next section. A rotating rod in a beaker of a Newtonian fluid causes the fluid to undergo a tan- gential motion. At steady state, the fluid surface is lower near the rotating rod. Intu- itively we know that this comes about because the centrifugal force causes the fluid to move radially toward the beaker wall. For a polymeric liquid, on the other hand, the fluid moves toward the rotating rod, and, at steady state, the fluid surface is as shown in Fig. 8.1-3. This phenomenon is called the Weissenberg rod-climbing effect.4 Evidently some kinds of forces are induced that cause the polymeric liquid to behave in a way that is qualitatively different from that of a Newtonian liquid. In a closely related experiment, we can put a rotating disk on the surface of a fluid in a cylindrical container as shown in Fig. 8.1-4. If the fluid is Newtonian, the rotating disk causes the fluid to move in a tangential direction (the \"primary flow\"), but, in addition, the fluid moves slowly outward toward the cylinder wall because of the centrifugal force, then moves downward, and then back up along the cylinder axis. This superposed radial and axial flow is weaker than the primary flow and is termed a \"secondary flow.\" For a polymeric liquid, the fluid also develops a primary tangential flow with a weak ra- Fig. 8.1-3.

The secondary flows in a cylindrical container with a rotating disk at the liquid surface have the This phenomenon was first described by F. H. Garner and A. H. Nissan, Nature, 158,634-635 (1946) and by R. J. Russel, Ph.D. thesis, Imperial College, University of London (1946), p. 58. The experiment was analyzed by K. Weissenberg, Nature, 159,310-311 (1947). 8.1 Examples of the Behavior of Polymeric Liquids 235 Fig. 8.1-5. Flow down a tilted semicylindri- ) cal trough. The convexity of the polymeric dial and axial secondary flow, but the latter goes in a direction opposite to that seen in the Newtonian fluid.5 In another experiment we can let a liquid flow down a tilted, semi-cylindrical trough as shown in Fig. 8.1-5. If the fluid is Newtonian, the liquid surface is flat, except for the meniscus effects at the outer edges. For most polymeric liquids, however, the liquid surface is found to be slightly convex. The effect is small but repr~ducible.~ Some Other Experiments The operation of a simple siphon is familiar to everyone. We know from experience that, if the fluid is Newtonian, the removal of the siphon tube from the liquid means that the siphoning action ceases. However, as may be seen in Fig. 8.1-6, for polymeric liquids the siphoning can continue even when the siphon is lifted several centimeters above the liq- uid surface. This is called the tubeless siphon effect. One can also just lift some of the fluid up over the edge of the beaker and then the fluid will flow upward along the inside of the beaker and then down the outside until the beaker is nearly empty.7 In another experiment a long cylindrical rod, with its axis in the z direction, is made to oscillate back and forth in the x direction with the axis parallel to the z axis (see Fig. Fig. 8.1-6. Siphoning continues to occur when the tube is raised above the surface of a polymeric liquid, but not so for a - \\ Newtonian liquid.

The \"acoustical streaming\" near a laterally oscillating rod, show- ing that the induced secondary flow goes in the opposite directions for Newtonian and polymeric fluids. 8.1-7). In a Newtonian fluid, a secondary flow is induced whereby the fluid moves to- ward the cylinder from above and below (i.e., from the +y and -y directions, and moves away to the left and right (i.e., toward the -x and +x direction). For the polymeric liquid, however, the induced secondary motion is in the opposite direction: the fluid moves in- ward from the left and right along the x axis and outward in the up and down directions along the y axk8 The preceding examples are only a few of many interesting experiments that have been performed.9 The polymeric behavior can be illustrated easily and inexpensively with a 0.5% aqueous solution of polyethylene oxide. There are also some fascinating effects that occur when even tiny quantities of poly- mers are present. The most striking of these is the phenomenon of drag reduction.1° With only parts per million of some polymers (\"drag-reducing agents\"), the friction loss in turbulent pipe flow may be lowered dramatically-by 30-50%. Such polymeric drag- reducing agents are used by fire departments to increase the flow of water, and by oil companies to lower the costs for pumping crude oil over long distances. For discussions of other phenomena that arise in polymeric fluids, the reader should consult the summary articles in Annual Review of Fluid ~echanics.~' 98.2 RHEOMETRY AND MATERIAL FUNCTIONS The experiments described in 38.1 make it abundantly clear that polymeric liquids do not obey Newton's law of viscosity. In this section we discuss several simple, control- lable flows in which the stress components can be measured. From these experiments one can measure a number of material functions that describe the mechanical response of complex fluids. Whereas incompressible Newtonian fluids are described by only one material constant (the viscosity), one can measure many different material functions for non-Newtonian liquids. Here we show how a few of the more commonly used material C. F. Chang and W. R. Schowalter, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech., 6,4747 (1979). The book by D. V. Boger and K. Walters, Rheological Phenomena in Focus, Elsevier, Amsterdam (1993), contains many photographs of fluid behavior in a variety of non-Newtonian flow systems. 'O This is sometimes called the Toms phenomenon, since it was perhaps first reported in B. A. Toms, Proc. Int. Congress on Rheology, North-Holland, Amsterdam (1949). The phenomenon has also been studied in connection with the drag-reducing nature of fish slime [T. L. Daniel, Biol. Bull., 160,376-382 (1981)], which is thought to explain, at least in part, \"Gray's paradoxu-the fact that fish seem to be able to swim faster than energy considerations permit. \" For example, M. M. Denn, Ann. Rev. Fluid Mech., 22,1334 (1990); E. S. G. Shaqfeh, Ann. Rev. Fluid Mech., 28,129-185 (1996); G. G. Fuller, Ann. Rev. Fluid Mech., 22,387417 (1992). 58.2 Rheometry and Material Functions 237 functions are defined and measured. Information about the actual measurement equip- ment and other material functions can be found e1sewhere.l~~ It is assumed throughout this chapter that the polymeric liquids can be regarded as incompressible. Steady Simple Shear Flow We consider now the steady shear flow between a pair of parallel plates, where the ve- locity profile is given by vx = jy, the other velocity components being zero (see Fig. 8.2- 1). The quantity y, here taken to be positive, is called the \"shear rate.\" For a Newtonian fluid the shear stress ryx is given by Eq. 1.1-2, and the normal stresses (rxx, r,,, and r,,) are all zero. For incompressible non-Newtonian fluids, the normal stresses are nonzero and un- equal. For these fluids it is conventional to define three material functions as follows: in which 7 is the non-Newtonian viscosity, q1 is the first normal stress coefficient, and q2 is the second normal stress coefficient. These three quantities-7, TI, q2-are all functions of the shear rate y. For many polymeric liquids q may decrease by a factor of as much as lo4 as the shear rate increases. Similarly, the normal stress coefficients may decrease by a factor of as much as lo7 over the usual range of shear rates. For polymeric fluids made up of flexible macromolecules, the functions q( j) and q,(y) have been found experimentally to be positive, whereas !P,(y) is almost always negative. It can be shown that for positive TI($ the fluid behaves as though it were under tension in the flow (or X) direction, and that the negative !P,(y) means that the fluid is under tension in the transverse (or z) direction. For the Newtonian fluid 7 = p, V, = 0, and q2 = 0. The strongly shear-ratedependent non-Newtonian viscosity is connected with the behavior given in Eqs. 8.1-1 to 3, as is shown in the next section. The positive 9, is pri- marily responsible for the Weissenberg rod-climbing effect. Because of the tangential flow, there is a tension in the tangential direction, and this tension pulls the fluid toward the rotating rod, overcoming the centrifugal force. The secondary flows in the disk-and- cylinder experiment (Fig. 8.1-4) can also be explained qualitatively in terms of the posi- tive !PI. Also, the negative !P2 can be shown to explain the convex surface shape in the tilted-trough experiment (Fig. 8.1-5). Uvver date moves at a constant meed II I I t Fig. 8.2-1.

Many ingenious devices have been developed to measure the three material func- tions for steady shearing flow, and the theories needed for the use of the instruments are explained in detail el~ewhere.~ See Problem 8C.1 for the use of the cone-and-plate instru- ment for measuring the material functions. Small-Amplitude Oscillatory Motion A standard method for measuring the elastic response of a fluid is the small-amplitude oscillatory shear experiment, depicted in Fig. 8.2-2. Here the top plate moves back and forth in sinusoidal fashion, and with a tiny amplitude. If the plate spacing is extremely small and the fluid has a very high viscosity, then the velocity profile will be nearly lin- ear, so that v,(y, t) = joy cos ot, in which jO, a real quantity, gives the amplitude of the shear rate excursion. The shear stress required to maintain the oscillatory motion will also be periodic in time and, in general, of the form T~~ = - q' yo cos of - q\"jO sin wt (8.2-4) in which 77' and q\" are the components of the complex viscosity, q* = q' - iq\", which is a function of the frequency. The first (in-phase) term is the \"viscous response,\" and the second (out-of-phase) term is the \"elastic response.\" Polymer chemists use the curves of q'(w) and q\"(o) (or the storage and loss moduli, G' = q\"w and G = q'o) for \"characteriz- ing\" polymers, since much is known about the connection between the shapes of these curves and the chemical str~cture.~ For the Newtonian fluid, q' = p and 77'' = 0. Steady-State Elongational Flow A third experiment that can be performed involves the stretching of the fluid, in which the velocity distribution is given by v, = I:z, v, = -$Ex, and vy = -$4y (see Fig. 8.2-31, where the positive quantity I: is called the \"elongation rate.\" Then the relation defines the elongational viscosity 7, which depends on I:. When I: is negative, the flow is referred to as biaxial stretching. For the Newtonian fluid it can be shown that 7 = 3p, and this is sometimes called the \"Trouton viscosity.\" < Fig. 8.2-3.

Other tests include stress relaxation after cessation of flow, stress growth at the inception of flow, recoil, and creep-each of which can be performed in shear, elongation, and other types of flow. Each experiment results in the definition of one or more material functions. These can be used for fluid characterization and also for determining the empirical constants in the models described in gs8.3 to 8.5.

One might say, very roughly, that these three sections satisfy three different groups of people: s8.3 The generalized Newtonian models are primarily used to describe steady-state shear flows and have been widely used by engineers for designing flow systems. 58.4 The linear viscoelastic models are primarily used to describe unsteady-state flows in systems with very small displacement gradients and have been used mainly by chemists interested in understanding polymer structure. 58.5 The nonlinear viscoelastic models represent an attempt to describe all types of flow (including the two listed above) and have been developed largely by physicists and applied mathematicians interested in finding an all-inclusive theory. Actually the three classes of models are interrelated, and each is important for understand- ing the subject of non-Newtonian flow. In the following discussion of non-Newtonian models, we assume throughout that the fluids are incompressible. The generalized Newtonian models1 discussed here are the simplest of the three types of models to be discussed. However, they can describe only the non-Newtonian viscosity, and none of the normal stress effects, time-dependent effects, or elastic effects. Nonethe- R. B. Bird, R. C. Armstrong, and 0.

Oldroyd, Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., 45,595-611 (1949), and 47,410-418 (1950). James Gardner Oldroyd (1921-1982), a professor at the University of Liverpool, made many contributions to the theory of non-Newtonian fluids, in particular his ideas on the construction of constitutive equations and the principles of continuum mechanics. 58.3 Non-Newtonian Viscosity and the Generalized Newtonian Models 241 less, in many processes in the polymer industry, such as pipe flow with heat transfer, dis- tributor design, extrusion, and injection molding, the non-Newtonian viscosity and its enormous variation with shear rate are central to describing the flows of interest. For incompressible Newtonian fluids the expression for the stress tensor is given by Eq. 1.2-7 with the last term omitted: in which we have introduced the symbol j = Vv + (VV)~, the rate-of-strain tensor (or rate- of-deformation tensor). The generalized Newtonian fluid model is obtained by simply re- placing the constant viscosity p by the non-Newtonian viscosity v, a function of the shear rate, which in general can be written as the \"magnitude of the rate-of-strain tensor\" j = m; it is understood that when the square root is taken, the sign must be so chosen that j is a positive quantity. Then the generalized Newtonian fluid model is The components of the rate-of-strain tensor j can be obtained in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates from the right sides of the equations in Table B.l by omitting the (V . V) terms as well as the factor (-p) in the remaining terms. We now have to give an empiricism for the non-Newtonian viscosity function r](j). Dozens of such expressions have been proposed, but we mention only two here: (a) The simplest empiricism for ~(j) is the two-parameter power law expression:2 in which m and n are constants characterizing the fluid. This simple relation describes the non-Newtonian viscosity curve over the linear portion of the log-log plot of the vis- cosity versus shear rate for many materials (see, for example, the viscosity data in Fig. 8.2-4). The parameter m has units of Pa sn, and n - 1 is the slope of the log r] vs. log j plot. Some sample values of power law parameters are given in Table 8.3-1. Although the power law model was proposed as an empirical expression, it will be seen in Eq. 8.6-11 that a simple molecular theory leads to a power law expression for high shear rates, with n = i.

Some sample parameters for the Carreau model are given in Table 8.3-2. We now give some examples of how to use the power law model. These are exten- sions of problems discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 for Newtonian fluid^.^ Derive the expression for the mass flow rate of a polymer liquid, described by the power law model. The fluid is flowing in a long circular tube of radius R and length L, as a result of a pressure difference, gravity, or both. SOLUTION Equation 2.3-13 gives the shear stress distribution for any fluid in developed steady flow in a circular tube. Into this expression we have to insert the shear stress for the power law fluid (instead of using Eq. 2.3-14). This expression may be obtained from Eqs. 8.3-2 and 3 above. Since v, is ostulated to be a function of v alone, from Eq. B.l-13 we find that j = = dwe have to choose the sign for the square root so that j will be positive.

When this is integrated over the cross section of the circular tube we get which simplifies to the Hagen-Poiseuille law for Newtonian fluids (Eq. 2.3-21) when n = 1 and rn = p.

Equation 8.3-22 can be used along with torque versus angular velocity data to determine the power law parameters rn and n. 58.4 ELASTICITY AND THE LINEAR VISCOELASTIC MODELS Just after Eq. 1.2-3, in the discussion about generalizing Newton's \"law of viscosity,\" we specifically excluded time derivatives and time integrals in the construction of a linear expression for the stress tensor in terms of the velocity gradients. In this section, we s8.4 Elasticity and the Linear Viscoelastic ModeIs 245 allow for the inclusion of time derivatives or time integrals, but still require a linear rela- tion between T and j. This leads to linear viscoelastic models. We start by writing Newton's expression for the stress tensor for an incompressible viscous liquid along with Hooke's analogous expression for the stress tensor for an in- compressible elastic solid:' Newton: Hooke: In the second of these expressions G is the elastic modulus, and u is the \"displacement vector,\" which gives the distance and direction that a point in the solid has moved from its initial position as a result of the applied stresses. The quantity y is called the \"infini- tesimal strain tensor.\" The rate-of-strain tensor and the infinitesimal strain tensor are re- lated by j = dy /dt. The Hookean solid has a perfect memory; when imposed stresses are removed, the solid returns to its initial configuration. Hooke's law is valid only for very small displacement gradients, Vu. Now we want to combine the ideas embodied in Eqs. 8.4-1 and 2 to describe viscoelastic fluids. The Maxwell Model The simplest equation for describing a fluid that is both viscous and elastic is the follow- ing Maxwell model:' Here A, is a time constant (the relaxation time) and 17, is the zero shear rate viscosity. When the stress tensor changes imperceptibly with time, then Eq. 8.4-3 has the form of Eq. 8.4-1 for a Newtonian liquid. When there are very rapid changes in the stress ten- sor with time, then the first term on the left side of Eq. 8.4-3 can be omitted, and when the equation is integrated with respect to time, we get an equation of the form of Eq. 8.4-2 for the Hookean solid. In that sense, Eq. 8.4-3 incorporates both viscosity and elasticity. A simple experiment that illustrates the behavior of a viscoelastic liquid involves \"silly putty.\" This material flows easily when squeezed slowly between the palms of the hands, and this indicates that it is a viscous fluid. However, when it is rolled into a ball, the ball will bounce when dropped onto a hard surface. During the impact the stresses change rapidly, and the material behaves as an elastic solid. The Jeffreys Model The Maxwell model of Eq. 8.4-3 is a linear relation between the stresses and the velocity gradients, involving a time derivative of the stresses. One could also include a time de- rivative of the velocity gradients and still have a linear relation: R. Hooke, Lectures de Potentia Restifutiva (1678). * This relation was proposed by J. C. Maxwell, Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., A157,49-88 (18671, to investigate the possibility that gases might be viscoelastic. 246 Chapter 8 Polymeric Liquids This Jeffreys modep contains three constants: the zero shear rate viscosity and two time constants (the constant A, is called the retardation time). One could clearly add terms containing second, third, and higher derivatives of the stress and rate-of-strain tensors with appropriate multiplicative constants, to get a still more general linear relation among the stress and rate-of-strain tensors. This gives greater flexibility in fitting experimental data. The Generalized Maxwell Model Another way of generalizing Maxwell's original idea is to \"superpose\" equations of the form of Eq. 8.4-3 and write the generalized Maxwell model as m d ~(t) = ~~(t) where TL + A* ;ji h = -7ky (8.4-5/61 k= 1 in which there are many relaxation times A, (with A, r A, 2 A,. . .) and many constants qk with dimensions of viscosity. Much is known about the constants in this model from polymer molecular theories and the extensive experiments that have been done on poly- meric liq~ids.~ The total number of parameters can be reduced to three by using the following em- pirical expression^:^ in which 7, is the zero shear rate viscosity, A is a time constant, and a is a dimensionless constant (usually between 1.5 and 4). Since Eq. 8.4-6 is a linear differential equation, it can be integrated analytically, with the condition that the fluid is at rest at t = - w. Then when the various lk are summed according to Eq. 8.4-5, we get the integral form of the generalized Maxwell model: In this form, the \"fading memory\" idea is clearly present: the stress at time t depends on the velocity gradients at all past times t', but, because of the exponentials in the inte- grand, greatest weight is given to times t' that are near t; that is, the fluid \"memory\" is better for recent times than for more remote times in the past. The quantity within braces { 1 is called the relaxation modulus of the fluid and is denoted by G(t - t'). The integral ex- This model was suggested by H. Jeffreys, The Earth, Cambridge University Press, 1st edition (1924), and 2nd edition (1929), p. 265, to describe the propagation of waves in the earth's mantle. The parameters in this model have been related to the structure of suspensions and emulsions by H. Frohlich and R. Sack, Proc. Roy. Soc., A185,415430 (1946) and by J. G. Oldroyd, Proc. Roy. Soc., AZ18,122-132 (19531, respectively. Another interpretation of Eq. 8.4-4 is to regard it as the sum of a Newtonian solvent contribution (s) and a polymer contribution (p), the latter being described by a Maxwell model: a T,= -q,y; T,+A,-T,= -7j at P (8.4-4a, b) so that T = T, + T~. Then if Eqs. 8.4-4a, 8.4-4b, and A, times the time derivative of Eq. 8.4-4a are added, we get the Jeffreys model of Eq. 8.44, with 7, = q, + qp and A, = (%/(q, + ?,))A,. * J. D.

The Maxwell, Jeffreys, and generalized Maxwell models are all examples of linear viscoelastic models, and their use is restricted to motions with very small displacement gradients. Polymeric liquids have many internal degrees of freedom and therefore many relaxation times are needed to describe their linear response. For this reason, the general- ized Maxwell model has been widely used for interpreting experimental data on linear viscoelasticity. By fitting Eq. 8.4-9 to experimental data one can determine the relaxation function G(t - t'). One can then relate the shapes of the relaxation functions to the mole- cular structure of the polymer. In this way a sort of \"mechanical spectroscopy\" is devel- oped, which can be used to investigate structure via linear viscoelastic measurements (such as the complex viscosity). Models describing flows with very small displacement gradients might seem to have only limited interest to engineers. However, an important reason for studying them is that some background in linear viscoelasticity helps us in the study of nonlinear vis- coelasticity, where flows with large displacement gradients are discussed. Obtain an expression for the components of the complex viscosity by using the generalized Maxwell model. The system is described in Fig. 8.2-2. Small-Amplitude Oscillatory Motion We use the yx-component of Eq. 8.4-9, and for this problem the yx-component of the rate-of- strain tensor is dux j,,(t) = - = jU cos wt dY where w is the angular frequency. When this is substituted into Eq. 8.4-9, with the relaxation modulus (in braces) expressed as G(t - t'), we get t T, = -I-= G(t - t')? cos wt'dt' G(s) sin ws ds sin wt I (8.4-1 1) in which s = t - t'. When this equation is compared with Eq. 8.2-4, we obtain for the components of the complex viscosity r]* = r]' - iq\". When the generalized Maxwell ex- pression for the relaxation modulus is introduced and the integrals are evaluated, we find that If the empiricisms in Eqs. 8.4-7 and 8 are used, it can be shown that both r]' and 7\" decrease as 1 /w~-(~/4 at very high frequencies (see Fig. 8.2-4). 248 Chapter 8 Polymeric Liquids Extend Example 4.1-3 to viscoelastic fluids, using the Maxwell model, and obtain the attenua- tion and phase shift in the \"periodic steady state.\" Unsteady Viscoelastic FZOW ~ebr an Oscillating Plate SOLUTION For the postulated shearing flow, the equation of motion, written in terms of the stress tensor component gives The Maxwell model in integral form is like Eq. 8.4-9, but with a single exponential: Combining these two equations, we get d2v,(y, tr) p 2 = (Im {z exp[-(t - ~Y/A,I I dt' As in Example 4.1-3 we postulate a solution of the form where vO(y) is complex. Substituting this into Eq. 8.4-19, we get Removing the real operator then gives an equation for vO(y) Then if the complex quantity in the brackets [ I is set equal to (a + i~)', the solution to the dif- ferential equation is Multiplying this by eimt and taking the real part gives This result has the same form as that in Eq. 4.1-57, but the quantities a and /3 depend on fre- quency: That is, with increasing frequency, a decreases and /3 increases, because of the fluid elasticity. This result shows how elasticity affects the transmission of shear waves near an oscillating surface. s8.5 The Corotational Derivatives and the Nonlinear Viscoelastic Models 249 Note that there is an important difference between the problems in the last two ex- amples. In Example 8.4-1 the velocity profile is prescribed, and we have derived an ex- pression for the shear stress required to maintain the motion; the equation of motion was not used. In Example 8.4-2 no assumption was made about the velocity distribution, and we derived the velocity distribution by using the equation of motion. 58.5 THE COROTATIONAL DERIVATIVES AND THE NONLINEAR VISCOELASTIC MODELS In the previous section it was shown that the inclusion of time derivatives (or time inte- grals) in the stress tensor expression allows for the description of elastic effects. The lin- ear viscoelastic models can describe the complex viscosity and the transmission of small-amplitude shearing waves. It can also be shown that the linear models can de- scribe elastic recoil, although the results are restricted to flows with negligible displace- ment gradients (and hence of little practical interest). In this section we introduce the hypothesis',2 that the relation between the stress ten- sor and the kinematic tensors at a fluid particle should be independent of the instanta- neous orientation of that particle in space. This seems like a reasonable hypothesis; if you measure the stress-strain relation in a rubber band, it should not matter whether you are stretching the rubber band in the north-south direction or the east-west direc- tion, or even rotating as you take data (provided, of course, that you do not rotate so rapidly that centrifugal forces interfere with the measurements). One way to implement the above hypothesis is to introduce at each fluid particle a corotating coordinate frame. This orthogonal frame rotates with the local instantaneous angular velocity as it moves along with the fluid particle through space (see Fig. 8.5-1). In the corotating coordinate system we can now write down some kind of relation \\ Fluid particle at time t Fluid particle trajectory Fig. 8.5-1.

Gustaf Andreas Johannes Jaumann (1863-1924) (pronounced \"Yow-mahn\") who taught at the German university in Briinn (now Brno), for whom the \"Jaumann derivative\" is named, was an important contributor to the field of continuum mechanics at the beginning of the twentieth century; he was the first to give the equation of change for entropy, including the \"entropy flux\" and the \"rate of entropy production\" (see s24.1).

In Eq. 8.5-1 the constants A,, A,, p,, p,, and p, all have dimensions of time. Since the equations of continuity and motion are written for the usual xyz-coordinate frame, fixed in space, it seems reasonable to transform Eq. 8.5-1 from the 492 frame into the xyz frame. This is a purely mathematical problem, which was worked out long ago,' and the solution is well known. It can be shown that the partial time derivatives d/dt, d2/dt2, . . . are changed into corotational (or Jaumann14) time derivatives 9/%, 912/9t', . .. The corotational time derivative of a second-order tensor is defined as in which w = Vv - (Vv)+ is the vorticity tensor, and D/Dt is the substantial time deriva- tive defined in 53.5. The tensor dot products appearing in Eq. 8.5-1, with components in the f 92 frame, transform into the corresponding dot products, with the components given in the xyz frame. When transformed into the xyz frame, Eq. 8.5-1 becomes which is the Oldroyd 6-constant model. This model, then, has no dependence on the local instantaneous orientation of the fluid particles in space. It should be emphasized that Eq. 8.5-3 is an empirical model; the use of the corotating frame guarantees only that the in- stantaneous local rotation of the fluid has been \"subtracted off.\" With proper choice of these parameters most of the observed phenomena in poly- mer fluid dynamics can be described qualitatively. As a result this model has been widely used in exploratory fluid dynamics calculations. A 3-constant simplification of Eq. 8.5-3 with F~ = Alf p2 = hZf and p, = 0 is called the Oldroyd-B model. In Example 8.5-1 we show what Eq. 8.5-3 gives for the material functions defined in 58.2. Another nonlinear viscoelastic model is the 3-constant Giesekus model,\" which con- tains a term that is quadratic in the stress components: Here h is a time constant, v0 is the zero shear rate viscosity, and a is a dimensionless pa- rameter. This model gives reasonable shapes for most material functions, and the analyt- ical expressions for them are summarized in Table 8.5-1. Because of the (7 .T) term, they J. D. Goddard and C.

Then with the definitions of the material functions in 98.2, we can obtain The model thus gives a shear-rate-dependent viscosity as well as shear-rate-dependent normal- stress coefficients. (For the Oldroyd-B model the viscosity and normal-stress coefficients are independent of the shear rate.) For most polymers the non-Newtonian viscosity decreases with the shear rate, and for such fluids we conclude that 0 < a2 < u,. Moreover, since mea- sured values of always increase monotonically with shear rate, we also require that u2 > $u1. Although the model gives shear-rate-dependent viscosity and normal stresses, the shapes of the curves are not in satisfactory agreement with experimental data over a wide range of shear rates. If p1 < Al and p2 < A2, the second normal-stress coefficient has the opposite sign of the first normal-stress coefficient, in agreement with the data for most polymeric liquids. Since the second normal-stress coefficient is much smaller than the first for many fluids and in some flows plays a negligible role, setting p, = A, and p2 = A2 may be reasonable, thereby re- ducing the number of parameters from 6 to 4. This discussion shows how to evaluate a proposed empirical model by comparing the model predictions with experimental data obtained in rheometric experiments. We have also seen that the experimental data may necessitate restrictions on the parameters. Clearly this is a tremendous task, but it is not unlike the problem that the thermodynamicist faces in devel- oping empirical equations of state for mixtures, for example. The rheologist, however, is deal- ing with tensor equations, whereas the thermodynamicist is concerned only with scalar equations. (c) For small-amplitude oscillatoy motion the nonlinear terms in Eqs. 8.5-5 to 8 may be omitted, and the material functions are the same as those obtained from the Jeffreys model of linear viscoelasticity: For 7' to be a monotone decreasing function of the frequency and for q\" to be positive (as seen in all experiments), we have to require that A, < A,. Here again, the model gives qualitatively correct results, but the shapes of the curves are not correct. (d) For the steady elongational flow defined in 98.2, the Oldroyd 6-constant model gives Since, for most polymers, the slope of the elongational viscosity versus elongation rate curve is positive at L. = 0, we must require that p1 > p2. Equation 8.5-14 predicts that the elonga- tional viscosity may become infinite at some finite value of the elongation rate; this may pos- sibly present a problem in fiber-stretching calculations. Note that the time constants A, and A, do not appear in the expression for elongational vis- cosity, whereas the constants po, pl, and p2 do not enter into the components of the complex viscosity in Eqs. 8.5-14 and 15. This emphasizes the fact that a wide range of rheometric experi- ments is necessary for determining the parameters in an empirical expression for the stress tensor. To put it in another way, various experiments emphasize different parts of the model. $8.6 Molecular Theories for Polymeric Liquids 253 58.6 MOLECULAR THEORIES FOR POLYMERIC LIQUIDS'~~ It should be evident from the previous section that proposing and testing empirical expressions for the stress tensor in nonlinear viscoelasticity is a formidable task. Recall that, in turbulence, seeking empirical expressions for the Reynolds stress tensor is equally daunting. However, in nonlinear viscoelasticity we have the advantage that we can narrow the search for stress tensor expressions considerably by using molecular theory. Although the kinetic theory of polymers is considerably more complicated than the kinetic theory of gases, it nonetheless guides us in suggesting possible forms for the stress tensor. However, the constants appearing in the molecular expressions must still be determined from rheometric measurements. The kinetic theories for polymers can be divided roughly into two classes: network theories and single-molecule theories: a. The network theories3 were originally developed for describing the mechanical properties of rubber. One imagines that the polymer molecules in the rubber are joined chemically during vulcanization. The theories have been extended to describe molten polymers and concentrated solutions by postulating an ever-changing network in which the junction points are temporary, formed by adjacent strands that move together for a while and then gradually pull apart (see Fig. 8.6-1). It is necessary in the theory to make some empirical statements about the rates of formation and rupturing of the junctions. b. The single-molecule theories1 were originally designed for describing the poly- mer molecules in a very dilute solution, where polymer-polymer interactions are infre- quent. The molecule is usually represented by means of some kind of \"bead spring\" model, a series of small spheres connected by linear or nonlinear springs in such a way as to represent the molecular architecture; the bead spring model is then allowed to move about in the solvent, with the beads experiencing a Stokes' law drag force by the solvent as well as being buffeted about by Brownian motion (see Fig. 8.6-2a). Then from the kinetic theory one obtains the \"distribution function\" for the orientations of the mol- ecules (modeled as bead spring structures); once this function is known, various macro- scopic properties can be calculated. The same kind of theory may be applied to concentrated solutions and molten polymers by examining the motion of a single bead spring model in the \"mean force field\" exerted by the surrounding molecules. That is, Fig. 8.6-1. Portion of a polymer network formed by \"temporary junctions,\" indi- cated here by circles. R. B. Bird, C. F. Curtiss, R. C. Armstrong, and 0.

In the dilute solution, the polymer molecule can move about in all directions through the solvent. In the undiluted polymer, a typical polymer mole- cule (black beads) is constrained by the surround- ing molecules and tends to execute snakelike motion (\"reptation\") by sliding back and forth along its backbone direction. because of the proximity of the surrounding molecules, it is easier for the \"beads\" of the model to move in the direction of the polymer chain backbone than perpendicular to it. In other words, the polymer finds itself executing a sort of snakelike motion, called \"rep- tation\" (see Fig. 8.6-2b). As an illustration of the kinetic theory approach we discuss the results for a simple system: a dilute solution of a polymer, modeled as an elastic dumbbell consisting of two beads connected by a spring. We take the spring to be nonlinear and finitely extensible, with the force in the connecting spring being given by4 in which His a spring constant, Q is the end-to-end vector of the dumbbell representing the stretching and orientation of the dumbbell, and Qo is the maximum elongation of the spring. The friction coefficient for the motion of the beads through the solvent is given by Stokes' law as 6 = 6.rr7,a, where a is the bead radius and 7, is the solvent viscosity. Al- though this model is greatly oversimplified, it does embody the key physical ideas of molecular orientation, molecular stretching, and finite extensibility. When the details of the kinetic theory are worked out, one gets the following expres- sion for the stress tensor, written as the sum of a Newtonian solvent and a polymer con- tribution (see fn. 3 in ~8.4):~ Here where n is the number density of polymer molecules (i.e., dumbbells), A, = 5/4H is a time constant (typically between 0.01 and 10 seconds), Z = 1 + (3/b)[l - (tr T~/~~KT)], and b = HQ~/KT is the finite extensibility parameter, usually between 10 and 100.

Thus the molecular the- ory suggests the form of the stress tensor expression, and the rheometric data are used to determine the values of the parameters. The model described by Eqs. 8.6-2, 3, and 4 is called the FENE-P model (finitely extensible nonlinear elastic model, in the Peterlin ap- proximation) in which (Q/Qo)' in Eq. 8.6-1 is replaced by (Q2)/Qi. This model is more difficult to work with than the Oldroyd 6-constant model, be- cause it is nonlinear in the stresses. However, it gives better shapes for some of the mate- rial functions. Also, since we are dealing here with a molecular model, we can get information about the molecular stretching and orientation after a flow problem has been solved. For example, it can be shown that the average molecular stretching is given by (Q')/Q; = 1 - Z-I where the angular brackets indicate a statistical average. The following examples illustrate how one obtains the material functions for the model and compares the results with experimental data. If the model is acceptable, then it must be combined with the equations of continuity and motion to solve interesting flow problems. This requires large-scale computing. Obtain the material functions for the steady-state shear flow and the steady-state elongational flow of a polymer described by the FENE-P model. Material Functions for the FENE-P Model SOLUTION (a) For steady-state shear flow the model gives the following equations for the nonvanishing components of the poIymer contribution to the stress tensor: Here the quantity Z is given by These equations can be combined to give a cubic equation for the dimensionless shear stress contribution Tvx = %,/3n~T in which p = (b/54) + (1/18) and q = (b/108)hHy.

From Eq. 8.6-9 we find for the limiting values of the viscosity For y = 0: For j+ m: Hence, at high shear rates one obtains a power law behavior (Eq. 8.3-3) with n = i. This can be taken as a molecular justification for use of the power law model. K.

Why do we deal only with differences in normal stresses for incompressible liquids (see Eqs. 8.2-2 and 3)? In Fig. 8.2-2 the postulated velocity profile is linear in y. What would you expect the velocity distribution to look like if the gap between the plates were not small and the fluid had a very low viscosity? How is the parameter n in Eq. 8.3-3 related to the parameter n in Eq. 8.3-4? How is it related to the slope of the non-Newtonian velocity curve from the dumbbell kinetic theory model in @.6? What limitations have to be placed on use of the generalized Newtonian models and the lin- ear viscoelastic models? Compare and contrast Examples 8.4-1 and 2 regarding the geometry of the flow system and the assumptions regarding the velocity profiles. To what extent does the Oldroyd model in Eq. 8.5-3 include a generalized Newtonian model and a linear viscoelastic model? Can the Oldroyd model describe effects that are not de- scribed by these other models? Why is it necessary to put restrictions on the parameters in the Oldroyd model? What is the relation between these restrictions and the subject of rheometry? What advantages do molecular expressions for the stress tensor have over the empirical ex- pressions? For what kinds of industrial problems would you use the various kinds of models described in this chapter? Why may the power law model be unsatisfactory for describing the axial flow in an annulus? PROBLEMS 8A.1 Flow of a polyisoprene solution in a pipe. A 13.5% (by weight) solution of polyisoprene in isopentane has the following power law parameters at 323 K: n = 0.2 and rn = 5 X lo3 Pa. sn. It is being pumped (in laminar flow) through a horizontal pipe that has a length of 10.2 m and an internal diameter of 1.3 cm.

For thick suspensions and pastes it is found that no flow oc- curs until a certain critical stress, the yield stress, is reached, and then the fluid flows in such a way that part of the stream is in \"plug flow.\" The simplest model of a fluid with a yield value is the Bingham model: r when r 5 TO 70 when r 2 TO Y in which r0 is the yield stress, the stress below which no flow occurs, and po is a parameter with units of viscosity. The quantity r = is the magnitude of the stress tensor. Find the mass flow rate in a slit for the Bingham fluid (see Problem 2B.3 and Example 8.3-2). The expression for the shear stress r,, as a function of position x in Eq. 2B.3-1 can be taken over here, since it does not depend on the type of fluid.

Stress relaxation after cessation of shear flow. A viscoelastic fluid is in steady-state flow be- tween a pair of parallel plates, with v, = yy. If the flow is suddenly stopped (i.e., y becomes zero), the stresses do not go to zero as would be the case for a Newtonian fluid.

Part Two Energy Transport This Page Intentionally Left Blank Chapter 9 Thermal Conductivity and the Mechanisms of Energy Transport Fourieis law of heat conduction (molecular energy transport) Temperature and pressure dependence of heat conductivity Theory of thermal conductivity of gases at low density Theory of thermal conductivity of liquids Thermal conductivity of solids Effective thermal conductivity of composite solids Convective transport of energy Work associated with molecular motions It is common knowledge that some materials such as metals conduct heat readily, whereas others such as wood act as thermal insulators. The physical property that de- scribes the rate at which heat is conducted is the thermal conductivity k. Heat conduction in fluids can be thought of as molecular energy transport, inasmuch as the basic mechanism is the motion of the constituent molecules. Energy can also be transported by the bulk motion of a fluid, and this is referred to as convective energy trans- port; this form of transport depends on the density p of the fluid. Another mechanism is that of difisive energy transport, which occurs in mixtures that are interdiffusing. In addi- tion, energy can be transmitted by means of radiative energy transport, which is quite dis- tinct in that this form of transport does not require a material medium as do conduction and convection. This chapter introduces the first two mechanisms, conduction and con- vection. Radiation is treated separately in Chapter 16, and the subject of diffusive heat transport arises in 519.3 and again in g24.2. We begin in 59.1 with the definition of the thermal conductivity k by Fourier's law for the heat flux vector q. In 59.2 we summarize the temperature and pressure depen- dence of k for fluids by means of the principle of corresponding states. Then in the next four sections we present information about thermal conductivities of gases, Liquids, solids, and solid composites, giving theoretical results when available. Since in Chapters 10 and 11 we will be setting up problems by using the law of con- servation of energy, we need to know not only how heat moves into and out of a system but also how work is done on or by a system by means of molecular mechanisms. The na- ture of the molecular work terms is discussed in 59.8. Finally, by combining the conduc- tive heat flux, the convective energy flux, and the work flux we can create a combined energy flux vector e, which is useful in setting up energy balances. 266 Chapter 9 Thermal Conductivity and the Mechanisms of Energy Transport 9.1 FOURIER'S LAW OF HEAT CONDUCTION (MOLECULAR ENERGY TRANSPORT) Consider a slab of solid material of area A located between two large parallel plates a distance Y apart. We imagine that initially (for time t < 0) the solid material is at a tem- perature To throughout. At t = 0 the lower plate is suddenly brought to a slightly higher temperature TI and maintained at that temperature. As time proceeds, the temperature profile in the slab changes, and ultimately a linear steady-state temperature distribution is attained (as shown in Fig. 9.1-1). When this steady-state condition has been reached, a constant rate of heat flow Q through the slab is required to maintain the temperature dif- ference AT = TI - To. It is found then that for sufficiently small values of AT the follow- ing relation holds: That is, the rate of heat flow per unit area is proportional to the temperature decrease over the distance Y. The constant of proportionality k is the thermal conductivity of the slab. Equation 9.1-1 is also valid if a liquid or gas is placed between the two plates, pro- vided that suitable precautions are taken to eliminate convection and radiation. In subsequent chapters it is better to work with the above equation in differential form. That is, we use the limiting form of Eq. 9.1-1 as the slab thickness approaches zero. The local rate of heat flow per unit area (heat flux) in the positive y direction is desig- nated by qy. In this notation Eq. 9.1-1 becomes This equation, which serves to define k, is the one-dimensional form of Fourier's law of heat cond~ction.',~ It states that the heat flux by conduction is proportional to the tempera- Solid initially at temperature To Lower plate suddenly raised to temperature TI Small t Large f Y y T(y) To Tl Fig. 9.1-1.

However, it does have a theoreti- cal basis, as discussed in Appendix D. If the temperature varies in all three directions, then we can write an equation like Eq. 9.1-2 for each of the coordinate directions: If each of these equations is multiplied by the appropriate unit vector and the equations are then added, we get which is the three-dimensional form of Fourier's law. This equation describes the molec- ular transport of heat in isotropic media. By \"isotropic\" we mean that the material has no preferred direction, so that heat is conducted with the same thermal conductivity k in all directions. Some solids, such as single noncubic crystals, fibrous materials, and laminates, are anis~tropic.~ For such substances one has to replace Eq. 9.1-6 by in which K is a symmetric second-order tensor called the thermal conductivity tensor. Thus, the heat flux vector does not point in the same direction as the temperature gra- dient. For polymeric liquids in the shearing flow v,(y, t), the thermal conductivity may increase above the equilibrium value by 20% in the x direction and decrease by 10% in the z direction. Anisotropic heat conduction in packed beds is discussed briefly in 59.6. J. B. Fourier, Thkorie analytique de la chaleur, CEuvres de Fourier, Gauthier-Villars et Fils, Paris (1822). (Baron) Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier (pronounced \"Foo-ree-ay\") (1768-1830) was not only a brilliant mathematician and the originator of the Fourier series and the Fourier transform, but also famous as an Egyptologist and a political figure (he was prefect of the province of Issre). 'Some authors prefer to write Eq. 9.1-2 in the form in which J, is the \"mechanical equivalent of heat,\" which displays explicitly the conversion of thermal units into mechanical units. For example, in the c.g.s. system one would use the following units: q,, [=I erg/cm2 - s, k [=] cal/cm s - C, T [=I C, y [=] cm, and J, [=I erg/cal. We will not use Eq. 9.1-2a in this book. Although polymeric liquids at rest are isotropic, kinetic theory suggests that when they are flowing the heat conduction is anisotropic [see B. H. A. A. van den Brule, Rheol. Acta, 28,257-266 (1989); and C. F. Curtiss and R. B. Bird, Advances in Polymer Science, 25,l-101 (1996)l. Experimental measurements for shear and elongational flows have been reported by D. C. Venerus, J. D. Schieber, H. Iddir, J. D. Guzman, and A. W. Broerman, Phys. Rev. Letters, 82,366-369 (1999); A. W. Broerman, D. C. Venerus, and J. D. Schieber, J. Chem. Phys., 111,6965-6969 (1999); H. Iddir, D. C. Venerus, and J. D. Schieber, AIChE Journal, 46,610-615 (2000). For oriented polymer solids, enhanced thermal conductiv- ity in the direction of orientation has been measured by B. Poulaert, J.-C. Chielens, C. Vandenhaende, J.-P. Issi, and R. Legras, Polymer Comm., 31,14&151(1989). In connection with the bead spring models of polymer thermal conductivity, it has been shown by R. B. Bird, C. F. Curtiss, and K. J. Beers [Rheol. Acfa, 36,269-276 (1997)l that the predicted thermal conductivity is exceedingly sensitive to the form of the potential energy used for describing the springs. 268 Chapter 9 Thermal Conductivity and the Mechanisms of Energy Transport Another possible generalization of Eq. 9.1-6 is to include a term containing the time derivative of q multiplied by a time constant, by analogy with the Maxwell model of lin- ear viscoelasticity in Eq. 8.4-3. There seems to be little experimental evidence that such a generalization is ~arranted.~ The reader will have noticed that Eq. 9.1-2 for heat conduction and Eq. 1.1-2 for vis- cous flow are quite similar. In both equations the flux is proportional to the negative of the gradient of a macroscopic variable, and the coefficient of proportionality is a physical property characteristic of the material and dependent on the temperature and pressure. For the situations in which there is three-dimensional transport, we find that Eq. 9.1-6 for heat conduction and Eq. 1.2-7 for viscous flow differ in appearance. This difference arises because energy is a scalar, whereas momentum is a vector, and the heat flux q is a vector with three components, whereas the momentum flux I is a second-order tensor with nine components. We can anticipate that the transport of energy and momentum will in general not be mathematically analogous except in certain geometrically simple situations. In addition to the thermal conductivity k, defined by Eq. 9.1-2, a quantity known as the thermal difisivity a is widely used. It is defined as Here Sp is the heat capacity at constant pressure; the circumflex (A) over the symbol indi- cates a quantity \"per unit mass.\" Occasionally we will need to use the symbol in which the tilde (-) over the symbol stands for a quantity \"per mole.\" The thermal diffusivity a has the same dimensions as the kinematic viscosity v- namely, (length)*/time. When the assumption of constant physical properties is made, the quantities v and CY occur in similar ways in the equations of change for momentum and energy transport. Their ratio v/a indicates the relative ease of momentum and en- ergy transport in flow systems. This dimensionless ratio is called the Prandtl number.%nother dimensionless group that we will encounter in subsequent chapters is the Piclet number: P6 = RePr. The units that are commonly used for thermal conductivity and related quantities are given in Table 9.1-1. Other units, as well as the interrelations among the various sys- tems, may be found in Appendix F. Thermal conductivity can vary all the way from about 0.01 W/m K for gases to about 1000 W/m . K for pure metals. Some experimental values of the thermal con- The linear theory of thermoviscoelasticity does predict relaxation effects in heat conduction, as discussed by R. M. Christensen, Theory of Viscoelasticity, Academic Press, 2nd edition (1982). The effect has also been found from a kinetic theory treatment of the energy equation by R. B. Bird and C. F. Curtiss, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, 79,255-259 (1998). \"his dimensionless group, named for Ludwig Prandtl, involves only the physical properties of the fluid.

This chart, which is similar to that for viscosity shown in Fig. 1.3-1, is a plot of the reduced thermal conductivity k, = k/k,, which is the thermal conductivity at pressure p and temperature T divided by the thermal conductivity at the critical point. This quantity is plotted as a function of the re- duced temperature T, = T/T, and the reduced pressure p, = p/~,.

It should not be used in the neighborhood of the critical point.' It can be seen that the thermal conductivity of a gas approaches a limiting function of T at low pressures; for most gases this limit is reached at about 1 atm pressure. The thermal conductivities of gases at low density increase with increasing temperature, whereas the thermal conductivities of most liquids decrease with increasing temperature. The correlation is less reliable in the liquid region; polar or associated liquids, such as water, may exhibit a maximum in the curve of k versus T. The main virtue of the corresponding-states chart is that one gets a global view of the behavior of the thermal conductivity of gases and liquids. The quantity kc may be estimated in one of two ways: (i) given k at a known temper- ature and pressure, preferably close to the conditions at which k is to be estimated, one can read k, from the chart and compute kc = k/k,; or (ii) one can estimate a value of k in the low-density region by the methods given in 99.3 and then proceed as in (i). Values of kc obtained by method (i) are given in Appendix E. For mixtures, one might estimate the thermal conductivity by methods analogous to those described in 91.3. Very little is known about the accuracy of pseudocritical proce- dures as applied to thermal conductivity, largely because there are so few data on mix- tures at elevated pressures. Estimate the thermal conductivity of ethane at 153'F and 191.9 atm from the experimental value2 k = 0.0159 Btu/hr. ft . F at 1 atm and 153°F. Effect of Pressure on Thermal Conductivity SOLmON Since a measured value of k is known, we use method (i). First we calculate p, and T, at the condition of the measured value: From Fig. 9.2-1 we read k, = 0.36. Hence kc is At 153°F (T, = 1.115) and 191.9 atm (p, = 3.98), we read from the chart k, = 2.07. The predicted thermal conductivity is then An observed value of 0.0453 Btu/hr ft F has been reported.' The poor agreement shows that one should not rely heavily on this correlation for polyatomic substances nor for conditions near the critical point. In the vicinity of the critical point, where the thermal conductivity diverges, it is customary to write k = kb + Ak, where kb is the \"background\" contribution and Ak is the \"critical enhancement'' contribution. The kc being used in the corresponding states correlation is the background contribution. For the behavior of transport properties near the critical point, see J. V. Sengers and J.

Although detailed theories for poly- atomic gases have been developed,' it is customary to use some simple approximate theories. Here, as in 91.5, we give a simplified mean free path derivation for monatomic gases, and then summarize the result of the Chapman-Enskog kinetic theory of gases. We use the model of rigid, nonattracting spheres of mass m and diameter d. The gas as a whole is at rest (v = O), but the molecular motions must be accounted for. As in 91.5, we use the following results for a rigid-sphere gas: ii = @ = mean molecular speed (9.3-1) Z = in@ = wall collision frequency per unit area (9.3-2) h = = mean free path *d2n The molecules reaching any plane in the gas have had, on an average, their last collision at a distance a from the plane, where In these equations K is the Boltzmann constant, n is the number of molecules per unit volume, and m is the mass of a molecule. The only form of energy that can be exchanged in a collision between two smooth rigid spheres is translational energy. The mean translational energy per molecule under equilibrium conditions is as shown in Prob. 1C.1. For such a gas, the molar heat capacity at constant volume is in which R is the gas constant. Equation 9.3-6 is satisfactory for monatomic gases up to temperatures of several thousand degrees. To determine the thermal conductivity, we examine the behavior of the gas under a temperature gradient dT/dy (see Fig. 9.3-1). We assume that Eqs. 9.3-1 to 6 remain valid in this nonequilibrium situation, except that $rnZ in Eq. 9.3-5 is taken as the average ki- netic energy for molecules that had their last collision in a region of temperature T. The heat flux qy across any plane of constant y is found by summing the kinetic energies of the molecules that cross the plane per unit time in the positive y direction and subtract- ing the kinetic energies of the equal number that cross in the negative y direction: ' C.

Molecular transport of (kinetic) energy from plane at (y - a) to plane at y. Equation 9.3-7 is based on the assumption that all molecules have velocities representa- tive of the region of their last collision and that the temperature profile T(y) is linear for a distance of several mean free paths. In view of the latter assumption we may write By combining the last three equations we get This corresponds to Fourier's law of heat conduction (Eq. 9.1-2) with the thermal con- ductivity given by k = fn~iih = iPtvii~ (monatomic gas) (9.3-1 1) in which p = nrn is the gas density, and kV = fK/m (from Eq. 9.3-6). Substitution of the expressions for ii and A from Eqs. 9.3-1 and 3 then gives k = - - - - tv (monatomic gas) ,d2 3%- rd2 which is the thermal conductivity of a dilute gas composed of rigid spheres of diameter d. This equation predicts that k is independent of pressure. Figure 9.2-1 indicates that this prediction is in good agreement with experimental data up to about 10 atm for most gases. The predicted temperature dependence is too weak, as was the case for viscosity. For a more accurate treatment of the monatomic gas, we turn again to the rigorous Chapman-Enskog treatment discussed in 51.5. The Chapman-Enskog formula2 for the thermal conductivity of a monatomic gas at low density and temperature T is k = - vmii 25w?v or k= 1.9891 X 10'- (monatomic gas) (9.3-13) 32 .rra21nk a 2CRk In the second form of this equation, k [=I cal/cm . s K, T [=I K, a [=I A, and the \"colli- sion integral\" for thermal conductivity, SZk, is identical to that for viscosity, a, in 51.4.

Equation 9.3-13, together with Table E.2, has been found to be remarkably accurate for predicting thermal conductivi- ties of monatomic gases when the parameters o and E deduced from viscosity measure- ments are used (that is, the values given in Table E.l). Equation 9.3-13 is very similar to the corresponding viscosity formula, Eq. 1.4-14. From these two equations we can then get 15 R k = -- 5 - p = 2 Cvp (monatomic gas) (9.3-14) The simplified rigid-sphere theory (see Eqs. 1.4-8 and 9.3-11) gives k = evP and is thus in error by a factor 2.5. This is not surprising in view of the many approximations that were made in the simple treatment. So far we have discussed only monatomic gases. We know from the discussion in 50.3 that, in binary collisions between diatomic molecules, there may be interchanges be- tween kinetic and internal (i.e., vibrational and rotational) energy. Such interchanges are not taken into account in the Chapman-Enskog theory for monatomic gases. It can there- fore be anticipated that the Chapman-Enskog theory will not be adequate for describing the thermal conductivity of polyatomic molecules. A simple semiempirical method of accounting for the energy exchange in poly- atomic gases was developed by E~cken.~ His equation for thermal conductivity of a polyatomic gas at low density is k = (* C, + - El) - p (polyatomic gas) This Eucken formula includes the monatomic formula (Eq. 9.3-14) as a special case, be- cause ?, = ~(R/M) for monatomic gases. Hirschfelder4 obtained a formula similar to that of Eucken by using multicomponent-mixture theory (see Example 19.4-4). Other theo- ries, correlations, and empirical formulas are also a~ailable.~,~ Equation 9.3-15 provides a simple method for estimating the Prandtl number, de- fined in Eq. 9.1-8: - This equation is fairly satisfactory for nonpolar polyatomic gases at low density, as can be seen in Table 9.3-1; it is less accurate for polar molecules. The thermal conductivities for gas mixtures at low density may be estimated by a method7 analogous to that previously given for viscosity (see Eqs. 1.4-15 and 16): The x, are the mole fractions, and the k, are the thermal conductivities of the pure chem- ical species. The coefficients are identical to those appearing in the viscosity equation - - A. Eucken, Physik. Z., 14,324-333 (1913); \"Eucken\" is pronounced \"Oy-ken.\" J. 0. Hirschfelder, J. Chem.

As a result we have to use rough theories or empirical estimation methods.' We choose to discuss here Bridgman's simple theory3 of energy transport in pure liquids. He assumed that the molecules are arranged in a cubic lattice, with a center- to-center spacing given by in which ?/N is the volume per molecule. He further assumed energy to be transferred from one lattice plane to the next at the sonic velocity v, for the given fluid. The development is based on a reinterpretation of Eq. 9.3-11 of the rigid-sphere gas theory: The heat capacity at constant volume of a monatomic liquid is about the scme as for a solid at high temperature, which is given by the Dulong and Petit formula4 Cv = 3(~/m). The mean molecular speed in the y direction, m, is replaced by the sonic velocity us. The distance a that the energy travels between two successive collisions is taken to be the lat- tice spacing (?/I?)'13. Making these substitutions in Eq. 9.4-1 gives which is Bridgrnan's equation. Experimental data show good agreement with Eq. 9.4-2, even for polyatomic liquids, but the numerical coefficient is somewhat too high. Better agreement is obtained if the coefficient is changed to 2.80: This equation is limited to densities well above the critical density, because of the tacit assumption that each molecule oscillates in a \"cage\" formed by its nearest neighbors. The success of this equation for polyatomic fluids seems to imply that the energy trans- fer in collisions of polyatomic molecules is incomplete, since the heat capacity used here, kv = 3(~/rn), is less than the heat capacities of polyatomic liquids. The velocity of low-frequency sound is given (see Problem 11C.1) by The quantity (dp/dp), may be obtained from isothermal compressibility measurements or from an equation of state, and (Cp/Cv) is very nearly unity for liquids, except near the critical point. ' J. H. Irving and J. G. Kirkwood, I. Chem. Phys., 18,817-829 (1950). This theory has been extended to polymeric liquids by C. F. Curtiss and R. B. Bird, J. Chem. Phys., 107,5254-5267 (1997). R. C. Reid, J. M. Prausnitz, and B. E. Poling, The Properties of Gases and Liquids, McGraw-Hill, New York (1987); L. Riedel, Chemie-1ng.-Techn., 27,209-213 (1955). \". W. Bridgman, Proc. Am. Acad. Arts and Sci., 59,141-169 (1923). Bridgman's equation is often misquoted, because he gave it in terms of a little-known gas constant equal to SK. This empirical equation has been justified, and extended, by A. Einstein [Ann. Phys. [41,22, 180-190 (1907)l and P. Debye [Ann. Phys., [4139,789-839 (1912)l. Equation 9.4-3 is in approximate agreement with a formula derived by R. E. Powell, W. E. Roseveare, and H. Eyring, Ind. Eng. Chem., 33,430-435 (1941). 280 Chapter 9 Thermal Conductivity and the Mechanisms of Energy Transport EXAMPLE 9.4-1 Prediction of the The density of liquid CCI, at 20°C and 1 atm is 1.595 g/cm3, and its isothermal compressibility (l/p)(ap/a~)~ is 90.7 X atm-'.

Substitution of these val- ues in Eq. 9.4-3 gives The experimental value as interpolated from Table 9.1-3 is 0.101 W/m K. s9.5 THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF SOLIDS Thermal conductivities of solids have to be measured experimentally, since they depend on many factors that are difficult to measure or predict.' In crystalline materials, the phase and crystallite size are important; in amorphous solids the degree of molecular orientation has a considerable effect. In porous solids, the thermal conductivity is strongly dependent on the void fraction, the pore size, and the fluid contained in the pores. A detailed discussion of thermal conductivity of solids has been given by Jakob.' In general, metals are better heat conductors than nonmetals, and crystalline materi- als conduct heat more readily than amorphous materials. Dry porous solids are very poor heat conductors and are therefore excellent for thermal insulation. The conductivi- ties of most pure metals decrease with increasing temperature, whereas the conductivi- ties of nonmetals increase; alloys show intermediate behavior. Perhaps the most useful of the rules of thumb is that thermal and electrical conductivity go hand in hand. For pure metals, as opposed to alloys, the thermal conductivity k and the electrical conductivity k, are related approximately3 as follows: -- - L = constant kJ This is the Wiedemann-Franz-Lorenz equation; this equation can also be explained theoret- ically (see Problem 9A.6). The \"Lorenz number\" L is about 22 to 29 X lop9 volt2/K2 for A. Goldsmith, T. E. Waterman, and H. J. Hirschhorn, eds., Handbook of Thermophysical Properfies of Solids, Macmillan, New York (1961). M.

At very low temperatures (-269.4\"C for mercury) met- als become superconductors of electricity but not of heat, and L thus varies strongly with temperature near the superconducting region. Equation 9.5-1 is of limited use for alloys, since L varies strongly with composition and, in some cases, with temperature. The success of Eq. 9.5-1 for pure metals is due to the fact that free electrons are the major heat carriers in pure metals. The equation is not suitable for nonmetals, in which the concentration of free electrons is so low that energy transport by molecular motion predominates. 59.6 EFFECTIVE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF COMPOSITE SOLIDS Up to this point we have discussed homogeneous materials. Now we turn our attention briefly to the thermal conductivity of two-phase solids--one solid phase dispersed in a second solid phase, or solids containing pores, such as granular materials, sintered met- als, and plastic foams. A complete description of the heat transport through such materi- als is clearly extremely complicated. However, for steady conduction these materials can be regarded as homogeneous materials with an effective thermal conductivity keff, and the temperature and heat flux components are reinterpreted as the analogous quantities av- eraged over a volume that is large with respect to the scale of the heterogeneity but small with respect to the overall dimensions of the heat conduction system. The first major contribution to the estimation of the conductivity of heterogeneous solids was by Maxwell.' He considered a material made of spheres of thermal conductiv- ity k, embedded in a continuous solid phase with thermal conductivity ko. The volume fraction 4 of embedded spheres is taken to be sufficiently small that the spheres do not \"interact\" thermally; that is, one needs to consider only the thermal conduction in a large medium containing only one embedded sphere. Then by means of a surprisingly simple derivation, Maxwell showed that for small volume fraction 4 (see Problems llB.8 and llC.5). For large volume fraction 4, Rayleigh2 showed that, if the spheres are located at the in- tersections of a cubic lattice, the thermal conductivity of the composite is given by Comparison of this result with Eq. 9.6-1 shows that the interaction between the spheres is small, even at 4 = in, the maximum possible value of 4 for the cubic lattice arrange- ment. Therefore the simpler result of Maxwell is often used, and the effects of nonuni- form sphere distribution are usually neglected. Maxwell's derivation was for electrical conductivity, but the same arguments apply for thermal conductivity. See J. C.

The effective thermal conductivity tensor has been computed up to 0(+') for a medium containing spheroidal inclusion^.^ For complex nonspherical inclusions, often encountered in practice, no exact treatment is possible, but some approximate relations are a~ailable.~,~,~ For simple unconsolidated granular beds the following expression has proven successful: in which The gk are \"shape factors\" for the granules of the medium: and they must satisfy g, t g2 + g3 = 1. For spheres g1 = g2 = g3 = & and Eq. 9.6-5 reduces to Eq. 9.6-1. For unconsol- idated soils? gl = g2 = d and g3 = 2. The structure of consolidated porous beds-for ex- ample, sandstones-is considerably more complex. Some success is claimed for predicting the effective conductivity of such s~bstances;l.~,~ but the generality of the methods is not yet known. For solids containing gas pocket^,^ thermal radiation (see Chapter 16) may be impor- tant. The special case of parallel planar fissures perpendicular to the direction of heat conduction is particularly important for high-temperature insulation. For such systems it may be shown that where a is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, k1 is the thermal conductivity of the gas, and L is the total thickness of the material in the direction of the heat conduction. A modifica- tion of this equation for fissures of other shapes and orientations is a~ailable.~ S.-Y. Lu and S. Kim, AIChE lournal, 36,927-938 (1990). \". I. Odelevskii, J. Tech. Phys.

Since the thermal conductivities of gases are much lower than those of solids, most of the gas-phase heat conduction is concentrated near the points of contact of adjacent solid particles. As a re- sult, the distances over which the heat is conducted through the gas may approach the mean free path of the gas molecules. When this is true, the conditions for the develop- ments of 59.3 are violated, and the thermal conductivity of the gas decreases. Very effec- tive insulators can thus be prepared from partially evacuated beds of fine powders. Cylindrical ducts filled with granular materials through which a fluid is flowing (in the z di- rection) are of considerable importance in separation processes and chemical reactors. In such systems the effective thermal conductivities in the radial and axial directions are quite different and are designated1' by K~~~,~~ and K,,,,,. Conduction, convection, and radia- tion all contribute to the flow of heat through the porous medium.\" For highly turbulent flow, the energy is transported primarily by the tortuous flow of the fluid in the inter- stices of the granular material; this gives rise to a highly anisotropic thermal conductivity. For a bed of uniform spheres, the radial and axial components are approximately in which vo is the \"superficial velocity\" defined in 54.3 and 56.4, and D, is the diameter of the spherical particles. These simplified relations hold for Re = D,vop/p greater than 200. The behavior at lower Reynolds numbers is discussed in several references.12 Also, the behavior of the effective thermal conductivity tensor as a function of the Pkclet num- ber has been studied in considerable detail.13 59.7 CONVECTIVE TRANSPORT OF ENERGY In 59.1 we gave Fourier's law of heat conduction, which accounts for the energy trans- ported through a medium by virtue of the molecular motions. Energy may also be transported by the bulk motion of the fluid. In Fig. 9.7-1 we show three mutually perpendicular elements of area dS at the point P, where the fluid Fig. 9.7-1. Three mutually perpendicular surface elements of area dS across which energy is being transported by convection by the fluid moving with the velocity v. The volume rate of flow across the faceperpendicular to the x-axis is v,dS, and the rate of flow of energy across dS is then (ipv2 + pU)v,dS. Similar expressions can be written for the surface elements per- pendicular to the y- and z-axes. In See Eq. 9.1-7 for the modification of Fourier's law for anisotropic materials. The subscripts rr and zz emphasize that these quantities are components of a second-order symmetrical tensor. \"W. B. Argo and J. M. Smith, Chem. Engr. Progress, 49,443-451 (1953). l2 J. Beek, Adv.

The volume rate of flow across the surface element dS perpendicular to the x-axis is v,dS. The rate at which energy is being swept across the same surface element is then in which $pv2 = $p(v: + 4 + vi) is the kinetic energy per unit volume, and pir is the inter- nal energy per unit volume. The definition of the internal energy in a nonequilibrium situation requires some care. From the continuum point of view, the internal energy at position r and time t is as- sumed to be the same function of the local, instantaneous density and temperature that one would have at equilibrium. From the molecular point of view, the internal energy consists of the sum of the kinetic energies of all the constituent atoms (relative to the flow velocity v), the intramolecular potential energies, and the intermolecular energies, within a small region about the point r at time t. Recall that, in the discussion of molecular collisions in 50.3, we found it convenient to regard the energy of a colliding pair of molecules to be the sum of the kinetic energies referred to the center of mass of the molecule plus the intramolecular potential energy of the molecule. Here also we split the energy of the fluid (regarded as a continuum) into kinetic energy associated with the bulk fluid motion and the internal energy associated with the kinetic energy of the molecules with respect to the flow velocity and the intra- and intermolecular potential energies. We can write expressions similar to Eq. 9.7-1 for the rate at which energy is being swept through the surface elements perpendicular to the y- and z-axes. If we now multi- ply each of the three expressions by the corresponding unit vector and add, we then get, after division by dS, and this quantity is called the convective energy flux vector. To get the convective energy flux across a_ unit surface whose normal unit vector is n, we form the dot product (n . ($v2 + pU)v). It is understood that this is the flux from the negative side of the sur- face to the positive side. Compare this with the convective momentum flux in Fig. 1.7-2. g9.8 WORK ASSOCIATED WITH MOLECULAR MOTIONS Presently we will be concerned with applying the law of conservation of energy to \"shells\" (as in the shell balances in Chapter 10) or to small elements of volume fixed in space (to develop the equation of change for energy in §11.1). The law of conservation of energy for an open flow system is an extension of the first law of classical thermodynam- ics (for a closed system at rest). In the latter we state that the change in internal energy is equal to the amount of heat added to the system plus the amount of work done on the system. For flow systems we shall need to account for the heat added to the system (by molecular motions and by bulk fluid motion) and also for the work done on the system by the molecular motions. Therefore it is appropriate that we develop here the expres- sion for the rate of work done by the molecular motions. First we recall that, when a force F acts on a body and causes it to move through a distance dr, the work done is dW = (F dr). Then the rate of doing work is dW/dt = (F . drldt) = (F v)-that is, the dot product of the force times the velocity. We now apply this formula to the three perpendicular planes at a point P in space shown in Fig. 9.8-1. First we consider the surface element perpendicular to the x-axis. The fluid on the minus side of the surface exerts a force IT# on the fluid that is on the plus side (see g9.8 Work Associated with Molecular Motions 285 Fig. 9.8-1. Three mutually perpendicular surface elements of area dS at point P along with the stress vectors m,, my, n, acting on these surfaces. In the first figure, the rate at which work is done by the fluid on the minus side of dS on the fluid on the plus side of dS is then (a,. v)dS = [m v],dS. Similar expressions hold for the surface elements perpendicular to the other two coordinate axes. Table 1.2-1). Since the fluid is moving with a velocity v, the rate at which work is done by the minus fluid on the plus fluid is (n, v)dS. Similar expressions may be written for the work done across the other two surface elements. When written out in component form, these rate of work expressions, per unit area, become When these scalar components are multiplied by the unit vectors and added, we get the \"rate of doing work vector per unit area,\" and we can call this, for short, the work flux: Furthermore, the rate of doing work across a unit area of surface with orientation given by the unit vector n is (n . [n - v]). Equations 9.8-1 to 9.8-4 are easily written for cylindrical coordinates by replacing x, y, z by r, 8, z and, for spherical coordinates by replacing x, y, z by r, 6, 4. We now define, for later use, the combined energy flux vector e as follows: The e vector is the sum of (a) the convective energy flux, (b) the rate of doing work (per unit area) by molecular mechanisms, and (c) the rate of transporting heat (per unit area) by molecular mechanisms. All the terms in Eq. 9.8-5 have the same sign convention, so that ex is the energy transport in the positive x direction per unit area per unit time. The total molecular stress tensor .rr can now be split into two parts: n = p6 + T so that [n . v] = pv + [T v]. The term py can then be combined with !he internal energy term to give an enthalpy term pUv + pv = p(~ + (p/p))v = p(U + pi3v = &v, so that e = ($pv2 + pkv + [T . v] + q (9.8-6) We shall usually use the e vector in this form. For a surface element dS of orientation n, the quantity (n . e) gives the convective energy flux, the heat flux, and the work flux across the surface element dS from the negative side to the positive side of dS. 286 Chapter 9 Thermal Conductivity and the Mechanisms of Energy Transport Table 9.8-1 Summary of Notation for Energy Fluxes Symbol Meaning Reference (ipv2 + pinv convective energy flux vector Eq. 9.7-2 molecular heat flux vector Eq. 9.1-6 molecular work flux vector Eq. 9.8-4 e = q + [P .

Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow Shell energy balances; boundary conditions Heat conduction with an electrical heat source Heat conduction with a nuclear heat source Heat conduction with a viscous heat source Heat conduction with a chemical heat source Heat conduction through composite walls Heat conduction in a cooling fin Forced convection Free convection In Chapter 2 we saw how certain simple viscous flow problems are solved by a two-step procedure: (i) a momentum balance is made over a thin slab or shell perpendicular to the direction of momentum transport, which leads to a first-order differential equation that gives the momentum flux distribution; (ii) then into the expression for the momentum flux we insert Newton's law of viscosity, which leads to a first-order differential equa- tion for the fluid velocity as a function of position. The integration constants that appear are evaluated by using the boundary conditions, which specify the velocity or momen- tum flux at the bounding surfaces. In this chapter we show how a number of heat conduction problems are solved by an analogous procedure: (i) an energy balance is made over a thin slab or shell perpen- dicular to the direction of the heat flow, and this balance leads to a first-order differential equation from which the heat flux distribution is obtained; (ii) then into this expression for the heat flux, we substitute Fourier's law of heat conduction, which gives a first-order differential equation for the temperature as a function of position. The integration con- stants are then determined by use of boundary conditions for the temperature or heat flux at the bounding surfaces. It should be clear from the similar wording of the preceding two paragraphs that the mathematical methods used in this chapter are the same as those introduced in Chapter 2-only the notation and terminology are different. However, we will encounter here a number of physical phenomena that have no counterpart in Chapter 2. After a brief introduction to the shell energy balance in §10.1, we give an analysis of the heat conduction in a series of uncomplicated systems. Although these examples are s10.1 Shell Energy Balances; Boundary Conditions 291 somewhat idealized, the results find application in numerous standard engineering cal- culations. The problems were chosen to introduce the beginner to a number of important physical concepts associated with the heat transfer field. In addition, they serve to show how to use a variety of boundary conditions and to illustrate problem solving in Carte- sian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. In §§10.2-10.5 we consider four kinds of heat sources: electrical, nuclear, viscous, and chemical. In 9510.6 and 10.7 we cover two topics with widespread applications-namely, heat flow through composite walls and heat loss from fins. Finally, in §§10.8 and 10.9, we analyze two limiting cases of heat transfer in moving fluids: forced convection and free convection. The study of these topics paves the way for the general equations in Chapter 11. $10.1 SHELL ENERGY BALANCES; BOUNDARY CONDITIONS The problems discussed in this chapter are set up by means of shell energy balances. We select a slab (or shell), the surfaces of which are normal to the direction of heat conduc- tion, and then we write for this system a statement of the law of conservation of energy. For steady-state (i.e., time-independent) systems, we write: (rate energy of in ] - [rate energy of out ) + (\"te of ] - (rate of ) energy in energy out + by convective by convective by molecular by molecular transport transport transport transport rate of The convective transport of energy was discussed in 59.7, and the molecular transport (heat conduction) in 99.1. The molecular work terms were explained in s9.8. These three terms can be added to give the \"combined energy flux\" el as shown in Eq. 9.8-6. In setting up problems here (and in the next chapter) we will use the e vector along with the expres- sion for the enthalpy in Eq. 9.8-8. Note that in nonflow systems (for which v is zero) the e vector simplifies to the q vector, which is given by Fourier's law. The energy production term in Eq. 10.1-1 includes (i) the degradation of electrical en- ergy into heat, (ii) the heat produced by slowing down of neutrons and nuclear frag- ments liberated in the fission process, (iii) the heat produced by viscous dissipation, and (iv) the heat produced in chemical reactions. The chemical reaction heat source will be discussed further in Chapter 19. Equation 10.1-1 is a statement of the first law of thermo- dynamics, written for an \"open\" system at steady-state conditions. In Chapter 11 this same statement-extended to unsteady-state systems-will be written as an equation of change. After Eq. 10.1-1 has been written for a thin slab or shell of material, the thickness of the slab or shell is allowed to approach zero. This procedure leads ultimately to an ex- pression for the temperature distribution containing constants of integration, which we evaluate by use of boundary conditions. The commonest types of boundary conditions are: a. The temperature may be specified at a surface. b. The heat flux normal to a surface may be given (this is equivalent to specifying the normal component of the temperature gradient). c. At interfaces the continuity of temperature and of the heat flux normal to the in- terface are required. 292 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow d. At a solid-fluid interface, the normal heat flux component may be related to the difference between the solid surface temperature To and the \"bulk\" fluid temper- ature Tb: q = h(To - Td (1 0.1-2) This relation is referred to as Newton's law of cooling. It is not really a \"law\" but rather the defining equation for h, which is called the heat transfer coejyrcient. Chapter 14 deals with methods for estimating heat-transfer coefficients. All four types of boundary conditions are encountered in this chapter. Still other kinds of boundary conditions are possible, and they will be introduced as needed. 910.2 HEAT CONDUCTION WITH AN ELECTRICAL HEAT SOURCE The first system we consider is an electric wire of circular cross section with radius R and electrical conductivity k, ohm-' cm-'. Through this wire there is an electric current with current density I amp/cm2. The transmission of an electric current is an irreversible process, and some electrical energy is converted into heat (thermal energy). The rate of heat production per unit volume is given by the expression The quantity S, is the heat source resulting from electrical dissipation. We assume here that the temperature rise in the wire is not so large that the temperature dependence of either the thermal or electrical conductivity need be considered. The surface of the wire is maintained at temperature To. We now show how to find the radial temperature distri- bution within the wire. For the energy balance we take the system to be a cylindrical shell of thickness Ar and length L (see Fig. 10.2-1). Since v = 0 in this system, the only contributions to the en- ergy balance are Rate of heat in across cylindrical (2.1rvL)qrlr) = (2.1rvLqr)l, surface at r Rate of heat out across cylindrical (2dr + Ar)L)(qrlr+Ar) = (2mLqr)lr+br surface at r + Ar Rate of thermal energy production by (2mArL) S, electrical dissipation The notation qr means \"heat flux in the r direction,\" and (a .)lr+8r means \"evaluated at r + Ar.\" Note that we take \"in\" and \"out\" to be in the positive r direction. We now substitute these quantities into the energy balance of Eq. 9.1-1. Division by 2rLAr and taking the limit as Ar goes to zero gives The expression on the left side is the first derivative of rq, with respect to r, so that Eq. 10.2-5 becomes s10.2 Heat Conduction with an Electrical Heat Source 293 Fig. 10.2-1.

We now substitute Fourier's law in the form 9, = -k(dT/dr) (see Eq. B.2-4) into Eq. 10.2-9 to obtain When k is assumed to be constant, this first-order differential equation can be integrated to give The integration constant is determined from B.C. 2: atr=R, T=To (10.2-12) Hence C, = (S,~'/4k) + To and Eq. 10.2-11 becomes I I Equation 10.2-13 gives the temperature rise as a parabolic function of the distance r from the wire axis. 294 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow Once the temperature and heat flux distributions are known, various information about the system may be obtained: (i) Maximum temperature rise (at r = 0) (ii) Average temperature rise Thus the temperature rise, averaged over the cross section, is half the maximum temper- ature rise. (iii) Heat outflow at the surface (for a length L of wire) This result is not surprising, since, at steady state, all the heat produced by electrical dis- sipation in the volume TR'L must leave through the surface r = R. The reader, while going through this development, may well have had the feeling of de'ja vu. There is, after all, a pronounced similarity between the heated wire problem and the viscous flow in a circular tube. Only the notation is different: - Tube flow Heated wire First integration gives r,(d 9Ay) Second integration gives UJY) T(r) - To Boundary condition at r = 0 rrz = finite q, = finite Boundary condition at r = R v, = 0 T-To=O Transport property E\". k Source term (9'0 - 9'L)/L s, Assumptions p = constant k, k, = constant That is, when the quantities are properly chosen, the differential equations and the boundary conditions for the two problems are identical, and the physical processes are said to be \"analogous.\" Not all problems in momentum transfer have analogs in energy and mass transport. However, when such analogies can be found, they may be useful in taking over known results from one field and applying them in another. For example, the reader should have no trouble in finding a heat conduction analog for the viscous flow in a liquid film on an inclined plane. There are many examples of heat conduction problems in the electrical industry.' The minimizing of temperature rises inside electrical machinery prolongs insulation life. One example is the use of internally liquid-cooled stator conductors in very large (500,000 kw) AC generators. M. Jakob, Heat Transfer, Vol. 1, Wiley, New York (19491, Chapter 10, pp. 167-199. 510.2 Heat Conduction with an Electrical Heat Source 295 To illustrate further problems in electrical heating, we give two examples concern- ing the temperature rise in wires: the first indicates the order of magnitude of the heating effect, and the second shows how to handle different boundary conditions. In addition, in Problem 10C.2 we show how to take into account the temperature dependence of the thermal and electrical conductivities. A copper wire has a radius of 2 mm and a length of 5 m. For what voltage drop would the temperature rise at the wire axis be 10°C, if the surface temperature of the wire is 20°C? Voltage Required for a Given Temperature Rise SOLUTION in a Wire Heated by an Electric Current Combining Eq. 10.2-14 and 10.2-1 gives EXAMPLE 10.2.2 Heated Wire with Specified Heat Transfer The current density is related to the voltage drop E over a length L by Hence from which For copper, the Lorenz number of 59.5 is k/keTo = 2.23 X lo-' VO~P/K~. Therefore, the voltage drop needed to cause a 10°C temperature rise is 8 volt v- E = 2(5000 2 mm mm)~2.23 X 10- - K (293)(10)K = (5000)(1.49 X 1oP4)(54.1) = 40 volts Repeat the analysis in 510.2, assuming that To is not known, but that instead the heat flux at the wall is given by Newton's \"law of cooling\" (Eq. 10.1-2). Assume that the heat transfer co- efficient h and the ambient air temperature Tair are known. Coefficient and SOLUTION I Ambient Air Temperature The solution proceeds as before through Eq. 10.2-11, but the second integration constant is de- termined from Eq. 10.1-2: B.C. 2': dT atr=R, -k-=h(T-TaiJ (10.2-22) dr Substituting Eq. 10.2-11 into Eq. 10.2-22 gives C2 = (SeR/2h) + (S,R2/4k) + Tair, and the tem- perature profile is then From this the surface temperature of the wire is found to be Ta,, + SJV2h. 296 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow SOLUTION II Another method makes use of the result obtained previously in Eq. 10.2-13. Although To is not known in the present problem, we can nonetheless use the result. From Eqs. 10.1-2 and 10.2-16 we can get the temperature difference Substraction of Eq. 10.2-24 from Eq. 10.2-13 enables us to eliminate the unknown To and gives Eq. 10.2-23. s10.3 HEAT CONDUCTION WITH A NUCLEAR HEAT SOURCE We consider a spherical nuclear fuel element as shown in Fig. 10.3-1. It consists of a sphere of fissionable material with radius R'~', surrounded by a spherical shell of alu- minum \"cladding\" with outer radius R\"'. Inside the fuel element, fission fragments are produced that have very high kinetic energies. Collisions between these fragments and the atoms of the fissionable material provide the major source of thermal energy in the reactor. Such a volume source of thermal energy resulting from nuclear fission we call S,, (cal/cm3. s). This source will not be uniform throughout the sphere of fissionable mater- ial; it will be the smallest at the center of the sphere. For the purpose of this problem, we assume that the source can be approximated by a simple parabolic function Here S,,, is the volume rate of heat production at the center of the sphere, and b is a di- mensionless positive constant. We select as the system a spherical shell of thickness Ar within the sphere of fission- able material. Since the system is not in motion, the energy balance will consist only of heat conduction terms and a source term. The various contributions to the energy bal- ance are: Coolant Fig. 10.3-1.

These are evaluated by means of the boundary conditions: B.C. I: B.C. 2: Evaluation of the constants then leads to These are the heat flux distributions in the fissionable sphere and in the spherical-shell cladding. Into these distributions we now substitute Fourier's law of heat conduction (Eq. B.2-7): 298 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow These equations may be integrated for constant Ic'~' and k(\" to give The integration constants can be determined from the boundary conditions B.C. 3: B.C. 4: where To is the known temperature at the outside of the cladding. The final expressions for the temperature profiles are ko find the maximum temperature in the sphere of fissionable material, all we have to do is set r equal to zero in Eq. 10.3-20. This is a quantity one might well want to know when making estimates of thermal deterioration. This problem has illustrated two points: (i) how to handle a position-dependent source term, and (ii) the application of the continuity of temperature and normal heat flux at the boundary between two solid materials. 510.4 HEAT CONDUCTION WITH A VISCOUS HEAT SOURCE Next we consider the flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid between two coaxial cylinders as shown in Fig. 10.4-1. The surfaces of the inner and outer cylinders are main- tained at T = To and T = Tb, respectively. We can expect that T will be a function of r alone. Outer cylinder moves with angular velocity 51 ----- Fig. 10.4-1. Flow between cylinders with viscous heat generation. That part of the system enclosed within the dotted lines is shown in modified form in Fig. 10.4-2. g10.4 Heat Conduction with a Viscous Heat Source 299 T~~ surface moves with velocity vb = ~a Fig. 10.4-2. Modification of a portion of the flow system in Fig. 10.4-1, in which the curvature of the bounding surfaces is neglected. X ~tationar$ surface As the outer cylinder rotates, each cylindrical shell of fluid \"rubs\" against an adja- cent shell of fluid. This friction between adjacent layers of the fluid produces heat; that is, the mechanical energy is degraded into thermal energy. The volume heat source re- sulting from this \"viscous dissipation,\" which can be designated by S,, appears automat- ically in the shell balance when we use the combined energy flux vector e defined at the end of Chapter 9, as we shall see presently. If the slit width b is small with respect to the radius R of the outer cylinder, then the problem can be solved approximately by using the somewhat simplified system de- picted in Fig. 10.4-2. That is, we ignore curvature effects and solve the problem in Carte- sian coordinates. The velocity distribution is then v, = vb(x/b), where vb = flR. We now make an energy balance over a shell of thickness Ax, width W, and length L. Since the fluid is in motion, we use the combined energy flux vector e as written in Eq. 9.8-6. The balance then reads Dividing by WL Ax and letting the shell thickness Ax go to zero then gives This equation may be integrated to give Since we do not know any boundary conditions for ex, we cannot evaluate the integra- tion constant at this point. We now insert the expression for e, f;om Eq. 9.8-6. Since the velocity component in the x direction is zero, the term (ipv2 + pLnv can be discarded. The x-component of q is -k(dT/dx) according to Fourier's law. The x-component of [T . v] is, as shown in Eq. 9.8-1, T,,v, + ~~~v~ + T,,v,. Since the only nonzero component of the velocity is v, and since T,, = -p(dv,/dx) according to Newton's law of viscosity, the x-component of [T . vl is -pu,(dv,/dx). We conclude, then, that Eq. 10.4-3 becomes When the linear velocity profile v, = vb(x/b) is inserted, we get in which p(~[,/b)~ can be identified as the rate of viscous heat production per unit volume S,. When Eq. 10.4-5 is integrated we get 300 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow The two integration constants are determined from the boundary conditions B.C. 1: B.C. 2: This yields finally, for Tb + To Here Br = pz;/k(Tb - To) is the dimensionless Brinkman number,' which is a measure of the importance of the viscous dissipation term. If Tb = To, then Eq. 10.4-9 can be written as and the maximum temperature is at x/b = $. If the temperature rise is appreciable, the temperature dependence of the viscosity has to be taken into account. This is discussed in Problem 10C.l. The viscous heating term S, = p(vb/b)' may be understood by the following argu- ments. For the system in Fig. 10.4-2, the rate at which work is done is the force acting on the upper plate times the velocity with which it moves, or (-T~=WL)(V~). The rate of en- ergy addition per unit volume is then obtained by dividing this quantity by WLb, which gives (-7,,vb/b) = p(~~/b)~. This energy all appears as heat and is hence S,. In most flow problems viscous heating is not important. However if there are large velocity gradients, then it cannot be neglected. Examples of situations where viscous heating must be accounted for include: (i) flow of a lubricant between rapidly moving parts, (ii) flow of molten polymers through dies in high-speed extrusion, (iii) flow of highly viscous fluids in high-speed viscometers, and (iv) flow of air in the boundary layer near an earth satellite or rocket during reentry into the earth's atmosphere. The first two of these are further complicated because many lubricants and molten plastics are non-Newtonian fluids. Viscous heating for non-Newtonian fluids is illustrated in Problem 10B. 5. 510.5 HEAT CONDUCTION WITH A CHEMICAL HEAT SOURCE A chemical reaction is being carried out in a tubular, fixed-bed flow reactor with inner radius X as shown in Fig. 10.5-1. The reactor extends from z = - to z = + 63 and is di- vided into three zones: Zone I: Entrance zone packed with noncatalytic spheres Zone 11: Reaction zone packed with catalyst spheres, extending from z = 0 to z = L Zone 111: Exit zone packed with noncatalytic spheres It is assumed that the fluid proceeds through the reactor tube in \"plug flowM-that is, with axial velocity uniform at a superficial value vo = w/m-~~~ (see text below Eq. 6.4-1 for the definition of \"superficial velocity\"). The density, mass flow rate, and superficial ' H. C. Brinkman, Appl. Sci. Research, A2,120-124 (1951), solved the viscous dissipation heating problem for the Poiseuille flow in a circular tube. Other dimensionless groups that may be used for characterizing viscous heating have been summarized by R. B. Bird, R. C. Armstrong, and 0. Hassager, Dynamics of Polymeric Liquids, Vol. 1,2nd edition, Wiley, New York (1987), pp. 207-208. 910.5 Heat Conduction with a Chemical Heat Source 301 Insulated Inert Catalyst Inert wall \\ particles particles qAzr particles - Zone I Zone I1 A Zone I11 --+ z = 0 z=L Fig. 10.5-1. Fixed-bed axial-flow reactor. Reactants enter at z = - m and leave at z = + m. The reaction zone extends from z = 0 to z = L. velocity are all treated as independent of r and z. In addition, the reactor wall is assumed to be well insulated, so that the temperature can be considered essentially independent of r. It is desired to find the steady-state axial temperature distribution T(z) when the fluid enters at z = -03 with a uniform temperature TI. When a chemical reaction occurs, thermal energy is produced or consumed when the reactant molecules rearrange to form the products. The volume rate of thermal en- ergy production by chemical reaction, s,, is in general a complicated function of pres- sure, temperature, composition, and catalyst activity. For simplicity, we represent S, here as a function of temperature only: S, = SclF(Q), where Q = (T - To)/(Tl - To). Here T is the local temperature in the catalyst bed (assumed equal for catalyst and fluid), and S,, and To are empirical constants for the given reactor inlet conditions. For the shell balance we select a disk of radius R and thickness Az in the catalyst zone (see Fig. 10.5-I), and we choose Az to be much larger than the catalyst particle di- mensions. In setting up the energy balance, we use the combined energy flux vector e inas- much as we are dealing with a flow system. Then, at steady state, the energy balance is Next we divide by rR2 AZ and take the limit as Az goes to zero. Strictly speaking, this op- eration is not \"legal,\" since we are not dealing with a continuum but rather with a gran- ular structure. Nevertheless, we perform this limiting process with the understanding that the resulting equation describes, not point values, but rather average values of e, and S, for reactor cross sections of constant z. This gives Now we substitute the z-component of Eq. 9.8-6 into this equation to get We now use Fourier's law for q,, Eq. 1.2-6 for r,,, and the enthalpy expression in Eq. 9.8-8 (with the assumption that the heat capacity is constant) to get in which the effective thermal conductivity in the z direction K,~~,~~ has been used (see Eq. 9.6-9). The first, fourth and fifth terms on the left side may be discarded, since the veloc- ity is not changing with z. The third term may be discarded if the pressure does not 302 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow change significantly in the axial direction. Then in the second term we replace v, by the superficial velocity v,, because the latter is the effective fluid velocity in the reactor. Then Eq. 10.5-4 becomes This is the differential equation for the temperature in zone 11. The same equation ap- plies in zones I and I11 with the source term set equal to zero. The differential equations for the temperature are then Zone I Zone I1 Zone I11 Here we have assumed that we can use the same value of the effective thermal conduc- tivity in all three zones. These three second-order differential equations are subject to the following six boundary conditions: B.C. 1: atz=--03, T1=T1 B.C. 2: at z = 0, = TII B.C. 3: B.C. 4: at z = L, ~11 = ~\"1 (10.5-12) B.C. 5: atz = L, dTn - d T\"' Keff,zz - - Keff,zz - dz dz B.C. 6: atz = m, TI\" = finite (10.5-14) Equations 10.5-10 to 13 express the continuity of temperature and heat flux at the bound- aries between the zones. Equations 10.5-9 and 14 specify requirements at the two ends of the system. The solution of Eqs. 10.5-6 to 14 is considered here for arbitrary F(O). In many cases of practical interest, the convective heat transport is far more important than the axial conductive heat transport. Therefore, here we drop the conductive terms entirely (those containing K,~~,~~). This treatment of the problem still contains the salient features of the solution in the limit of large P6 = RePr (see Problem 10B.18 for a fuller treatment). If we introduce a dimensio_nless axial coordinate Z = z/L and a dimensionless chemical heat source N = ScIL/pC,~ti(Tl - TO), then Eqs. 10.5-6 to 8 become Zone I dO1 (Z < 0) = 0 (10.5-15) Zone 11 (o<z<I) -- d@I1 - j,gqO) dZ (10.5-16) d@III Zone I11 (Z>1) -- - 0 (10.5-17) dZ for which we need three boundary conditions: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: 1.6 Heat Conduction Through Composite Walls 303 Zone I1 in which heat is produced by Zone I chemical reaction Zone I11 Dimensionless axial coordinate Z = z/L Fig. 10.5-2. Predicted temperature profiles in a fixed-bed axial-flow reactor when the heat production varies linearly with the temperature and when there is negligible axial diffusion. The above first-order, separable differential equations, with boundary conditions, are easily solved to get Zone I Zone I1 Zone I11 These results are shown in Fig. 10.5-2 for a simple choice for the source function- namely, F(0) = @-which is reasonable for small changes in temperature, if the reaction rate is insensitive to concentration. Here in this section we ended up discarding the axial conduction terms. In Problem 10B.18, these terms are not discarded, and then the solution shows that there is some preheating (or precooling) in region I. 510.6 HEAT CONDUCTION THROUGH COMPOSITE WALLS In industrial heat transfer problems one is often concerned with conduction through walls made up of layers of various materials, each with its own characteristic thermal conductivity. In this section we show how the various resistances to heat transfer are combined into a total resistance. In Fig. 10.6-1 we show a composite wall made up of three materials of different thicknesses, x, - x,, x, - x,, and x, - x,, and different thermal conductivities k,,, k,,, and k2,. At x = x,, substance 01 is in contact with a fluid with ambient temperature T,, and at x = x,, substance 23 is in contact with a fluid at temperature Tb. The heat transfer at the boundaries x = xo and x = x, is given by Newton's \"law of cooling\" with heat transfer 304 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow Sub- Substance stance Substance 1 Fluid ------ 0 xo XI x2 x3 Distance, x --+ Fig. 10.6-1. Heat conduction through a composite wall, located be- tween two fluid streams at temperatures T, and Tb. coefficients ho and h3, respectively. The anticipated temperature profile is sketched in Fig. 10.6-1. First we set up the energy balance for the problem. Since we are dealing with heat conduction in a solid, the terms containing velocity in the e vector can be discarded, and the only relevant contribution is the q vector, describing heat conduction. We first write the energy balance for a slab of volume WH Ax Region 01 : ~x~xW - qxlx+~x~ = 0 (10.6-1) which states that the heat entering at x must be equal to the heat leaving at x + Ax, since no heat is produced within the region. After division by WH Ax and taking the limit as Ax + 0, we get Region 01 : dqx -- - 0 (10.6-2) dx Integration of this equation gives Region 01 : q, = q, (a constant) (1 0.6-3) The constant of integration, qo, is the heat flux at the plane x = xo. The development in Eqs. 10.6-1,2, and 3 can be repeated for regions 12 and 23 with continuity conditions on q, at interfaces, so that the heat flux is constant and the same for all three slabs: Regions 01,12,23: qX = 40 (10.6-4) with the same constant for each of the regions. We may now introduce a Fourier's law for each of the three regions and get Region 01: - Region 12: - Region 23: - g10.6 Heat Conduction Through Composite Walls 305 We now assume that k,,, k,,, and k2, are constants. Then we integrate each equation over the entire thickness of the relevant slab of material to get Region 01: Region 12: Region 23: In addition we have the two statements regarding the heat transfer at the surfaces ac- cording to Newton's law of cooling: At surface 0: At surface 3: Addition of these last five equations then gives Sometimes this result is rewritten in a form reminiscent of Newton's law of cooling, ei- ther in terms of the heat flux qo (J/m2 s) or the heat flow Q, U/s): The quantity U, called the \"overall heat transfer coefficient,\" is given then by the follow- ing famous formula for the \"additivity of resistances\": Here we have generalized the formula to a system with n slabs of material. Equations 10.6-15 and 16 are useful for calculating the heat transfer rate through a composite wall separating two fluid streams, when the heat transfer coefficients and thermal conductivi- ties are known. The estimation of heat transfer coefficients is discussed in Chapter 14. In the above development it has been tacitly assumed that the solid slabs are con- tiguous with no intervening \"air spaces.\" If the solid surfaces touch each other only at several points, the resistance to heat transfer will be appreciably increased. Develop a formula for the overall heat transfer coefficient for the composite cylindrical pipe wall shown in Fig. 10.6-2. Composite Cylindrical Walls SOLUTION An energy balance on a shell of volume 2m-L Ar for region 01 is Region 01: q,l, - 2mL - q,l,+A,. 2r(r + Ar)L = 0 306 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow which can also be written as Region 01: Fig. 10.6-2. Heat conduction through a lami- nated tube with a fluid at temperature T, in- side the tube and temperature Tb outside. Dividing by 2.rrL Ar and taking the limit as Ar goes to zero gives Region 01: d F ('4,) = 0 (10.6-19) Integration of this equation gives in which ro is the inner radius of region 01, and 90 is the heat flux there. In regions 12 and 23, rq, is equal to the same constant. Application of Fourier's law to the three regions gives Region 01: dT -kolr - = r,q, (10.6-21) dr Region 12: dT - k,,r - = r,qo (10.6-22) dr Region 23: dT - k23~ - = TogD dr (10.6-23) If we assume that the thermal conductivities in the three annular regions are constants, then each of the above three equations can be integrated across its region to give Region 10: Region 12: s10.7 Heat Conduction in a Cooling Fin 307 Region 23: At the two fluid-solid interfaces we can write Newton's law of cooling: Surface 0: Surface 3: Addition of the preceding five equations gives an equation for T, - T,. Then the equation is solved for qo to give We now define an \"overall heat transfer coefficient based on the inner surface\" Uo by Combination of the last two equations gives, on generalizing to a system with n annular layers, The subscript \"0\" on Uo indicates that the overall heat transfer coefficient is referred to the radius ro. 510.7 HEAT CONDUCTION IN A COOLING FIN' Another simple, but practical application of heat conduction is the calculation of the effi- ciency of a cooling fin. Fins are used to increase the area available for heat transfer be- tween metal walls and poorly conducting fluids such as gases. A simple rectangular fin is shown in Fig. 10.7-1. The wall temperature is T, and the ambient air temperature is T,. wall temperature known to be T, Fig. 10.7-1. A simple cooling fin with B<<LandB<< W. For further information on fins, see M. Jakob, Heat Transfer, Vol. I, Wiley, New York (19491, Chapter 11; and H. D. Baehr and K. Stephan, Heat and Mass Transfeu, Springer, Berlin (1998), 52.2.3. 308 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow A reasonably good description of the system may be obtained by approximating the true physical situation by a simplified model: True situation Model 1. T is a function of x, y, and z, but the 1. dependence on z is most important. 2. A small quantity of heat is lost from the 2. fin at the end (area 2BW) and at the edges (area (2BL + 2BL). 3. The heat transfer coefficient is a function 3. of position. T is a function of z alone. No heat is lost from the end or from the edges. The heat flux at the surface is given by q, = h(T - T,), where h is constant and T depends on z. The energy balance is made over a segment Az of the bar. Since the bar is stationary, the terms containing v in the combined energy flux vector e may be discarded, and the only contribution to the energy flux is q. Therefore the energy balance is Division by 2BW Az and taking the limit as Az approaches zero gives We now insert Fourier's law (q, = -kdT/dz), in which k is the thermal conductivity of the metal. If we assume that k is constant, we then get This equation is to be solved with the boundary conditions B.C. 1: at z = 0, T = T, B.C. 2: atz=L, -- dTO dz We now introduce the following dimensionless quantities: T - T, @=-- - dimensionless temperature Tw - T', Z 5 = - L = dimensionless distance 2 - hL2 N - - = dimensionless heat transfer coefficient2 kB (10.7-8) The problem then takes the form -- d2@ - N20 with @Ii=. = 1 and - (10.7-9,10,11) dl2 The quantity may be rewritten as N2 = (hL/k)(L/B) = Bi(L/B), where Bi is called the Biot number, named after Jean Baptiste Biot (1774-1862) (pronounced \"Bee-oh\"). Professor of physics at the CollPge de France, he received the Rumford Medal for his development of a simple, nondestructive test to determine sugar concentration. s10.7 Heat Conduction in a Cooling Fin 309 Equation 10.7-9 may be integrated to give hyperbolic functions (see Eq. C.l-4 and 9C.5). When the two integration constants have been determined, we get O = cosh N{ - (tanh N) sinh N{ (10.7-12) This may be rearranged to give cosh N(1 - 5) cosh N This result is reasonable only if the heat lost at the end and at the edges is negligible. The \"effectiveness\" of the fin surface is defined3 by actual rate of heat loss from the fin \" = rate of heat loss from an isothermal fin at T,. (10.7-14) For the problem being considered here is then in which N is the dimensionless quantity defined in Eq. 10.7-8.

Jakob, Heat Transfer, Vol. I, Wiley, New York (19491, p. 235. 310 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow SOLUTION The thermocouple well wall of thickness B is in contact with the gas stream on one side only, and the tube thickness is small compared with the diameter. Hence the temperature distribu- tion along this wall will be about the same as that along a bar of thickness 2B, in contact with the gas stream on both sides. According to Eq. 10.7-13, the temperature at the end of the well (that registered by the thermocouple) satisfies Hence the actual ambient gas temperature is obtained by solving this equation for T,: and the result is Therefore, the reading is 10 I?' too low. This example has focused on one kind of error that can occur in thermometry. Fre- quently a simple analysis, such as the foregoing, can be used to estimate the measurement errors4 510.8 FORCED CONVECTION In the preceding sections the emphasis has been placed on heat conduction in solids. In this and the following section we study two limiting types of heat transport in flu- ids: forced convection and free convection (also called natural convection). The main dif- ferences between these two modes of convection are shown in Fig. 10.8-1. Most industrial heat transfer problems are usually put into either one or the other of these two limiting categories. In some problems, however, both effects must be taken into account, and then we speak of mixed convection (see 514.6 for some empiricisms for handling this situation). In this section we consider forced convection in a circular tube, a limiting case of which is simple enough to be solved analyti~all~.',~ A viscous fluid with physical prop- erties (p, k, p, Cp) assumed constant is in laminar flow in a circular tube of radius R. For z < 0 the fluid temperature is uniform at the inlet temperature TI. For z > 0 there is a constant radial heat flux q, = -qo at the wall. Such a situation exists, for example, when a pipe is wrapped uniformly with an electrical heating coil, in which case qo is positive. If the pipe is being chilled, then q,, has to be taken as negative. As indicated in Fig. 10.8-1, the first step in solving a forced convection heat transfer problem is the calculation of the velocity profiles in the system. We have seen in 52.3 For further discussion, see M. Jakob, Heat Transfer, Vol. 11, Wiley, New York (1949), Chapter 33, pp. 147-201. A. Eagle and R. M. Ferguson, Proc. Roy. Soc.

The flow patterns are determined by the buoyant force on the heated fluid 2. The velocity profiles and temperature profiles are interdependent 3. The Nusselt number depends on the Grashof and Prandtl numbers (see Chapter 14) Fig. 10.8-1. A comparison of forced and free convection in non- isothermal systems. how this may be done for tube flow by using the shell balance method. We know that the velocity distribution so obtained is v, = 0, v, = 0, and This parabolic distribution is valid sufficiently far downstream from the inlet that the en- trance length has been exceeded. In this problem, heat is being transported in both the r and the z directions. There- fore, for the energy balance we use a \"washer-shaped\" system, which is formed by the intersection of an annular region of thickness Ar with a slab of thickness Az (see Fig. 10.8- 2). In this problem, we are dealing with a flowing fluid, and therefore all terms in the e vector will be retained. The various contributions to Eq. 10.1-1 are Total energy in at r e,l, 2mAz = (2me,)Jr Az (10.8-2) Total energy out at r + Ar erlr+hr 27dr + Ar)Az = (2~re,)),+~~ AZ (10.8-3) Total energy in at z ezlZ -2mAr (10.8-4) Total energy out at z + Az eZlz+~, 2m.A~ (10.8-5) Work done on fluid by gravity pv,g, 2.rruArA.z (10.8-6) The last contribution is the rate at which work is done on the fluid within the ring by gravity-that is, the force per unit volume pg, times the volume 2m Ar Az multiplied by the downward velocity of the fluid. 312 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow I u Fluid inlet temperature T: Fig. 10.8-2. Heating of a fluid in laminar flow through a cir- cular tube, showing the annular ring over which the energy balance is made. The energy balance is obtained by summing these contributions and equating the sum to zero. Then we divide by 2v Ar Az to get In the limit as Ar and Az go to zero, we find The subscript z in g, has been omitted, since the gravity vector is acting in the +z direc- tion. Next we use Eqs. 9.8-6 and 9.8-8 to write out the expressions for the r- and z-compo- nents of the combined energy flux vector, using the fact that the only nonzero compo- nent of v is the axial component v,: Substituting these flux expressions into Eq. 10.8-8 and using the fact that v, depends only on r gives, after some rearrangement, The second bracket is exactly zero, as can be seen from Eq. 3.6-4, which is the z-component s10.8 Forced Convection 313 term containing the viscosity is the viscous heating, which we shall neglect in this dis- cussion. The last term in the first bracket, corresponding to heat conduction in the axial direction, will be omitted, since we know from experience that it is usually small in com- parison with the heat convection in the axial direction. Therefore, the equation that we want to solve here is This partial differential equation, when solved, describes the temperature in the fluid as a function of r and z. The boundary conditions are B.C. 1: at r = 0, T = finite (10.8-13) B.C. 2: dT at r = R, k - = qo (constant) dr (10.8-14) B.C. 3: at z = 0, T = TI (10.8-15) We now put the problem statement into dimensionless form. The choice of the dimen- sionless quantities is arbitrary. We choose Generally one tries to select dimensionless quantities so as to minimize the number of parameters in the final problem formulation. In this problem the choice of 5 = r/R is a natural one, because of the appearance of r/R in the differential equation. The choice for the dimensionless temperature is suggested by the second and third boundary condi- tions. Having specified these two dimensionless variables, the choice of dimensionless axial coordinate follows naturally. The resulting problem statement, in dimensionless form, is now with boundary conditions B.C. 1: at t = 0, (3 = finite (10.8-20) B.C. 2: - 1 at(= I, --- at (10.8-21) B.C. 3: at 5 = 0, a = o (10.8-22) The partial differential equation in Eq. 10.8-19 has been solved for these boundary condi- tions: but in this section we do not give the complete solution. It is, however, instructive to obtain the asymptotic solution to Eq. 10.8-19 for large 5. After the fluid is sufficiently far downstream from the beginning of the heated section, one expects that the constant heat flux through the wall will result in a rise of the fluid temperature that is linear in 5. One further expects that the shape of the temperature pro- files as a function of ,$ will ultimately not undergo further change with increasing (see Fig. 10.8-3). Hence a solution of the following form seems reasonable for large 6: in which C, is a constant to be determined presently. %. Siegel, E. M. Sparrow, and T. M. Hallman, Appl. Sci. Research, A7,386-392 (1958).

Sketch showing how one expects the temperature T(r, z) to look for the system shown in Fig. 10.8-2 when the fluid is heated by means of a heating coil wrapped uniformly around the tube (corresponding to qo positive). The function in Eq. 10.8-23 is clearly not the complete solution to the problem; it does allow the partial differential equation and boundary conditions 1 and 2 to be satis- fied, but clearly does not satisfy boundary condition 3. Hence we replace the latter by an integral condition (see Fig. 10.8-41, Condition 4: 21~Xzq~ = /021 loR - T,)u,r dr dB (1 0.8-24) or, in dimensionless form, This condition states that the energy entering through the walls over a distance 5 is the same as the difference between the energy leaving through the cross section at 5 and that entering at 5 = 0. Substitution of the postulated function of Eq. 10.8-23 into Eq. 10.8-19 leads to the fol- lowing ordinary differential equation for (see Eq. C.l-11): s10.8 Forced Convection 315 Uniform Plane at arbitrary temperature TI downstream position z No energy enters here, ~eat'in by Energy leaving here is since datum temperature heating coil was chosen to be TI is 2rRzqO Fig. 10.8-4.

This equation may be integrated twice with respect to 5 and the result substituted into Eq. 10.8-23 to give The three constants are determined from the conditions 1,2, and 4 above: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: Condition 4: Substitution of these values into Eq. 10.8-27 gives finally Both averages are functions of z. The quantity (T) is the arithmetic average of the temper- atures over the cross section at z. The \"bulk temperature\" Tb is the temperature one would obtain if the tube were chopped off at z and if the fluid issuing forth were col- lected in a container and thoroughly mixed. This average temperature is sometimes re- ferred to as the \"cup-mixing temperature\" or the \"flow-average temperature.\" O(&[) = 45 + 3 - at4 - 5 (10.8-31) This result gives the dimensionless temperature as a function of the dimensionless radial and axial coordinates. It is exact in the limit as 5 + m; for 5 > 0.1, it predicts the local value of O to within about 2%. Once the temperature distribution is known, one can get various derived quantities. There are two kinds of average t$mperatures commonly used in connection with the flow of fluids with constant p and C,: 316 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow Now let us evaluate the local heat transfer driving force, To - Tb, which is the differ- ence between the wall and bulk temperatures at a distance z down the tube: where D is the tube diameter. We may now rearrange this result in the form of a dimen- sionless wall heat flux which, in Chapter 14, will be identified as a Nusselt number. Before leaving this section, we point out that the dimensionless axial coordinate l in- troduced above may be rewritten in the following way: Here D is the tube diameter, Re is the Reynolds number used in Part I, and Pr and Pi. are the Prandtl and Pkclet numbers introduced in Chapter 9. We shall find in Chapter 11 that the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers can be expected to appear in forced convection prob- lems. This point will be reinforced in Chapter 14 in connection with correlations for heat transfer coefficients. 510.9 FREE CONVECTION In 510.8 we gave an example of forced convection. In this section we turn our attention to an elementary free convection problem-namely, the flow between two parallel walls maintained at different temperatures (see Fig. 10.9-1). A fluid with density p and viscosity p is located between two vertical walls a dis- tance 2B apart. The heated wall at y = -B is maintained at temperature T,, and the cooled wall at y = + B is maintained at temperature TI. It is assumed that the tempera- ture difference is sufficiently small that terms containing (An2 can be neglected. Because of the temperature gradient in the system, the fluid near the hot wall rises and that near the cold wall descends. The system is closed at the top and bottom, so that the fluid is continuously circulating between the plates. The mass rate of flow of the Fig. 10.9-1. Laminar free convection flow between two vertical plates at two different temperatures. The velocity is a cubic function of the coordinate y. 510.9 Free Convection 317 fluid in the upward-moving stream is the same as that in the downward-moving stream. The plates are presumed to be very tall, so that end effects near the top and bot- tom can be disregarded. Then for all practical purposes the temperature is a function of y alone. An energy balance can now be made over a thin slab of fluid of thickness Ay, using the y-component of the combined energy flux vector e as given in Eq. 9.8-6. The term containing the kinetic energy and enthalpy can be disregarded, since the y-component of the v vector is zero. The y-component of the term [T . vl is rYv, = -p(dv,/dy)v,, which would lead to the viscous heating contribution discussed in 510.4. However, in the very slow flows encountered in free convection, this term will be extremely small and can be neglected. The energy balance then leads to the equation for constant k. The temperature equation is to be solved with the boundary conditions: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: The solution to this problem is in which AT = T, - TI is the difference of the wall temperatures, and = +(T, + T2) is their arithmetic mean. By making a momentum balance over the same slab of thickness Ay, one arrives at a differential equation for the velocity distribution Here the viscosity has been assumed constant (see Problem 10B.ll for a solution with temperature-dependent viscosity). The phenomenon of free convection results from the fact that when the fluid is heated, the density (usually) decreases and the fluid rises. The mathematical description of the system must take this essential feature of the phenomenon into account. Because the temperature difference AT = T2 - TI is taken to be small in this problem, it can be ex- pected that the density changes in the system will be small. This suggests that we should expand p in a Taylor series about the temperature T = f (T, + T2) thus: Here 5 and p are the density and coefficient of volume expansion evaluated at the tem- perature T. The coefficient of volume expansion is defined as We now introduce the \"Taylor-made\" equation of state of Eq. 10.9-6 (keeping two terms only) into the equation of motion in Eq. 10.9-5 to get 318 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow This equation describes the balance amonx the viscous force, the pressure force, the gravity force, and the buoyant force -&3(T - T) (all per unit volume). Into this we now substitute the temperature distribution given in Eq. 10.9-4 to get the differential equation which is to be solved with the boundary conditions B.C. 1: B.C. 2: aty= -B, v,=O aty = +B, v, = 0 The solution is We now require that the net mass flow in the z direction be zero, that is, Substitution of v, from Eq. 10.9-12 and p from Eqs. 10.9-6 and 4 into this integral leads to the conclusion that when terms containing the square of the small quantity AT are neglected. Equation 10.9- 14 states that the pressure gradient in the system is due solely to the weight of the fluid, and the usual hydrostatic pressure distribution prevails. Therefore the second term on the right side of Eq. 10.9-12 drops out and the final expression for the velocity distribu- tion is The average velocity in the upward-moving stream is The motion of the fluid is thus a direct result of the buoyant force term in Eq. 10.9-8, as- sociated with the temperature gradient in the system. The velocity distribution of Eq. 10.9-15 is shown in Fig. 10.9-1. It is this sort of velocity distribution that occurs in the air space in a double-pane window or in double-wall panels in buildings. It is also this kind of flow that occurs in the operation of a Clusius-Dickel column used for separating iso- topes or organic liquid mixtures by the combined effects of thermal diffusion and free convection.' Thermal diffusion is the diffusion resulting from a temperature gradient. For a lucid discussion of the Clusius-Dickel column see K. E. Grew and T. L. Ibbs, Thermal Diffusion in Gases, Cambridge University Press (1952), pp. 94-106. Questions for Discussion 319 The velocity distribution in Eq. 10.9-15 may be rewritten using a dimensionless ve- locity 6, = Bv,p/p and a dimensionless coordinate 5 = y/B thus: Here Gr is the dimensionless Gmshof number: defined by where Ap = p, - p,. The second form of the Grashof number is obtained from the first form by using Eq. 10.9-6. The Grashof number is the characteristic group occurring in analyses of free convection, as is shown by dimensional analysis in Chapter 11. It arises in heat transfer coefficient correlations in Chapter 14. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1. Verify that the Brinkman, Biot, Prandtl, and Grashof numbers are dimensionless. 2.

In the manufacture of glass-coated steel pipes, it is common practice first to heat the pipe to the melting range of glass and then to contact the hot pipe surface with glass granules. These granules melt and wet the pipe surface to form a tightly adhering nonporous coat. In one method of preheating the pipe, an electric current is passed along the pipe, with the result that the pipe is heated (as in g10.2). For the purpose of this problem make the following assumptions: (i) The electrical conductivity of the pipe k, is constant over the temperature range of in- terest. The local rate of electrical heat production S, is then uniform throughout the pipe wall. (ii) The top and bottom of the pipe are capped in such a way that heat losses through them are negligible. (iii) Heat loss from the outer surface of the pipe to the surroundings is given by New- ton's law of cooling: q, = h(T, - T,). Here h is a suitable heat transfer coefficient.

Radial temperature gradients in an annular chemical reactor. A catalytic reaction is being carried out at constant pressure in a packed bed between coaxial cylindrical walls with inner radius ro and outer radius r,. Such a configuration occurs when temperatures are measured with a centered thermowell, and is in addition useful for controlling temperature gradients if a thin annulus is used. The entire inner wall is at uniform temperature To, and it can be as- sumed that there is no heat transfer through this surface. The reaction releases heat at a uni- form volumetric rate S, throughout the reactor. The effective thermal conductivity of the reactor contents is to be treated as a constant throughout.

A hot-wire anemometer is essentially a fine wire, usually made of platinum, which is heated electrically and exposed to a flowing fluid. Its temperature, which is a function of the fluid temperature, fluid velocity, and the rate of heating, may be determined by measuring its electrical resistance. It is used for measuring velocities and velocity fluctuations in flow systems. In this problem we analyze the tempera- ture distribution in the wire element. We consider a wire of diameter D and length 2L supported at its ends (z = -L and z = +L) and mounted perpendicular to an air stream. An electric current of density I amp/cm2 flows through the wire, and the heat thus generated is partially lost by convection to the air stream (see Eq. 10.1-2) and partially by conduction toward the ends of the wire. Because of their size and their high electrical and thermal conductivity, the supports are not appreciably heated by the current, but remain at the temperature TL , which is the same as that of the ap- proaching air stream. Heat loss by radiation is to be neglected. 328 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow (a) Derive an equation for the steady-state temperature distribution in the wire, assuming that T depends on z alone; that is, the radial temperature variation in the wire is neglected.

Heating of an electric wire with temperature-dependent electrical and thermal conductiv- it^.^ Find the temperature distribution in an electrically heated wire when the thermal and electrical conductivities vary with temperature as follows: Here ko and k, are the values of the conductivities at temperature To, and O = (T - To)/To is a dimensionless temperature rise. The coefficients ai and Pi are constants. Such series expan- sions are useful over moderate temperature ranges. (a) Because of the temperature gradient in the wire, the electrical conductivity is a function of position, k,(r). Therefore, the current density is also a function of Y: I(r) = ke(r) . (EIL), and the electrical heat source also is position dependent: Se(r) = k,(r) (EIL)'. The equation for the temperature distribution is then -- --- The solution given here was suggested by L. J. F. Broer (personal communication, 20 August 1958). 330 Chapter 10 Shell Energy Balances and Temperature Distributions in Solids and Laminar Flow Now introduce the dimensionless quantities 6 = r/R and B = kJ?.2E2/k,,~2~o and show that Ea. 10C.l-3 then becomes When the power series expressions for the conductivities are inserted into this equation we get This is the equation that is to be solved for the dimensionless temperature distribution. (b) Begin by noting that if all the ai and Pi were zero (that is, both conductivities constant), then Eq. 10C.l-5 would simplify to When this is solved with the boundary conditions that @ = finite at 4 = 0,-and O = 0 at 5 = 1, we get 0 = $B(l - f) (lOC.l-7) This is Eq. 10.2-13 in dimensionless notation. Note that Eq. 10C.-5 will have the solution in Eq. 10C.l-7 for small values of B-that is, for weak heat sources. For stronger heat sources, postulate that the temperature distribution can be expressed as a power series in the dimensionless heat source strength B: Here the 0, are functions of 6 but not of B. Substitute Eq. 10C.1-8 into Eq. 10C.l-5, and equate the coefficients of like powers of B to get a set of ordinary differential equations for the @,,,with n = 1,2,3, . . . . These may be solved with the boundary conditions that O,, = finite at 6 = 0 and 0, = 0 at 5 = 1. In this way obtain where 0(B2) means \"terms of the order of B2 and higher.\" (c) For materials that are described by the Wiedemann-Franz-Lorenz law (see §9.5), the ratio k/kJ is a constant (independent of temperature). Hence Combine this with Eqs. 10C.l-1 and 2 to get Equate coefficients of equal powers of the dimensionless temperature to get relations among the ai and the Pi: a, = PI - I, a, = p, + p,, and so on. Use these relations to get 10C.2. Viscous heating with temperature-dependent viscosity and thermal conductivity (Figs. 10.4-1 and 2). Consider the flow situation shown in Fig. 10.4-2.

In Eq. 2B.11-3 there is an expression for the torque 9 required to maintain an angular velocity fl in a cone-and-plate viscometer with included angle t,b0 (see Fig. 2B.11). It is desired to obtain a correction factor to account for the change in torque caused by the change in viscosity resulting from viscous heating. This effect can be a disturbing factor in viscometric measurements, causing errors as large as 20%. (a) Adapt the result of Problem 10C.2 to the cone-and-plate system as was done in Problem 2B.ll(a).

We obtained the temperature profiles, as well as some derived properties such as average temperature and energy fluxes. In this chapter we generalize the shell energy balance and obtain the equation of energy, a partial differ- ential equation that describes the transport of energy in a homogeneous fluid or solid. This chapter is also closely related to Chapter 3, where we introduced the equation of continuity (conservation of mass) and the equation of motion (conservation of mo- mentum). The addition of the equation of energy (conservation of energy) allows us to extend our problem-solving ability to include nonisothermal systems. We begin in §11.1 by deriving the equation of change for the total energy. As in Chapter 10, we use the combined energy flux vector e in applying the law of conserva- tion of energy. In 511.2 we subtract the mechanical energy equation (given in 53.3) from the total energy equation to get an equation of change for the internal energy. From the latter we can get an equation of change for the temperature, and it is this kind of energy equation that is most commonly used. Although our main concern in this chapter will be with the various energy equa- tions just mentioned, we find it useful to discuss in 511.3 an approximate equation of motion that is convenient for solving problems involving free convection. In 511.4 we summarize the equations of change encountered up to this point. Then we proceed to illustrate the use of these equations in a series of examples, in which we begin with the general equations and discard terms that are not needed. In this way we have a standard procedure for setting up and solving problems. Finally, in 511.5 we extend the dimensional analysis discussion of 53.7 and show how additional dimensionless groups arise in heat transfer problems. $11.1 THE ENERGY EQUATION The equation of change for energy is obtained by applying the law of conservation of en- ergy to a small element of volume Ax Ay Az (see Fig. 3.1-1) and then allowing the dimen- sions of the volume element to become vanishingly small. The law of conservation of 334 Chapter 11 The Equations of Change for Nonisothermal Systems energy is an extension of the first law of classical thermodynamics, which concerns the difference in internal energies of two equilibrium states of a closed system because of the heat added to the system and the work done on the system (that is, the familiar Au=Q+W).' Here we are interested in a stationary volume element, fixed in space, through which a fluid is flowing. Both kinetic energy and internal energy may be entering and leaving the system by convective transport. Heat may enter and leave the system by heat conduction as well. As we saw in Chapter 9, heat conduction is fundamentally a molecu- lar process. Work may be done on the moving fluid by the stresses, and this, too, is a molecular process. This term includes the work done by pressure forces and by viscous forces. In addition, work may be done on the system by virtue of the external forces, such as gravity. We can summarize the preceding paragraph by writing the conservation of energy in words as follows: net rate of kinetic net rate of heat E; kinetic and of = [nd energy internal addition + [;:=by molecular + by convective transport (conduction) rate of work rate of work done on system done on system by molecular + by external (mechanisms (i.e., by stresses) Lrces (e.g., by gravity) 1 (11.1-1) In developing the energy equation we will use the e vector of Eq. 9.8-5 or 6, which in- cludes the first three brackets on the right side of Eq. 11.1-1. Several comments need to be made before proceeding: (i) By kinetic energy we mean that energy associated with the observable motion of the fluid, which is ipv2 = gp(v . v), per unit volume. Here v is the fluid velocity vector. (ii) By internal energy we mean the kinetic energies of the constituent molecules cal- culated in a frame moving with the velocity v, plus the energies associated with the vibrational and rotational motions of the molecules and also the energies of interaction among all the molecules. It is assumed that the internal energy U for a flowing fluid is the same function of temperature and density as that for a fluid at equilibrium. Keep in mind that a similar assumption is made for the thermodynamic pressure p(p, T) for a flowing fluid. (iii) The potential energy does not appear in Eq. 11.1-1, since we prefer instead to consider the work done on the system by gravity. At the end of this section, however, we show how to express this work in terms of the potential energy. (iv) In Eq. 10.1-1 various source terms were included in the shell energy balance. In 510.4 the viscous heat source S, appeared automatically, because the mechani- cal energy terms in e were properly accounted for; the same situation prevails here, and the viscous heating term -(T:VV) will appear automatically in Eq. 11.2-1. The chemical, electrical, and nuclear source terms (S,, S,, and S,) do not appear automatically, since chemical reactions, electrical effects, and nuclear -- -- -- I R. J. Silbey and R. A. Albert~, Physical Chemistry, Wiley, New York, 3rd edition (2001),§2.3. 911.1 The Energy Equation 335 disintegrations have not been included in the energy balance. In Chapter 19, where the energy equation for mixtures with chemical reactions is considered, the chemical heat source S, appears naturally, as does a \"diffusive source term,\" ZJj, . g,). We now translate Eq. 11.1-1 into mathematical terms. The rate of increase of kinetic and internal energy within the volume element Ax Ay Az is Here is the internalAenergy per unit mass (sometimes called the \"specific internal en- ergy\"). The product pU is the internal energy per unit volume, and $v2 = ;p(vz + vi + v:) is the kinetic energy per unit volume. Next we have to know how much energy enters and leaves across the faces of the volume element Ax Ay Az. Keep in mind that the e vector includes the convective transport of kinetic and internal energy, the heat conduction, and the work associated with molecular processes. The rate at which work is done on the fluid by the external force is the dot product of the fluid velocity v and the force acting on the fluid (p Ax Ay Az)g, or We now insert these various contributions into Eq. 11.1-1 and then divide by Ax Ay Az. When Ax, Ay, and Az are allowed to go to zero, we get This equation may be written more compactly in vector notation as Next we insert the expression for the e vector from Eq. 9.8-5 to get the equation of energy: rate of increase of energy per unit volume - (V . pv) rate of work done on fluid per unit volume by pressure forces rate of energy addition rate of energy addition per unit volume by per unit volume by convective transport heat conduction - (V . [T . vl) + p(v g) rate of work done rate of work done on fluid per unit on fluid per unit volume by viscous volume by external forces forces This equation does not include nuclear, radiative, electromagnetic, or chemical forms of energy. For viscoelastic fluids, the next-to-last term has to be reinterpreted by replacing \"viscous\" by \"viscoelastic.\" Equation 11.1-7 is the main result of this section, and it provides the basis for the re- mainder of the chapter. Th? equation can be written in another form to include the poten- tial energy per unit mass, @, which has been defined earlier by g = -V@ (see 33.3). For moderate elevation changes, this gives 6 = gh, where h is a coordinate in the direction 336 Chapter 11 The Equations of Change for Nonisothermal Systems opposed to the gravitational field. For terrestrial problems, where the gravitational field is independent of time, we can write p(v g) = - (pv . v&) (1 1 .l-8) = -(V . pv6) + &V . pv) Use vector identity in Eq. A.4-19 Use Eq. 3.1-4 d\" = -(V spv9) - &3@) Use 6 independent of t When this result is inserted into Eq. 11.1-7 we get d (&u2 + pii + p6) = -(V . (ipv2 + pG + ,06)v) - (v . q) - (0 . pv) - (V [T - v]) (11.1-9) Sometimes it is convenient to have the energy equation in this form. 511.2 SPECIAL FORMS OF THE ENERGY EQUATION The most useful form of the energy equation is one in which the temperature appears. The object of this section is to arrive at such an equation, which can be used for predic- tion of temperature profiles. First we subtract the mechanical energy equation in Eq. 3.3-1 from the energy equa- tion in 11.1-7. This leads to the following equation of change for internal energy: rate of net rate of rate of internal increase in addition of energy addition internal internal energy by heat conduction, energy by convective per unit per unit transport, volume volume per unit volume - p(V v) - (T:VV) reversible rate irreversible rate of internal of internal energy energy increase increase per unit per unit volume volume by by compression viscous dissipation It is now of interest to compare the mechanical energy equation of Eq. 3.3-1 and the in- ternal energy equation of Eq. 11.2-1. Note that the terms p(V . v) and (T:VV) appear in both equations-but with opposite signs. Therefore, these terms describe the intercon- version of mechanical and thermal energy. The term p(V . v) can be either positive or negative, depending on whether the fluid is expanding or contracting; therefore it repre- sents a reversible mode of interchange. On the other hand, for Newtonian fluids, the quantity - (T:VV) is always positive (see Eq. 3.3-3) and therefore represents an irreversible degradation of mechanical into internal energy. For viscoelastic fluids, discussed in Chapter 8, the quantity -(T:VV) does not have to be positive, since some energy may be stored as elastic energy. We pointed out in s3.5 that the equations of change can be written somewhat more compactly by using the substantial derivative (see Table 3.5-1). Equation 11.2-1 can be 51 1.2 Special Forms of the Energy Equation 337 put in the substantial derivative form by using Eq. 3.5-4. This gives, with no further assumptions Next it is convenient to switch from intynalnenergy to ythalpy, as we did at the very end of 59.8. That is, in Eq. 11.2-2 we set U = H - pV = H - (p/p), making the standard assumption that thermodynamic formulas derived from equilibrium thermodynamics may be applied locally for nonequilibrium systems. When we substitute this formula into Eq. 11.2-2 and use the equation of continuity (Eq. A of Table 3.5-I), we get Next we may use Eq. 9.8-7, which presumes that the enthalpy is a function of p and T (this restricts the subsequent development to Newtonian fluids). Then we may get an ex- pression for the change in the enthalpy in an element of fluid moving with the fluid ve- locity, which is Equating the right sides of Eqs. 11.2-3 and 11.2-4 gives This is the equation of change for temperature, in terms of the heat flux vector q and the viscous momentum flux tensor T. To use this equation we need expressions for these fluxes: (i) When Fourier's law of Eq. 9.1-4 is used, the term -(V q) becomes +(V . kVT), or, if the thermal conductivity is assumed constant, +kV2T. (ii) When Newton's law of Eq. 1.2-7 is used, the term -(T:VV) becomes pa, + KIP,, the quantity given explicitly in Eq. 3.3-3. We do not perform the substitutions here, because the equation of change for tempera- ture is almost never used in its complete generality. We now discuss several special restricted versions of the equation of change for tem- perature. In all of these we use Fourier's law with constant k, and we omit the viscous dissipation term, since it is important only in flows with enormous velocity gradients: (i) For an ideal gas, (d In p/d In T), = -1, and Or, if use is made of the relation ?, - rv = R, the equation of state in the form pM = pXT, and the equation of continuity as written in Eq. A of Table 3.5-1, we get 338 Chapter 11 The Equations of Change for Nonisothermal Systems (ii) For a fluid flowing in a constant pressure system, Dp/Dt = 0, and (iii) For a fluid with constant density,' (d In p/d In Dp = 0, and (iv) For a stationa y solid, v is zero and - dl- pC - = kV2T P dt (1 1.2-10) These last five equations are the ones most frequently encountered in textbooks and re- search publications. Of course, one can always go back to Eq. 11.2-5 and develop less re- strictive equations when needed. Also, one can add chemical, electrical, and nuclear source terms on an ad hoc basis, as was done in Chapter 10. Equation 11.2-10 is the heat conduction equation for solids, and much has been writ- ten about this famous equation developed first by ~ourier.~ The famous reference work by Carslaw and Jaeger deserves special mention. It contains hundreds of solutions of this equation for a wide variety of boundary and initial conditions.\" g11.3 THE BOUSSINESQ EQUATION OF MOTION FOR FORCED AND FREE CONVECTION The equation of motion given in Eq. 3.2-9 (or Eq. B of Table 3.5-1) is valid for both isothermal and nonisothermal flow. In nonisothermal flow, the fluid density and viscos- ity depend in general on temperature as well as on pressure. The variation in the density is particularly important because it gives rise to buoyant forces, and thus to free convec- tion, as we have already seen in s10.9. The buoyant force appears automatically when an equation of state is inserted into the equation of motion. For example, we can use the simplified equation of state intro- duced in Eq. 10.9-6 (this is called the Boussinesq approximation)' in which p is -(l/p)(~p/dTIP evaluated at T = T. This equation is obtained by writing the Taylor series for p as a function of T, considering the pressure p to be constant, and keeping only the first two terms of the series. When Eq. 11.3-1 is substituted into the pg term (but not into the p(Dv/Dt) term) of Eq. B of Table 3.5-1, we get the Boussinesq equation: ' The assumption of constant density is made here, instead of the less stringent assumption that (d In p/d In T), = 0, since Eq. 11.2-9 is customarily used along with Eq. 3.1-5 (equation of continuity for constant density) and Eq. 3.5-6 (equation of motion for constant density and viscosity). Note that the hypothetical equation of state p = constant has to be supplemented by the statement that (dp/dT), = finite, in order to permit the evaluation of certain thermodynamic derivatives. For example, the relation leads to the result that k, = k, for the \"incompressible fluid thus defined. J. B.

It describes the limiting cases of forced convection and free convection (see Fig. 10.8-I), and the re- gion between these extremes as well. In forced convection the buoyancy term -@&T - T) is neglected. In free convection (or natural convection) the term (-Vp + pg) is small, and omitting it is usually appropriate, particularly for vertical, rectilinear flow and for the flow near submerged objects in large bodies of fluid. Setting (-Vp + pg) equal to zero is equivalent to assuming that the pressure distribution is just that for a fluid at rest. It is also customary to replace p on the left side of Eq. 11.3-2 by p. This substitution has been successful for free convection at moderate temperature differences. Under these con- ditions the fluid motion is slow, and the acceleration term Dv/Dt is small compared to g. However, in systems where the acceleration term is large with respect to g, one must also use Eq. 11.3-1 for the density on the left side of the equation of motion. This is par- ticularly true, for example, in gas turbines and near hypersonic missiles, where the term (p - p)Dv/Dt may be at least as important as pg. $11.4 USE OF THE EQUATIONS OF CHANGE TO SOLVE STEADY-STATE PROBLEMS In 593.1 to 3.4 and in 591 1.1 to 11.3 we have derived various equations of change for a pure fluid or solid. It seems appropriate here to present a summary of these equations for future reference. Such a summary is given in Table 11.4-1, with most of the equations given in both the d/dt form and the D/Dt form. Reference is also made to the first place where each equation has been presented. Although Table 11.4-1 is a useful summary, for problem solving we use the equa- tions written out explicitly in the several commonly used coordinate systems. This has been done in Appendix B, and readers should thoroughly familiarize themselves with the tables there. In general, to describe the nonisothermal flow of a Newtonian fluid one needs the equation of continuity the equation of motion (containing p and K) the equation of energy (containing p, K, and k) the thermal equation of state (p = p(p, TI) the caloric equation of state (4 = k&p, T)) as well as expressions for the density and temperature dependence of the viscosity, di- latational viscosity, and thermal conductivity. In addition one needs the boundary and initial conditions. The entire set of equations can then-in principle-be solved to get the pressure, density, velocity, and temperature as functions of position and time. If one wishes to solve such a detailed problem, numerical methods generally have to be used. Often one may be content with a restricted solution, for making an order-of-magni- tude analysis of a problem, or for investigating limiting cases prior to doing a complete numerical solution. This is done by making some standard assumptions: (i) Assumption of constant physical properties. If it can be assumed that all physical properties are constant, then the equations become considerably simpler, and in some cases analytical solutions can be found. (ii) Assumption of zero fluxes. Setting T and q equal to zero may be useful for (a) adi- abatic flow processes in systems designed to minimize frictional effects (such as Venturi meters and turbines), and (b) high-speed flows around streamlined ob- jects. The solutions obtained would be of no use for describing the situation near fluid-solid boundaries, but may be adequate for analysis of phenomena far from the solid boundaries.

We restrict ourselves here to steady- state flow problems and consider unsteady-state problems in Chapter 12. In each problem we start by listing the postulates that lead us to simplified versions of the equa- tions of change. Show how to set up the equations for the problem considered in 510.8-namely, that of find- ing the fluid temperature profiles for the fully developed laminar flow in a tube. SOLUTION We assume constant physical properties, and we postulate a solution of the following form: v = 6,v,(r), 9 = Wz), and T = T(r, z). Then the equations of change, as given in Appendix B, may be simplified to Continuity: 0 = 0 (11.4-1) Motion: Energy: The equation of continuity is automatically satisfied as a result of the postulates. The equation of motion, when solved as in Example 3.6-1, gives the velocity distribution (the parabolic ve- locity profile). This expression is then substituted into the convective heat transport term on the left side of Eq. 11.4-3 and into the viscous dissipation heating term on the right side. Next, as in 510.8, we make two assumptions: (i) in the z direction, heat conduction is much smaller than heat convection, so that the term d2T/dz2 can be neglected, and (ii) the flow is not sufficiently fast that viscous heating is significant, and hence the term p(dv,/dr)2 can be omitted. When these assumptions are made, Eq. 11.4-3 becomes the same as Eq. 10.8- 12. From that point on, the asymptotic solution, valid for large z only, proceeds as in s10.8. Note that we have gone through three types of restrictive processes: (i) postulates, in which a tentative guess is made as to the form of the solution; (ii) assumptions, in which we elimi- nate some physical phenomena or effects by discarding terms or assuming physical proper- ties to be constant; and (iii) an asymptotic solution, in which we obtain only a portion of the entire mathematical solution. It is important to distinguish among these various kinds of restrictions. Determine the temperature distribution in an incompressible liquid confined between two coaxial cylinders, the outer one of which is rotating at a steady angular velocity Q, (see 510.4 and Example 3.6-3). Use the nomenclature of Example 3.6-3, and consider the radius ratio K to be fairly small so that the curvature of the fluid streamlines must be taken into account. The temperatures of the inner and outer surfaces of the annular region are maintained at T, and TI, respectively, with T, # T,. Assume steady laminar flow, and neglect the tempera- ture dependence of the physical properties. This is an example of a forced convection problem: The equations of continuity and mo- tion are solved to get the velocity distribution, and then the energy equation is solved to get the temperature distribution. This problem is of interest in connection with heat effects in coaxial cylinder viscometers' and in lubrication systems. ' J. R. Van Wazer, J. W. Lyons, K. Y. Kim, and R. E. Colwell, Viscosity and Flow Measurement, Wiley, New York (1963), pp. 82-85. g11.4 Use of the Equations of Change to Solve Steady-State Problems 343 SOLUTION We begin by postulating that v = Zi,v,(r), that 9 = 9(r, z), and that T = T(r). Then the simplifi- cation of the equations of change leads to Eqs. 3.6-20,21, and 22 (the r-, 8-, and z-components of the equation of motion), and the energy equation When the solution to the 0-component of the equation of motion, given in Eq. 3.6-29, is substi- tuted into the energy equation, we get This is the differential equation for the temperature distribution. It may be rewritten in terms of dimensionless quantities by putting The parameter N is closely related to the Brinkman number of 910.4. Equation 11.4-5 now becomes This is of the form of Eq. C.l-11 and has the solution The integration constants are found from the boundary conditions B.C. 1: B.C. 2: Determination of the constants then leads to When N = 0, we obtain the temperature distribution for a motionless cylindrical shell of thickness R(1 - K) with inner and outer temperatures T, and TI. If N is large enough, there will be a maximum in the temperature distribution, located at with the temperature at this point greater than either T, or TI. Although this example provides an illustration of the use of the tabulated equations of change in cylindrical coordinates, in most viscometric and lubrication applications the clear- ance between the cylinders is so small that numerical values computed from Eq. 11.4-13 will not differ substantially from those computed from Eq. 10.4-9. EXAMPLE 11.4-3 A liquid is flowing downward in steady laminar flow along an inclined plane surface, as shown in Figs. 2.2-1 to 3. The free liquid surface is maintained at temperature To, and the solid Steady Flow in a surface at x = 6 is maintained at T,. At these temperatures the liquid viscosity has values po Nonisothermal Film and pb, respectively, and the liquid density and thermal conductivity may be assumed con- stant. Find the velocity distribution in this nonisothermal flow system, neglecting end effects 344 Chapter 11 The Equations of Change for Nonisothermal Systems and recognizing that viscous heating is unimportant in this flow. Assume that the tempera- ture dependence of viscosity may be expressed by an equation of the form p = AeBIT, with A and B being empirical constants; this is suggested by the Eyring theory given in 51.5. We first solve the energy equation to get the temperature profile, and then use the latter to find the dependence of viscosity on position. Then the equation of motion can be solved to get the velocity profile. SOLUTION We postulate that T = T(x) and that v = 6,vJx). Then the energy equation simplifies to This can be integrated between the known terminal temperatures to give The dependence of viscosity on temperature may be written as in which B is a constant, to be determined from experimental data for viscosity versus tem- perature. To get the dependence of viscosity on position, we combine the last two equations to get The second expression is a good approximation if the temperature does not change greatly through the film. When this equation is combined with Eq. 11.4-17, written for T = T,, we then get This is the same as the expression used in Example 2.2-2, if we set a equal to -ln(p,/p,). Therefore we may take over the result from Example 2.2-2 and write the velocity profile as This completes the analysis of the problem begun in Example 2.2-2, by providing the appro- priate value of the constant a. EXAMPLE 11.4-4 Transpiration cooling2 A system with two concentric porous spherical shells of radii KR and R is shown in Fig. 11.4- 1. The inner surface of the outer shell is at temperature T,, and the outer surface of the inner shell is at a lower temperature TK. Dry air at TK is blown outward radially from the inner shell into the intervening space and then through the outer shell. Develop an expression for the re- quired rate of heat removal from the inner sphere as a function of the mass rate of flow of the gas. Assume steady laminar flow and low gas velocity. In this example the equations of continuity and energy are solved to get the temperature distribution. The equation of motion gives information about the pressure distribution in the system. M.

Transpiration cooling. The inner sphere is being cooled by means of a refrigeration coil to maintain its temperature at TK. When air is blown outward, as shown, less refrigeration is required. We postulate that for this system v = 6pr(r), T = T(r), and 9 = Wr). The equation of continuity in spherical coordinates then becomes This equation can be integrated to give 2 wr r pv, = const. = - 4Tr Here w, is the radial mass flow rate of the gas. The r-component of the equation of mofion in spherical coordinates is, from Eq. B.6-7, The viscosity term drops out because of Eq. 11.4-21. Integration of Eq. 11.4-23 then gives Hence the modified pressure 8 increases with r, but only very slightly for the low gas veloc- ity assumed here. The energy equation in terms of the temperature, in spherical coordinates, is, according to Eq. B.9-3, Here we have used Eq. 11.2-8, for which we assume that the thermal conductivity is constant, the pressure is constant, and there is no viscous dissipation-all reasonable assumptions for the problem at hand. When Eq. 11.4-22 for the velocity distribution is used for v, in Eq. 11.4-25, we obtain the following differential equation for the temperature distribution T(r) in the gas between the two shells: 346 Chapter 11 The Equations of Change for Nonisothermal Systems \"3 1.0 Fig. 11.4-2.

This may be integrated, and when the boundary conditions are applied, we get in which Ro = w,Cp/4?~k is a constant with units of length. The rate of heat flow toward the inner sphere is and this is the required rate of heat removal by the refrigerant. Insertion of Fourier's law for the r-component of the heat flux gives Next we evaluate the temperature gradient at the surface with the aid of Eq. 11.4-27 to obtain the expression for the heat removal rate. In the limit that the mass flow rate of the gas is zero, so that R, = 0, the heat removal rate becomes The fractional reduction in heat removal as a result of the transpiration of the gas is then Here 4 = Ro(l - K)/KR = w,Cp(l - K)/~TKR~ is the \"dimensionless transpiration rate.\" Equation 11.4-32 is shown graphically in Fig. 11.4-2. For small values of 6, the quantity (Qo - Q)/Qo approaches the asymptote $4. EXAMPLE 11.4-5 Free-Convection Heat A flat plate of height Hand width W (with W >> H) heated to a temperature To is suspended in a large body of fluid, which is at ambient temperature TI. In the neighborhood of the heated plate the fluid rises because of the buoyant force (see Fig. 11.4-3). From the equations Transfer from a of change, deduce the dependence of the heat loss on the system variables. The physical prop- Vertical Plate erties of the fluid are considered constant, except that the change in density with temperature will be accounted for by the Boussinesq approximation. 1.4 Use of the Equations of Change to Solve Steady-State Problems 347 SOLUTION Fig. 11.4-3. The temperature and velocity profiles the neighborhood of a vertical heated plate. We postulate that v = 6,v,(y, z) + 6,v,(y, z) and that T = T(y, 2). We assume that the heated fluid moves almost directly upward, so that v, << v,. Then the x- and y-components of Eq. 11.3-2 give p = p(z), so that the pressure is given to a very good approximation by -dp/dz - pg = 0, which is the hydrostatic pressure distribution. The remaining equations of change are Continuity Motion Energy ----- in which p and p are evaluated at the ambient temperature TI. The dashed-underlined terms will be omitted on the ground that momentum and energy transport by molecular processes in the z direction is small compared with the corresponding convective terms on the left side of the equations. These omissions should give a satisfactory description of the system except for a small region around the bottom of the plate. With this simplification, the following boundary conditions suffice to analyze the system up to z = H: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: aty=O, v,=v,=O and T=T, asy+ ?m, v,+O and T+T1 at z = 0, v, = 0 Note that the temperature rise appears in the equation of motion and that the velocity distrib- ution appears in the energy equation. Thus these equations are \"coupled.\" Analytic solutions of such coupled, nonlinear differential equations are very difficult, and we content ourselves here with a dimensional analysis approach. To do this we introduce the following dimensionless variables: T - TI 0 = --- = dimensionless temperature To - TI 2 5 = - = dimensionless vertical coordinate H (1 1 .4-40) 348 Chapter 11 The Equations of Change for Nonisothermal Systems 1 /4 ,r, = (&) y = dimensionless horizontal coordinate 9, = (--&)1'2uz = dimensionless vertical velocity (1 1.4-42) pH dy = (z) vy = dimensionless horizontal velocity (1 1.4-43) in which a = k/& and B = F~~(T~ - TI). When the equations of change, without the dashed-underlined terms, are written in terms of these dimensionless variables, we get Continuity Motion Energy The preceding boundary conditions then become B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: One can see immediately from these equations and boundary conditions that the dimension- less velocity components $ and 4, and the dimensionless temperature @ will depend on 7 and l and also on the Prandtl number, Pr. Since the flow is usually very slow in free convec- tion, the terms in which Pr appears will generally be rather small; setting them equal to zero would correspond to the \"creeping flow assumption.\" Hence we expect that the dependence of the solution on the Prandtl number will be weak. The average heat flux from one side of the plate may be written as The integral may now be written in terms of the dimensionless quantities in which the grouping Ra = GrPr is referred to as the Rayleigk number. Because O is a function of 77, l, and Pr, the derivative dO/dv is also a function of ,r,, l, and Pr. Then dO/dq, evaluated at ,r, = 0, depends only on l and Pr. The definite integral over 5 is thus a function of Pr. From the remarks made earlier, we can infer that this function, called C, will be only a weak func- tion of the Prandtl number-that is, nearly a constant. The preceding analysis shows that, even without solving the partial differential equa- tions, we can predict that the average heat flux is proportional to the $-power of the tempera- ture difference (To - TI) and inversely proportional to the +-power of H. Both predictions have been confirmed by experiment. The only thing we could not do was to find C as a func- tion of Pr. g11.4 Use of the Equations of Change to Solve Steady-State Problems 349 Adiabatic Frictionless Processes in an Ideal Gas To determine that function, we have to make experimental measurements or solve Eqs. 11.4-44 to 49. In 1881, Lorenz3 obtained an approximate solution to these equations and found C = 0.548. Later, more refined calculations4 gave the following dependence of C on Pr: Pr 0.73 (air) 1 10 100 1000 C 0.518 0.535 0.620 0.653 0.665 0.670 These values of C are nearly in exact agreement with the best experimental measurements in the laminar flow range (i.e., for GrPr < lo9h5 Develop equations for the relationship of local pressure to density or temperature in a stream of ideal gas in which the momentum flux .r and the heat flux q are negligible. SOLUTION With 7 and q neglected, the equation of energy [Eq. (1) in Table 11.4-11 may be rewritten as For an ideal gas, = RT/M, where M is the molecular weight of the gas, and Eq. 11.4-52 becomes Dividing this equation by p and assuming the molar heat capacity $ = MS to be constant, we can again use the ideal gas law to get Hence the quantity in parentheses is a constant along the path of a fluid element, as is its an- tilogarithm, so that we have TC,/R 1 = p constant (1 1.4-55) This relation applies to all thermodynamic states p, T that a fluid element encounters as it moves along with the fluid. Introducing the definition y = tp/Pv and the ideal gas relations $ - Sv = R and p = pRT/M, one obtains the related expressions p'y-l\"y~-' = constant (1 1.4-56) and pp-Y = constant (1 1.4-57) These last three equations find frequent use in the study of frictionless adiabatic processes in ideal gas dynamics. Equation 11.4-57 is a famous relation well worth remembering. L. Lorenz, Wiedemann's Ann. der Physik u. Chemie, 13,42247,582406 (1881). See also U.

Hence the derivative d In p/d In T = y/(y - 1) following the fluid motion has to be understood to mean (d In p/d In T)s = y/(y - 1). This equation is a standard formula from equilibrium thermodynamics. We consider here the adiabatic expansion6-lo of an ideal gas through a convergent-divergent nozzle under such conditions that a stationary shock wave is formed. The gas enters the noz- zle from a reservoir, where the pressure is po, and discharges to the atmosphere, where the pressure is p,. In the absence of a shock wave, the flow through a well-designed nozzle is vir- tually frictionless (hence isentropic for the adiabatic situation being considered). If, in addi- tion, p,/po is sufficiently small, it is known that the flow is essentially sonic at the throat (the region of minimum cross section) and is supersonic in the divergent portion of the nozzle. Under these conditions the pressure will continually decrease, and the velocity will increase in the direction of the flow, as indicated by the curves in Fig. 11.4-4. However, for any nozzle design there is a range of p,/po for which such an isentropic flow produces a pressure less than p, at the exit. Then the isentropic flow becomes unstable. The simplest of many possibilities is a stationary normal shock wave, shown schematically in the Fig. 11.4-4 as a pair of closely spaced parallel lines.

These changes take place in an extremely thin region, which may therefore be considered locally one-dimensional and laminar, and they are accompanied by a very substantial dissipation of mechanical energy. Viscous dissipation and heat conduction effects are thus concentrated in an extremely small region of the nozzle, and it is the purpose of the example to explore the fluid behavior there. For simplicity the shock wave will be considered normal to the fluid streamlines; in practice, much more complicated shapes are often observed. The velocity, pressure, and temperature just upstream of the shock can be calculated and will be considered as known for the pur- poses of this example. Use the three equations of change to determine the conditions under which a shock wave is possible and to find the velocity, temperature, and pressure distributions in such a shock wave. Assume steady, one-dimensjonal flow of an ideal gas, neglect the dilatational viscosity K, and ignore changes of p, k, and Cp with temperature and pressure. The equations of change in the neighborhood of the stationary shock wave may be simpli- fied to Continuity: d ;s; PV, = 0 (1 1.4-58) Motion: Energy: The energy equation is in the form of Eq. J of Table 11.4-1, written for an ideal gas in a steady- state situation. The equation of continuity may be integrated to give in which p1 and v1 are quantities evaluated a short distance upstream from the shock. In the energy equation we eliminate pv, by use of Eq. 11.4-61 and dp/dx by using the equation of motion to get (after some rearrangement) We next move the second term on the right side over to the left side and divide the entire equation by p,v,. Then each term is integrated with respect to x to give A in which C, is a constant of integration and Pr = C,p/k. For most gases Pr is between 0.65 and 0.85, with an average value close to 0.75. Therefore, to simplify the problem we set Pr equal to 3 z. Then Eq. 11.4-63 becomes a first-order, linear ordinary differential equation, for which the solution is Since t,T + iv; cannot increase without limit in the positive x direction, the second integra- tion constant CI1 must be zero. The first integration constant is evaluated from the upstream conditions, so that Of course, if we had not chosen Pr to be 2, a numerical integration of Eq. 11.4-63 would have been required. 352 Chapter 11 The Equations of Change for Nonisothermal Systems Next we substitute the integrated continuity equation into the equation of motion and in- tegrate once to obtain Evaluation of the constant CIIl from upstream conditions, where dv,/dx = 0, gives CIII = plv: + pl = plIv: + (RTl/M)I. We now multiply both sides by vx and divide by plvl. Then, with the help of the ideal gas law, p = pRT/M, and Eqs. 11.4-61 and 65, we may eliminate p from Eq. 11.4-60 to obtain a relation containing only v, and x as variables: This equation can, after considerable rearrangement, be rewritten in terms of dimensionless variables: The relevant dimensionless quantities are vx 4 = - = dimensionless velocity Vl (1 1.4-69) X 5 = - = dimensionless coordinate h (1 1.4-70) Ma - Vl = Mach number at the upstream condition I-- (1 1.4-71) The reference length h is the mean free path defined in Eq. 1.4-3 (with d2 eliminated by use of Eq. 1.4-9): We may integrate Eq. 11.4-68 to obtain - ' = explPMa1(l - a)(( - &)I (a < 4 < 1) (4 - a)\" This equation describes the dimensionless velocity distribution 4(5) containing an integration constant to = x,/h, which specifies the position of the shock wave in the nozzle; here to is con- sidered to be known.

Liepmann and A. Roshko, Elements of Gas Dynamics, Wiley, New York (1957), p. 3331 are indeed very thin. The temperature and pressure distributions may be determined from Eq. 11.4-75 and Eqs. 11.4-65 and 66. Since 4 must approach unity as 6 -+ -a, the constant a is less than 1. This can be true only if Ma, > 1-that is, if the upstream flow is supersonic. It can also be seen that for very large positive 6, the dimensionless velocity 4 approaches a. The Mach number Ma, is defined as the ratio of v, to the velocity of sound at TI (see Problem 11C.1). In the above development we chose the Prandtl number Pr to be z, but the solution has been extended8 to include other values of Pr as well as the temperature variation of the vis- cosity. The tendency of a gas in supersonic flow to revert spontaneously to subsonic flow is im- portant in wind tunnels and in the design of high-velocity systems-for example, in turbines and rocket engines. Note that the changes taking place in shock waves are irreversible and that, since the velocity gradients are so very steep, a considerable amount of mechanical en- ergy is dissipated. In view of the thinness of the predicted shock wave, one may question the applicability of the analysis given here, based on the continuum equations of change. Therefore it is desir- able to compare the theory with experiment. In Fig. 11.4-6 experimental temperature mea- surements for a shock wave in helium are compared with the theory for y = z, Pr = z, and p - We can see that the agreement is excellent. Nevertheless we should recognize that this is a simple system, inasmuch as helium is monatomic, and therefore internal degrees of freedom are not involved. The corresponding analysis for a diatomic or polyatomic gas would need to consider the exchange of energy between translational and internal degrees of freedom, which typically requires hundreds of collisions, broadening the shock wave consid- erably. Further discussion of this matter can be found in Chapter 11 of Ref. 7. 511.5 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE EQUATIONS OF CHANGE FOR NONISOTHERMAL SYSTEMS Now that we have shown how to use the equations of change for nonisothermal systems to solve some representative heat transport problems, we discuss the dimensional analy- sis of these equations. 354 Chapter 11 The Equations of Change for Nonisothermal Systems Just as the dimensional analysis discussion in 53.7 provided an introduction for the discussion of friction factors in Chapter 6, the material in this section provides the back- ground needed for the discussion of heat transfer coefficient correlations in Chapter 14. As in Chapter 3, we write the equations of change and boundary conditions in dimen- sionless form. In this way we find some dimensionless parameters that can be used to characterize nonisothermal flow systems. We shall see, however, that the analysis of nonisothermal systems leads us to a larger number of dimensionless groups than we had in Chapter 3. As a result, greater re- liance has to be placed on judicious simplifications of the equations of change and on carefully chosen physical models. Examples of the latter are the Boussinesq equation of motion for free convection (511.3) and the laminar boundary layer equations (512.4). As in 53.7, for the sake of simplicity we restrict ourselves to a fluid with constant p, k, and tp. The density is taken to be p = p - ?F(T - n in the pg term in the equation of motion, and p = p everywhere else (the \"Boussinesq approximation\"). The equations of change then become with p + sgh expressed as 9, Continuity: (V v) = 0 (1 1.5-1) Motion: Energy: We now introduce quantities made dimensionless with the characteristic quantities (sub- script 0 or 1) as follows: Here lo, v,, and Po are the reference quantities introduced in s3.7, and T, and TI are temperatures appearing in the boundary conditions. In Eq. 11.5-2 the value 7. is the temperature around which the density p was expanded. In terms of these dimensionless variables, the equations of change in Eqs. 11.5-1 to 3 take the forms Energy: The characteristic velocity can be chosen in several ways, and the consequences of the choices are summarized in Table 11.5-1. The dimensionless groups appearing in Eqs. 11.5-8 and 9, along with some combinations of these groups, are summarized in Table 11.5-2. Further dimensionless groups may arise in the boundary conditions or in the equation of state. The Froude and Weber numbers have already been introduced in 93.7, and the Mach number in Ex. 11.4-7. We already saw in Chapter 10 how several dimensionless groups appeared in the solution of nonisothermal problems. Here we have seen that the same groupings appear naturally when the equations of change are made dimensionless. These dimensionless groups are used widely in correlations of heat transfer coefficients. s11.5 Dimensional Analysis of the Equations of Change for Nonisothermal Systems 355 Table 11.5-1 Dimensionless Groups in Equations 11.5-7,8, and 9 Special Forced Free Free cases + convection Intermediate convection convection (A) (B) Choice for vo -+ Vo Vo v/10 a /lo 1 1 - - RePr RePr Neglect Neglect Notes: \" For forced convection and forced-plus-free (\"intermediate\") convection, v, is generally taken to be the approach velocity (for flow around submerged objects) or an average velocity in the system (for flow in conduits). For free convection there are two standard choices for v,, labeled as A and B. In g10.9, Case A arises naturally. Case B proves convenient if the assumption of creeping flow is appropriate, so that D+/D~ can be neglected (see Example 11.5-2). Then a new dimensionless pressure difference 9 = Pry, different from 9 in Eq. 3.7-4, can be introduced, so that when the equation of motion is divided by Pr, the only dimensionless group appearing in the equation is GrPr. Note that in Case B, no dimensionless groups appear in the equation of energy. It is sometimes useful to think of the dimensionless groups as ratios of various forces or effects in the system, as shown in Table 11.5-3. For example, the inertia1 term in the equation of motion is p[v . Vvl and the viscous term is To get \"typical\" values of these terms, replace the variables by the characteristic \"yardsticks\" used in construct- ing dimensionless variables. Hence replace p[v - Vv] by p@lo, and replace /AV% by ,!~v~/li to get rough orders of magnitude. The ratio of these two terms then gives the Reynolds number, as shown in the table. The other dimensionless groups are obtained in similar fashion. Table 11.5-2 Dimensionless Groups Used in Nonisothermal Systems Re = [lov,p/p]l = [lov,/v]l = Reynolds number Pr = [epp/k] = [v/a] = Prandtl number Gr = bp(T, - T,)I;/S?] = Grashof number Br = [[pv~/k(~l - To)] = Brinkman number Pe = RePr = Pkclet number Ra = GrPr = Rayleigh number Ec = &-/R =Z&erf number 356 Chapter 11 The Equations of Change for Nonisothermal Systems Table 11.5-3 Physical Interpretation of Dimensionless Groups ~v?j/lo - inertial force Re=-- v0/ viscous force pv?j/Io - inertial force Fr=-- P8 gravity force Gr - pg/3(Tl - To) - buoyant force -- - Re2 PV?~ / 10 inertial force ~C,V&T~ - TJ / 10 heat transport by convection Pk = RePr = - -- ( - ) heat transport by conduction p(vo/lo)2 heat production by viscous dissipation Br = - - kU-1 - To)/G heat transport by conduction A low value for the Reynolds number means that viscous forces are large in compar- ison with inertial forces. A low value of the Brinkrnan number indicates that the heat produced by viscous dissipation can be transported away quickly by heat conduction. When ~r/~e* is large, the buoyant force is important in determining the flow pattern. Since dimensional analysis is an art requiring judgment and experience, we give three illustrative examples. In the first two we analyze forced and free convection in sim- ple geometries. In the third we discuss scale-up problems in a relatively complex piece of equipment. EXAMPLE 125-1 Temperature Distribution about a Long Cylinder It is desired to predict the temperature distribution in a gas flowing about a long, internally cooled cylinder (system I) from experimental measurements on a one-quarter scale model (system 11). If possible the same fluid should be used in the model as in the full-scale system. The system, shown in Fig. 11.5-1, is the same as that in Example 3.7-1 except that it is now nonisothermal. The fluid approaching the cylinder has a speed v, and a temperature T,, and the cylinder surface is maintained at To, for example, by the boiling of a refrigerant contained within it. Show by means of dimensional analysis how suitable experimental conditions can be chosen for the model studies. Perform the dimensional analysis for the \"intermediate case\" in Table 11.5-1. SOLUTION The two systems, I and 11, are geometrically similar. To ensure dynamical similarity, as pointed out in 53.7, the dimensionless differential equations and boundary conditions must be the same, and the dimensionless groups appearing in them must have the same numerical values. Here we choose the characteristic length to be the diameter D of the cylinder, the charac- teristic velocity to be the approach velocity v, of the fluid, the characteristic pressure to be the pressure at x = - 03 and y = 0, and the characteristic temperatures to be the temperature T, of the approaching fluid and the temperature To of the cylinder wall. These characteristic quan- tities will carry a label I or I1 corresponding to the system being described. Both systems are described by the dimensionless differential equations given in Eqs. 11.5-7 to 9, and by boundary conditions B.C. 1 B.C. 2 B.C. 3 511.5 Dimensional Analysis of the Equations of Change for Nonisothermal Systems 357 (b) Small system (System 11): (~.JII Fig. 11.5-1. Temperature profiles about long heated cylin- ders. The contour lines in the two figures represent surfaces of constant temperature. in which ? = (T - To)/(T, - To). For this simple geometry, the boundary conditions contain no dimensionless groups. Therefore, the requirement that the differential equations and boundary conditions in dimensionless form be identical is _that the following dimensionless groups be equal in the two systems: Re = Dv,p/p, Pr = C,p/k, Br = pv;/k(T, - To), and Gr = p2g/3(T, - T,)D~/~~. In the latter group we use the ideal gas expression /3 = 1/T. To obtain the necessary equality for the four governing dimensionless groups, we may use different values of the four disposable parameters in the two systems: the approach veloc- ity v,, the fluid temperature T,, the approach pressure P,, and the cylinder temperature To. The similarity requirements are then (for D1 = 4D11): Equality of Pr Equality of Re Equality of Gr Equality of Br 2 T-11 (T, - To11 (2) = \" (T, - To),, * Here v = p/p is the kinematic viscosity and a = k/pC, is the thermal diffusivity. The simplest way to satisfy Eq. 11.5-13 is to use the same fluid at the same approach pres- sure 8, and temperature T, in the two systems. If that is done, Eq. 11.5-14 requires that the approach velocity in the small model (11) be four times that used in the full-scale system (I). If the fluid velocity is moderately large and the temperature differences small, the equality of Pr 358 Chapter 11 The Equations of Change for Nonisothermal Systems and Re in the two systems provides a sufficient approximation to dynamic similarity. This is the limiting case of forced convection with negligible viscous dissipation. If, however, the temperature differences T, - To are large, free-convection effects may be appreciable. Under these conditions, according to Eq. 11.5-15, temperature differences in the model must be 64 times those in the large system to ensure similarity. From Eq. 11.5-16 it may be seen that such a ratio of temperature differences will not per- mit equality of the Brinkman number. For the latter a ratio of 16 would be needed. This con- flict will not normally arise, however, as free-convection and viscous heating effects are seldom important simultaneously. Free-convection effects arise in low-velocity systems, whereas viscous heating occurs to a significant degree only when velocity gradients are very large. EXAMPLE 11.5-2 Free Convection in a Horizontal Fluid Layer; We wish to investigate the free-convection motion in the system shown in Fig. 11.5-2. It con- sists of a thin layer of fluid between two horizontal parallel plates, the lower one at tempera- ture T,, and the upper one at T,, with T, < To. In the absence of fluid motion, the conductive heat flux will be the same for all z, and a nearly uniform temperature gradient will be estab- Formation of &kard lished at steady state. This temperature gradient will in turn cause a density gradient. If the Ce l 1s density decreases with increasing z, the system will clearly be stable, but if it increases a po- tentially unstable situation occurs. It appears possible in this latter case that any chance dis- turbance may cause the more dense fluid to move downward and displace the lighter fluid beneath it. If the temperatures of the top and bottom surfaces are maintained constant, the re- sult may be a continuing free-convection motion. This motion will, however, be opposed by viscous forces and may, therefore, occur only if the temperature difference tending to cause it is greater than some critical minimum value. Determine by means of dimensional analysis the functional dependence of this fluid mo- tion and the conditions under which it may be expected to arise. SOLUTION The system is described by Eqs. 11.5-1 to 3 along with the following boundary conditions: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: Top view Side view Fig. 11.5-2. Bknard cells formed in the region between two horizontal parallel plates, with the bottom plate at a higher temperature than the upper one. If the Rayleigh number exceeds a certain critical value, the system becomes unstable and hexagonal Bknard cells are produced. s11.5 Dimensional Analysis of the Equations of Change for Nonisothermal Systems 359 We now restate the problem in dimensionless form, using lo = h. We use the dimensionless quantities listed under Case B in Table 11.5-1, and we select the reference temperature T to be 1 ,(To + TI), so that Continuity: (9 . ir) = 0 (1 1.5-20) Motion: Energy: with dimensionless boundary conditions B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: If the above dimensionless equations could be solved along with the dimensionless boundary conditions, we would find that the velocity and temperature profiles would depend only on Gr, Pr, and R/h. Furthermore, the larger the ratio R/h is, the less prominent its effect will be, and in the limit of extremely large horizontal plates, the system behavior will depend solely on Gr and Pr. If we consider only steady creeping flows, then the term Dt/D; may be set equal to zero. Then we define a new dimensionless pressure difference as @ = ~r8. With the left side of Eq. 11.5-21 equal to zero, we may now divide by Pr and the resulting equation contains oniy one dimensionless group, namely the Rayleigh number' Ra = GrPr = p2gp(~, - ~,)h~c?/~k, whose value will determine the behavior of the system. This illustrates how one may reduce the number of dimensionless groups that are needed to describe a nonisothermal flow system. The preceding analysis suggests that there may be a critical value of the Rayleigh num- ber, and when this critical value is exceeded, fluid motion will occur. This suggestion has been amply confirmed e~perimentall~~,~ and the critical Rayleigh number has been found to be 1700 2 51 for R/h>>l. For Rayleigh numbers below the critical value, the fluid is station- ary, as evidenced by the observation that the heat flux across the liquid layer is the same as that predicted for conduction through a static fluid: q, = k(To - TJ/h. As soon as the critical Rayleigh number is exceeded, however, the heat flux rises sharply, because of convective en- ergy transport. An increase of the thermal conductivity reduces the Rayleigh number, thus moving Ra toward its stable range. The assumption of creeping flow is a reasonable one for this system and is asymptoti- cally correct when Pr + c-~. It is also very convenient, inasmuch as it allows analytic solutions of the relevant equations of ~hange.~ One such solution, which agrees well with experiment, is sketched qualitatively in Fig. 11.5-2. This flow pattern is cellular and hexagonal, with up- flow at the center of each hexagon and downflow at the periphery. The units of this fascinat- ing pattern are called Bknard cells.5 The analytic solution also confirms the existence of a critical Rayleigh number. For the boundary conditions of this problem and very large R/h it has been calculated4 to be 1708, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental result cited above. The Rayleigh number is named after Lord Rayleigh 0. W. Strutt), Phil. Mag., (6) 32,529-546 (1916). ' P. L. Silveston, Forsch. Ingenieur-Wesen, 24,2932,5949 (1958). S.

If the upper plate of Fig. 11.5-2 is replaced by a liquid-gas interface, so that the surface shear stress in the liquid is neg- ligible, cellular convection is predicted theoretically3 for Rayleigh numbers above about 1101. A spectacular example of this type of instability occurs in the occasional spring \"turnover\" of water in northern lakes. If the lake water is cooled to near freezing during the winter, an ad- verse density gradient will occur as the surface waters warm toward 4\"C, the temperature of maximum density for water. In shallow liquid layers with free surfaces, instabilities can also arise from surface-ten- sion gradients. The resulting surface stresses produce cellular convection superficially similar to that resulting from temperature gradients, and the two effects may be easily confused. In- deed, it appears that the steady flows first seen by Bhard, and ascribed to buoyancy effects, may actually have been produced by surface-tension gradient^.^ EXAMPLE 11.5-3 Surface Temperature An electrical heating coil of diameter D is being designed to keep a large tank of liquid above its freezing point. It is desired to predict the temperature that will be reached at the coil sur- of face as a function of the heating rate Q and the tank surface temperature To. This prediction is an Electrical Heating to be made on the basis of experiments with a smaller, geometrically similar apparatus filled Coil with the same liquid. Outline a suitable experimental procedure for making the desired prediction. Tempera- ture dependence of the physical properties, other than the density, may be neglected. The en- tire heating coil surface may be assumed to be at a uniform temperature T,. SOLUTION This is a free-convection problem, and we use the column labeled A in Table 11.5-1 for the di- mensionless groups. From the equations of change and the boundary conditions, we know that the dimensionless temperature T = (T - To)/(T, - To) must be a function of the dimen- sionless coordinates and depend on the dimensionless groups Pr and Gr. The total energy input rate through the coil surface is Here r is the coordinate measured outward from and normal to the coil surface, S is the sur- face area of the coil, and the temperature gradient is that of the fluid immediately adjacent to the coil surface. In dimensionless form this relation is in which $ is a function of Pr = kPp/k and Gr = p2gp(T, - ~,)~~//lr Since the large-scale and small-scale systems are geometrically similar, the dimensionless function S describing the surface of integration will be the same for both systems and hence does not need to be in- cluded in the function $. Similarly, if we write the boundary conditions for temperature, ve- locity, and pressure at the coil and tank surfaces, we will obtain only size ratios that will be identical in the two systems. We now note that the desired quantity (TI - To) appears on both sides of Eq. 11.5-27. If we multiply both sides of the equation by the Grashof number, then (T, - To) appears only on the right side: ' C. V. Sternling and L. E. Scriven, MChE journal, 5,514-523 (1959); L. E. Scriven and C. V. Sternling, j. Fluid Mech., 19,321-340 (1964). Problems 361 In principle, we may solve Eq. 11.5-28 for Gr and obtain an expression for (TI - To). Since we are neglecting the temperature dependence of physical properties, we may consider the Prandtl number constant for the given fluid and write Here 4 is an experimentally determinable function of the group ~p'gp~~/k~~. We may then construct a plot of Eq. 11.5-29 from the experimental measurements of TI, To, and D for the small-scale system, and the known physical properties of the fluid. This plot may then be used to predict the behavior of the large-scale system. Since we have neglected the temperature dependence of the fluid properties, we may go even further. If we maintain the ratio of the Q values in the two systems equal to the inverse square of the ratio of the diameters, then the corresponding ratio of the values of (TI - To) will be equal to the inverse cube of the ratio of the diameters.

It is proposed to reduce the rate of evaporation of liquefied oxygen in small containers by taking advantage of transpira- tion. To do this, the liquid is to be stored in a spherical container surrounded by a spherical shell of a porous insulating material as shown in the figure. A thin space is to be left between the container and insulation, and the opening in the insulation is to be stoppered. In opera- tion, the evaporating oxygen is to leave the container proper, move through the gas space, and then flow uniformly out through the porous insulation. Calculate the rate of heat gain and evaporation loss from a tank 1 ft in diameter cov- ered with a shell of insulation 6 in. thick under the following conditions with and without transpiration. Temperature of liquid oxygen -297°F Temperature of outer surface of insulation 30°F Effective thermal conductivity of insulation 0.02 Btu/hr. ft F Heat of eyaporation of oxygen 91.7 Btu/lb Average C, of 0, flowing through insulation 0.22 Btu/lb. F Neglect the thermal resistance of the liquid oxygen, container wall, and gas space, and ne- glect heat losses through the stopper.

Esti- mate the time tf required for a drop of radius R to freeze completely, if the drop is initially at its melting point To and the surrounding air is at T,. Heat is lost from the drop to the sur- rounding air according to Newton's law of cooling, with a constant heat-transfer coefficient h. Assume that there is no volume change in the solidification process. Solve the problem by using a quasi-steady-state method. (a) First solve the steady-state heat conduction problem in the solid phase in the region be- tween r = Rf (the liquid-solid interface) and r = R (the solid-air interface). Let k be the ther- mal conductivity of the solid phase. Then find the radial heat flow Q across the spherical surface at r = R.

A sphere of radius R and thermal diffusivity a is initially at a uniform temperature To. For t > 0 the sphere is immersed in a well-stirred water bath main- tained at a temperature TI > To.

In the integration all terms with rn # n vanish on the right side. The term with m = n, when integrated, equals the integral on the left side. Dimensionless variables for free con~ection.~ The dimensionless variables in Eqs. 11.4-39 to 43 can be obtained by simple arguments. The form of O is dictated by the boundary condi- tions and that of 5 is suggested by the geometry. The remaining dimensionless variables may be found as follows: (a) Set 77 = y/yo, 4z = vz/vzo, and 4, = vY/v@, the subscript-zero quantities being constants. Then the differential equations in Eqs. 11.4-33 to 35 become with the boundary conditions given in Eqs. 11.4-47 to 49. H. S. Carslaw and J. C.

(c) Why is the choice of variables developed in (b) preferable to that obtained by setting the dimensionless groups in Eqs. llB.15-1 and 2 equal to unity? llC.l. The speed of propagation of sound waves. Sound waves are harmonic compression waves of very small amplitude traveling through a compressible fluid. The velocity of propagation of such waves may be estimated by assuming that the momentum flux tensor 7 and the heat flux vector q are zero and that the velocity v of the fluid is small.6 The neglect of T and q is equivalent to assuming that the entropy is constant following the motion of a given fluid ele- ment (see Problem 11D.1). (a) Use equilibrium thermodynamics to show that in which y = CJC,. (b) When sound is being propagated through a fluid, there are slight perturbations in the pressure, density, and velocity from the rest state: p = po + p', p = po + p', and v = vo + v', the subscript-zero quantities being constants associated with the rest state (with vo being zero), and the primed quantities being very small. Show that when these quantities are substi- tuted into the equation of continuity and the equation of motion (with the I and g terms omit- ted) and products of the small primed quantities are omitted, we get Equation of continuity dp - = -p0(V . v) dt (11C.l-2) Equation of motion dv p,, - = -Vp dt (11C.l-3) (c) Next use the result in (a) to rewrite the equation of motion as in which v: = y(dp/dp),.

A fluid of constant viscosity, with density given by Eq. 11.3-1, is confined in a rectangular slot. The slot has vertical walls at x = + B, y = + W, and a top and bottom at z = _tH, with H >> W >> B. The walls are nonisothermal, with temperature dis- tribution T, = T + Ay, so that the fluid circulates by free convection. The velocity profiles are to be predicted, for steady laminar flow conditions and small deviations from the mean density p. See L. Landau and E. M.

Show that Eq. 11.4-13 for flow in an an- nular region reduces to Eq. 10.4-9 for plane slit flow in the limit as K approaches unity. Com- parisons of this kind are often useful for checking results. The right side of Eq. 11.4-13 is indeterminate at K = 1, but its limit as K + 1 can be ob- tained by expanding in powers of E = 1 - K. To do this, set K = 1 - s and 5 = 1 - s[l - (x/b)l; then the range K 5 8 % 1 in Problem 11.4-2 corresponds to the range 0 % x 5 b in 310.4. After making the substitutions, expand the right side of Eq. 11.4-13 in powers of s (neglecting terms beyond 8') and show that Eq. 10.4-9 is obtained.

Interfacial boundary conditions. Consider a nonisothermal interfacial surface S(t) be- tween pure phases I and I1 in a nonisothermal system. The phases may consist of two im- miscible fluids (so that no material crosses S(t)), or two different pure phases of a single substance (between which mass may be interchanged by condensation, evaporation, freez- ing, or melting). Let n1 be the local unit normal to S(t) directed into phase I. A superscript I or I1 will be used for values along S in each phase, and a superscript s for values in the in- terface itself. The usual interfacial boundary conditions on tangential velocity v, and tem- perature T on S are v~ - - v II (no slip) (11C.6-1) T' = TI1 (continuity of temperature) (llC.6-2) In addition, the following simplified conservation equations are suggesteds for surfactant-free interfaces: Interfacial mass balance (nl. {p'(vl - J) - p'l(v'l - J)}) = 0 (1 lC.6-3) Interfacial momentum balance Interfacial internal energy balance (n' . pl{v' - $})[(I? - 9) + i(v\" - vU2)] + (d . {cf - qll}) = o(VS . vS) (1 1C.6-5) The momentum balance of Eq. 3C.5-1 has been extended here to include the surface gradient VSu of the interfacial tension; the resulting tangential force gives rise to a variety of interfacial flow phenomena, known as Marangoni effect^.^,'^ Equation llC.6-5 is obtained in the manner of 511.2, from total and mechanical energy balances on S, neglecting interfacial excess energy Ij\", heat flux qS, and viscous dissipation (.rS:VV); fuller results are given elsewhere.'

Effect of surface-tension gradients on a falling film. (a) Repeat the determination of the shear-stress and velocity distributions of Example 2.1-1 in the presence of a small temperature gradient dT/dz in the direction of flow. Assume that this temperature gradient produces a constant surface-tension gradient du/dz = A but has no other effect on system physical properties. Note that this surface-tension gradient will pro- duce a shear stress at the free surface of the film (see Problem llC.6) and, hence, will require a nonzero velocity gradient there. Once again, postulate a stable, nonrippling, laminar film. (b) Calculate the film thickness as a function of the net downward flow rate and discuss the physical significance of the result.

In Chapter 11 we developed the energy equation for flow systems, which describes the heat transport processes in more complex situations. To illustrate the usefulness of the energy equation, we gave in 511.4 a series of examples, most of which required no knowledge of solving partial differential equations. In this chapter we turn to several classes of heat transport problems that involve more than one dependent variable, either two spatial variables, or one space variable and the time variable. The types of problems and the mathematical methods parallel those given in Chapter 4. 512.1 UNSTEADY HEAT CONDUCTION IN SOLIDS For solids, the energy equation of Eq. 11.2-5, when combined with Fourier's law of heat conduction, becomes If the thermal conductivity can be assumed to be independent of the temperature and position, then Eq. 12.1-1 becomes in which a = k/& is the thermal diffusivity of the solid.

Many frequently encountered heat conduction problems may be solved just by looking up the solution in this impressive reference work. In this section we illustrate four important methods for solving unsteady heat con- duction problems: the method of combination of variables, the method of separation of variables, the method of sinusoidal response, and the method of Laplace transform. The first three of these were also used in 54.1. A solid material occupying the space from y = 0 to y = is initially at temperature To. At time t = 0, the surface at y = 0 is suddenly raised to temperature TI and maintained at that Heating a Semi-Infinite temperature for t > 0. Find the time-dependent temperature profiles T(y, t). Slab SOLUTION For this problem, Eq. 12.1-2 becomes Here a dimensionless temperature difference O = (T - To)/(T, - To) has been introduced. The initial and boundary conditions are then LC.: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: attsO, 0=0 forally at y = 0, O = 1 for all t > 0 aty= m, 0=0 forallt>O This problem is mathematically analogous to that formulated in Eqs. 4.1-1 to 4. Hence the so- lution in Eq. 4.1-15 can be taken over directly by appropriate changes in notation: T - To -- Y - 1 - erf- Tl - To a The solution shown in Fig. 4.1-2 describes the temperature profiles when the ordinate is la- beled (T - To)/(Tl - To) and the abscissa y/*. Since the error function reaches a value of 0.99 when the argument is about 2, the thermal penetration thickness 6T is That is, for distances y > 6, the temperature has changed by less than 1% of the difference T, - To. If it is necessary to calculate the temperature in a slab of finite thickness, the solution in Eq. 12.1-8 will be a good approximation when 6, is small with respect to the slab thickness. However, when 8, is of the order of magnitude of the slab thickness or greater, then the series solution of Example 12.1-2 has to be used. The wall heat flux can be calculated from Eq. 12.1-8 as follows: Hence, the wall heat flux varies as t-\"2, whereas the penetration thickness varies as t1I2 b 376 Chapter 12 Temperature Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable EXAMPLE 12.1-2 Heating of a Finite Slab A solid slab occupying the space between y = -b and y = + b is initially at temperature To. At time t = 0 the surfaces at y = ?b are suddenly raised to T, and maintained there. Find T(y, t). SOLUTION For this problem we define the following dimensionless variables: TI - T Dimensionless temperature 0 =- T, - To Dimensionless coordinate Y '7 =i (12.1-12) Dimensionless time With these dimensionless variables, the differential equation and boundary conditions are I.C.: at 7 = 0, 0 = 1 B.C. 1 and 2: at q = +I, O = 0 for^> 0 Note that no parameters appear when the problem is restated thus. We can solve this problem by the method of separation of variables. We start by postulat- ing that a solution of the following product form can be obtained: Substitution of this trial function into Eq. 12.1-14 and subsequent division by the product f (q)g(d gives The left side is a function of 7 alone, and the right side is a function of '7 alone. This can be true only if both sides equal a constant, which we call -c2. If the constant is called +c2, +c, or -c, the same final result is obtained, but the solution is a bit messier. Equation 12.1-18 can then be separated into two ordinary differential equations These equations are of the form of Eq. C.l-1 and 3 and may be integrated to give g = A exp (-c27) f = Bsincq + Ccoscv in which A, El, and C are constants of integration. Because of the symmetry about the xz-plane, we must have @(q, T) = @(-'7, r), and thus f (7) = f (-7). Since the sine function does not have this kind of behavior, we have to require that B be zero. Use of either of the two boundary conditions gives Ccos c = 0 (12.1-23) Clearly C cannot be zero, because that choice leads to a physically inadmissible solution. However, the equality can be satisfied by many different choices of c, which we call c,: s12.1 Unsteady Heat Conduction in Solids 377 Hence Eq. 12.1-14 can be satisfied by 12 2 @,, = A,,C, exp[-(n + ,) .rr TI cos (n + f).rrrl (12.1-25) The subscripts n remind us that A and C may be different for each value of n. Because of the linearity of the differential equation, we may now superpose all the solutions of the form of Eq. 12.1-25. In doing this we note that the exponentials and cosines for n have the same values as those for -(n + I), so that the terms with negative indices combine with those with posi- tive indices.

The D,, are now determined by using the initial condition, which gives Multiplication by cos(m + $).rrrl and integration from 77 = -1 to 7 = +1 gives When the integrations are performed, all integrals on the right side are identically zero, ex- cept for the term in which n = m.

These series converge rapidly for large values2 of the dimen- sionless time, at/b2. For very short times the convergence is very slow, and in the limit as cut/b2 approaches zero, the solution in Eq. 12.1-31 may be shown to approach that given in Eq. 12.1-8 (see Problem 12D.1). Although Eq. 12.1-31 is unwieldy for some practical calculations, a graphical presentation, such as that in Fig. 12.1-1, is easy to use (see Problem 12A.3). From the figure it is clear that when the dimensionless time r = at/b2 is 0.1, the heat has \"pene- trated\" measurably to the center plane of the slab, and that at r = 1.0 the heating is 90% com- plete at the center plane. Results analogous to Fig. 12.1-1 are given for infinite cylinders and for spheres in Figs. 12.1-2 and 3. These charts can also be used to build up the solutions for the analogous heat conduction problems in rectangular parallelepipeds and cylinders of finite length (see Prob. 12C.1).

Beginning at time t = 0, a periodic heat flux given by Unsteady Heat Conduction near a q, = qo cos ot = qo%{eiwfl (12.1-32) with Sinusoidal is imposed at y = 0. Here q,, is the amplitude of the heat flux oscillations, and o is the (circu- Heat Flux lar) frequency. It is desired to find the temperature in this system, T(y, t), in the \"periodic steady state\" (see Problem 4.1-3). SOLUTION For one-dimensional heat conduction, Eq. 12.1-2 is Multiplying by -k and operating on the entire equation with d/dy gives or, by making use of 9, = -k(dT/dy), Hence q, satisfies the same differential equation as T. The boundary conditions are B.C. 1: B.C. 2: This problem is formally exactly the same as that given in Eqs. 4.1-44,46, and 47. Hence the solution in Eq. 4.1-57 may be taken over with appropriate notational changes: - Then by integrating Fourier's law Substitution of the heat flux distribution into the right side of this equation gives after inte- gration Thus, at the surface y = 0, the temperature oscillations lag behind the heat flux oscillations by ~/4. This problem illustrates a standard procedure for obtaining the \"periodic steady state\" in heat conduction systems. It also shows how one can use the heat conduction equation in terms of the heat flux, when boundary conditions on the heat flux are known. A homogeneous solid sphere of radius R, initially at a uniform temperature TI, is suddenly immersed at time t = 0 in a volume Vf of well-stirred fluid qf temperature To in an insulated of a tank. It is desired to find the thermal diffusivity a, - ks/psC,, of the solid by observing the in Contact with a change of the fluid temperature Tf with time.

Linear problems with complicated boundary conditions and/or coupling between equa- tions are often solved readily by the Laplace transform method. We now take the Laplace transform of the preceding equations and their boundary conditions to get: Fluid Atr=O,@, = 0 (12.1-46) Atc$= I,@, = af (12.1-47) At 6 = 0,@, = finite (12.1-48) I Solid I Fluid I At7=0,0f=1 (12.1-50) ~tt= l,%=or (12.1-52) At 5 = 0,@ = finite (12.1-53) Here p is the transform ~ariable.~ The solution to Eq. 12.1-51 is Because of the boundary condition at ,$ = 0, we must set C, equal to zero. Substitution of this result into Eq. 12.1-54 then gives Next, we insert these last two results into the boundary condition at 5 = 1, in order to deter- mine C,. This gives us for 6 We now divide the numerator and denominator within the parentheses by p, and take the in- verse Laplace transform to get s12.2 Steady Heat Conduction in Laminar, Incompressible Flow 381 Fig. 12.1-4. Variation of the fluid tem- perature with time after a sphere of ra- dius R at temperature T, is placed in a well-stirred fluid initially at a tempera- ture To. The dimensionless parameter B is defined in the text following Eq. 12.1-50. [H. S. Carslaw and J. C. Jaeger, Conduction of Heat in Solids, 2nd edi- tion, Oxford University Press (1959), p. 241.1 It can be shown that D(p) has a single root at p = 0, and roots at V'& = ib, (with k = 1, 2, 3,. . . , m), where the bk are the nonzero roots of tan bk = 3bk/(3 + Bb:).

In this result the only place where the thermal diffusivity of the solid a, appears is in the dimensionless time T = a,t/R2, SO that the temperature rise of the fluid can be used to determine experimentally the thermal diffusivity of the solid. Note that the Laplace transform technique allows us to get the temperature his- tory of the fluid without obtaining the temperature profiles in the solid. 512.2 STEADY HEAT CONDUCTION IN LAMINAR, INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOW In the preceding discussion of heat conduction in solids, we needed to use only the en- ergy equation. For problems involving flowing fluids, however, all three equations of change are needed.

To get the temperature profiles for forced convection, a two-step procedure is used: first Eqs. 12.2-1 and 2 are solved to obtain the velocity distribution v(r, t); then the expression for v is substi- tuted into Eq. 12.2-3, which may in turn be solved to get the temperature distribution T(r, t). Many analytical solutions of Eqs. 12.2-1 to 3 are available for commonly encoun- tered situation^.'-^. One of the oldest forced-convection problems is the Graetz-Nusselt problem,' describing the temperature profiles in tube flow where the wall temperature undergoes a sudden step change at some position along the tube (see Problems 12D.2, 3, and 4). Analogous solutions have been obtained for arbitrary variations of wall temperature and wall flux.9 The Graetz-Nusselt problem has also been extended to non-Newtonian fluids.'' Solutions have also been developed for a large class of laminar heat exchanger problems,ll in which the wall boundary condition is provided by the continuity of heat flux across the surfaces separating the two streams. A fur- ther problem of interest is duct flow with significant viscous heating effects (the Brinkman problem12). In this section we extend the discussion of the problem treated in §10.8-namely, the determination of temperature profiles for laminar flow of an incompressible fluid in a circular tube. In that section we set up the problem and found the asymptotic solution for distances far downstream from the beginning of the heated zone. Here, we give the complete solution to the partial differential equation as well as the asymptotic solution for short distances. That is, the system shown in Fig. 10.8-2 is discussed from three view- points in this book: a. Complete solution of the partial differential equation by the method of separa- tion of variables (Example 12.2-1). b. Asymptotic solution for short distances down the tube by the method of combi- nation of variables (Example 12.2-2). c. Asymptotic solution for large distances down the tube (s10.8). ' M.

Laminar Tube Flow with Constant Heat SOLUTION Flux at the Wall The complete solution for the temperature is postulated to be of the following form: in which Om((, l) is the asymptotic solution given in Eq. 10.8-31, and Od((, 5) is a function that will be damped out exponentially with 5. By substituting the expression for @(& 5) in Eq. 12.2- 4 into Eq. 10.8-19, it may be shown that the function Od(& 5) must satisfy Eq. 10.8-19 and also the following boundary conditions: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: at l= 0, Od = Om(& 0) (12.2-7) We anticipate that a solution to the equation for O&, will be factorable, Then Eq. 10.8-19 can be separated into two ordinary differential equations in which -c2 is the separation constant. Since the boundary conditions on X are dX/dt = 0 at 6 = 0, 1, we have a Sturm-Liouville problem.13 Therefore we know there will be an infinite number of eigenvalues ck and eigenfunctions Xk, and that the final solution must be of the form: where The problem is thus reduced to finding the eigenfunctions Xk(O by solving Eq. 12.2-10, and then getting the eigenvalues ck by applying the boundary condition at 6 = 1. This has been done for k up to 7 for this problem.14 l3 M. D. Greenberg, Advanced Engineering Mathematics, Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle River, N.J., Second Edition (1998), s17.7. I%. Siegel, E. M.

Develop an expression for T(r, z) that is useful for small values. Laminar Tube Flow with Constant Heat Flux at the Wall: ~~~~~~i~ solution For small z the heat addition affects only a very thin region near the wall, so that the follow- for the Region ing three approximations lead to results that are accurate in the limit as z + 0: a. Curvature effects may be neglected and the problem treated as though the wall were flat; call the'distance from the wall y = R - r. b. The fluid may be regarded as extending from the (flat) heat transfer surface (y = 0) to y = m. c. The velocity profile may be regarded as linear, with a slope given by the slope of the parabolic velocity profile at the wall: v,(y) = voy/R, in which v, = (Po - P,)R2/2p~. This is the way the system would appear to a tiny \"observer\" who is located within the very thin shell of heated fluid. To this observer, the wall would seem flat, the fluid would appear to be of infinite extent, and the velocity profile would seem to be linear. The energy equation then becomes, in the region just slightly beyond z = 0, Actually it is easier to work with the corresponding equation for the heat flux in the y direc- tion (q, = -k dT/dy). This equation is obtained by dividing Eq. 12.2-13 by y and differentiat- ing with respect to y: It is more convenient to work with dimensionless variables defined as Then Eq. 12.2-14 becomes with these boundary conditions: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: ath =0, Q=O atq=O, $=I asv+m, Q+O This problem can be solved by the method of combination of variables (see Examples 4.1-1 and 12.1-1) by using the new independent variable x = v/$\"%. Then Eq. 12.2-16 becomes The boundary conditions are: at x = 0, IC, = 1, and as x + m, Q + 0. The solution of Eq. 12.2-20 is found by first letting d+/dx = p, and getting a first-order equation for p. The equation for p can be solved and then I) is obtained as 512.3 Steady Potential Flow of Heat in Solids 385 The temperature profile may then be obtained by integrating the heat flux: or, in dimensionless form, Then the expression for cC, is inserted into the integral, and the order of integration in the dou- ble integral can be reversed (see Problem 12D.7). The result is Here r($) is the (complete) gamma function, and r($, X3) is an incomplete gamma function.15 To compare this result with that in Example 12.2-1, we note that 17 = 1 - 8 and A = if. The di- mensionless temperature is defined identically in 510.8, in Example 12.2-1, and here. 812.3 STEADY POTENTIAL FLOW OF HEAT IN SOLIDS The steady flow of heat in solids of constant thermal conductivity is described by Fourier's law q = -kVT Heat conduction equation V2T = 0 These equations are exactly analogous to the expression for the velocity in terms of the velocity potential (v = -V+), and the Laplace equation for the velocity potential (V24 = 0), which we encountered in 54.3. Steady heat conduction problems can therefore be solved by application of potential theory. For two-dimensional heat conduction in solids with constant thermal conductivity, the temperature satisfies the two-dimensional Laplace equation: We now use the fact that any analytic function w(z) = fix, y) + ig(x, y) provides two scalar functions f and g, which are solutions of Eq. 12.3-3. Curves off = constant may be interpreted as lines of heat flow, and curves of g = constant are the corresponding isothermals for some heat flow problems. These two sets of curves are orthogonal-that is, they intersect at right angles. Furthermore, the components of the heat flux vector at any point are given by Given an analytic function, it is easy to find heat flow problems that are described by it. But the inverse process of finding an analytic function suitable for a given heat flow problem is generally very difficult. Some methods for this are available, but they are out- side the scope of this textbook.',* l5 M. Abramowitz and I. A.

Furthermore, two additional nets are obtained by working with the inverse function z(w) as illustrated in Chapter 4 for ideal fluid flow. Note that potential fluid flow and potential heat flow are mathematically similar, the two-dimensional flow nets in both cases being described by analytic functions. Physi- cally, however, there are certain important differences. The fluid flow nets described in 54.3 are for a fluid with no viscosity (a fictitious fluid!), and therefore one cannot use them to calculate the drag forces at surfaces. On the other hand, the heat flow nets de- scribed here are for solids that have a finite thermal conductivity, and therefore the re sults can be used to calculate the heat flow at all surfaces. Moreover, both the velocity components (in Cartesian coordinates!) of 54.3 and the temperature profiles of this sec- tion satisfy the Laplace equation. Further information about analogous physical pro- cesses described by the Laplace equation is available in books on partial differential eq~ations.~ Here we give just one example to provide a glimpse of the use of analytic functions; further examples may be found in the references cited.

We saw that, in the neighbor- hood of a solid surface, the equations of continuity and motion could be simplified, and that these equations may be solved to get \"exact boundary layer solutions\" and that an integrated form of these equations (the von KBrmdn momentum balance) enables one to get \"approximate boundary layer solutions.\" In this section we extend the previous de- velopment by including the boundary layer equation for energy transport, so that the temperature profiles near solid surfaces can be obtained. As in 54.4 we consider the steady two-dimensional flow around a submerged object such as that shown in Fig. 4.4-1. In the vicinity of the solid surface the equations of change may be written (omitting the bars over p and P) as: Continuity Motion Energy dv, avy --+--TO dx dy Here p, p, k, and 4 are regarded as constants, and p(dv,/dy)' is the viscous heating ef- fect, which is henceforth disregarded. Solutions of these equations are asymptotically ac- curate for small mpmentum diffusivity v = p/p in Eq. 12.4-2, and for small thermal diffusivity a = k/pCp in Eq. 12.4-3. Equation 12.4-1 is the same as Eq. 4.4-1. Equation 12.4-2 differs from Eq. 4.4-2 be- cause of the inclusion of the buoyant force term (see 511.3), which can be significant even when fractional changes in density are small. Equation 12.4-3 is obtained from Eq. 11.2-9 by neglecting the heat conduction in the x direction. More complete forms of the bound- ary layer equations may be found elsewhere.*,\" The usual boundary conditions for Eqs. 12.4-1 and 2 are that v, = v, = 0 at the solid surface, and that the velocity merges into the potential flow at the outer edge of the veloc- ity boundary layer, so that v, + v,(x). For Eq. 12.4-3 the temperature T is specified to be To at the solid surface and T, at the outer edge of the thermal bounda y layer. That is, the ve- locity and temperature are different from v,(x) and T, only in thin layers near the solid surface. However, the velocity and temperature boundary layers will be of different thicknesses corresponding to the relative ease of the diffusion of momentum and heat. Since Pr = v/a, for Pr > 1 the temperature boundary layer usually lies inside the veloc- H. Schlichting, Boundary-Layer Theory, 7th edition, McGraw-Hill, New York (1979), Chapter 12. IS.

In 94.4 we showed that the boundary layer equation of motion could be integrated formally from y = 0 to y = m, if use is made of the equation of continuity. In a similar fashion the integration of Eqs. 12.4-1 to 3 can be performed to give Energy Equations 12.4-4 and 5 are the uon Urmh momentum and energy balances, valid for forced-convection and free-convection systems. The no-slip condition vy = 0 at y = 0 has been used here, as in Eq. 4.4-4; nonzero velocities at y = 0 occur in mass transfer systems and will be considered in Chapter 20. As mentioned in 94.4, there are two approaches for solving boundary layer prob- lems: analytical or numerical solutions of Equations 12.4-1 to 3 are called \"exact bound- ary layer solutions,\" whereas solutions obtained from Eqs. 12.4-4 and 5, with reasonable guesses for the velocity and temperature profiles, are called \"approximate boundary layer solutions.\" Often considerable physical insight can be obtained by the second method, and with relatively little effort. Example 12.4-1 illustrates this method. Extensive use has been made of the boundary layer equations to establish correla- tions of momentum- and heat-transfer rates, as we shall see in Chapter 14. Although in this section we do not treat free convection, in Chapter 14 many useful results are given along with the appropriate literature citations. Obtain the temperature profiles near a flat plate, along which a Newtonian fluid is flowing, as shown in Fig. 12.4-1. The wetted surface of the plate is maintained at temperature To and the temperature of the approaching fluid is T,. SOLUTION In order to use the von KhrmAn balances we first postulate reasonable forms for the velocity and temperature profiles. The following polynomial form gives 0 at the wall and 1 at the outer limit of the boundary layer, with a slope of zero at the outer limit: That is, we assume that the dimensionless velocity and temperature profiles have the same form within their respective boundary layers. We further assume that the boundary layer thicknesses 6(x) and 6,(x) have a constant ratio, so that A = 6,(x)/6(x) is independent of x. Two possibilities have to be considered: A 5 1 and A 2 1. We consider here A 5 1 and rele- gate the other case to Problem 12D.8. s12.4 Boundary Layer Theory for Nonisothermal Flow 389 Fluid approaches with velocity v, - Fig. 12.4-1. Boundary layer development for the flow along a heated flat plate, showing the thermal boundary layer for A = 6T(~)/6(~) < 1. The surface of the plate is at temperature To, and the approaching fluid is at T,. The use of Eqs. 12.4-4 and 5 is now straightforward but tedious. Substitution of Eqs. 12.4-6 through 9 into the integrals gives (with v, set equal to v, here) In these integrals r] = y/6(x) and vT = y/aT(x) = y/AS(x). Next, substitution of these integrals into Eqs. 12.4-4 and 5 gives differential equations for the boundary layer thicknesses. These first-order separable differential equations are easily integrated, and we get 6~(x) = J,, The boundary layer thicknesses are now determined, except for the evaluation of A in Eq. 12.4-13. The ratio of Eq. 12.4-12 to Eq. 12.4-13 gives an equation for A as a function of the Prandtl number: When this sixth-order algebraic equation is solved for A as a function of Pr, it is found that the solution may be curve-fitted by the simple relation4 within about 5%.

The assumption of laminar flow made here is valid for x < xCyitr where x,,,,v,p/p is usually greater than lo5.

Eq. 12.4-17 is in good agreement with more detailed solutions based on Eqs. 12.4-1 to 3. The asymptotic solution for Q at large Prandtl numbers, given in the next example? has the same form except that the numerical coefficient = 0.685 is replaced by 0.677. The exact so- lution for Q at finite Prandtl numbers, obtained numerically? has the same form except that the coefficient is replaced by a slowly varying function C(Pr), shown in Table 12.4-1. The value C = 0.664 is exact at Pr = 1 and good within 52% for Pr > 0.6. The proportionality of Q to ~r\"~, found here, is asymptotically correct in the limit as Pr + w, not only for the flat plate but also for all geometries that permit a laminar, nonsepa- rating boundary layer, as illustrated in the next example. Deviations from Q - Pr'I3 occur at finite Prandtl numbers for flow along a flat plate and even more so for flows near other- shaped objects and near rotating surfaces. These deviations arise from nonlinearity of the ve- locity profiles within the thermal boundary layer. Asymptotic expansions for the Pr dependence of Q have been presented by Merk and other^.^ M. J.

Now we repeat the same problem but obtain an exact solution of the boundary layer equations in the limit that the Prandtl number is large-that is, for liquids (see 59.1). In this limit, the outer edge of the thermal boundary layer is well inside the velocity boundary layer. Therefore it can safely be assumed that v, varies linearly with y throughout the entire thermal boundary layer. SOLUTION By combining the boundary layer equations of continuity and energy (Eqs. 12.4-1 and 3) we get ,. in which a = k/pCp. The leading term of a Taylor expansion for the velocity distribution near the wall is in which the constant c = 0.4696/~ = 0.332 can be inferred from Eq. 4.4-30. Substitution of this velocity expression into Eq. 12.4-18 gives This has to be solved with the boundary conditions that T = To at y = 0, and T = T, at x = 0. This equation can be solved by the method of combination of variables. The choice of the dimensionless variables makes it possible to rewrite Eq. 12.4-20 (see Eq. C.l-9) as Integration of this equation with the boundary conditions that Il = 0 at 7 = 0 and II + 1 as for the dimensionless temperature distribution. See 5C.4 for a discussion of the gamma func- tion Un). For the rate of heat loss from both sides of a heated plate of width Wand length L, we get = (2 WL)(To - T,) - --- - pr'13 ~e;\" (t I;:, (;r31 which is the same result as that in Eq. 12.4-17 aside from a numerical constant.

These regions are illustrated for cylin- ders in Fig. 3.7-2. The technique introduced in the preceding example has been extended to flow around objects of arbitrary shape. Consider the steady flow of a fluid over a stationary object as shown in Forced Convection Fig. 12.4-2. The fluid approaches at a uniform temperature T,, and the solid surface is main- in Steady Three- tained at a uniform temperature To. The temperature distribution and heat transfer rate are to Dimensional Flow be found for the region of laminar flow, which extends downstream from the stagnation locus at High Prandtl to the place where turbulence or flow separation begins. The velocity profiles are considered ~umbers\"~ to be known. The thermal boundary layer is considered to be very thin. This implies that the isotherms nearly coincide with the solid surface, so that the heat flux q is nearly normal to the surface. It also implies that the complete velocity profiles are not needed here. We need to know the state of the motion only near the solid surface. To capitalize on these simplifications, we choose the coordinates in a special way (see Fig. 12.4-2). We define y as the distance from the surface into the fluid just as in Fig. 12.4-1. We further define x and z as the coordinates of the nearest point on the surface, measured parallel and perpendicular to the tangential motion next to the surface. We express elements of arc in the x and z directions as h$x and hdz, where h, and h, are position-dependent \"scale factors\" discussed in 5A.7. Since we are interested here in the region of small y, the scale fac- tors are treated as functions only of x and z evaluated at y = 0, with h, = 1. With this choice of coordinates, the velocity components for small y become Here P(x, z) is the local value of dv,/dy on the surface; it is positive in the nonseparated re- gion, but may vanish at points of stagnation or separation. These equations are obtained by writing Taylor series for v, and v,, retaining terms through the first degree in y, and then inte- W. E. Stewart, AlChE Journal, 9,528-535 (1963).

These results are valid for Newtonian or non-Newtonian flow with temperature-independent density and visc~sity.'~ By a procedure analogous to that used in Example 12.4-2, one obtains a result similar to that given in Eq. 12.4-24. The only difference is that 7 is defined more generally as 77 = y/ST, where ST is the thermal boundary layer thickness given by and xl(z) is the upstream limit of the heat transfer region. From Eqs. 12.4-24 and 25 the local surface heat flux qo and the total heat flow for a heated region of the form x,(z) < x < x2(z), z, < z < 2, are This last result shows how Q depends on the fluid properties, the velocity profiles, and the geometry of the system. We see that Q is proportional to the temperature difference, to = ~/~~~'~ei/~, and to the of a mean velocity gradient over the surface. Show how the above results can be used to obtain the heat transfer rate from a heated sphere of radius R with a viscous fluid streaming past it in creeping flow\" (see Example 4.2-1 and Fig. 2.6-1). The boundary-layer coordinates x, y, and z may be identified here with .rr - 8, r - R, and 4 of Fig. 2.6-1. Then stagnation occurs at 8 = n-, and separation occurs at 8 = 0. The scale factors are h, = R, and h, = R sin 0. The interfacial velocity gradient p is Insertion of the above into Eqs. 12.4-29 and 31 gives the following results for forced convec- tion heat transfer from an isothermal sphere of diameter D: (T - 8 + sin 28)1/3 = (z)1/3~(~e sin 8 31'3k(~o - T,) /02T (- j: Q = zff1/3r(;) zv, sin 0 R2 sin 0 d8 1213 d6 The constant in brackets is 0.991. The behavior predicted by Eq. 12.4-33 is sketched in Fig. 12.4-3. The boundary layer thickness increases steadily from a small value at the stagnation point to an infinite value at separation, where the boundary layer becomes a wake extending downstream. The analysis here is most accurate for the forward part of the sphere, where 6, is small; fortunately, that is Temperature-dependent properties have been included by Acrivos, loc. cit.

The result for Q is good within about 5% for RePr > 100; this limits its use primarily to fluids with Pr > 100, since creeping flow is obtained only at Re of the order of 1 or less.12 Results of the same form as Eq. 12.4-34 are obtained for creeping flow in other geome- tries, including packed beds.\"13 It should be emphasized that the asymptotic solutions are particularly important: they are relatively easy to obtain, and for many applications they are sufficiently accurate. We will see in Chapter 14 that some of the standard heat transfer correlations are based on asymptotic solutions of the type discussed here.

A fluid at temperature T, flows in the x direction across a long, infinitesimally thin wire, which is heated electrically at a rate Q/L (energy per unit time per unit length).

The lower plate (at z = 0) is made to oscillate sinusoidally in the z direction with a velocity amplitude vo and a circular fre- quency o.

Let the temperature in the ground be T(y, t), where y is the depth below the surface of the earth and t is the time, measured from the time of maximum temperature To.

Then it can be shown that the temperature at any depth is given by This equation is the heat conduction analog of Eq. 4D.1-1, which describes the response of the velocity profiles near an oscillating plate.

The procedure has involved solving the equations of change with appropriate boundary and initial conditions. We now turn to the problem of finding temperature profiles in turbulent flow. This discussion is quite similar to that given in Chapter 5. We begin by time-smoothing the equations of change. In the time-smoothed energy equation there appears a turbulent heat flux q(t), which is expressed in terms of the correlation of velocity and temperature fluctuations. There are several rather useful empiricisms for ij't', which enable one to pre- dict time-smoothed temperature distributions in wall turbulence and in free turbulence. We use heat transfer in tube flow to illustrate the method. The most apparent influence of turbulence on heat transport is the enhanced trans- port perpendicular to the main flow. If heat is injected into a fluid flowing in laminar flow in the z direction, then the movement of heat in the x and y directions is solely by conduction and proceeds very slowly. On the other hand, if the flow is turbulent, the heat \"spreads out\" in the x and y directions extremely rapidly. This rapid dispersion of heat is a characteristic feature of turbulent flow. This mixing process is worked out in some de- tail here for flow in tubes and in circular jets. Although it has been conventional to study turbulent heat transport via the time- smoothed energy equation, it is also possible to analyze the heat flux at a wall by use of a Fourier transform technique without time-smoothing. This is set forth in the last section. 513.1 TIME-SMOOTHED EQUATIONS OF CHANGE FOR INCOMPRESSIBLE NONISOTHERMAL FLOW In s5.2 we introduced the notions of time-smoothed quantities and turbulent fluctua- tions. In this chapter we shall be primarily concerned with the temperature profiles. We introduce the time-smoothed temperature T and temperature fluctuation T', and write analogously to Eq. 5.2-1 T=T+T' (13.1-1) 408 Chapter 13 Temperature Distributions in Turbulent Flow -- Clearly T' averages to zero so that = Of but quantities like v:T', viT', and will not be zero because of the \"correlation\" between the velocity and temperature fluctuations at any point. For a nonisothermal pure fluid we need three equations of change, and we want to discuss here their time-smoothed forms. The time-smoothed equations of continuity and motion for a fluid with constant density and viscosity were given in Eqs. 5.2-10 and 12, and need not be repeated here. For a fluid with constant p, p, $ and k, Eq. 11.2-5, when put in the d/dt form by using Eq. 3.5-4, and with Newton's and Fourier's law included, becomes in which only a few sample terms in the viscous dissipation term -(T:VV) = p@, have been written (see Eq. B.7-1 for the complete expression). In Eq. 13.1-2 we replace T by T = T + T', v, by Ex + v:, and so on. Then the equation is time-smoothed to give Comparison of this equation with the preceding one shows that the time-smoothed equation has the same form as the original equation, except for the appearance of the terms indicated by dashed underlines, which are concerned with the turbulent fluctua- tions. We are thus led to the definition of the turbulent heat flux q\"' with components - A- A- A- (t) - C v'~f (t) - C v'~f (t) - C v'~' qx -P p I %J -P P Y qz -P pz (13.1-4) and the turbulent energy dissipation function 8:): The similarity between the components of q\") in Eq. 13.1-4 and those of ?\"' in Eq. 5.2-8 should be noted. In Eq. 13.1-5, v,', vi, and vi are synonymous with v:, v;, and vi, and x,, x2, and x, have the same meaning as x, y, and z. To summarize, we list all three time-smoothed equations of change for turbulent flows of pure fluids with constant p, p, 5 and k in their D/Dt form (the first two were given in Eqs. 5.2-10 and 12): Continuity (V V) = 0 (13.1-6) Motion DV p - = -vp - [V (5'\"' + ?\"')I + pg Dt (13.1-7) Energy 513.2 The Time-Smoothed Temperature Profile Near a Wall 409 in which it is understood that D/Dt = d/dt + ?. V. Here q'\"' = - k~?, and @\" is the vis- cous dissipation function of Eq. B.7-1, but with all the vi replaced by 6. In discussing turbulent heat flow problems, it has been customary to drop the vis- cous dissipation terms. Then, one sets up a turbulent heat transfer problem as for lami- nar flow, except that .r and q are replaced by ?'\") + l@' and q'\"' + q(\", respectively, and time-smoothed p, 7, and T are used in the remaining terms. 913.2 THE TIME-SMOOTHED TEMPERATURE PROFILE NEAR A WALL' Before giving empiricisms for q(\" in the next section, we present a short discussion of some results that do not depend on any empiricism. We consider the turbulent flow along a flat wall as shown in Fig. 13.2-1, and we in- quire as to the temperature in the inertial sublayer. We pattern the development after that for Eq. 5.3-1. We let the heat flux into the fluid at y = 0 be qo = G(y=O and we postulate that the heat flux in the inertial sublayer will not be very different from that at the wall. We seek to relate q, to the time-smoothed temperature gradient in the inertial sub- layer. Because transport in this region is dominated by turbulent convection, the viscos- ity p and the thermal conductivity k will not play an im orta$ role. Therefore the only parameters on which dT/dy can depend are qo, v, = * %/p, p, C,, and y. We must further use the fact that the linearity of the energy equation implies that dT/dy must be propor- tional to qo. The only combination that satisfies these requirements is in which K is the dimensionless constant in Eq. 5.3-1, and P is an additional constant (which turns out1 to be the turbulent Prandtl number ~r\"' = ~'~)/cu(')). When Eq. 13.2-1 is integrated we get - Pqo To-T=,-lny+C KPC~.U, where To is the wall temperature and C is a constant of integration. The constant is to be determined by matching the logarithmic expression with the expression for T(y) that i i I Fig. 13.2-1. Temperature profile in a tube with turbulent flow.

Lifshitz, Fluid Mechanics, 2nd edition, Pergamon Press, New York (1987), 554. 410 Chapter 13 Temperature Distributions in Turbulent Flow holds at the junction with the viscous sublayer. The latter expression will involve both p and k; hence C will n~cessarily contain p and k, and will therefore include the dimen- sionless group Pr = C,p/k. If, in addition, we introduce the dimensionless coordinate yv,/u, then Eq. 13.2-2 can be rewritten as YV* for, > 1 in which f(Pr) is a function representing the thermal resistance between the wall and the inertial sublayer. Landau and Lifshitz (see Ref. 1 on page 409) estimate, from a mixing- length argument (see Eq. 13.3-3), that, for large Prandtl numbers, f(Pr) = constant . ~3~''; however, Example 13.3-1 implies that the function f(Pr) = constant ~r'/\"s better. Keep in mind that Eq. 13.2-3 can be expected to be valid only in the inertial sublayer and that it should not be used in the immediate neighborhood of the wall. s13.3 EMPIRICAL EXPRESSIONS FOR THE TURBULENT HEAT FLUX In g13.1 we saw that the time-smoothing of the energy equation gives rise to a turbulent heat flux q't'. In order to solve the energy equation for the time-smoothed temperature profiles, it is customary to postulate a relation between q'\" and the time-smoothed tem- perature gradient. We summarize here two of the most popular empirical expressions; more of these can be found in the heat transfer literature. Eddy Thermal Conductivity By analogy with the Fourier law of heat conduction we may write in which the quantity k't' is called the turbulent therrnal conductivity or the eddy thennal conductivity. This quantity is not a physical property of the fluid, but depends on posi- tion, direction, and the nature of the turbulent flow. The eddy kinematic viscosity df' = p't'/p and the eddy thermal diffusivity a\"' = k'\"/pCP have the same dimensions. Their ratio is a dimensionless group called the turbulent Pvandtl number. This dimensionless quantity is of the order of unity, values in the literature varying from 0.5 to 1 .O. For gas flow in conduits, ranges from 0.7 to 0.9 (for circular tubes the value 0.85 has been recommended1), whereas for flow in jets and wakes the value is more nearly 0.5. The assumption that ~r\"' = 1 is called the Reynolds analogy. The Mixing-Length Expression of Prandtl and Taylor According to Prandtl's mixing-length theory, momentum and energy are transferred in turbulent flow by the same mechanism. Hence, by analogy with Eq. 5.4-4, one obtains W. M. Kays and M. E. Crawford, Convective Heat arid Mass Tvunsfer, 3rd edition, McGraw-Hill, New York (1993), pp. 259-266. 913.4 Temperature Distribution for Turbulent Flow in Tubes 411 where 1 is the Prandtl mixing length introduced in Eq. 5.4-4. Note that this expression predicts that ~r'\" = 1. The Taylor vorticity transport theory2 gives ~r\"' = $. Use the Reynolds analogy (df' = a\"'), along with Eq. 5.4-2 for the eddy viscosity, to estimate the wall heat flux qo for the turbulent flow in a tube of diameter - D = 2R. Express the result in An Approximate terms of the temperature-difference driving force To - TR, where To is the temperature at Relation for the Wall the wall (y = 0) and TR is the time-smoothed temperature at the tube axis (y = R). Heat Flux for Turbulent Flow in a Tube SOLUTION The time-smoothed radial heat flux in a tube is given by the sum of IfZ\") and 4;': Here we have used Eq. 13.3-1 and the Reynolds analogy, and we have switched to the coordi- nate y, which is the distance from the wall. We now use the empirical expression of Eq. 5.4-2, which applies across the viscous sublayer next to the wall: where ijr = -i$ has been used. If now we approximate the heat flux in Eq. 13.3-5 by its wall value qo, then integration from y = 0 to y = R gives For very large Prandtl numbers, the upper limit R in the integral can be replaced by m, since the integrand is decreasing rapidly with increasing y. Then when the integration on the left side is performed and the result is put into dimensionless form, we get in which Eq. 6.1-4a has been used to eliminate v, in favor of the friction factor. The above development is only approximate. We have not taken into account the change of the bulk temperature as the fluid moves axially through the tube, nor have we taken into account the change in the heat flux throughout the tube. Furthermore, the result is restricted to very high Pr, because of the extension of the integration to y = m. Another derivation is given in the next section, which is free from these assumptions. However, we will see that at large Prandtl numbers the result in Eq. 13.4-20 simplifies to that in Eq. 13.3-7 but with a differ- ent numerical constant. 513.4 TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION FOR TURBULENT FLOW IN TUBES In 510.8 we showed how to get the asymptotic behavior of the temperature profiles for large z in a fluid in laminar flow in a circular tube. We repeat that problem here, but for a fluid in fully developed turbulent flow. The fluid enters the tube of radius R at an inlet temperature T,. For z > 0 the fluid is heated because of a uniform radial heat flux q, at the wall (see Fig. 13.4-1). G. I. Taylor, Proc. Roy. Soc. (London), A135,685-702 (1932); Phil.

We start from the energy equation, Eq. 13.1-8, written in cylindrical coordinates Then insertion of the expression for the radial heat flux from Eq. 13.3-4 gives This is to be solved with the boundary conditions B.C. 1: at r = 0, T = finite B.C. 2: - dT at r = R, +k - = q, (a constant) dr - B.C. 3: atz=O, T=Tl (13.4-5) We now use the same dimensionless variables as already given in Eqs. 10.8-16 to 18 (with T in place of T in the definition of the dimensionless temperature). Then Eq. 13.4-2 in dimensionless form is in which +(,$I = EZ/v,,, is the dimensionless turbulent velocity profile. This equation is to be solved with the dimensionless boundary conditions B.C. 1: at 6 = 0, O = finite (13.4-7) B.C. 2: a@ at[=l, +-=I d5 (13.4-8) BS. 3: atC=O, 0=0 (13.4-9) The complete solution to this problem has been given,' but we content ourselves here with the solution for large z. We begin by assuming an asymptotic solution of the form of Eq. 10.8-23 which must satisfy the differential equation, together with B.C. 1 and 2 and Condition 4 in Eq. 10.8-24 (with T and v, = vmax(l - f) replaced by T and v, = urn,,+(()).

The constant C, is found by applying B.C. 2, which gives The remaining constant, C2, can, if desired, be obtained from Condition 4, but we shall not need it here (see Problem 13D.1). We next get an expression for the dimensionless temperature difference Oo - Ob, the \"driving force\" for the heat transfer at the tube wall: In the second line, the order of integration of the double integral has been reversed. The inner integral in the second term on the right is just 10) - I@, and the portion containing I(1) exactly cancels the first term in Eq. 13.4-15. Hence when Eq. 13.4-14 is used, we get But the quantity I(1) appearing in Eq. 13.4-16 has a simple interpretation: Finally, we want to get the dimensionless wall heat flux, the reciprocal of which is2 To use this result, it is necessary to have an expression for the time-smoothed velocity distribution (which appears in I([)), the turbulent kinematic viscosity v\"' as a function of position, and a postulate for the turbulent Prandtl number Pr\"'. Equation 13.4-19 was first developed by R. N. Lyon, Chem. Eng. Prog., 47, 75-79 (1950) in a paper on liquid-metal heat transfer. The left side of Eq. 13.4-19 is the reciprocal of the Nusselt number, Nu = hD/k, which is a dimensionless heat transfer coefficient. This nomenclature is discussed in the next chapter. 414 Chapter 13 Temperature Distributions in Turbulent Flow A Deissler & Eian (1952) Allen & Eckert (1964) o Malina & Sparrow (1964) A Friend & Metzner (1958) o Harriott & Hamilton (1965) Fig. 13.4-2.

The data of Harriott and Hamilton are for the analogous mass transfer experiment, for which Eq. 13.4-20 also applies. Extensive calculations based on Eq. 13.4-19 were performed by Sandall, Hanna, and ~azet.~ These authors took the turbulent Prandtl number to be unity. They divided the region of integration into two parts, one near the wall and the other for the turbulent core. In the \"wall region\" they used the modified van Driest equation of Eq. 5.4-7 for the mixing length, and in the \"core region\" they used a logarithmic velocity distribution. Their final result3 is given as In obtaining this result, Eq. 6.1-4a has been used. Equation 13.4-20 agrees with the available data on heat transfer (and mass transfer) within 3.6 and 8.1% over the range 0.73 < Pr < 590, depending on the sets of data stud- ied. The analogous mass transfer expression, containing Sc = p/p%,, instead of Pr, was reported3 to agree with the mass transfer data within 8% over the range 452 < Sc < 97600. The agreement of the theory with the heat transfer and mass transfer data, shown in Fig. 13.4-2, is quite convincing. 0. C. Sandall, 0. T. Hanna, and P. R. Mazet, Canad. J. Chem.

Here we wish to ex- tend this problem by considering an incoming jet with temperature To higher than that of the surrounding fluid TI. The problem then is to find the time-smoothed temperature distribution T(r, z) in a steadily driven jet. We expect that this distribution will be monot- one decreasing in both the r and z directions. We start by assuming that viscous dissipation is negligible, and we neglect the con- tribution $\"' to the heat flux as well as the axial contribution to q\"'. Then Eq. 13.1-8 takes the time-averaged form Then we express the turbulent heat flux in terms of the turbulent thermal conductivity introduced in Eq. 13.3-1: When Eq. 13.5-1 is written in terms of a dimensionless temperature function it becomes Here it has been assumed that the turbulent Prandtl number and the turbulent kinematic viscosity are constants (see the discussion after Eq. 5.6-3). This equation is to be solved with the boundary conditions: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: atz=O, @=1 at r = 0, @ is finite atr=m, O=O Next we introduce the expressions for the time-smoothed velocity components 5, and Ez in terms of a stream function F([), as given in Eqs. 5.6-12 and 13, and a trial expression for the dimensionless time-smoothed temperature function: Here 5 = r/z and 5 = (pv't'/w)z, where w is the total mass flow rate in the jet. The pro- posal in Eq. 13.5-8 is motivated by the expression for 5, that was found in Eq. 5.6-21. When these expressions for the velocity components and the dimensionless temper- ature are substituted into Eq. 13.5-1, some terms cancel and others can be combined, and as a result, the following rather simple equation is obtained: ' J. 0. Hinze, Turbulence, 2nd edition, McGraw-Hill, New York (1975), pp. 531-546. 416 Chapter 13 Temperature Distributions in Turbulent Flow This equation can be integrated once to give The constant of integration may be set equal to zero, since, at 8 = 0. A second integration from 0 to 5 then gives according to E, Finally, comparison of Eqs. 13.5-12 and 13.5-8 with Eq. 5.6-21 shows that the shapes of the time-smoothed temperature and axial velocity profiles are closely related, an equation attributed to Reichardt.' This theory provides a moderately satisfactory ex- planation for the shapes of the temperature profiles.' The turbulent Prandtl (or Schmidt) number deduced from temperature (or concentration) measurements in circular jets is about 0.7. The quantity C3 appearing in Eq. 13.5-12 was given explicitly in Eq. 5.6-23 as C3 = wm(1 /dt)), where J is the rate of momentum flow in the jet, defined in Eq. 5.6- 2. Similarly, an expression for the quantity f(0) in Eq. 13.5-12 can be found by equating the energy in the incoming jet to the energy crossing any plane downstream: Insertion of the expressions for the velocity and temperature profiles and integrating then gives Combining Eqs. 13.5-3, 13.5-8,5.6-23, 13.5-12, and 13.5-15 then gives the complete expres- sion for the temperature profiles T(r, z) in the circular turbulent jet, in terms of the total momentum of the jet, the turbulent viscosity, the turbulent Prandtl number, and the fluid density. 13.6 FOURIER ANALYSIS OF ENERGY TRANSPORT IN TUBE FLOW AT LARGE PRANDTL NUMBERS In the preceding two sections we analyzed energy transport in turbulent systems by use of time-smoothed equations of change.

In this section we analyze a turbulent energy trans- port problem without time-smoothing-that is, by direct use of the energy equation with fluctuating velocity and temperature fields. The Fourier transform1 is well suited for such problems, and the \"method of dominant balanceu2 gives useful information with- out detailed computations. The specific question considered here is the influence of the thermal diffusivity, a = k/&, on the expected distribution and fluctuations of the fluid temperature in turbulent forced convection near a wall.3 This topic was discussed in Example 13.3-1 by an approx- imate procedure. Let us consider a fluid with constant p, $ and k in turbulent flow through a tube of inner radius R = ;D. The flow enters at z = - 03 with uniform temperature TI and exits at z = L. The tube wall is adiabatic for z < 0, and isothermal at To for 0 5 z 5 L. Heat con- duction in the z direction is neglected. The temperature distribution T(r, 8, z, t) is to be analyzed in the long-time limit, in the thin thermal boundary layer that forms for z > 0 when the molecular thermal diffusivity a is small (as in a Newtonian fluid when the Prandtl number, Pr = Spp/k = p/pa, is large). A stretching function ~(a) will be derived for the average thickness of the thermal boundary layer without introducing an eddy thermal diffusivity df'. In the limit as cu + 0, the thermal boundary layer lies entirely within the viscous sub- layer, where the velocity components are given by truncated Taylor expansions in the distance y = R - r from the wall (compare these expansions with those in Eqs. 5.4-8 to 10) Here the coefficients p, and p, are treated as given functions of 8, z, and t. These velocity expressions satisfy the no-slip conditions and the wall-impermeability condition at y = 0 and the continuity equation at small y, and are consistent with the equation of motion to the indicated orders in y. The energy equation can then be written as with the usual boundary layer approximation for VZT, and with the following boundary conditions on T(y, 6, z, t): Inlet condition: at z = 0, T(y, 8,0, t) = T, for 0 < y r R (1 3.6-5) Wall condition: at y = 0, T(0, 0, z, t) = To for 0 I z 5 L (13.6-6) The initial temperature distribution T(y, 6, z, 0) is not needed, since its effect disappears in the long-time limit. To obtain results asymptotically valid for a + 0, we introduce a stretched coordi- nate Y = y/~(cu), which is the distance from the wall relative to the average boundary layer thickness ~(a). The range of Y is from 0 at y = 0 to w at y = R in the limit as a + 0. ' R. N. Bracewell, The Fourier Transform and its Applications, 2nd edition, McGraw-Hill, New York (1978).

Thus a change of variables is needed to analyze the influence of the parameter a in this problem. For this purpose we turn to the Fourier transform, a standard tool for analyzing noisy processes. We choose the following definition1 for the Fourier transform of a function g(t) into the domain of frequency v at a particular position Y, 8, z: The corresponding transforms for the t-derivative and for products of functions of t are and the latter integral is known as the convolution of the transforms and h. Before taking the Fourier transforms of Eqs. 13.6-7 to 9, we express each included function g(t) as a time average g plus a fluctuating function gf(t) and expand each prod- uct of such functions. The resulting expressions have the following Fourier transforms: Here 6(v) is the Dirac delta function, obtained as the Fourier transform of the function g(t) = 1 in the long-duration limit. The leading term in the last line is a real-valued im- pulse at v = 0, coming from the time-independent product 8. The next two terms are complex-valued functions of the frequency v. The convolution term j' * h' may contain complex-valued functions of v, along with a real-valued impulse ~(v)g'h' coming from time-independent products of simple harmonic oscillations present in g' and h'. Taking the Fourier transform of Eq. 13.6-7 by the method just given and noting that dG/dt is identically zero, we obtain the differential equation 513.6 Fourier Analysis of Energy Transport in Tube Flow at Large Prandtl Numbers 419 for the Fourier-transformed temperature 6(~, 0, z, v). The transformed boundary condi- tions are Inlet condition: at z = 0, O(Y, 0, z, v) = 0 for Y > 0 (13.6-16) Wall condition: at Y = 0, O(Y, 6, z, v) = S(v) for 0 5 z I L (13.6-17) Here again, the unit impulse function 6(v) appears as the Fourier transform of the func- tion g(t) = 1 in the long-duration limit. Two types of contributions appear in Eq. 13.6-15: real-valued zero-frequency im- pulses S(v) from functions and products independent of t, and complex-valued functions of v from time-dependent product terms. We consider these two types of contributions separately here, thus decoupling Eq. 13.6-15 into two equations. We begin with the zero-frequency impulse terms. In addition to the explicit 6(v) terms of Eq. 13.6-15, implicit impulses arise in the convolution terms from synchronous oscillations A- of velocity and temperature, giving rise to the turbulent energy flux $\" = pC,v'T1 discussed in s13.2. The coefficients of all the impulse terms must be proportional functions of a, in order that the dominant terms at each point remain balanced (i.e., of comparable size) as a + 0. Therefore, the coefficient K of the convective impulse terms, including those from synchronous fluctuations, must be proportional to the coefficient a/K2 of the conductive impulse term, giving K cc or for the dependence of the average thermal boundary layer thickness on the Prandtl number. The remaining terms in Eq. 13.6-15 describe the turbulent temperature fluctuations. They include the accumulation term 2n-iv6' and the remaining convection and conduc- tion terms. The coefficients of all these terms (including 271-i~ in the leading term) must be proportional functions of a in order that these terms likewise remain balanced as a + 0. This reasoning confirms Eq. 13.6-18 and gives the further relation v cc K, or for the frequency bandwidth Av of the temperature fluctuations. Consequently, the stretched frequency Pr1'3v and stretched time ~r-\"~t are natural variables for reporting Fourier analyses of turbulent forced convection. Shaw and Hanratty4 reported turbu- lence spectra for their mass transfer experiments analogously, in terms of a stretched fre- quency variable proportional to sc1I3 v (here Sc = p/p9AB is the Schmidt number, the mass transfer analog of the Prandtl number, which contains the binary diffusivity 9AR, to be introduced in Chapter 16). Thus far we have considered only the leading term of a Taylor expansion in K for each term in the energy equations. More accurate results are obtainable by continuing the Taylor expansions to higher powers of K, and thus of Pr-'13D. The resulting formal solution is a perturbation expansion for the distribution of the fluctuating temperature over position and frequency in a given velocity field. The expansion for T (the long-time average of the temperature) corresponding to Eq. 13.6-20 is obtained from the zero-frequency part of 6, - - 0 = @,(Y, 8,~) + K~,(Y, 8,Z) + ' . (13.6-21) D. A.

We give the mass transfer expression here (rather than wait until Part 111) because electrochem- ical mass transfer experiments give better precision than heat transfer experiments and the available range of Schmidt numbers is much greater than that of Prandtl numbers. If the expansions in Eq. 13.6-24 and 25 are truncated to one term, we are led to Nu, cc and Sh, SC~'~. These expressions are essential ingredients in the famous Chilton-Colburn relations5 (see Eqs. 14.3-18 and 19, and Eqs. 22.3-22 to 24). The first term in Eq. 13.6-24 or 25 also corresponds to the high Prandtl (or Schmidt) number asymptote of Eq. 13.4-20.6 With the development of electrochemical methods of measuring mass transfer at surfaces, it has become possible to investigate the second term in Eq. 13.6-25. In Fig. 13.6-1 are shown the data of Shaw and Hanratty, who measured the diffusion- limited current to a wall electrode for values of the Schmidt number Sc = p/p9,, from 693 to 37,200.

Equation 13.6-26 combines the observed Re number dependence of the Sherwood number with the two leading terms of Eq. 13.6-25 (that is, the coefficients a,, a,, . . . are proportional to em). Equation 13.6-26 lends itself to clear physical interpretation: The leading term corresponds to a diffusional boundary layer so thin that the tangential velocity is linear in y and the wall curvature can be neglected, whereas the second term accounts for wall curvature and the y2 terms in the tangential velocity expansions of Eqs. 13.6-1 and 2). In higher approxima- tions, special terms can be expected to arise from edge effects as noted by ~ewrnan~ and Stewart .3 QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1.

Chapter 14 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Svstems Definitions of heat transfer coefficients Analytical calculations of heat transfer coefficients for forced convection through tubes and slits Heat transfer coefficients for forced convection in tubes Heat transfer coefficients for forced convection around submerged objects Heat transfer coefficients for forced convection through packed beds Heat transfer coefficients for free and mixed convection Heat transfer coefficients for condensation of pure vapors on solid surfaces In Chapter 10 we saw how shell energy balances may be set up for various simple problems and how these balances lead to differential equations from which the tem- perature profiles may be calculated. We also saw in Chapter 11 that the energy bal- ance over an arbitrary differential fluid element leads to a partial differential equation-the energy equation-which may be used to set up more complex prob- lems. Then in Chapter 13 we saw that the time-smoothed energy equation, together with empirical expressions for the turbulent heat flux, provides a useful basis for summarizing and extrapolating temperature profile measurements in turbulent sys- tems. Hence, at this point the reader should have a fairly good appreciation for the meaning of the equations of change for nonisothermal flow and their range of applic- ability. It should be apparent that all of the problems discussed have pertained to systems of rather simple geometry and furthermore that most of these problems have contained assumptions, such as temperature-independent viscosity and constant fluid density. For some purposes, these solutions may be adequate, especially for order-of-magnitude esti- mates. Furthermore, the study of simple systems provides the stepping stones to the dis- cussion of more complex problems. In this chapter we turn to some of the problems in which it is convenient or necessary to use a less detailed analysis. In such problems the usual engineering approach is to for- mulate energy balances over pieces of equipment, or parts thereof, as described in Chapter 15. In the macroscopic energy balance thus obtained, there are usually terms that require estimating the heat that is transferred through the system boundaries. This requires know- ing the heat transfer coefficient for describing the interphase transport. Usually the heat transfer coefficient is given, for the flow system of interest, as an empirical correlation of 514.1 Definitions of Heat Transfer Coefficients 423 the Nusselt number' (a dimensionless wall heat flux or heat transfer coefficient) as a func- tion of the relevant dimensionless quantities, such as the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. This situation is not unlike that in Chapter 6, where we learned how to use dimen- sionless correlations of the friction factor to solve momentum transfer problems. How- ever, for nonisothermal problems the number of dimensionless groups is larger, the types of boundary conditions are more numerous, and the temperature dependence of the physical properties is often important. In addition, the phenomena of free convec- tion, condensation, and boiling are encountered in nonisothermal systems. We have purposely limited ourselves here to a small number of heat transfer formulas and correlations-just enough to introduce the reader to the subject without attempting to be encyclopedic. Many treatises and handbooks treat the subject in much greater depth.\"3,4,5~6 514.1 DEFINITIONS OF HEAT TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS Let us consider a flow system with the fluid flowing either in a conduit or around a solid object. Suppose that the solid surface is warmer than the fluid, so that heat is being trans- ferred from the solid to the fluid. Then the rate of heat flow across the solid-fluid inter- face would be expected to depend on the area of the interface and on the temperature drop between the fluid and the solid. It is customary to define a proportionality factor h (the heat transfer coefficient) by Q=hAAT (14.1-1) in which Q is the heat flow into the fluid (J/hr or Btu/hr), A is a characteristic area, and AT is a characteristic temperature difference. Equation 14.1-1 can also be used when the fluid is cooled. Equation 14.1-1, in slightly different form, has been encountered in Eq. 10.1-2. Note that h is not defined until the area A and the temperature difference AT have been specified. We now consider the usual definitions for h for two types of flow geometry. As an example of flow in conduits, we consider a fluid flowing through a circular tube of diameter D (see Fig. 14.1-I), in which there is a heated wall section of length L and varying inside surface temperature To(z), going from To, to To,. Suppose that the bulk temperature Tb of the fluid (defined in Eq. 10.8-33 for fluids with constant p and ep) in- creases from Tbl to T,, in the heated section. Then there are three conventional definitions of heat transfer coefficients for the fluid in the heated section: This dimensionless group is named for Ernst Kraft Wilhelm Nusselt (1882-19571, the German engineer who was the first major figure in the field of convective heat and mass transfer. See, for example, W. Nusselt, Zeits. d. Ver. deutsck. Ing., 53,1750-1755 (19091, Forschungsarb. a. d. Geb. d. Ingenieurwes., No. 80,l-38, Berlin (1910), and Gesundkeits-kg., 38,477482,490496 (1915).

For most calculations h,, is preferable, because it is less dependent on L/D than the other two, although it is not al- ways used.' In using heat transfer correlations from treatises and handbooks, one must be careful to note the definitions of the heat transfer coefficients. If the wall temperature distribution is initially unknown, or if the fluid properties change appreciably along the pipe, it is difficult to predict the heat transfer coefficients defined above. Under these conditions, it is customary to rewrite Eq. 14.1-2 in the differ- ential form: dQ = h,oc(~Ddz)(To - Tb) hl,,(~Ddz)AT1, (14.1-5) Here dQ is the heat added to the fluid over a distance dz along the pipe, ATloc is the local temperature difference (at position z), and h,,, is the local heat transfer coefficient. This equation is widely used in engineering design. Actually, the definition of h,,, and AT,,, is not complete without specifying the shape of the element of area. In Eq. 14.1-5 we have set dA = ~Ddz, which means that h,,, and ATl,, are the mean values for the shaded area dA in Fig. 14.1-1. As an example of flow around submerged objects, consider a fluid flowing around a sphere of radius R, whose surface temperature is maintained at a uniform value To. Sup- pose that the fluid approaches the sphere with a uniform temperature T,. Then we may define a mean heat transfer coeficient, h,, for the entire surface of the sphere by the re- lation Q = ~,(~TR~)(T, - T,) (14.1-6) The characteristic area is here taken to be the heat transfer surface (as in Eqs. 14.1-2 to 5), whereas in Eq. 6.1-5 we used the sphere cross section. A local coefficient can also be defined for submerged objects by analogy with Eq. 14.1-5: dQ = hloc(dA)(To - T,) (14.1-7) This coefficient is more informative than h, because it predicts how the heat flux is dis- tributed over the surface. However, most experimentalists report only h,,, which is easier to measure. If ATJAT, is between 0.5 and 2.0, then AT, may be substituted for ATl,, and h, for h,,, with a maximum error of 4%. This degree of accuracy is acceptable in most heat transfer calculations. 514.1 Definitions of Heat Transfer Coefficients 425 Table 14.1-1 Typical Orders of Magnitude for Heat Transfer Coefficientsa h (W/m2 K) or h System (kcal/m2. hr C) (Btu/ft2 hr .

F, and by 1.162 to get h in W/m2. K. For additional conversion factors, see Appendix F. Let us emphasize that the definitions of A and AT must be made clear before h is de- fined. Keep in mind, also, that h is not a constant characteristic of the fluid medium. On the contrary, the heat transfer coefficient depffnds in a complicated way on many vari- ables, including the fluid properties (k, p, p, CJ, the system geometry, and the flow ve- locity. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to predicting the dependence of h on these quantities. Usually this is done by using experimental data and dimensional analy- sis to develop correlations. It is also possible, for some very simple systems, to calculate the heat transfer coefficient directly from the equations of change. Some typical ranges of h are given in Table 14.1-1. We saw in 510.6 that, in the calculation of heat transfer rates between two fluid streams separated by one or more solid layers, it is convenient to use an overall heat trans- fer coefficient, U,, which expresses the combined effect of the series of resistances through which the heat flows. We give here a definition of U, and show how to calculate it in the special case of heat exchange between two coaxial streams with bulk temperatures Th (\"hot\") and T, (\"cold), separated by a cylindrical tube of inside diameter Do and outside diameter D,: 1 1 +ln(D,/Do) + 1 ) - = (- DoUo D&\" 2k\"l Dlhl loc Note that Uo is defined as a local coefficient. This is the definition implied in most design procedures (see Example 15.4-1). Equations 14.1-8 and 9 are, of course, restricted to thermal resistances connected in series. In some situations there may be appreciable parallel heat flux at one or both surfaces by radiation, and Eqs. 14.1-8 and 9 will require special modification (see Example 16.5-2). To illustrate the physical significance of heat transfer coefficients and illustrate one method of measuring them, we conclude this section with an analysis of a hypothetical set of heat transfer data. 426 Chapter 14 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Systems EXAMPLE 14.1-1 Calculation of Heat Transfer Coeficients from Experimental Data SOLUTION Isothermal Heated section , section Fig. 14.1-2.

Pipe with heated section of length LA Pipe with heated section I of length L, , I I I I Pipe with heated section of length LC I I I I A series of simulated steady-state experiments on the heating of air in tubes is shown in Fig. 14.1-2. In the first experiment, air at Tbl = 200.0°F is flowing in a 0.5-in. i.d. tube with fully de- veloped laminar velocity profile in the isothermal pipe section for z < 0. At z = 0 the wall temperature is suddenly increased to To = 212.O\"F and maintained at that value for the re- maining tube length LA. At z = LA the fluid flows into a mixing chamber in which the cup- mixing (or \"bulk) temperature T,, is measured. Similar experiments are done with tubes of different lengths, L,, LC, and so on, with the following results: Experiment A B C D E F G L (in.) 1.5 3.0 6.0 12.0 24.0 48.0 96.0 In all experiments, the air flow rate w is 3.0 lb,,/hr. Calculate h,, h,, h,,, and the exit value of h,,, as functions of the L/D ratio. First we make a steady-state energy balance over a length L of the tube, by stating that the heat in through the walls plus the energy entering at z = 0 by convection equals the energy leaving the tube at z = L. The axial energy flux at the tube entry and exit may be calculated from Eq. 9.8-6. For fully developed flow, changes in the kinetic energy flux gpv2v and the work term [T. vl will be negligible relative to changes in the enthalpy flux. We also assume that q, << pHv,, so that the axial heat conduction term may be neglected. Hence the only con- tribution to the energy flux entering and leaving with the flow will be the term containing the enthalpy, which can be computed with the help of Eq. 9.8-8 and the assumptions that the heat capacity and density of the fluid are constant throughout. Therefore the steady-state energy balance becomes simply \"rate of energy flow in = rate of energy flow out,\" or Using Eq. 14.1-2 to evaluate Q and rearranging gives s14.1 Definitions of Heat Transfer Coefficients 427 from which hl =- aD2 (To - Tbl) This gives us the formula for calculating h1 from the data given above. Analogously, use of Eqs. 14.1-3 and 14.1-4 gives WG (\"2 - (r) h, = --- nD2 (To - Tb)a for obtaining h, and h,, from the data. To evaluate h,,,, we have to use the preceding data to construct a continuous curve Tb(z), as in Fig. 14.1-2, to represent the change in bulk temperature with z in the longest (96-in.) tube. Then Eq. 14.1-10 becomes By differentiating this expression with respect to z and combining the result with Eq. 14.1-5, we get Since To is constant, this becomes The derivative in this equation is conveniently determined from a plot of In(T, - Tb) versus z/L. Because a differentiation is involved, it is difficult to determine hlo, precisely. The calculated results are shown in Fig. 14.1-3. Note that all of the coefficients decrease with increasing LID, but that hi,, and hl, vary less than the others. They approach a common asymptote (see Problem 14B.5 and Fig. 14.1-3). Somewhat similar behavior is observed in tur- bulent flow with constant wall temperature, except that h,, approaches the asymptote much more rapidly (see Fig. 14.3-2). LID Fig. 14.1-3.

We would like to do the same for the heat transfer coefficient, h, which, however, is not dimension- less. Nonetheless we can construct with it a dimensionless quantity, Nu = hD/k, the Nusselt number, using the fluid thermal conductivity k and a characteristic length D that must be specified for each flow system. Two other related dimensionless groups are commonly used: the Stanton number, St = Nu/RePr, and the Chilton-Colbum j-fnctor for heat transfer, j, = Nu/~e~r\"~. Each of these dimensionless groups may be \"decorated with subscript 1, a, In, or m, corresponding to the subscript on the Nusselt number. By way of illustration, let us return to 310.8 where we discussed the heating of a fluid in laminar flow in a tube, with all the fluid properties being considered constant. From Eq. 10.8-33 and Eq. 10.8-31 we can get the difference between the wall temperature and the bulk temperature: in which R and D are the radius and diameter of the tube. Solving for the wall flux we get Then making use of the definition of the local heat transfer coefficient hlo,-namely, that q0 = h,,,(To - T&we find that This result is the entry in Eq. (L) of Table 14.2-1-namely, for the laminar flow of a con- stant-property fluid with a constant wall heat flux, for very large z. The other entries in Table 14.2-1 and 2 may be obtained in a similar way.' Some Nusselt numbers for New- tonian fluids with constant physical properties are shown in Fig. 14.2-1.'

For turbulent flow there is little difference between Nu for constant wall temperature and for constant wall heat flux. For the turbulent flow of liquid metals, for which the Prandtl numbers are generally much less than unity, there are two results of importance. Notter and Sleicher4 solved the energy equation numerically, using a realistic turbulent velocity profile, and ob- tained the rates of heat transfer through the wall.

When there are large temperature differences in the sys- tem, it is necessary to take into account the temperature dependence of the viscosity, density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity. Usually this is done by means of an empiricism-namely, by evaluating the physical properties at some appropriate average temperature. Throughout this chapter, unless explicitly stated otherwise, it is under- stood that all physical properties are to be calculated at the film temperature Tf defined as follow^:^ a.

In this section we show how dimensional analysis leads us to a general form for the dependence of the Nusselt number on various dimen- sionless groups, and that this form includes not only the results of the preceding section, but turbulent flows as well. Then we present a dimensionless plot of Nusselt numbers that was obtained by correlating experimental data. First we extend the dimensional analysis given in 511.5 to obtain a general form for correlations of heat transfer coefficients in forced convection. Consider the steadily driven laminar or turbulent flow of a Newtonian fluid through a straight tube of inner radius R, as shown in Fig. 14.3-1. The fluid enters the tube at z = 0 with velocity uniform out to very near the wall, and with a uniform inlet temperature TI (= Tbl). The tube wall is insulated except in the region 0 I z r L, where a uniform inner-surface temperature To is main- tained by heat from vapor condensing 02 the outer surface. For the moment, we assume constant physical properties p, p, k, and C,. Later we will extend the empiricism given in $14.2 to provide a fuller allowance for the temperature dependence of these properties. We follow the same procedure used in 56.2 for friction factors. We start by writing the expression for the instantaneous heat flow from the tube wall into the fluid in the system described above, which is valid for laminar or turbulent flow (in laminar flow, Q would, of course, be in- dependent of time). The + sign appears here because the heat is added to the system in the negative r direction. Equating the expressions for Q given in Eqs. 14.1-2 and 14.3-1 and solving for h,, we get Next we introduce the dimensionless quantities i. = r/D, i = z/D, and ? = (T - To)/ (Tbl - TO), and multiply by D/k to get an expression for the Nusselt number Nul = hlD/k: Thus the (instantaneous) Nusselt number is basically a dimensionless temperature gradient averaged over the heat transfer surface.

Heat transfer in the entrance region of a tube. 434 Chapter 14 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Systems The dimensionless temperature gradient appearing in Eq. 14.3-3 could, in principle, be evaluated by differentiating the expression for ? obtained by solving Eqs. 11.5-7, 8, and 9 with the boundary conditions where i7 = v/(uZ), and 9 = (9 - 91)/p(v,)~. As in s6.2, we have neglected the d2/di2 terms of the equations of change on the basis of order-of-magnitude reasoning similar to that in 94.4. With those terms suppressed, upstream transport of heat and momentum are excluded, so that the solutions upstream of plane 2 in Fig. 14.3-1 do not depend on L/D. From Eqs. 11.5-7,8, and 9 and these boundary conditions, we conclude that the di- mensionless instantaneous temperature distribution must be of the following form: ? = ?(?, 8, i, i; Re, Pr, Br) for 0 5 i 5 L/D (14.3-9) Substitution of this relation into Eq. 14.3-3 leads to the conclusion that NU,(^) = Nul(Re, Pr, Br, L/D, i). When time-averaged over an interval long enough to include all the tur- bulent disturbances, this becomes Nul = Nul(Re, Pr, Br, L/D) (14.3-10) A similar relation is valid when the flow at plane 1 is fully developed. If, as is often the case, the viscous dissipation heating is small, the Brinkman number can be omitted. Then Eq. 14.3-10 simplifies to Nu, = Nul(Re, Pr, L/ D) (14.3-1 1) Therefore, dimensional analysis tells us that, for forced-convection heat transfer in circu- lar tubes with constant wall temperature, experimental values of the heat transfer coeffi- cient h1 can be correlated by giving Nu, as a function of the Reynolds number, the Prandtl number, and the geometric ratio L/D. This should be compared with the similar, but simpler, situation with the friction factor (Eqs. 6.2-9 and 10). The same reasoning leads us to similar expressions for the other heat transfer coeffi- cients we have defined. It can be shown (see Problem 14.B-4) that Nu, = Nu,(Re, Pr, LID) Nul, = Nu,(Re, Pr, LID) Nuloc = Nul,,(Re, Pr, z/ D) in which Nu, = h,D/k, Nul, = hl,D/k, and Nu,,, = hl,,D/k. That is, to each of the heat transfer coefficients, there is a corresponding Nusselt number. These Nusselt numbers are, of course, interrelated (see Problem 14.B-5). These general functional forms for the Nusselt numbers have a firm scientific basis, since they involve only the dimensional analysis of the equations of change and boundary conditions. Thus far we have assumed that the physical properties are constants over the tem- perature range encountered in the flow system. At the end of s14.2 we indicated that evaluating the physical properties at the film temperature is a suitable empiricism. How- ever, for very large temperature differences, the viscosity variations may result in such a large distortion of the velocity profiles that it is necessary to account for this by introduc- ing an additional dimensionless group, pb/po, where pb is the viscosity at the arithmetic s14.3 Heat Transfer Coefficients for Forced Convection in Tubes 435 average bulk temperature and po is the viscosity at the arithmetic average wall tempera- ture.' Then we may write Nu = Nu(Re, Pr, L/ D, pb/po) (14.3-15) This type of correlation seems to have first been presented by Sieder and Tate.2 If, in ad- dition, the density varies significantly, then some free convection may occur. This effect can be accounted for in correlations by including the Grashof number along with the other dimensionless groups. This point is pursued further in 914.6. Let us now pause to reflect on the significance of the above discussion for con- structing heat transfer correlations. *The heat transfer coefficient h depends on eight physical quantities (D, (v), p, PO, pb, Cp, k, L). However, Eq. 14.3-15 tells us that this de- pendence can be expressed more concisely by giving Nu as a function of only four di- mensionless groups (Re, Pr, LID, pb/pO). Thus, instead of taking data on h for 5 values of each of the eight individual physical quantities (58 tests), we can measure h for 5 values of the dimensionless groups (5\"ests)-a rather dramatic saving of time and effort. A good global view of heat transfer in circular tubes with nearly constant wall tem- perature can be obtained from the Sieder and Tate2 correlation shown in Fig. 14.3-2. This is of the form of Eq. 14.3-15. It has been found empiri~ally~,~ that transition to turbulence usually begins at about Re = 2100, even when the viscosity varies appreciably in the ra- dial direction. For highly turbulent flow, the curves for LID > 10 converge to a single curve. For Re > 20,000 this curve is described by the equation This equation reproduces available experimental data within about ?20% in the ranges lo4 < Re < 105and0.6 < Pr < 100. For laminar flow, the descending lines at the left are given by the equation One can arrive at the viscosity ratio by inserting into the equations of change a temperature- dependent viscosity, described, for example, by a Taylor expansion about the wall temperature: When the series is truncated and the differential quotient is approximated by a difference quotient, we get Thus, the viscosity ratio appears in the equation of motion and hence in the dimensionless correlation.

Alan Philip Colburn (1904-1955), provost at the University of Delaware (1950-1955), made important contributions to the fields of heat and mass transfer, including the \"Chilton-Colburn relations.\" 436 Chapter 14 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Systems Fig. 14.3-2. Heat transfer coefficients for fully developed flow in smooth tubes. The lines for lami- nar flow should not be used in the range RePrD/L < 10, which corresponds to (To - Tb),/(T0 - T,), < 0.2. The laminar curves are based on data for RePrD/L >> 10 and nearly constant wall tem- perature; under these conditions h, and kl, are indistinguishable. We recommend using k,, as op- posed to the h, suggested by Sieder and Tate, because this choice is conservative in the usual heat- exchanger design calculations [E. N. Sieder and G. E. Tate, Ind. Eng. Chem., 28,1429-1435 (1936)l. which is based on Eq. (C) of Table 14.2-l4 and Problem 12D.4. The numerical coefficient in Eq. (C) has been multiplied by a factor of $ to convert from h,,, to hln, and then further modified empirically to account for the deviations due to variable physical properties. This illustrates how a satisfactory empirical correlation can be obtained by modifying the result of an analytical derivation. Equation 14.3-17 is good within about 20% for RePr D/L > 10, but at lower values of RePr D/L it underestimates hl, considerably. The occur- rence of Pr1'3 in Eqs. 14.3-16 and 17 is consistent with the large Prandtl number asymp- tote found in 9913.6 and 12.4. The transition region, roughly 2100 < Re < 8000 in Fig. 14.3-2, is not well understood and is usually avoided in design if possible. The curves in this region are supported by experimental measurements2 but are less reliable than the rest of the plot. The general characteristics of the curves in Fig. 14.3-2 deserve careful study. Note that for a heated section of given L and D and a fluid of given physical properties, the or- dinate is proportional to the dimensionless temperature rise of the fluid passing through-that is, (T,, - T,,)/(T, - Tb)ln Under these conditions, as the flow rate (or Reynolds number) is increased, the exit fluid temperature will first decrease until Re reaches about 2100, then increase until Re reaches about 8000, and then finally decrease again. The influence of L/D on h,, is marked in laminar flow but becomes insignificant for Re > 8000 with LID > 60. Equation (C) is an asymptotic solution of the Graetz problem, one of the classic problems of heat convection: L. Graetz, Ann. d. Physik, 13,79-94 (1883), 25,337-357 (1885); see J. Leveque, Ann. Mines (Series 12), 13,201-299,305-362,381415 (1928) for the asymptote in Eq. (C). An extensive summary can be found in M. A. Ebadian and Z. F. Dong, Chapter 5 of Handbook of Heat Transfer, 3rd edition, (W. M. Rohsenow, J. P. Hartnett, and Y. I. Cho, eds.), McGraw-Hill, New York (1998). 514.3 Heat Transfer Coefficients for Forced Convection in Tubes 437 Note also that Fig. 14.3-2 somewhat resembles the friction-factor plot in Fig. 6.2-2, al- though the physical situation is quite different. In the highly turbulent range (Re > 10,000) the heat transfer ordinate agrees approximately with f/2 for the long smooth pipes under consideration. This was first pointed out by Colburn,\" who proposed the fol- lowing empirical analogy for long, smooth tubes: where S is the area of the tube cross section, w is the mass rate of flow through the tube, and f/2 is obtainable from Fig. 6.2-2 using Re = Dw/Sp = 4w/n-Dp. Clearly the analogy of Eq. 14.3-18 is not valid below Re = 10,000. For rough tubes with fully developed tur- bulent flow the analogy breaks down completely, because f is affected more by rough- ness than j, is. One additional remark about the use of Fig. 14.3-2 has to do with the application to conduits of noncircular cross section. For highly turbulent flow, one may use the mean hydraulic radius of Eq. 6.2-16. To apply that empiricism, D is replaced by 4R, every- where in the Reynolds and Nusselt numbers. Air at 70°F and 1 atm is to be pumped through a straight 2-in. i.d. tube at a rate of 70 IbJhr.

The viscosities of air at 150°F and 250°F are 0.049 and 0.055 Ib,/ft . hr, respectively, so that the viscosity ratio is pb/pO = 0.049/0.055 = 0.89. The Reynolds number, evaluated at the film temperature, 200°F, is then From Fig. 14.3-1 we obtain When this is solved for L/D we get Hence the required length is If Reb had been much smaller, it would have been necessary to estimate LID before reading Fig. 14.3-2, thus initiating a trial-and-error process. 438 Chapter 14 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Systems Note that in this problem we did not have to calculate h. Numerical evaluation of h is necessary, however, in more complicated problems such as heat exchange between two fluids with an intervening wall. 514.4 HEAT TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS FOR FORCED CONVECTION AROUND SUBMERGED OBJECTS Another topic of industrial importance is the transfer of heat to or from an object around which a fluid is flowing. The object may be relatively simple, such as a single cylinder or sphere, or it may be more complex, such as a \"tube bundle\" made up of a set of cylindri- cal tubes with a stream of gas or liquid flowing between them. We examine here only a few selected correlations for simple systems: the flat plate, the sphere, and the cylinder. Many additional correlations may be found in the references cited in the introduction to the chapter. Flow Along a Flat Plate We first examine the flow along a flat plate, oriented parallel to the flow, with its surface maintained at To and the approaching stream having a uniform temperature T, and a uniform velocity v,. The heat transfer coefficient hlOc = qo/(To - T,) and the friction fac- tor fi,, = T,/;~V~ are shown in Fig. 14.1-1. For the laminar region, which normally exists near the leading edge of the plate, the following theoretical expressions are obtained (see Eq. 4.4-30 as well as Eqs. 12.4-12,12.4-15, and 12.4-16): Fig. 14.4-1. Transfer coefficients for a smooth flat plate in tangential flow. Adapted from H. Schlichting, Boundary-Layer Theo y, McGraw-Hill, New York (1955), pp. 438-439. 514.4 Heat Transfer Coefficients for Forced Convection Around Submerged Objects 439 As shown in Table 12.4-1, a more accurate value of the numerical coefficient in Eq. 14.4-2 is that of Pohlhausen-namely, 0.332. If we use this value, then Eq. 14.4-2 gives Since the numerical coefficient in Eq. 14.4-3 is the same as that in Eq. 14.4-1, we then €9 for the Colburn analogy between heat transfer and fluid friction. This was to be ex- pected, because there is no \"form drag\" in this flow geometry. Equation 14.4-4 was derived for fluids with constant physical properties.' When the physical properties are evaluated at the film temperature Ti = :(To + T,), Eq. 14.4-3 is known to work well for gases.* The analogy of Eq. 14.4-4 is accurate within 2% for Pr > 0.6, but becomes inaccurate at lower Prandtl numbers. For highly turbulent flows, the Colburn analogy still holds with fair accuracy, with f,,, given by the empirical curve in Fig. 14.4-1. The transition between laminar and turbu- lent flow resembles that for pipes in Fig. 14.3-1, but the limits of the transition region are harder to predict. For smooth, sharp-edged flat plates in an isothermal flow the transi- tion usually begins at a Reynolds number Re, = xv,p/p of 100,000 to 300,000 and is al- most complete at a 50% higher Reynolds number. Flow Around a Sphere In Problem 10B.1 it is shown that the Nusselt number for a sphere in a stationary fluid is 2. For the sphere with constant surface temperature To in a flowing fluid approaching with a uniform velocity v,, the mean Nusselt number is given by the following empiri- cism3 Nu, = 2 + 0.60 ~e'/' Pr1l3 (14.4-5) This result is useful for predicting the heat transfer to or from droplets or bubbles. Another correlation that has proven successful4 is Nu,, = 2 + (0.4 Re'12 + 0.06Re~/~)Pr~,~ (14.4-6) in which the physical properties appearing in Nu,, Re, and Pr are evaluated at the ap- proaching stream temperature. This correlation is recommended for 3.5 < Re < 7.6 x 10\" 0.71 < Pr < 380, and 1.0 < p,/p, < 3.2. In contrast to Eq. 14.4-5, it is not valid in the limit that Pr -, w. ' The result in Eq. 14.4-1 was first obtained by H. Blasius, Z. Math. Phys., 56,l-37 (1908), and that in Eq. 14.4-3 by E. Pohlhausen, Z. angew. Math. Mech., 1,115-121 (1921). E. R. G. Eckert, Trans.

This result can be used for analyzing the steady-state performance of hot-wire anemometers, which typically operate at low Reynolds numbers. Flow Around Other Objects We learn from the preceding three discussions that, for the flow around objects of shapes other than those described above, a fairly good guess for the heat transfer coefficients can be obtained by using the relation Nu, - NU,^,, = 0.6 Re1l2 Pr1I3 (14.4-9) in which Nu,,o is the mean Nusselt number at zero Reynolds number.

The velocity profiles in packed beds exhibit a strong maximum near the wall, attribut- able partly to the higher void fraction there and partly to the more ordered interstitial passages along this smooth boundary. The resulting segregation of the flow into a fast outer stream and a slower interior one, which mix at the exit of the bed, leads to compli- cated behavior of mean Nusselt numbers in deep packed beds,' unless the tube-to-parti- cle diameter ratio DJD, is very large or close to unity. Experiments with wide, shallow beds show simpler behavior and are used in the following discussion. We define hi,, for a representative volume Sdz of particles and fluid by the following modification of Eq. 14.1-5: Here a is the outer surface area of particles per unit bed volume, as in 96.4. Equations 6.4- 5 and 6 give the effective particle size D, as 6/a, = 6(1 - &)/a for a packed bed with void fraction E. Extensive data on forced convection for the flow of gases2 and liquids3 through shal- low packed beds have been critically analyzed4 to obtain the following local heat transfer correlation, j, = 2.19 ~e-~/~ + 0.78 Re-0,381 (14.5-2) and an identical formula for the mass transfer function j, defined in 922.3. Here the Chilton-Colburn j, factor and the Reynolds number are defined by In this equation the physical properties are all evaluated at the film temperature Tf = $(To - TJ, and Go = w/S is the superficial mass flux introduced in 96.4. The quantity 4 is a particle-shape factor, with a defined value of 1 for spheres and a fitted value4 of 0.92 for cylindrical pellets. A related shape factor was used by Gamson5 in Re and j,; the present factor + is used in Re only. For small Re, Eq. 14.5-2 yields the asymptote ' H. Martin, Chem. Eng. Sci., 33,913-919 (1978). B. W.

The latter re- striction gives Nu >> 1 corresponding to a thin thermal boundary layer relative to DJ(1 - E)$. This asymptote represents the creeping-flow mass-transfer data for liquids3 very well. The exponent 5 in Eq. 14.5-3 is a high-Pr asymptote given by boundary layer theory for steady laminar flows6 and for steadily driven turbulent flows.7 This dependence is consistent with the cited data over the full range Pr > 0.6 and the corresponding range of the dimensionless group Sc for mass transfer. 514.6 HEAT TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS FOR FREE AND MIXED CONVECTION1 Here we build on Example 11.4-5 to summarize the behavior of some important sys- tems in the presence of appreciable buoyant forces, first by rephrasing the results ob- tained there in terms of Nusselt numbers and then by extension to other situations: (1) small buoyant forces, where the thin-boundary-layer assumption of Example 11.4-5 may not be valid; (2) very large buoyant forces, where turbulence can occur in the boundary layer, and (3) mixed forced and free convection. We shall confine ourselves to heat transfer between solid bodies and a large quiescent volume of surrounding fluid, and to the constant-temperature boundary conditions of Example 11.4-5. Discussions of other situations, including transient behavior and duct and cavity flows, are available elsewhere.' In Example 11.4-5 we saw that for the free convection near a vertical flat plate, the principal dimensionless group is GrPr, which is often called the Rayleigh number, Ra. If we define the area mean Nusselt number as Nu,, = hH/k = qavgH/k(T0 - TI), then Eq. 11.4-51 may be written as Nu, = c(G~P~)\"~ (14.6-1) where C was found to be a weak function of Pr. The heat transfer behavior at moderate values of Ra = GrPr is governed, for many shapes of solids, by laminar boundary layers of the type described in Example 11.4-5, and the results of those discussions are normally used directly. However, at small values of GrPr direct heat conduction to the surroundings may invalidate the boundary layer result, and at sufficiently high values of GrPr the mecha- nism of heat transfer shifts toward random local eruptions or plumes of fluid, producing turbulence within the boundary layer. Then the Nusselt number becomes independent of the system size. The case of combined forced and free convection (normally referred to as mixed convection) is more complex: one must now consider Pr, Gr, and Re as inde- pendent variables, and also whether the forced and free convection effects are in the same or different directions. Only the former seems to be at all well understood. The de- scription of the behavior is further complicated by lack of abrupt transitions between the various flow regimes. ' W. E.

NU^^, for pure forced convection These are dealt with in the following subsections. No Buoyant Forces The limiting Nusselt number for vanishingly small free and forced convection is ob- tained by solving the heat conduction equation (the Laplace equation, V2T = 0) for con- stant, uniform temperature over the solid surface and a different constant temperature at infinity. The mean Nusselt number then has the general form With K equal to zero for all objects with at least one infinite dimension (e.g., infinitely long cylinders or infinitely wide plates). For finite bodies K is nonzero, and an important case is that of the sphere for which, according to Problem 10B.1, with the characteristic length taken to be the sphere diameter. Oblate ellipsoids of revo- lution and circular disks are discussed in Problem 14D.1. Thin Laminar Boundary Layers For thin laminar boundary layers, the isothermal vertical flat plate is a representative system, conforming to Eq. 14.6-1. This equation may be generalized to Moreover, the function of Pr and shape can be factored into the product Representative values',3 of C, and C, are given in Tables 14.6-1 and 2, respectively.

Laminar free-convection heat fluxes tend to be small, and a conduction correction is often necessary for accurate predictions. The conduction limit is determined by solving the equation V2T = 0 for the given geometry, and this leads to the calculation , .

This rule appears to hold reasonably well for all geometries and situations, provided only that the forced and free convection have the same primary flow direction. EXAMPLE 14.6-1 Heat Loss by Free Convection from a Horizontal Pipe Estimate the rate of heat loss by free convection from a unit length of a long horizontal pipe, 6 in. in outside diameter, if the outer surface temperature is 100°F and the surrounding air is at 1 atm and 80°F.

Condensation occurs industrially in many types of equipment; for simplicity, we consider here only the common cases of condensation of a slowly moving vapor on the outside of horizontal tubes, vertical tubes, and vertical flat walls. The condensation process on a vertical wall is illustrated schematically in Fig. 14.7-1. Vapor flows over the condensing surface and is moved toward it by the small pressure gradient near the liquid surface.' Some of the molecules from the vapor phase strike the liquid surface and bounce off; others penetrate the surface and give up their latent heat of condensation. The heat thus released must then move through the condensate to the wall, thence to the coolant on the other side of the wall. At the same time, the condensate must drain from the surface by gravity flow. The condensate on the wall is normally the sole important resistance to heat transfer on the condensing wall. If the solid surface is clean, the condensate will usu- ally form a continuous film over the surface, but if traces of certain impurities are pre- sent, (such as fatty acids in a steam condenser), the condensate will form in droplets. \"Dropwise condensati~n\"~ gives much higher rates of heat transfer than \"film con- densation,\" but is difficult to maintain, so that it is common practice to assume film condensation in condenser design. The correlations that follow apply only to film condensation. The usual definition of h,, for condensation of a pure vapor on a solid surface of area A and uniform temperature To is in which Q is the rate of heat flow into the solid surface, and Td is the dew point of the vapor approaching the wall surfacethat is, the temperature at which the vapor would Note that there occur small but abrupt changes in pressure and temperature at an interface. These discontinuities are essential to the condensation process, but are generally of negligible magnitude in engineering calculations for pure fluids. For mixtures, they may be important. See R. W. Schrage, Interphase Mass Transfer, Columbia University Press (1953). Dropwise condensation and boiling are discussed at length by J. G. Collier and J. R. Thome, Convective Boiling and Condensation, 3rd edition, Oxford University Press (1996). g14.7 Heat Transfer Coefficients for Condensation of Pure Vapors on Solid Surfaces 447 condense if cooled slowly at the prevailing pressure. This temperature is very nearly that of the liquid at the liquid-gas interface. Therefore h, may be regarded as a heat transfer coefficient for the liquid film. Expressions for h, have been derived3 for laminar nonrippling condensate flow by ap- proximate solution of the equations of energy and motion for a falling liquid film (see Problem 14C.1). For film condensation on a horizontal tube of diameter D, length L, and constant surface temperature To, the result of Nusselt3 may be written as Here w/L is the mass rate of condensation per unit length of tube, and it is understood that all the physical properties of the condensate are to be calculated at the film tempera- ture, Ti = :(T, + To). For moderate temperature differences, Eq. 14.7-2 may be rewritten with the aid of an energy balance on the condensate to give Equations 14.7-2 and 3 have been confirmed experimentally within 2 10% for single hori- zontal tubes. They also seem to give satisfactory results for bundles of horizontal tubesf4 in spite of the complications introduced by condensate dripping from tube to tube. For film condensation on vertical tubes or vertical walls of height L, the theoretical re- sults corresponding to Eqs. 14.7-2 and 3 are and respectively. The quantity r in Eq. 14.7-4 is the total rate of condensate flow from the bot- tom of the condensing surface per unit width of that surface. For a vertical tube, r = w/nD, where w is the total mass rate of condensation on the tube. For short vertical tubes (L < 0.5 ft), the experimental values of h, confirm the theory well, but the measured values for long ver- tical tubes (L > 8 ft) may exceed the theory for a given T, - To by as much as 70%. This dis- crepancy is attributed to ripples that attain greatest amplitude on long vertical tubes: We now turn to the empirical expressions for turbulent condensate flow. Turbulent flow begins, on vertical tubes or walls, at a Reynolds number Re = T/p of about 350. For higher Reynolds numbers, the following empirical formula has been pr~posed:~ This equation is equivalent, for small T, - To, to the formula W. Nusselt, Z. Ver. deutsch.

Somewhat better agreement could have been obtained by using a family of lines in the turbulent range to represent the effect of Prandtl number. However, in view of the scattering of the data, a single line is adequate. Turbulent condensate flow is very difficult to obtain on horizontal tubes, unless the tube diameters are very large or high temperature differences are encountered. Equa- tions 14.7-2 and 3 are believed to be satisfactory up to the estimated transition Reynolds number, Re = w,/Lp, of about 1000, where w, is the total condensate flow leaving a given tube, including the condensate from the tubes above.7 The inverse process of vaporization of a pure fluid is considerably more complicated than condensation.

The steam-heated tube section is 10 ft high and 2 in. in outside diameter. If saturated steam is used, what steam temperature is required to supply 92,000 Btu/hr of heat to the tube at a tube-surface temperature of 200°F? Assume film condensation. SOLUTION The fluid properties depend on the unknown temperature T,. We make a guess of T, = To = 200°F. Then the physical properties at the film temperature (also 200°F) are Assuming that the steam gives up only latent heat (the assumption Td = 7'\" = 200°F implies this), an energy balance around the tube gives in which Q is the heat flow into the tube wall. The film Reynolds number is Reading Fig. 14.7-2 at this value of the ordinate, we find that the flow is laminar. Equation 14.7-2 is applicable, but it is more convenient to use the line based on this equation in Fig. 14.7-2, which gives from which Therefore, the first approximation to the steam temperature is Td = 222°F. This result is close enough; evaluation of the physical properties in accordance with this result gives T, = 220 as a second approximation. It is apparent from Fig. 14.7-2 that this result represents an upper limit. On account of rippling, the temperature drop through the condensate film may be as lit- tle as half that predicted here.

Local overall heat transfer coefficient. In Prob- lem 14A.1 the thermal resistances of the condensed steam film and wall were neglected. Justify this neglect by calcu- lating the actual inner-surface temperature of the tubes at that cross section in the exchanger at which the oil bulk temperature is 150°F. You may assume that for the oil bloc is constant throughout the exchanger at 190 Btu/hr ft2 . F. The tubes are horizontal. 14B.3. The hot-wire anemometer.' A hot-wire anemome- ter is essentially a fine wire, usually made of platinum, which is heated electrically and inserted into a flowing fluid. The wire temperature, which is a function of the fluid temperature, fluid velocity, and the rate of heating, may be determined by measuring its electrical resistance. (a) A straight cylindrical wire 0.5 in. long and 0.01 in. in diameter is exposed to a stream of air at 70°F flowing past the wire at 100 ft/s. What must the rate of energy input be in watts to maintain the wire surface at 600°F? Neglect ra- diation as well as heat conduction along the wire. (b) It has been reported2 that for a given fluid and wire at given fluid and wire temperatures (hence a given wire resistance) I~=B&+c (14B.3-1) See, for example, G.

Dimensional analysis. Consider the flow system described in the first paragraph of s14.3, for which dimen- sional analysis has already given the dimensionless veloc- ity profile (Eq. 6.2-7) and temperature profile (Eq. 14.3-9).

Heat loss by free convection from a pipe. In Ex- ample 14.6-1, would the heat loss be higher or lower if the pipe-surface temperature were 200°F and the air tempera- ture were 180°F? 14C.1. The Nusselt expression for film condensation heat transfer coefficients (Fig. 14.7-1). Consider a laminar film of condensate flowing down a vertical wall, and as- sume that this liquid film constitutes the sole heat transfer resistance on the vapor side of the wall. Further assume that (i) the shear stress between liquid and vapor may be neglected; (ii) the physical properties in the film may be evaluated at the arithmetic mean of vapor and cooling- surface temperatures and that the cooling-surface temper- ature may be assumed constant; (iii) acceleration of fluid elements in the film may be neglected compared to the 452 Chapter 14 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Systems gravitational and viscous forces; (iv) sensible heat changes, C&T, in the condensate film are unimportant compared to the latent heat transferred through it; and (v) the heat flux is very nearly normal to the wall surface. (a) Recall from 52.2 that the average velocity of a film of constant thickness 6 is (v,) = pgS2/3p. Assume that this re- lation is valid for any value of z. (b) Write the energy equation for the film, neglecting film curvature and convection. Show that the heat flux through the film toward the cold surface is (c) As the film proceeds down the wall, it picks up addi- tional material by the condensation procps. In this process, heat is liberated to the extent of AH,,, per unit mass of material that undergoes the change in state. Show that equating the heat liberation by condensation with the heat flowing through the film in a segment dz of the film leads to (d) Insert the expression for the average velocity from (a) into Eq. 14C.1-2 and integrate from z = 0 to z = L to obtain (e) Use the definition of the heat transfer coefficient and the result in (d) to obtain Eq. 14.7-5. (f) Show that Eqs. 14.7-4 and 5 are equivalent for the con- ditions of this problem. 14C.2. Heat transfer correlations for agitated tanks (Fig. 14C.2). A liquid of essentially constant physical properties is being continuously heated by passage through an agi- tated tank, as shown in the accompanying figure. Heat is supplied by condensation of steam on the outer wall of the tank. The thermal resistance of the condensate film and the tank wall may be considered small compared to that of the fluid in the tank, and the unjacketed portion of the tank t Condensate out Fig. 14C.2. Continuous heating of a liquid in an agitated tank. may be assumed to be well insulated. The rate of liquid flow through the tank has a negligible effect on the flow pattern in the tank. Develop a general form of dimensionless heat transfer correlation for the tank corresponding to the correlation for tube flow in 514.3. Choose the following reference quantities: reference length, D, the impeller diameter; ref- erence velocity, ND, where N is the rate of shaft rotation in revolutions per unit time; reference pressure, ~PD~, where p is the fluid density. 14D.1. Heat transfer from an oblate ellipsoid of revolu- tion. Systems of this sort are best described in oblate ellip- soidal coordinates (5; 7, +)' for which 5 = constant describes oblate ellipsoids (0 5 5 < m) 77 = constant describes hyperboloids of revolution (0 5 77 I 7r) + = constant describes half planes (0 I + < 27r) Note that 5 = 6, can describe oblate ellipsoids, with 5, = 0 being a limiting case of the two-sided disk, and the limit as + a~ being a sphere. In this problem we investigate the corresponding two limiting values of the Nusselt number. (a) First use Eq. A.7-13 to get the scale factors from the re- lation between oblate ellipsoidal coordinates and Carte- sian coordinates: x = a cosh 5 sin 7 cos + (14D.1-1) y = a cosh sin 7 sin + (14D.1-2) z =a sinhc cos 77 (14D.1-3) in which a is one-half the distance between the foci. Show that h,, = a cosh 5 sin 77 (14D.1-5) Equations A.7-13 and 14 can then be used to get any of the V-operations that are needed. (b) Next obtain the temperature profile outside of an oblate ellipsoid with surface temperature To, which is em- bedded in an infinite medium with the temperature T, far from the ellipsoid. Let O = (T - To)/(T, - To) be a dimen- sionless temperature, and show that Laplace's equation describing the heat conduction exterior to the ellipsoid is ,-, 7 1 Id (cosh 6 $) + . . = 0 (14D.1-6) a2(cosh2 5 - sin2 77) d5 ' For a discussion of oblate ellipsoidal coordinates, see P. Moon and D. E. Spencer, Field Theory Handbook, Springer, Berlin (1961), pp. 31-34. See also J. Happel and H. Brenner, Low Reynolds Number Hydrodynamics, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. (196.51, pp. 512-516; note that their scale factors are the reciprocals of those defined in this book. Problems 453 The terms involving derivatives with respect to 77 and t,b have been omitted because they are not needed. Show that this equation may be solved with the boundary conditions that @(to) = 0 and @(a) = 1 to obtain (c) Next, specialize this result for the two-sided disk (that is, the limiting case that to = O), and show that the normal temperature gradient at the surface is where a has been expressed as X, the disk radius. Show fur- ther that the total heat loss through both sides of the disk is and that the Nusselt number is given by Nu = 16/a = 5.09. Since Nu = 2 for the analogous sphere problem, we see that the Nusselt number for any oblate ellipsoid must lie somewhere between 2 and 5.09. (d) By dimensional analysis show that, without doing any detailed derivation (such as the above), one can predict that the heat loss from the ellipsoid must be proportional to the linear dimension a rather than to the surface area. Is this result limited to ellipsoids? Discuss. Chapter 15 Macroscopic Balances for Nonisothermal Systems The macroscopic energy balance The macroscopic mechanical energy balance Use of the macroscopic balances to solve steady-state problems with flat velocity profiles The d-forms of the macroscopic balances Use of the macroscopic balances to solve unsteady-state problems and problems with nonflat velocity profiles In Chapter 7 we discussed the macroscopic mass, momentum, angular momentum, and mechanical energy balances. The treatment there was restricted to systems at constant temperature. Actually this restriction is somewhat artificial, since in real flow systems mechanical energy is always being converted into thermal energy by viscous dissipation. What we really assumed in Chapter 7 is that any heat so produced is either too small to change the fluid properties or is immediately conducted away through the walls of the system containing the fluid. In this chapter we extend the previous results to describe the overall behavior of nonisothermal macroscopic flow systems. For a nonisothermal system there are five macroscopic balances that describe the re- lations between the inlet and outlet conditions of the stream. They may be derived by in- tegrating the equations of change over the macroscopic system: Ltj (eq. of continuity) dV = macroscopic mass balance (eq. of motion) dV = macroscopic momentum balance (eq. of angular momentum) dV = macroscopic angular momentum balance IW (eq. of mechanical energy) dV = macroscopic mechanical energy balance Iv(t, (eq. of (total) energy) dV = macroscopic (total) energy balance The first four of these were discussed in Chapter 7, and their derivations suggest that they can be applied to nonisothermal systems just as well as to isothermal systems. In this chapter we add the fifth balance-namely, that for the total energy. This is derived in 915.1, not by performing the integration above, but rather by applying the law of con- servation of total energy directly to the system shown in Fig. 7.0-1. Then in 915.2 we re- visit the mechanical energy balance and examine it in the light of the discussion of the s15.1 The Macroscopic Energy Balance 455 (total) energy balance. Next in 515.3 we give the simplified versions of the macroscopic balances for steady-state systems and illustrate their use. In 515.4 we give the differential forms (d-forms) of the steady-state balances. In these forms, the entry and exit planes 1 and 2 are taken to be only a differential distance apart. The \"d-forms\" are frequently useful for problems involving flow in conduits in which the velocity, temperature, and pressure are continually changing in the flow direction. Finally, in 515.5 we present several illustrations of unsteady-state problems that can be solved by the macroscopic balances. This chapter will make use of nearly all the topics we have covered so far and pro- vides an excellent opportunity to review the preceding chapters. Once again we take this opportunity to remind the reader that in using the macroscopic balances, it may be nec- essary to omit some terms and to estimate the values of others. This requires good intu- ition or some extra experimental data. 515.1 THE MACROSCOPIC ENERGY BALANCE We consider the system sketched in Fig. 7.0-1 and make the same assumptions that were made in Chapter 7 with regard to quantities at the entrance and exit planes: (i) The time-smoothed velocity is perpendicular to the relevant cross section. (ii) The density and other physical properties are uniform over the cross section. (iii) The forces associated with the stress tensor T are neglected. (iv) The pressure does not vary over the cross section. To these we add (likewise at the entry and exit planes): (v) The energy transport by conduction q is small compared to the convective en- ergy transport and can be neglected. (vi) The work associated with [T . v] can be neglected relative to pv. We now apply the statement of conservation of energy to the fluid in the macroscopic flow system. In doing this, we make use of the concept of potential energy to account for the work done against the external forces (this corresponds to using Eq. 11.1-9, rather than Eq. 11.1-7, as the equation of change for energy). The statement of the law of conservation of energy then takes the form: rate of increase of rate at which internal, kinetic, and internal, kinetic, and potential energy enter the system potential energy in at plane 1 by flow the system - @&(v2) + $P*(& + P&s)& (15.1-1) rate at which internal, kinetic, and potential energy leave the system at plane 2 by flow + Q + Wm + (p,(v1)S1 - p*(v2)S*) rate at which rate at which work is done on rate at which work is heat is added the system by the surroundings done on the system by the to the system by means of the moving surroundings at planes 1 across boundary surfaces and 2 Here U,, = Jp~dv, Kt,, = J$p2dv, and @,,, = $p&d~ are the total internal, kinetic, and potential energy in the system, the integrations being performed over the entire volume of the system. 456 Chapter 15 Macroscopic Balances for Nonisothermal Systems This equation may be written in a more compact form by introducing the mass rates of flow w1 = pl(vl)S1 and w, = p,(v,)S,, and the total energy E,,, = U,,, + Kt,,+ a,,,. We thus get for the unsteady state macroscopic energy balance It is clear, from the derivation of Eq. 15.1-1, that the \"work done on the system by the surroundings\" consists of two parts: (1) the work done by the moving surfaces W,, ~nd (2) the work done at the ends of the system (planes 1 and 21, which appears as -A(pVw) in Eq. 15.1-2. Although we have combined the pV terms with the internal, kinetic, and potential energy terms in Eq. 15.1-2, it is inappropriate to say that \"pV energy enters and leaves the system\" at the inlet and outlet. The pV terms originate as work terms and should be thought of as such. We now consider the situation where the system is operating at steady state so that the total energy E,,, is constant, and the mass rates of flow in and out are equal (w, = w, = w). Then it is convenient tojntroduce the symbols Q = Q/w (the heat addition per unit mass of flowing fluid) and W, = W,/w (the work done on a unit mass of flowing fluid). Then the steady state macroscopic energy balance is Here we have written 6, = ghl and 6, = gh, where h, and h, are heights above an ~rbitrariLy chosep datum plane (see the discussion just before Eq. 3.3-2). Similarly, H~ = U1 + plVl and H2 = U, + p2V2 are enthalpies per unit mass measured with respect to an arbitrarily specified reference state. The explicit formula for the enthalpy is given in Eq. 9.8-8. For many problems in the chemical industry the kinetic energy, potential energy, and work terms are negligibie compare4 with the thermal terms in Eq. 15.1-3, and the energy balance simplifies to H2 - H1 = Q, often called an \"enthalpy balance.\" However this relation should not be construed as a conservation equation for enthalpy. 515.2 THE MACROSCOPIC MECHANICAL ENERGY BALANCE The macroscopic mechanical energy balance, given in 57.4 and derived in 57.8, is re- peated here for comparison with Eqs. 15.1-2 and 3. The unsteady-state macroscopic mechan- ical energy balance, as given in Eq. 7.4-2, is where E, and E, are defined in Eqs. 7.4-3 and 4. An approximate form of the steady-state macroscopic mechanical balance, as given in Eq. 7.4-7, is The details of the approximation introduced here are explained in Eqs. 7.8-9 to 12. The integral in Eq. 15.2-2 must be evaluated along a \"representative streamline\" in the system. To do this, one must know the equation of state p y p(p, T) and also how T changes with p along the streamline. In Fig. 15.2-1 the surface V = Q(p, T) for an ideal gas is shown. In the pT-plane there is shown a curve beginning at pl, T1 (the inlet stream conditions) and ending at p,, T2 (the outlet stream conditions). The curve in the pT-plane indicates the succession of states through which the gas passes in going from the initial s15.2 The Macroscopic Mechanical Energy Balance 457 Fig. 15.2-1. Graphical representa- tion of the integral in_Eq. 15.2-2. The ruled area is SF: Vdp = SF; (1 /p)dp. Note that the value of this integral is negative here, because we are integrating from right to left. state to the final state. The integral J: (1 /p) dp is then the projection of the shaded area in Fig. 15.2-1 onto the pc-plane. It is evident that the value of this integral changes as the \"thermodynamic path of the process from plane 1 to 2 is altered. If one knows the path and the equation of state then one can compute J: (1 /p) dp. In several special situations, it is not difficult to evaluate the integral: For isothermal systems, the integral is evaluated by prescribing the isothermal equation of statethat is, by giving a relation for p as a function of p. For exam- ple, for ideal gases p = pM/RT and RT P21 RT P2 1 dp = - 1 dp = - In - (ideal gases) (15.2-3) M PI M PI For incompressible liquids, p is constant so that 1 1,' dp = p (p2 - pl) (incompressible liquids) (15.2-4) For frictionless adiabatic flow of ideal gases with constant heat capacity, p and p are related by the expression pp-? = constant, in which y = kP/& as shown in Exarn- ple 11.4-6. Then the integral becomes Hence for this special case of nonisothermal flow, the integration can be per- formed analytically. We now conclude with several comments involving both the mechanical energy bal- ance and the total energy balance. We emphasized in 57.8 that Eq. 7.4-2 (same as Eq. 15.2-1) is derived by taking the dot product of v with the equation of motion and then in- tegrating the result over the volume of the flow system. Since we start with the equation of motion-which is a statement of the law of conservation of linear momentum-the mechanical energy balance contains information different from that of the (total) energy 458 Chapter 15 Macroscopic Balances for Nonisothermal Systems balance, which is a statement of the law of conservation of energy. Therefore, in general, both balances are needed for problem solving. The mechanical energy balance is not \"an alternative form\" of the energy balance. In fact, if we subtract the mechanical energy balance in Eq. 15.2-1 from the total en- ergy balance in Eq. 15.1-2 we get the macroscopic balance for the internal energy This states that the total internal energy in the system changes because of the difference in the amount of internal energy entering and leaving the system by fluid flow, because of the heat entering (or leaving) the system through walls of the system, because of the heat produced (or consumed) within the fluid by compression (or expansion), and because of the heat produced in the system because of viscous dissipation heating. Equation 15.2-6 cannot be written a priori, since there is no conservation law for inter- nal energy. It can, however, be obtained by integrating Eq. 11.2-1 over the entire flow system. s15.3 USE OF THE MACROSCOPIC BALANCES TO SOLVE STEADY-STATE PROBLEMS WITH FLAT VELOCITY PROFILES The most important applications of the macroscopic balances are to steady-state prob- lems. Furthermore, it is usually assumed that the flow is turbulent so that the variation of the velocity over the cross section can be safely neglected (see \"Notes\" after Eqs. 7.2-3 and 7.4-7). The five macroscopic balances, with these additional restrictions, are summa- rized in Table 15.3-1. They have been generalized to multiple inlet and outlet ports to ac- commodate a larger set of problems.

All equations are written for compressible flow; for incompressible flow, E, = 0. The quantities E, and E, are defined in Eqs. 7.3-3 and 4. f u, and u, are unit vectors in the direction of flow. s15.3 Use of the Macroscopic Balances to Solve Steady-State Problems with Flat Velocity Profiles 459 EXAMPLE 15.3-1 The Cooling of an Ideal Gas SOLUTION Air out at 0\" F and 15 psia Fig. 15.3-1. The cooling of air in a countercurrent <v>=? heat exchanger. ---------- - Plane 2 liquid in 10 ft Hot - liquid ---------- out - Plane 1 Air in at 300°F and 30 psia <v> = 100 ft sec-' Two hundred pounds per hour of dry air enter the inner tube of the heat exchanger shown in Fig. 15.3-1 at 300°F and 30 psia, with a velocity of 100 ft/sec. The air leaves the exchanger at O\"F and 15 psia, at 10 ft above the exchanger entrance. Calculate the rate of energy removal across the tube wall. Assume turbulent flow and ideal gas behavior, and use the following ex- pression for the heat capacity of air: where ?, is in Btu/(lb-mole . R) and T is in degrees R. For this system, the macroscopic energy balance, Eq. 15.1-3, becomes The enthalpy difference may be obtained from Eq. 9.8-8, and the velocity may be obtained as a function of temperature and pressure with the aid of the macroscopic mass balance plv, = p2v2 and the ideal gas law p = pRT/M. Hence Eq. 15.3-2 becomes The explicit expression for in Eq. 15.3-1 may then be inserted into Eq. 15.3-3 and the inte- gration performed. Next substitution of the numerical values gives the heat removal per pound of fluid passing through the heat exchanger: The rate of heat removal is then Note, in Eq. 15.3-4, that the kinetic and potential energy contributions are negligible in com- parison with the enthalpy change. 460 Chapter 15 Macroscopic Balances for Nonisothermal Systems I I Fig. 15.3-2. The mixing of two ideal gas streams. Two steady, turbulent streams of the same ideal gas flowing at different velocities, tempera- tures, and pressures are mixed as shown in Fig. 15.3-2. Calculate the velocity, temperature, Mixing of Two Ideal and pressure of the resulting stream. Gas Streams SOLUTION The fluid behavior in this example is more complex than that for the incompressible, isother- mal situation discussed in Example 7.6-2, because here changes in density and temperature may be important. We need to use the steady-state macroscopic energy balance, Eq. 15.2-3, and the ideal gas equation of state, in addition to the mass and momentum balances. With these exceptions, we proceed as in Example 7.6-2. We choose the inlet planes (la and lb) to be cross sections at which the fluids first begin to mix. The outlet plane (2) is taken far enough downstream that complete mixing has oc- curred. As in Example 7.6-2 we assume flat velocity profiles, negligible shear stresses on the pipe wall, and no changes in the potential energy. In addition, we neglect the changes in the heat capacity of the fluid and assume adiabatic operation. We now write the following equa- tions for this system with two entry ports and one exit port: Mass: w1 = wla + wlb = W, (15.3-6) Equation of state: P2 = P~RTz/M (15.3-9) In this set of equations we know all the quantities at la and lb, and the four unknowns are p,, T2, p2, and v,. Tref is the reference temperature for the enthalpy. By multiplying Eq. 15.3-6 by kp~,, and adding the result to Eq. 15.3-8 we get The right sides of Eqs. 15.3-6,7, and 10 contain known quantities and we designate them by w, P, and E, respectively. Note that w, P, and E are not independent, because the pressure, temperature, and density of each inlet stream must be related by the equation of state. We now solve Eq. 15.3-7 for v, and eliminate p, by using the ideal gas law. In addition we write w, as p2v2S2. This gives RT2 - P v,+--- Mv, w This equation can be solved for T,, which is inserted into Eq. 15.3-10 to give g15.4 The &Forms of the Macroscopic Balances 461 in which y = C,/Cv, a quantity which varies from about 1.1 to 1.667 for gases. Here we have used the fact that G/R = y/(y - 1) for an ideal gas. When Eq. 15.3-12 is solved for v2 we get On physical grounds, the radicand cannot be negative. It can be shown (see Problem 15B.4) that, when the radicand is zero, the velocity of the final stream is sonic. Therefore, in general one of the solutions for v2 is supersonic and one is subsonic. Only the lower (subsonic) solu- tion can be obtained in the turbulent mixing process under consideration, since supersonic duct flow is unstable. The transition from supersonic to subsonic duct flow is illustrated in Example 11.4-7. Once the velocity v, is known, the pressure and temperature may be calculated from Eqs. 15.3-7 and 11. The mechanical energy balance can be used to get (E, + E,). 515.4 THE d-FORMS OF THE MACROSCOPIC BALANCES The estimation of E, in the mechanical energy balance and Q in the total energy balance often presents some difficulties in nonisothermal systems. For example, for E,,, consider the following two nonisothermal situations: a. For liquids, the average flow velocity in a tube of constant cross section is nearly constant. However, the viscosity may change markedly in the direction of the flow because of the temperature changes, so that f in Eq. 7.5-9 changes with dis- tance. Hence Eq. 7.5-9 cannot be applied to the entire pipe. b. For gases, the viscosity does not change much with pressure, so that the local Reynolds number and local friction factor are nearly constant for ducts of con- stant cross section. However, the average velocity may change considerably along the duct as a result of the change in density with temperature. Hence Eq. 7.5-9 cannot be applied to the entire duct. Similarly for pipe flow with the wall temperature changing with distance, it may be necessary to use local heat transfer coefficients. For such a situation, we can write Eq. 15.1-3 on an incremental basis and generate a differential equation. Or the cross sectional area of the conduit may be changing with downstream distance, and this situation also results in a need for handling the problem on an incremental basis. It is therefore useful to rewrite the steady-state macroscopic mechanical energy bal- ance and the total energy balance by taking planes 1 and 2 to be a differential distance dl apart. We then obtain what we call the \"d-forms\" of the balances: The d-Form of the Mechanical Energy Balance If we take planes 1 and 2 to be a differential distance apart, then we may write Eq. 15.2-2 in the following differential form (assuming flat velocity profiles): 1 * * d($v2) + gdh + - dp = d W - dE, P Then using Eq. 7.5-9 for a differential length dl, we write 462 Chapter 15 Macroscopic Balances for Nonisothermal Systems in which f is the local friction factor, and Rk is the local value of the mean hydraulic ra- dius. In most applications we omit the d~ term, since work is usually done at isolated points along the flow path. The term d w would be needed in tubes with extensible walls, magnetically driven flows, or systems with transport by rotating screws. The d-Form of the Total Energy Balance If we write Eq. 15.1-3 in differential form, we have (with flat velocity profiles) d($') + gdh + dfi = d~ + d~ (15.4-3) Then using Eq. 9.8-7 for d6 and Eq. 14.1-8 for dB we get [ A (;;)A \"fOczAT dl + d ii ~dv+gdh+?~d~+ V-T- dp= in which U,,, is the local overall heat transfer coefficient, Z is the corresponding local conduit perimeter, and AT is the local temperature difference between the fluids inside and outside of the conduit. The examples that follow illustrate applications of Eqs. 15.4-2 and 15.4-4. EXAMPLE 15.4-1 Parallel- or Counter- Flow Heat Exchangers SOLUTION It is desired to describe the performance of the simple double-pipe heat exchanger shown in Fig. 15.4-1 in terms of the heat transfer coefficients of the two streams and the thermal resis- tance of the pipe wall. The exchanger consists essentially of two coaxial pipes with one fluid stream flowing through the inner pipe and another in the annular space; heat is transferred across the wall of the inner pipe. Both streams may flow in the same direction, as indicated in the figure, but normally it is more efficient to use counter flow-that is, to reverse the direc- tion of one stream so that either wk or w, is negative. Steady-state turbulent flow may be as- sumed, and the heat losses to the surroundings may be neglected. Assume further that the local overall heat transfer coefficient is constant along the exchanger. (a) Macroscopic energy balance for each stream as a whole. We designate quantities refer- ring to the hot stream with a subscript h and the cold stream with subscript c.

For incompressible lipids with a press_ure Grop that is not too large, or for ideal gases, Eq. 9.8-8 gives for constant C, the rela- tion AH = CpAT. Hence Eqs. 15.4-5 and 6 can be rewritten as w,$,(T, - Tcl) = Q, = -Qh (15.4-8) (b) d-form of the macroscopic energy balance. Application of Eq. 15.4-4 to the hot stream gives where ro is the outside radius of the inner tube, and Uo is the overall heat transfer coefficient based on the radius ro (see Eq. 14.1-8). Rearrangement of Eq. 15.4-9 gives The corresponding equation for the cold stream is Adding Eqs. 15.4-10 and 11 gives a differential equation for the temperature difference of the two fluids as a function of I: By assuming that U, is independent of 1 and integrating from plane 1 to plane 2, we get This expression relates the terminal temperatures to the stream rates and exchanger dimen- sions, and it can thus be used to describe the performance of the exchanger. However, it is conventional to rearrange Eq. 15.4-13 by taking advantage ofnthe steady-state energy balances in Eq. 15.4-7 and 8. We solve each of these equations for wC, and substitute the results into Eq. 15.4-13 to obtain Here A, is the total outer surface of the inner tube, and (T,, - TC),, is the \"logarithmic mean temperature difference\" between the two streams. Equations 15.4-14 and 15 describe the rate of heat exchange between the two streams and find wide application in engineering practice. Note that the stream rates do not appear explicitly in these equations, which are valid for both parallel-flow and counter-flow exchangers (see Problem 15A.1). From Eqs. 15.4-10 and 11 we can also get the stream temperatures as functions of 1 if de- sired. Considerable care must be used in applying the results of this example to laminar flow, for which the variation of the overall heat transfer coefficient may be quite large. An example of a problem with variable U, is Problem 15B.1. 464 Chapter 15 Macroscopic Balances for Nonisothermal Systems EXAMPLE 15.4-2 Power Requirement for Pumping a Compressible Fluid through a Long Pipe I I I Cooler 1 I Cooler I Natural I 43s -p Natural gas I I gas Compressor I 1 Compressor I - I I I I I I I I Plane 1 Plane 2 Plane 3 1=0 1 = 10 miles Fig. 15.4-2. Pumping a compressible fluid through a pipeline. A natural gas, which may be considered to be pure methane, is to be pumped through a long, smooth pipeline with a 2-ft inside diameter. The gas enters the line at 100 psia with a velocity of 40 ft/s and at the ambient temperature of 70°F. Pumping stations are provided every 10 miles along the line, and at each of these stations the gas is recompressed and cooled to its original temperature and pressure (see Fig. 15.4-2). Estimate the power that must be ex- pended on the gas at each pumping station, assuming ideal gas behavior, flat velocity pro- files, and negligible changes in elevation. SOLUTION We find it convenient to consider the pipe and compressor separately. First we apply Eq. 15.4- 2 to a length dl of the pipe. We then integrate this equation between planes 1 and 2 to obtain the unknown pressure p2. Once this is known, we may apply Eq. 15.2-2 to the system between planes 2 and 3 to obtain the work done by the pump. (a) Flow through the pipe. For this portion of the system, Eq. 15.4-2 simplifies to where D is the pipe diameter. Since the pipe is quite long, we assume that the fluid is isother- mal at 70°F. We may then eliminate both v and p from Eq. 15.4-16 by use of the assumed equa- tion of state, p = pRT/M, and the macroscopic mass balance, which may be written pv = p,v,. With p and v written in terms of the pressure, Eq. 15.4-16 becomes We pointed out in 51.3 that the viscosity of ideal gases is independent of the pressure. From this it follows that the Reynolds number of the gas, Re = Dw/Sp, and hence the friction factor f, must be constants. We may then integrate Eq. 15.4-17 to obtain This equation gives p, in terms of quantities that are already known, except for f, which is eas- ily calculated: the kinematic viscosity of methane at 100 psi and 70 F is about 2.61 X fi?/s, and therefore Re = Dv/v = (200 ft)(40 ft/s)/(2.61 ft2/s) = 3.07 X lo6. The friction factor can then be estimated to be 0.0025 (see Fig. 6.2-2). Substituting numerical values into Eq. 15.4-18, we get g15.5 Use of the Macroscopic Balances to Solve Unsteady-State Problems 465 By solving this equation with p, = 100 psia, we obtain p2 = 86 psia. (b) Flow through the compressor. We are now ready to apply the mechanical energy bal- ance to the compressor. We start by putting Eq. 15.2-2 into the form To evaluate _the integral in this equation, we assume that the compression is adiabatic and further that E, between planes 2 and 3 can be neglected. We may use Eq. 15.2-5 to rewrite Eq. 15.2-21 as in which w,, is the energy required of the compressor. By substituting numerical values into Eq. 15.4-22, we get The power required to compress the fluid is The power required would be virtually the same if the flow in the pipeline were adiabatic (see Problem 15A.2). The assumptions used here-assuming the compression to be adiabatic and neglecting the viscous dissipation-are conventional in the design of compressor-cooler combinatiops. Note that the energy required to run the compressor is greater than the calculated work, W,, by (i) g, between planes 2 and 3, (ii) mechanical losses in the compressor itself, and (iii) errors in the assume$ p-p path. Normally the energy required at the pump shaft is at least 15 to 20% greater than W,. $15.5 USE OF THE MACROSCOPIC BALANCES TO SOLVE UNSTEADY-STATE PROBLEMS AND PROBLEMS WITH NONFLAT VELOCITY PROFILES In Table 15.5-1 we summarize all five macroscopic balances for unsteady state and non- flat velocity profiles, and for systems with multiple entry and exit ports. One practically never needs to use these balances in this degree of completeness, but it is convenient to have the entire set of equations collected in one place. We illustrate their use in the ex- amples that follow. 466 Chapter 15 Macroscopic Balances for Nonisothermal Systems Table 15.5-1 Unsteady-State Macroscopic Balances for Flow in Nonisothermal Systems Mass: Momentum: Angular momentum: Mechanical energy: (Total) energy: Notes: a CW, = wla + wlb + w,, + - , where w,, = p,,v,,S,,, and so on. h, and h, are elevations above an arbitrary datum plane. ' kl and H> are enthalpies per unit mass relative to some arbitrarily chosen reference state; the formula for k is given in Eq. 9.8-8. All equations are written for compressible flow; for incompressible flow, E, = 0. The quantities E, and E, are defined in Eqs. 7.3-3 and 4. u, and u, are unit vectors in the direction of flow. A cylindrical tank capable of holding 1000 ft%f liquid is equipped with an agitator having sufficient power to keep the liquid contents at a uniform temperature (see Fig. 15.5-1). Heat is Heating of a Liquid in transferred to the contents by means of a coil arranged in such a way that the area available an Agitated ~ank' for heat transfer is proportional to the quantity of liquid in the tank. This heating coil consists of 10 turns, 4 ft in diameter, of 1-in. 0.d. tubing. Water at 20°C is fed into this tank at a rate of 20 lb/min, starting with no water in the tank at time t = 0. Steam at 105OC flows through the Steam in Instantaneous liquid level \\ Liquid inlet It4\"\" Fig. 15.5-1. Heating of a liquid in a tank with a Condensate out variable liquid level. This problem is taken in modified form from W. R. Marshall, Jr., and R. L. Pigford, Applications of Differential Equations to Chemical Engineering Problems, University of Delaware Press, Newark, Del.

What is the temper- ature of the water when the tank is filled? We shall make the following assumptions: a. The steam temperature is uniform throughout the coil. b. The density and heat capacity do not change very much with temperature. * h c. The fluid is approximately incompressible so that C, = C,. d. The agitator maintains uniform temperature throughout the liquid. e. The heat transfer coefficient is independent of position and time. f. The walls of the tank are perfectly insulated so that no heat loss occurs. We select the fluid within the tank as the system to be considered, and we make a time- dependent energy balance over this system. Such a balance is provided by Eq. (E) of Table 15.5-1. On the left side of the equation the time rates of change of kinetic and potential ener- gies can be neglected relative to that of the internal energy. On the right side we can normally omit the work term, and the kinetic and potential energy terms can be discarded, since they will be small compared with the other terms. Inasmuch as there is no outlet stream, we can set w2 equal to zero. Hence for this system the total energy balance simplifies to This states that the internal energy of the system increases because of the enthalpy added by the incoming fluid, and because of the addition of heat through the steam coil. Since U,,, and H, cannot bengiven absolutely, ye now select th? inlet temperature TI as the thermal datum plane. Then H1 = 0 and U,,, = pCVV(T - TI) = pCpV(T - TI), where T and V are the instantaneous temperature and volume of the liquid. Furthermore, the rate of heat addition to the liquid Q is given by Q = Ud(Ts - T), in which T, is the steam temperature, and A is the instantaneous heat transfer area. Hence Eq. 15.5-1 becomes The expressions for V(t) and A(t) are in which V, and A. are the volume and ergy balance equation becomes heat transfer area when the tank is full. Hence the en- which is to be solved with the initial condition that T = TI at t = 0. The equation is more easily solved in dimensionless form. We divide both sides by W,?,(T~ - TI) to get This equation suggests that suitable definitions of dimensionless temperature and time are @= - Udot and T = - P?,YO 468 Chapter 15 Macroscopic Balances for Nonisothermal Systems EXAMPLE 15.5-2 Operation of a Simple Temperature Controller Fig. 15.5-2.

Pigford, Application of Differen- tial Equations to Chemical Engineering, Uni- versity of Delaware Press, Newark, Del. (1947), p. 18.1 Then the equation in Eq. 15.5-5 becomes after some rearranging and the initial condition requires that O = 0 at 7 = 0. This is a first-order linear differential equation whose solution is (see Eq. C.l-2) The constant of integration, C, can be obtained from the initial condition after first multiply- ing Eq. 15.5-9 by r. In that way it is found that C = 1, so that the final solution is This function is shown in Fig. 15.5-2. Finally, the temperature To of the liquid in the tank, whe? it has been filled, is given by Eq. 15.5-10 when t = pV,/wl (from Eq. 15.5-3) or T = U&/w,C, (from Eq. 15.5-7). Therefore, in terms of the original variables, Thus it can be seen tpat the final liquid temperature is determined entirely by the dimension- less group U&/wlCr which, for this problem, has the value of 2.74. Knowing this we can find from Eq. 15.5-11 that (To - Tl)/(T, - T,) = 0.659, whence To = 76°C. A well-insulated agitated tank is shown in Fig. 15.5-3. Liquid enters at a temperature T,(t), which may vary with time. It is desired to control the temperature, T,(t), of the fluid leaving the tank. It is presumed that the stirring is sufficiently thorough that the temperature in the tank is uniform and equal to the exit temperature. The volume of the liquid in the tank, V, and the mass rate of liquid flow, w, are both constant. To accomplish the desired control, a metallic electric heating coil of surface area A is placed in the tank, and a temperature-sensing element is placed in the exit steam to measure TJt). These devices are connected to a temperature controller that supplies energy to the heating coil at a rate Q, = b(T,,, - TJ, in which T,,, is the maximum temperature for which the controller is designed to operate, and b is a known parameter. It may be assumed that the s15.5 Use of the Macroscopic Balances to Solve Unsteady-State Problems 469 SOLUTION Power supply Temperature / indicator Temperature controller Electric heater Liquid - inlet \\ Liquid outlet - -- TI = TI, (for t > 0) Fig. 15.5-3. An agitated tank with a temperature controller. liquid temperature T,(t) is always less than T,,, in normal operation. The heating coil sup- plies energy to the liquid in the tank at a rate Q = UA(T, - T2), where U is the overall heat transfer coefficient between the coil and the liquid, and T, is the instantaneous coil tempera- ture, considered to be uniform. Up to time t = 0, the system has been operating at steady state with liquid inlet tempera- ture TI = TI, and exit temperature T, = T,,. At time t = 0, the inlet stream temperature is sud- denly increased to TI = T,, and held there. As a consequence of this disturbance, the tank temperature will begin to rise, and the temperature indicator in the outlet stream will signal the controller to decrease the power supplied to the heating coil. Ultimately, the liquid tem- perature in the tank will attain a new steady-state value Tz,. It is desired to describe the be- havior of the liquid temperature T2(f). A qualitative sketch showing the various temperatures is given in Fig. 15.5-4. We first write the unsteady-state macroscopic energy balances [Eq. (E) of Table 15.5-11 for the liquid in the tank and for the heating coil: (liquid) (coil) Note that in applying the macroscopic energy balance to the liquid, we have neglected kinetic and potential energy changes as well as the power input to the agitator. 4 Underdamped Overdamped I 1 bitlet I temperature I T2(t) I TI I I L Fig. 15.5-4.

When the time derivatives in Eqs. 15.5-12 and 13 are set equal to zero and the equations added, we get for t < 0, where TI = TI,: Then from Eq. 15.5-13 we can get the initial temperature of the coil (b) Steady-state behavior for t + m. When similar operations are performed with TI = TI,, we get and for the final temperature of the coil. (c) Unsteady state behavior for t > 0. It is convenient to define dimensionless variables using the steady-state quantities for t < 0 and t + m: T2 - T2m O2 = = dimensionless liquid temperature (15.5-18) T20 - T20: T' - T,, 0, = = dimensionless coil temperature Tc, - Tc, UAt r = ,-- = dimensionless time PC,~ In addition we define three dimensionless parameters: A R = pC,V/p,Cp,Vc = ratio of thermal capacities (15.5-21) F = W~/UA = flow-rate parameter (15.5-22) b/ UA = controller parameter (15.5-23) In terms of these quantities, the unsteady-state balances in Eqs. 15.5-12 and 13 become (after considerable manipulation): elimination of 0, between this pair of equations gives a single second-order linear ordinary differential equation for the exit liquid temperature as a function of time: This equation has the same form as that obtained for the damped manometer in Eq. 7.7-21 (see also Eq. C.1-7). The general solution is then of the form of Eq. 7.7-23 or 24: 0, = C+ exp (m+r) + C exp (m-r) (m+ + m-) (15.5-27) 0, = C, exp rnr + C2r exp rn~ (m, = m- = m) (15.5-28) g15.5 Use of the Macroscopic Balances to Solve Unsteady-State Problems 471 EXAMPLE 15.5-3 Flow of Compressible Fluids Through Head Meters where m, = $[-(I + R + F) * d(1 + R + F)~ - 4R(B + F)] (15.5-29) Thus by analogy with Example 7.7-2, the fluid exit temperature may approach its final value as a monotone increasing function (overdamped or critically damped) or with oscillations (underdamped). The system parameters appear in the dimensionless time variable, as well as in the parameters B, F, and R. Therefore, numerical calculations are needed to determine whether in a particular system the temperature will oscillate or not. Extend the development of Example 7.6-5 to the steady flow of compressible fluids through orifice meters and Venturi tubes. SOLUTION We begin, as in Example 7.6-5, by writing the steady-state mass and mechanical energy bal- ances between reference planes 1 and 2 of the two flow meters shown in Fig. 15.5-5. For com- pressible fluids, these may be expressed as in which the quantities ai = (v~)~/(v~) are included to allow for the replacement of the average of the cube by the cube of the average. . .

Measurement of mass flow rate by use of (a) an orifice meter, and (b) a Venturi tube. 472 Chapter 15 Macroscopic Balances for Nonisothermal Systems We next eliminate (v,) and (v,) from the above two equations to get an expression for the mass flow rate: We now repeat the assumptions of Example 7.6-5: (i) e, = 0, (ii) a, = 1, and (iii) cr2 = (so/s2)'. Then Eq. 15.5-32 becomes The empirical \"discharge coefficient,\" Cd, is included in this equation to permit correction of this expression for errors introduced by the three assumptions and must be determined ex- perimentally. For Venturi meters, it is convenient to put plane 2 at the point of minimum cross section of the meter so that S2 = So. Then a, is very nearly unity, and it has been found experimentally that Cd is almost the same for compressible and incompressible fluids-that is, about 0.98 for well designed Venturi meters. For orifice meters, the degree of contraction of a compressible fluid stream at plane 2 is somewhat less than for incompressible fluids, especially at high flow rates, and a different discharge coefficient2 is required. In order to use Eq. 15.5-33, the fluid density must be known as a function of pressure. That is, one must know both the path of the expansion and the equation of state of the fluid. In most cases the assumption of frictionless adiabatic behavior appears to be acceptable. For ideal gases, one may write ppP = constant, where y = CJCV (see Eq. 15.2-5). Then Eq. 15.5- 33 becomes This formula expresses the mass flow rate as a function of measurable quantities and the dis- charge coefficient. Values of the latter may be found in engineering handbook^.^ A compressible gas, initially at T = To, p = p,,, and p = po, is discharged from a large station- ary insulated tank through a small convergent nozzle, as shown in Fig. 15.5-6. Show how the Free Batch fractional remaining mass of fluid in the tank, p/p,, may be determined as a function of time. of a Compressible Fluid Develop working equations, assuming that the gas is ideal. SOLUTION For convenience, we divide the tank into two parts, separated by the surface 1 as shown in the figure. We assume that surface 1 is near enough to the tank exit that essentially all of the fluid mass is to left of it, but far enough from the exit that the fluid velocity through the sur- face 1 is negligible. We further assume that the average fluid properties to the left of 1 are identical with those at surface 1. We now consider the behavior of these two parts of the sys- tem separately. (a) The bulk of the fluid in the tank. For the region to the left of surface 1, the unsteady state mass balance in Eq. (A) of Table 15.5-1 is R. H. Perry, D. W. Green, and J. 0.

Ambient pressure = p, 1 For the same region, the energy balance of Eq. (E) of Table 15.5-1 becomes in which V is the total volume in the system being considered, and w1 is the mass rate of flow of gas leaving the system. In writing this equation, we have neglected the kinetic energy of the fluid. Substituting the mass balance into both sides of the energy equation gives ,. For a stationary system under the influence of no external forces other than gravity, d@,/dt = 0, so that Eq. 15.5-37 becomes This equation may be combined with the thermal and caloric equations of state for the fluid in order to obtain pl(pl) and T,(p,). We find, thus, that the condition of the fluid in the tank de- pends only on the degree to which the tank has been emptied and not on tte rate of dis- charge. For the special case of an ideal gas with constant Cv, for which dU = CdT and p = pRT/M, we may integrate Eq. 15.5-38 to obtain in which y = CJC,. This result also follows from Eq. 11.4-57. (b) Discharge of the gas through the nozzle. For the sake of simplicity we assume here that the flow between surfaces 1 and 2 is both frictionless and adiabatic. Also, since w, is not far different from w2, it is also appropriate to consider at any one instant that the flow is quasi- steady-state. Then we can use the macroscopic mechanical energy balance in the form of Eq. 15.2-2 with the second, fourth, and fifth terms omitted. That is, Since we are dealing with an ideal gas, we may use the result in Eq. 15.5-34 to get the instan- taneous discharge rate. Since in this problem the ratio S2/S1 is very small and its square is even smaller, we can replace the denominator under the square root sign in Eq. 15.5-34 by unity. Then the p2 outside the square root sign is moved inside and use is made of Eq. 15.5-39. This gives in which S2 is the cross-sectional area of the nozzle opening. 474 Chapter 15 Macroscopic Balances for Nonisothermal Systems PROBLEMS 1s~~. Now we use Eq. 15.5-39 to eliminate p, from Eq. 15.5-41. Then we have a first-order dif- ferential equation for p,, which may be integrated to give From this equation we can obtain the time required to discharge any given fraction of the original gas. At low flow rates the pressure p2 at the nozzle opening is equal to the ambient pressure. However, examination of Eq. 15.5-41 shows that, as the ambient pressure is reduced, the cal- culated mass rate of flow reaches a maximum at a critical pressure ratio For air (y = 1.4), this critical pressure ratio is 0.53. If the ambient pressure is further reduced, the pressure just inside the nozzle will remain at the value of p2 calculated from Eq. 15.5-43, and the mass rate of flow will become independent of ambient pressure p,. Under these con- ditions, the discharge rate is Then, for pJp, < r, we may write Eq. 15.5-42 more simply: If p,/pl is initially less than r, both Eqs. 15.5-46 and 42 will be useful for calculating the total discharge time.

Flow of a compressible fluid through a convergent-divergent nozzle (Fig. 15B.6). In many applications, such as steam turbines or rockets, hot compressed gases are expanded through nozzles of the kind shown in the accompanying figure in order to convert the gas enthalpy into kinetic energy. This operation is in many ways similar to the flow of gases through ori- fices. Here, however, the purpose of the expansion is to produce power-for example, by the impingement of the fast-moving fluid on a turbine blade, or by direct thrust, as in a rocket engine. To explain the behavior of such a system and to justlfy the general shape of the nozzle described, follow the path of expansion of an ideal gas. Assume that the gas is initially in a very large reservoir at essentially zero velocity and that it expands through an adiabatic fric- tionless nozzle to zero pressure.

It is desired to withdraw 5 Ib,,/s from a large storage tank through an equivalent length of 55 ft of new steel pipe 2.067 in. in diameter. The air undergoes a sudden contraction on entering the pipe, and the accompanying contraction loss is not in- cluded in the equivalent length of the pipe. Can the desired flow rate be obtained if the air in the tank is at 150 psig and 70°F and the pressure at the downstream end of the pipe is 50 psig? The effect of the sudden contraction may be estimated with reasonable accuracy by con- sidering the entrance to consist of an ideal nozzle converging to a cross section equal to that of the pipe, followed by a section of pipe with e, = 0.5 (see Table 7.5-1). The behavior of the nozzle can be determined from Eq. 15.5-34 by assuming the cross sectional area S, to be infi- nite and Cd to be unity. Answer: Yes. The calculated discharge rate is about 6 1bJs if isothermal flow is assumed (see Problem 15B.3) and about 6.3 lb,/s for adiabatic flow. The actual rate should be between these limits for an ambient temperature of 70°F. Stagnation temperature (Fig. 15C.3). A \"total temperature probe,\" as shown in the figure, is inserted in a steady stream of an ideal gas at a temperature T, and moving with a velocity v,. Part of the moving gas enters the open end of the probe and is decelerated to nearly zero veloc- ity before slowly leaking out of the bleed holes. This deceleration results in a temperature rise, which is measured by the thermocouple. Since the deceleration is rapid, it is nearly adiabatic. (a) Develop an expression for the temperature registered by the thermocouple in terms of T, and v, by using the steady-state macroscopic energy balance, Eq. 15.1-3. Use as your system a representative stream of fluid entering the probe.

(Hint: Some suggestions on solving this problem may be obtained by studying the derivation of the macroscopic mechanical energy balance in 97.8.) Operation of a heat-exchange device (Fig. 15D.3). A hot fluid enters the circular tube of ra- dius R, at position z = 0 and moves in the positive z direction to z = L, where it leaves the tube and flows back along the outside of that tube in the annular space. Heat is exchanged be- tween the fluid in the tube and that in the annulus. AIso heat is lost from the annulus to the air outside, which is at the ambient air temperature T, (a constant). Assume that the density and heat capacity are constant. Use the following notation: Ul = overall heat transfer coefficient between the fluid in the tube and the fluid in the annular space LI, = overall heat transfer coefficient between the fluid in the annulus and the air at temperature T, Tl(z) = temperature of the fluid in the tube T2(z) = temperature of the fluid in the annular space w = mass flow rate through the system (a constant) If the fluid enters at the inlet temperature Ti, what will be the outlet temperature T,?

Equation 15.5-38 in Example 15.5-4 was obtained by setting d@/dt equal to zero, a procedure justified only because the tank was said to be stationary. It is nevertheless true that Eq. 15.5-38 is correct for moving tanks as well. This statement can be proved as follows: (a) Consider a tank such as that pictured in Fig. 15.5-6, but moving at a velocity v that is much larger than the relative velocity of fluid and tank in the region to the left of surface 1.

Below Eq. 15.2-5 we have emphasized that the mechanical energy balance and the total energy balance contain different information, since the first is a consequence of conservation of momentum, whereas the second is a consequence of conser- vation of energy. For the steady-state flow of a compressible fluid with zero transport properties, both bal- ances lead to the classical Bernoulli equation. The derivation based on the equation of motion was given in Example 3.5-1.

We now end Part I1 with a brief discussion of radiative energy trans- port, which cannot be described by Fourier's law. In Chapters 9 to 15 the transport of energy by conduction and by convection has been discussed. Both modes of transport rely on the presence of a material medium. For heat conduction to occur, there must be temperature inequalities between neighboring points. For heat convection to occur, there must be a fluid that is free to move and trans- port energy with it. In this chapter, we turn our attention to a third mechanism for en- ergy transport-namely, radiation. Radiation is basically an electromagnetic mechanism, which allows energy to be transported with the speed of light through regions of space that are devoid of matter. The rate of energy transport between two \"black bodies in a vacuum is proportional to the difference of the fourth powers of their absolute tempera- tures. This mechanism is qualitatively very different from the three transport mecha- nisms considered elsewhere in this book: momentum transport in Newtonian fluids, proportional to the velocity gradient; energy transport by heat conduction, proportional to a temperature gradient; and mass transport by diffusion, proportional to a concentra- tion gradient. Because of the uniqueness of radiation as a means of transport and be- cause of the importance of radiant heat transfer in industrial calculations, we have devoted a separate chapter to this subject. A thorough understanding of the physics of radiative transport requires the use of several different discipline^:',^ electromagnetic theory is needed to describe the essen- tially wavelike nature of radiation, in particular the energy and pressure associated with electromagnetic waves; thermodynamics is useful for obtaining some relations among M.

All we can do in this elementary discussion is define the key quantities and set forth the results of theory and experiment. We then show how some of these results can be used to compute the rate of heat transfer by radiant processes in simple systems. In $16.1 and $16.2 we introduce the basic concepts and definitions. Then in s16.3 some of the principal physical results concerning black-body radiation are given. In the following section, $16.4, the rate of heat exchange between two black bodies is discussed. This section introduces no new physical principles, the basic problems being those of geometry. Next, 516.5 is devoted to an extension of the preceding section to nonblack surfaces. Finally, in the last section, there is a brief discussion of radiation processes in absorbing media.3 516.1 THE SPECTRUM OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION When a solid body is heated-for example, by an electric coil-the surface of the solid emits radiation of wavelength primarily in the range 0.1 to 10 microns. Such radiation is usually referred to as thermal radiation. A quantitative description of the atomic and mol- ecular mechanisms by which the radiation is produced is given by quantum mechanics and is outside the scope of this discussion. A qualitative description, however, is possi- ble: When energy is supplied to a solid body, some of the constituent molecules and atoms are raised to \"excited states.\" There is a tendency for the atoms or molecules to re- turn spontaneously to lower energy states. When this occurs, energy is emitted in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Because the emitted radiation results from changes in the electronic, vibrational, and rotational states of the atoms and molecules, the radiation will be distributed over a range of wavelengths. Actually, thermal radiation represents only a small part of the total spectrum of elec- tromagnetic radiation. Figure 16.1-1 shows roughly the kinds of mechanisms that are re- sponsible for the various parts of the radiation spectrum. The various kinds of radiation are distinguished from one another only by the range of wavelengths they include. In a vacuum, all these forms of radiant energy travel with the speed of light c. The wave- length A, characterizing an electromagnetic wave, is then related to its frequency v by the equation in which c = 2.998 x lo8 m/s. In the visible part of the spectrum, the various wave- lengths are associated with the \"color\" of the light. For some purposes, it is convenient to think of electromagnetic radiation from a cor- puscular point of view. Then we associate with an electromagnetic wave of frequency v a photon, which is a particle with charge zero and mass zero with an energy given by For additional information on radiative heat transfer and engineering applications, see the comprehensive textbook by R. Siege1 and J. R. Howell, Thermal Radiation Heat Transfer, 3rd edition, Hemisphere Publishing Co., New York (1992). See also J. R. Howell and M. P. Mengoq, in Handbook of Heat Transfer, 3rd edition, (W. M. Rohsenow, J. P. Hartnett, and Y. I.

The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, showing roughly the mechanisms by which various wavelengths of radiation are produced (1 A = Angstrom unit = lo-' cm = 0.1 nm; 1 p = 1 mi- cron = l~-~ m). Here h = 6.626 X J,s is Planck's constant. From these two equations and the infor- mation from Fig. 16.1-1, we see that decreasing the wavelength of electromagnetic radia- tion corresponds to increasing the energy of the corresponding photons. This fact ties in with the various mechanisms that produce the radiation. For example, relatively small energies are released when a molecule decreases its speed of rotation, and the associated radiation is in the infrared. On the other hand, relatively large energies are released when an atomic nucleus goes from a high energy state to a lower one, and the associated radiation is either gamma- or x-radiation. The foregoing statements also make it seem reasonable that the radiant energy emitted from heated objects will tend toward shorter wavelengths (higher energy photons) as the temperature of the body is raised. Thus far we have sketched the phenomenon of the emission of radiant energy or pho- tons when a molecular or atomic system goes from a high to a low energy state. The re- verse process, known as absorption, occurs when the addition of radiant energy to a molecular or atomic system causes the system to go from a low to a high energy state. The latter process is then what occurs when radiant energy impinges on a solid surface and causes its temperature to rise. 490 Chapter 16 Energy Transport by Radiation 516.2 ABSORPTION AND EMISSION AT SOLID SURFACES Having introduced the concepts of absorption and emission in terms of the atomic pic- ture, we now proceed to the discussion of the same processes from a macroscopic view- point. We restrict the discussion here to opaque solids. Radiation impinging on the surface of an opaque solid is either absorbed or re- flected. The fraction of the incident radiation that is absorbed is called the absorptivity and is given the symbol a. Also the fraction of the incident radiation with frequency v that is absorbed is designated by a,. That is, a and a, are defined as in which qt'dv and q!'dv are the absorbed and incident radiation per unit area per unit time in the frequency range v to v + dv. For any real body, a, will be less than unity and will vary considerably with the frequency. A hypothetical body for which a, is a con- stant, less than unity, over the entire frequency range and at all temperatures is called a gray body. That is, a gray body always absorbs the same fraction of the incident radiation of all frequencies. A limiting case of the gray body is that for which a, = 1 for all frequen- cies and all temperatures. This limiting behavior defines a black body. All solid surfaces emit radiant energy. The total radiant energy emitted per unit area per unit time is designated by q'\", and that emitted in the frequency range u to u + dv is called qf'dv. The corresponding rates of energy emission from a black body are given the symbols qjf) and qlP,'du. In terms of these quantities, the emissivity for the total radiant-en- ergy emission as well as that for a given frequency are defined as The emissivity is also a quantity less than unity for real, nonfluorescing surfaces and is equal to unity for black bodies. At any given temperature the radiant energy emitted by a black body represents an upper limit to the radiant energy emitted by real, nonfluo- rescing surfaces. We now consider the radiation within an evacuated enclosure or \"cavity\" with isothermal walls. We imagine that the entire system is at equilibrium. Under this condi- tion, there is no net flux of energy across the interfaces between the solid and the cavity. We now show that the radiation in such a cavity is independent of the nature of the walls and dependent solely on the temperature of the walls of the cavity. We connect two cavities, the walls of which are at the same temperature, but are made of two differ- ent materials, as shown in Fig. 16.2-1. If the radiation intensities in the two cavities were different, there would be a net transport of radiant energy from one cavity to the other. Because such a flux would violate the second law of thermodynamics, the radiation in- tensities in the two cavities must be equal, regardless of the compositions of the cavity surfaces. Furthermore, it can be shown that the radiation is uniform and unpolarized throughout the cavity. This cavity radiation plays an important role in the development Material 1 Material 2 Fig. 16.2-1.

We designate the intensity of the radiation as q\"\"\"). This is the radiant energy that would impinge on a solid surface of unit area placed anywhere within the cavity. We now perform two additional thought experiments. In the first, we put into a cav- ity a small black body at the same temperature as the walls of the cavity. There will be no net interchange of energy between the black body and the cavity walls. Hence the en- ergy impinging on the black-body surface must equal the energy emitted by the black body: From this result, we draw the important conclusion that the radiation emitted by a black body is the same as the equilibrium radiation intensity within a cavity at the same tem- perature. In the second thought experiment, we put a small nonblack body into the cavity, once again specifying that its temperature be the same as that of the cavity walls. There is no net heat exchange between the nonblack body and the cavity walls. Hence we can state that the energy absorbed by the nonblack body will be the same as that radiating from it: Comparison of Eqs. 16.2-5 and 6 leads to the result The definition of the emissivity e in Eq. 16.2-3 allows us to conclude that PI (16.2-8) This is Kirchhoff's law,' which states that at a given temperature the emissivity and ab- sorptivity of any solid surface are the same when the radiation is in equilibrium with the solid surface. It can be shown that Eq. 16.2-8 is also valid for each wavelength separately: (16.2-9) Values of the total emissivity e for some solids are given in Table 16.2-1. Actually, e de- pends also on the frequency and on the angle of emission, but the averaged values given there have found widespread use. The tabulated values are, with a few exceptions, for emission normal to the surface, but they may be used for hemispheric emissivity, partic- ularly for rough surfaces. Unoxidized, clean, metallic surfaces have very low emissivi- ties, whereas most nonmetals and metallic oxides have emissivities above 0.8 at room temperature or higher. Note that emissivity increases with increasing temperature for nearly all materials. We have indicated that the radiant energy emitted by a black body is an upper limit to the radiant energy emitted by real surfaces and that this energy is a function of the temperature. It has been shown experimentally that the total emitted energy flux from a black surface is - - - G. Kirchhoff, Monatsbeu. d. preuss. Akad. d.

Slovenian-born Josef Stefan (1835-1893), rector of the University of Vienna (1876-1877), in addition to being known for the law of radiation that bears his name, also contributed to the theory of multicomponent diffusion and to the problem of heat conduction with phase change. Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann (1844-1906), who held professorships in Vienna, Graz, Munich, and Leipzig, developed the basic differential equation for gas kinetic theory (see Appendix D) and the fundamental entropy-probability relation, S = K In W, which is engraved on his tombstone in Vienna; K is called the Boltzmann constant. 316.3 Planck's Distribution Law, Wien's Displacement Law, and the Stefan-Boltzmann Law 493 in which e must be evaluated at temperature T. The use of Eqs. 16.2-10 and 11 to calcu- late radiant heat transfer rates between heated surfaces is discussed in g516.4 and 5. We have mentioned that the Stefan-Boltzmann constant has been experimentally determined. This implies that we have a true black body at our disposal. Solids with perfectly black surfaces do not exist. However, we can get an excellent approximation to a black surface by piercing a very small hole in the wall of an isothermal cavity. The hole itself is then very nearly a black surface. The extent to which this is a good ap- proximation may be seen from the following relation, which gives the effective emis- sivity of the hole, eh,,,, in a rough-walled enclosure in terms of the actual emissivity e of the cavity walls and the fraction f of the total internal cavity area that is cut away by the hole: If e = 0.8 and f = 0.001, then e,,,, = 0.99975. Therefore, 99.975% of the radiation that falls on the hole will be absorbed. The radiation that emerges from the hole will then be very nearly black-body radiation. 516.3 PLANCK'S DISTRIBUTION LAW, WIEN'S DISPLACEMENT LAW, AND THE STEFAN-BOLTZMANN LAW1r2r3 The Stefan-Boltzmann law may be deduced from thermodynamics, provided that cer- tain results of the theory of electromagnetic fields are known. Specifically, it can be shown that for cavity radiation the energy density (that is, the energy per unit volume) within the cavity is Since the radiant energy emitted by a black body depends on temperature alone, the energy density u\"' must also be a function of temperature only. It can further be shown that the electromagnetic radiation exerts a pressure p(') on the walls of the cav- ity given by (r) - Z (7) P -3u (16.3-2) The preceding results for cavity radiation can also be obtained by considering the cavity to be filled with a gas made up of photons, each endowed with an energy hv and mo- mentum hv/c. We now apply the thermodynamic formula to the photon gas or radiation in the cavity. Insertion of U'\" = Vu'\" and p'\" = $u\"' into this relation gives the following ordinary differential equation for u(')(T): ' J. de Boer, Chapter VII in Leerboek der Nafuurkunde, 3rd edition, (R.

Phys., 4,553-563,564-566 (1901). 494 Chapter 16 Energy Transport by Radiation This equation can be integrated to give in which b is a constant of integration. Combination of this result with Eq. 16.3-1 gives the radiant energy emitted from the surface of a black body per unit area per unit time: This is the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Note that the thermodynamic development does not predict the numerical value of a. The second way of deducing the Stefan-Boltzmann law is by integrating the Planck distribution law. This famous equation gives the radiated energy flux qg from a black sur- face in the wavelength range A to A + dA: Here h is Planck's constant. The result can be derived by applying quantum statistics to a photon gas in a cavity, the photons obeying Bose-Einstein statistic^.^,' The Planck distri- bution, which is shown in Fig. 16.3-1, correctly predicts the entire energy versus wave- length curve and the shift of the maximum toward shorter wavelengths at higher temperatures. When Eq. 16.3-7 is integrated over all wavelengths, we get In the above integration we changed the variable of integration from A to x = ch/h~T. Then the integration over x was performed by expanding l/(ex - 1) in a Taylor series in 8 (see 5C.2) and integrating term by term. The quantum statistical approach thus gives the details of the spectral distribution of the radiation and also the expression for the Ste- fan-Boltzmann constant, - having the value 1.355 X lo-'' cal/s cm2 . K, which is confirmed within experimental uncertainty by direct radiation measurements. Equation 16.3-9 is an amazing formula, interrelating as it does the a from radiation, the K from statistical mechanics, the speed of light c from electromagnetism, and the h from quantum mechanics. In addition to obtaining the Stefan-Boltzmann law from the Planck distribution, we can get an important relation pertaining to the maximum in the Planck distribution. First - J. E. Mayer and M. G.

Hence at a given temperature T Inserting the values of the universal constants and the value for x,,,, we then get This result, originally found experimentally,6 is known as Wien's displacement law. It is useful primarily for estimating the temperature of remote objects. The law predicts, in agreement with experience, that the apparent color of radiation shifts from red (long wavelengths) toward blue (short wavelengths) as the temperature increases. Finally, we may reinterpret some of our previous remarks in terms of the Planck dis- tribution law. In Fig. 16.3-2 we have sketched three curves: the Planck distribution law for a hypothetical black body, the distribution curve for a hypothetical gray body, and a distribution curve for some real body. It is thus clear that when we use the total ernissiv- ity values, such as those in Table 16.2-1, we are just accounting empirically for the devia- tions from Planck's law over the entire spectrum. We should not leave the subject of the Planck distribution without pointing out that Eq. 16.3-7 was presented at the October 1900 meeting of the German Physical Society as W.

Planck himself had misgivings, as clearly stated in his textbook.' In a letter in 1931, he wrote: \". . . what I did can be described as an act of desperation. . . . I had been wrestling unsuccessfully for six years. . . with the problem of equilibrium between radiation and matter, and I knew that the problem was of fundamental importance. . .\" Then Planck went on to say that he was \"ready to sacrifice every one of my previous convictions about physical laws\" ex- cept for the first and second laws of thermodynamic^.'^ Planck's radical proposal ush- ered in a new and exciting era of physics, and quantum mechanics penetrated into chemistry and other fields in the twentieth century.

In this section we discuss the radiant-energy transfer between two black bodies of arbitrary geometry and orienta- tion. Hence we need to know how the radiant energy emanating from a black body is distributed with respect to angle. Because black-body radiation is isotropic, the follow- ing relation, known as Lambert's cosine law,' can be deduced: in which qg is the energy emitted per unit area per unit time per unit solid angle in a di- rection 8 (see Fig. 16.4-1). The energy emitted through the shaded solid angle is then qt sin 8 de d+ per unit area of black solid surface. Integration of the foregoing expression for qfj over the entire hemisphere gives the known total energy emission: LZT r qf$ sin e ae a+ = , uT4 /021 lo*/' cos B sin e ae d+ This justifies the inclusion of the factor of I/T in Eq. 16.4-1. We are now in a position to get the net heat transfer rate from body 1 to body 2, where these are black bodies of any shape and orientation (see Fig. 16.4-2). We do this by getting the net heat transfer rate between a pair of surface elements dA, and dA, that can \"see\" each other, and then integrating over all such possible pairs of areas. The elements dAl and dA2 are joined by a straight line of length r,,, which makes an angle 8, with the normal to dA, and an angle 82 with the normal to dA,. We start by writing an expression for the energy radiated from dA, into a solid angle sin O1 dB1 d+, about r,,. We choose this solid angle large enough that dA2 will lie entirely within the \"beam\" (see Fig. 16.4-2). According to Lambert's cosine law, the energy radi- ated per unit time will be (9 cos B,)dA, sin el do, d+, ' H.

The net rate of energy transport from dA, to dA2 is then Therefore, the net rate of energy transfer from an isothermal black body 1 to another isothermal black body 2 is Here it is understood that the integration is restricted to those pairs of areas dA, and dA2 that are in full view of each other.

In the above development, we have assumed that Lambert's law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law may be used to describe the nonequilibrium transport process, in spite of the fact that they are strictly valid only for radiative equilibrium. The errors thus introduced do not seem to have been studied thoroughly, but apparently the resulting formulas give a good quantitative description. H. C. Hottel and A. F.

The net heat flow from any surface i to the enclosure surfaces is n Q,, = UA,~ F,,(Tf - T$) i = 1,2,. . . ,n (16.4-12) ]=I In writing the second form, we have used the relations The sums in Eqs. 16.4-13 and 14 include the term F,,, which is zero for any object that in- tercepts none of its own rays. The set of n equations given in Eq. 16.4-12 (or Eq. 16.4-13) may be solved to get the temperatures or heat flows according to the data available. A simultaneous solution of Eqs. 16.4-13 and 14 of special interest is that for which Q& -Q 4=...= 7 - Q, = 0. Surfaces such as 3,4, . . . , n are here called \"adiabatic.\" In this situation one can eliminate the temperatures of all surfaces except 1 and 2 from the heat flow calculation and obtain an exact solution for the net heat flow from surface 1 to sur- face 2: Values of F,, for use in this equation are given in Fig. 16.4-4. These values apply only when the adiabatic walls are formed from line elements perpendicular to surfaces 1 and 2. The use of these view factors F and T greatly simplifies the calculations for black- body radiation, when the temperatures of surfaces 1 and 2 are known to be uniform.

The treatment of r:, as a constant in the integrand is permissible here because the distance r12 varies by less than 0.5% over the visible surface of the sun.

For nearly black surfaces this is feasible, as only one or two reflections need be considered. For highly reflecting sur- faces, however, the analysis is complicated, and the distributions of emitted and re- flected rays with respect to angle and wavelength are not usually known with enough accuracy to justify a detailed calculation. A reasonably accurate treatment is possible for a small convex surface in a large, nearly isothermal enclosure (i.e., a \"cavity\"), such as a steam pipe in a room with walls at constant temperature. The rate of energy emission from a nonblack surface 1 to the surrounding enclosure 2 is given by and the rate of energy absorption from the surroundings by surface 1 is Here we have made use of the fact that the radiation impinging on surface 1 is very nearly cavity radiation or black-body radiation corresponding to temperature T,. Since A, is convex, it intercepts none of its own rays; hence F,, has been set equal to unity. The net radiation rate from A, to the surroundings is therefore 1 S usu- In Eq. 16.5-3, e, is the value of the emissivity of surface 1 at TI.

Next we consider an enclosure formed by n gray, opaque, diffuse-reflecting surfaces A,, A,, A3,. . . , A,, at temperatures TI, T,, T,, . . . , T,. Following oppenheiml we define the radiosity Ji for each surface A, as the sum of the fluxes of reflected and emitted radiant energy from Ai. Then the net radiant flow from Ai to A, is expressed as that is, by Eq. 16.4-9 with substitution of radiosities J, in place of the black-body emissive powers ac. The definition of Ji gives, for an opaque surface, in which li is the incident radiant flux on A,. Elimination of li in favor of the net radiant flux Qi,/Ai from Ai into the enclosure gives whence Finally, a steady-state energy balance on each surface gives Here Q, is the rate of heat addition to surface A, by nonradiative means.

For example, the system in Fig. 16.5-1 gives the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 16.5-2 so that the net radiant heat transfer rate is The shortcut solution summarized in Eq. 16.4-15 has been similarly generalized to non-black-walled enclosures giving in place of Eq. 16.5-8, for an enclosure with Qi = 0 for i = 2, 3,. . . , n. The result is like that in Eq. 16.5-9, except that F1, must be used instead of F1, to include indirect paths from A, to A,, thus giving a larger heat transfer rate.

Substitution of numerical values into Eq. 16.5-12 then gives for 1 ft of pipe: By adding the convection heat loss from Example 14.5-1, we obtain the total heat loss: Note that in this situation radiation accounts for more than half of the heat loss. If the fluid were not transparent, the convection and radiation processes would not be independent, and the convective and radiative contributions could not be added directly.

All heat received by the water is by free convection from the surrounding air, which is assumed to be quiescent. b. The heat effect of evaporation or condensation of water is not significant. c. Steady state has been achieved. d. The pan of water is square in cross section. e. Back radiation from the atmosphere is neglected. The maximum permitted air temperature at the water surface is T, = 492\"R. The rate of heat loss by radiation is in which L is the length of one edge of the pan. To get the heat gain by convection, we use the relation in which h is the heat transfer coefficient for free convection. For cooling atmospheric air by a horizontal square facing upward, the heat transfer coefficient is given by2 in which h is expressed in Btu/hr. ft2. F and the temperature is given in degrees Rankine. When the foregoing expressions for heat loss by radiation and heat gain by free convec- tion are equated, we get 95L2 = 0.2L2(Tair - 492)5/4 (16.5-22) From this we find that the maximum ambient air temperature is 630°R or 170°F. Except under desert conditions, back radiation and moisture condensation from the surrounding air greatly lower the required air temperature. W. H. McAdams, in Chemical Engineers' Handbook (J. H.

To describe energy transport in nontrans- parent media, we write differential equations for the local rate of change of energy as viewed from both the material and radiation standpoint. That is, we regard a material medium traversed by electromagnetic radiation as two coexisting \"phases\": a \"material phase,\" consisting of all the mass in the system, and a \"photon phase,\" consisting of the electromagnetic radiation. In Chapter 11 we have already given an energy balance equation for a system con- taining no radiation. Here we extend Eq. 11.2-1 for the material phase to take into ac- count the energy that is being interchanged with the photon phase by emission and absorption processes: Here we have introduced % and d, which are the local rates of photon emission and ab- sorption per unit volume, respectively. That is, % represents the energy lost by the mate- rial phase resulting from the emission of photons by molecules, and d represents the local gain of energy by the material phase resulting from photon absorption by the mole- cules (see Fig. 16.6-1). The q in Eq. 16.6-1 is the conduction heat flux given by Fourier's law. For the \"photon phase,\" we may write an equation describing the local rate of change of radiant energy density dr': in which q\"' is the radiant energy flux. This equation may be obtained by writing a radi- ant energy balance on an element of volume fixed in space.

Note further that the term (8 - d) appears with opposite signs in Eqs. 16.6-1 and 2, indicating that a net gain of radiant energy occurs at the expense of molecular energy. Equation 16.6-2 can also be written for the radiant energy within a frequency range v to v + dv: This expression is obtained by differentiating Eq. 16.6-2 with respect to v. For the purpose of simplifying the discussion, we consider a steady-state nonflow system in which the radiation travels only in the positive z direction. Such a system can be closely approximated by passing a collimated light beam through a solution at tem- peratures sufficiently low that the emission by the solution is unimportant. (If emissions were important, it would be necessary to consider radiation in all directions.) These are the conditions commonly encountered in spectrophotometry. For such a system, Eqs. 16.6-1 and 2 become In order to use these equations, we need information about the volumetric absorption rate d. For a unidirectional beam a conventional expression is in which ma is known as the extinction coeficient. Basically, this states that the rate of pho- ton absorption is proportional to the concentration of photons. A monochromatic radiant beam of frequency v, focused parallel to the z-axis, passes through an absorbing fluid. The local rate of energy absorption is given by mad:), in which m,, is the Absorption of a extinction coefficient for radiation of frequency v. Determine the distribution of the radiant Monochromatic flux q!)(z) in the system. Radiant Beam SOLUTION We neglect refraction and scattering of the incident beam. Also, we assume that the liquid is cooled so that re-radiation can be neglected. Then Eq. 16.6-5 becomes for steady state Integration with respect to z gives This is Lambert's law of absorption: widely used in spectrophotometry. For any given pure ma- terial, m,, depends in a characteristic way on v. The shape of the absorption spectrum is there- fore a useful tool for qualitative analysis. J. H.

What is the physical content of the laws as- sociated with the following scientists' names: Stefan and Boltzmann, Planck, Kirchhoff, Lam- bert, Wien? How are the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the Wien displacement law related to the Planck black-body distribution law? Do black bodies exist? Why is the concept of a black body useful? In specular (mirrorlike) reflection, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. How are these angles related for diffuse reflection? What is the physical significance of the view factor, and how can it be calculated? What are the units of q'\", qt', and qf)? Under what conditions is the effect of geometry on radiant heat interchange completely ex- pressible in terms of view factors? Which of the equations in this chapter show that the apparent brightness of a black body with a uniform surface temperature is independent of the position (distance and direction) from which it is viewed through a transparent medium? What relation is analogous to Eq. 16.3-2 for an ideal monatomic gas? Check the dimensional consistency of Eq. 16.3-9. 16A.1. Approximation of a black body by a hole in a sphere. A thin sphere of copper, with its internal surface highly oxidized, has a diameter of 6 in. How small a hole must be made in the sphere to make an opening that will have an absorptivity of 0.99? Answer: Radius = 0.70 in. 16A.2. Efficiency of a solar engine. A device for utilizing solar energy, developed by ~bbot,' consists of a parabolic mirror that focuses the impinging sunlight onto a Pyrex tube containing a high-boiling, nearly black liquid. This liquid is circulated to a heat exchanger in which the heat energy is transferred to superheated water at 25 atm pressure. Steam may be withdrawn and used to run an engine. The most effi- cient design requires a mirror 10 ft in diameter to generate 2 hp, when the axis of the mirror is pointed directly toward the sun. What is the overall efficiency of the device? Answer: 15% 16A.3. Radiant heating requirement. A shed is rectangu- lar in shape, with the floor 15 ft by 30 ft and the roof 7.5 ft above the floor. The floor is heated by hot water running through coils. On cold winter days the exterior walls and roof are about -10°F. At what rate must heat be supplied through the floor in order to maintain the floor temperature at 75\"F? (Assume that all surfaces of the system are black.) 16A.4.

F may be assumed. A maximum temperature of 100°F may be assumed for the surrounding air. The solar constant of Example 16.4-1 may be used, and the absorption and scattering of the sun's rays by the atmosphere may be neglected. (a) Solve for a perfectly black roof. (b) Solve for an aluminum-coated roof, with an absorptiv- ity of 0.3 for solar radiation and an ernissivity of 0.07 at the temperature of the roof. 16A.5. Radiation errors in temperature measurements. The temperature of an air stream in a duct is being mea- sured by means of a thermocouple. The thermocouple wires and junction are cylindrical, 0.05 in. in diameter, and extend across the duct perpendicular to the flow with the junction in the center of the duct. Assuming a junction emis- sivity e = 0.8, estimate the temperature of the gas stream from the following data obtained under steady conditions: Thermocouple junction temperature = 500°F Duct wall temperature = 300°F Convection heat transfer coefficient from wire to air = 50 Btu/hr. fi? . F The wall temperature is constant at the value given for 20 duct diameters upstream and downstream of the thermo- couple installation. The thermocouple leads are positioned so that the effect of heat conduction along them on the junction temperature may be neglected. 16A.6. Surface temperatures on the Earth's moon.

(a) Develop an equation for the rate of radiant heat transfer through a series of n very thin, flat, parallel metal sheets, each having a different emissivity e, when the first sheet is at temperature T, and the nth sheet is at temperature T,. Give your result in terms of the radiation resistances for the successive pairs of planes. Edge effects and conduc- tion across the air gaps between the sheets are to be ne- glected. (b) Determine the ratio of the radiant heat transfer rate for n identical sheets to that for two identical sheets. (c) Compare your results for three sheets with that ob- tained in Example 16.5-1. The marked reduction in heat transfer rates produced by a number of radiation shields in series has led to the use of multiple layers of metal foils for high-temperature insu- lation. 16B.4. Radiation and conduction through absorbing media. A glass slab, bounded by planes z = 0 and z = 6, is of infinite extent in the x and y directions. The tempera- tures of the surfaces at z = 0 and z = S are maintained at To and T,, respectively. A uniform monochromatic radiant beam of intensity q(' in the z direction impinges on the face at z = 0.

In this chapter we start by giving Fick's law of dif- fusion, which describes the movement of one chemical species A through a binary mix- ture of A and B because of a concentration gradient of A. The movement of a chemical species from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration can be observed by dropping a small crystal of potassium perman- ganate into a beaker of water. The KMnO, begins to dissolve in the water, and very near the crystal there is a dark purple, concentrated solution of KMnO,. Because of the con- centration gradient that is established, the KMnO, diffuses away from the crystal. The progress of the diffusion can then be followed by observing the growth of the dark pur- ple region. In 517.1 we give Fick's law for binary diffusion and define the diffusivity BAB for the pair A-B. Then we discuss briefly the temperature and pressure dependence of the diffu- sivity. After that we give a summary of the theories available to predict the diffusivity for gases, liquids, colloids, and polymers. At the end of the chapter we discuss the trans- port of mass of a chemical species by convection, thus paralleling the treatments in Chapters 1 and 9 for momentum and heat transfer. We also introduce molar units and the notation needed for describing diffusion in these units. Finally, we give the Maxwell-Stefan equations for multicomponent gases at low densities. Before starting the discussion we establish the following conventions. For multicom- ponent diffusion, we designate the species with lower-case Greek letters a, P, y, . . . and their concentrations with the corresponding subscripts. For bina y diffusion we use the capital italic letters A and B. For self-difusion (diffusion of chemically identical species) 514 Chapter 17 Diffusivity and the Mechanisms of Mass Transport we label the species A and A*. The \"tagged\" species A\" may differ physically from A by virtue of radioactivity or other nuclear properties such as the mass, magnetic moment, or spin.' The use of this system of notation enables one to see at a glance the type of system to which a given formula applies. 517.1 FICK'S LAW OF BINARY DIFFUSION (MOLECULAR MASS TRANSPORT) Consider a thin, horizontal, fused-silica plate of area A and thickness Y. Suppose that ini- tially (for time t < 0) both horizontal surfaces of the plate are in contact with air, which we regard as completely insoluble in silica. At time t = 0, the air below the plate is sud- denly replaced by pure helium, which is appreciably soluble in silica. The helium slowly penetrates into the plate by virtue of its molecular motion and ultimately appears in the gas above. This molecular transport of one substance relative to another is known as dif- fusion (also known as mass diffusion, concentration diffusion, or ordinary diffusion). The air above the plate is being replaced rapidly, so that there is no appreciable buildup of he- lium there. We thus have the situation represented in Fig. 17.1-1; this process is analo- gous to those described in Fig. 1.1-1 and Fig. 9.1-1 where viscosity and thermal conductivity were defined. In this system, we will call helium \"species A and silica \"species B.\" The concentra- tions will be given by the \"mass fractions\" w, and w,. The mass fraction w, is the mass of helium divided by the mass of helium plus silica in a given microscopic volume element. The mass fraction w~ is defined analogously. Thickness of I slab of fused silica = Y (substance B) I Fig. 17.1-1. Build-up to the steady-state concentration pro- file for the diffusion of helium (substance A) through fused sil- ica (substance B). The symbol w~ stands for the mass fraction of helium, and w,, is the solubility of helium in fused silica, ex- pressed as the mass fraction. See Figs. 1.1-1 and 9.1-1 for the anal- ogous momentum and heat transport situations. Y Large t y X O,=O UA = W~~ ' E. 0. Stejskal and J. E. Tanner, J. Chem. Phys., 42,288-292 (1965); P.

Reson. 19,325388 (1996). g17.1 Fick's Law of Binary Diffusion (Molecular Mass Transport) 515 For time t less than zero, the mass fraction of helium, w,, is everywhere equal to zero. For time t greater than zero, at the lower surface, y = 0, the mass fraction of helium is equal to w,,. This latter quantity is the solubility of helium in silica, expressed as mass fraction, just inside the solid. As time proceeds the mass fraction profile develops, with w, = w,, at the bottom surface of the plate and w, = 0 at the top surface of the plate. As indicated in Fig. 17.1-1, the profile tends toward a straight line with increasing t. At steady state, it is found that the mass flow w,, of helium in the positive y direc- tion can be described to a very good approximation by That is, the mass flow rate of helium per unit area (or mass flux) is proportional to the mass fraction difference divided by the plate thickness. Here p is the density of the sil- ica-helium system, and the proportionality factor 9lAB is the difusivity of the silica-he- lium system. We now rewrite Eq. 17.1-1 for a differential element within the slab: Here wA,/A has been replaced by jAy, the molecular mass flux of helium in the positive y direction. Note that the first index, A, designates the chemical species (in this case, he- lium), and the second index indicates the direction in which diffusive transport is taking place (in this case, the y direction). Equation 17.1-2 is the one-dimensional form of Fick's first law of diffusion.' It is valid for any binary solid, liquid, or gas solution, provided that jAy is defined as the mass flux relative to the mixture velocity v,. For the system examined in Fig. 17.1-1, the helium is moving rather slowly and its concentration is very small, so that v, is negligibly different from zero during the diffusion process. In general, for a binary mixture Thus v is an average in which the species velocities, v, and v,, are weighted according to the mass fractions. This kind of velocity is referred to as the mass average velocity. The species velocity VA is not the instantaneous molecular velocity of a molecule of A, but rather the arithmetic average of the velocities of all the molecules of A within a tiny volume element. The mass flux j,, is then defined, in general, as The mass flux of B is defined analogously. As the two chemical species interdiffuse there is, locally, a shifting of the center of mass in the y direction if the molecular weights of A and B differ. The mass fluxes j4 and jBy are so defined that jAy + jBy = 0. In other words, the fluxes jA, and jBy are measured with respect to the motion of the center of mass. This point will be discussed in detail in ss17.7 and 8. If we write equations similar to Eq. 17.1-2 for the x and z directions and then com- bine all three equations, we get the vector form of Fick's law: A. Fick, Ann. der Physik, 94/59-86 (1855). Fick's second law, the diffusional analog of the heat conduction equation in Eq. 11.2-10, is given in Eq. 19.1-18. Adolf Eugen Fick (1829-1901) was a medical doctor who taught in Ziirich and Marburg, and later became the Rector of the University of Wiirzburg. He postulated the laws of diffusion by analogy with heat conduction, not by experiment. 516 Chapter 17 Diffusivity and the Mechanisms of Mass Transport A similar relation can be written for species B: j~ = - P~BA~WB (17.1-6) It is shown in Example 17.1-2 that 9,, = 9,,. Thus for the pair A-B, there is just one dif- fusivity; in general it will be a function of pressure, temperatu~e, and composition. The mass diffusivity 9,,, the thermal diffusivity a = k/pC,, and the momentum dif- fusivity (kinematic viscosity) v = p/p all have dimensions of (length)'/time. The ratios of these three quantities are therefore dimensionless groups: ,, cpEl. The Prandtl number: Pr=-=- a k (17.1-7) The Schmidt number:' v El. sc=-=- A p9Afl The Lewis number:' These dimensionless groups of fluid properties play a prominent role in dimensionless equations for systems in which competing transport processes occur. (Note: Sometimes the Lewis number is defined as the inverse of the expression above.) In Tables 17.1-1,2,3, and 4 some values of 9,, in cm2/s are given for a few gas, liq- uid, solid, and polymeric systems. These values can be converted easily to m2/s by mul- tiplication by lop4. Diffusivities of gases at low density are almost independent of w,, increase with temperature, and vary inversely with pressure. Liquid and solid diffusivi- ties are strongly concentration-dependent and generally increase with temperature. There are numerous experimental methods for measuring diffusivities, and some of these are described in subsequent chapter^.^ For gas mixtures, the Schmidt number can range from about 0.2 to 3, as can be seen in Table 17.1-1. For liquid mixtures, values up to 40,000 have been ~bserved.~ Up to this point we have been discussing isotropic fluids, in which the speed of dif- fusion does not depend on the orientation of the fluid mixture. For some solids and structured fluids, the diffusivity will have to be a tensor rather than a scalar, so that Fick's first law has to be modified thus: in which AAD is the (symmetric) dimsivity te~sor.~,~ According to this equation, the mass flux is not necessarily collinear with the mass fraction gradient. We do not pursue this subject further here.

Immergut, eds.), Wiley-Interscience, New York (1999), Chapter VI. In this section we have discussed the diffusion that occurs as a result of a concen- tration gradient in the system. We refer to this kind of diffusion as concentration diffusion or ordinay diffusion. There are, however, other kinds of diffusion: thermal diflusion, which results from a temperature gradient; pressure diffusion, resulting from a pressure gradient; and forced diffusion, which is caused by unequal external forces acting on the chemical species. For the time being, we consider only concentration diffusion, and we postpone discussion of the other mechanisms to Chapter 24. Also, in that chapter we discuss the use of activity, rather than concentration, as the driving force for ordinary diffusion. Calculate the steady-state mass flux jAy of helium for the system of Fig. 17.1-1 at 500K. The partial pressure of helium is 1 atm at y = 0 and zero at the upper surface of the plate. The Difision of thickness Y of the pyrex plate is mm, and its density p'B' is 2.6 g/cm3. The solubility and through Pyrex Glass diffusivity of helium in pyrex are reported7 as 0.0084 volumes of gaseous helium per volume of glass, and 9,, = 0.2 X cm2/s, respectively. Show that the neglect of the mass average velocity implicit in Eq. 17.1-1 is reasonable. SOLUTION The mass concentration of helium in the glass at the lower surface is obtained from the solu- bility data and the ideal gas law: The mass fraction of helium in the solid phase at the lower surface is then C.

Barrer, Diffusion in and through Solids, corrected printing, Cambridge University Press (1951). 520 Chapter 17 Diffusivity and the Mechanisms of Mass Transport We may now calculate the flux of helium from Eq. 17.1-1 as Next, the velocity of the helium can be obtained from Eq. 17.1-4: At the lower surface of the plate (y = 0) this velocity has the value - 1.05 X 10-I' g/cm2 s v~yly=u - + v,, = 1.98 X lop5 cm/s + vYo (17.1-15) 5.3 x lop7 g/cm3 The corresponding value v,, of the mass average velocity of the glass-helium system at y = 0 is then obtained from Eq. 17.1-3 Thus it is safe to neglect vy in Eq. 17.1-14, and the analysis of the experiment in Fig. 17.1-1 at steady state is accurate. Show that only one diffusivity is needed to describe the diffusional behavior of a binary mixture. The Equivalence of 9,, and 9, SOLUTION We begin by writing Eq. 17.1-6 as follows: The second form of this equation follows from the fact that w~ + w, = 1. We next use the vec- tor equivalents of Eqs. 17.1-3 and 4 to write Interchanging A and B in this expression shows that jA = -jB. Combining this with the sec- ond form of Eq. 17.1-17 then gives Comparing this with Eq. 17.1-5 gives 9BA = BAR. We find that the order of subscripts is unim- portant for a binary system and that only one diffusivity is required to describe the diffu- sional behavior. However, it may well be that the diffusivity for a dilute solution of A in B and that for a dilute solution of B in A are numerically different. The reason for this is that the diffusivity is concentration-dependent, so that the two limiting values mentioned above are the values of the diffusivity BRA = 91AB at two different concentrations. 517.2 Temperature and Pressure Dependence of Diffusivities 521 517.2 TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE DEPENDENCE OF DIFFUSIVITIES In this section we discuss the prediction of the diffusivity 9,, for binary systems by cor- responding-states methods. These methods are also useful for extrapolating existing data. Comparisons of many alternative methods are available in the literature.'f2 For binary gas mixtures at low pressure, %,, is inversely proportional to the pressure, increases with increasing temperature, and is almost independent of the composition for a given gas pair. The following equation for estimating '3,, at low pressures has been devel- oped3 from a combination of kinetic theory and corresponding-states arguments: Here %,, [=I cm2/s, p [=I atm, and T [=I K. Analysis of experimental data gives the di- mensionless constants a = 2.745 x lop4 and b = 1.823 for nonpolar gas pairs, excluding helium and hydrogen, and a = 3.640 x lop4 and b = 2.334 for pairs consisting of H,O and a nonpolar gas. Equation 17.2-1 fits the experimental data at atmospheric pressure within an average deviation of 6 to 8%. If the gases A and B are nonpolar and their Lennard-Jones parameters are known, the kinetic-theory method described in the next section usually gives somewhat better accuracy. At high pressures, and in the liquid state, the behavior of %,, is more complicated. The simplest and best understood situation is that of self-diffusion (interdiffusion of la- beled molecules of the same chemical species). We discuss this case first and then extend the results approximately to binary mixtures. A corresponding-states plot of the self-diffusivity %AA* for nonpolar substances is given in Fig. 17.2-1.4 This plot is based on self-diffusion measurements, supplemented by molecular dynamics simulations and by kinetic theory for the low-pressure limit. The or- dinate is c5JAA* at pressure p and temperature T, divided by cgAA+ at the critical point. This quantity is plotted as a function of the reduced pressure p, = p/p, and the reduced temperature T, = T/T,. Because of the similarity of species A and the labeled species A\", the critical properties are all taken as those of species A. From Fig. 17.2-1 we see that c9,* increases strongly with temperature, especially for liquids. At each temperature c9,,$ decreases toward zero with increasing pressure. With decreasing pressure, ~9~\" increases toward a low-pressure limit, as predicted by kinetic theory (see 517.3). The reader is warned that this chart is tentative, and that the lines, except for the low-density limit, are based on data for a very few substances: Ar, Kr, Xe, and CH,. The quantity (cBAA.), may be estimated by one of the following three methods: (i) Given &AA* at a known temperature and pressure, one can read (c~AA*)~ from the chart and get (&,,*), = c%~~*/(c~~~*)~.

Here c [=I g-mole/cm3, 9~~~* [=I cm2/s, T, [=I K, and p, [=I atm. Thus far the discussion of high-density behavior has been concerned with self-diffu- sion. We turn now to the binary diffusion of chemically dissimilar species. In the absence of other information it is suggested that Fig. 17.2-1 may be used for crude estimation of cg,,, with pCA and TcA replaced everywhere by qpcAF?cB and v'Z respectively (see Problem 17A.9 for the basis for this empiricism). The ordinate of the plot is then inter- preted as (~9~~)~ = ~9~~/(~9~~)~ and Eq. 17.2-2 is replaced by With these substitutions, accurate results are obtained in the low-pressure limit. At higher pressures, very few data are available for comparison, and the method must be regarded as provisional. The results in Fig. 17.2-1, and their extensions to binary systems, are expressed in terms of caAA* and c9,, rather than 9,. and BA,. This is done because the c-multiplied diffusion coefficients are more frequently required in mass transfer calculations, and their dependence on pressure and temperature is simpler. 517.2 Temperature and Pressure Dependence of Diffusivities 523 EXAMPLE 17.2-1 Estimation of Diffusivity at Low Density EXAMPLE 17.2-2 Estimation of Self- Diffusivity at High Density Estimate BAB for the system CO-C02 at 296.1K and 1 atm total pressure. SOLUTION The properties needed for Eq. 17.2-1 are (see Table E.l): Label Species M T, (K) p, (atm) Therefore, Substitution of these values into Eq. 17.2-1 gives This gives QAB = 0.152 cm2/s, in agreement with the experimental value.5 This is unusually good agreement. This problem can also be solved by means of Fig. 17.2-1 and Eq. 17.2-3, together with the ideal gas law p = cRT. The result is BAB = 0.140 cm2/s, in fair agreement with the data. Estimate c93,qAx for C1402 in ordinary C02 at 171.7 atm and 373K. It is known6 that QAA* = 0,113 cm2/s at 1.00 atm and 298K, at which condition c = p/ RT = 4.12 X g-mole/cm3. SOLUTION Since a measured value of 9AAX is given, we use method (i). The reduced conditions of the measurement are T, = 298/304.2 = 0.980 and p, = 1.00/72.9 = 0.014. Then from Fig. 17.2-1 we get the value (CQ~~)~ = 0.98. Hence At the conditions of prediction (T, = 373/304.2 = 1.23 and p, = 171.7/72.9 = 2.36), we read (aAA*), = 1.21. The predicted value is then The data of O'Hern and Martin7 give a,,* = 5.89 X g-mole/cm . s at these conditions.

It is known that, at 1 atm and 293K, the molar density is c = 4.17 X g-mole/cm3 and gAB = 0.163 cm2/s. SOLUTION Figure 17.2-1 is used, with method (i). The reduced conditions for the known data are From Fig. 17.2-1 at these conditions we obtain = 1.21. The critical value (~9,~)~ is therefore c9,, (4.17 X 10-~)(0.163) (&A,), = - - - (BAB)~ 1.21 = 5.62 X g-mol/cm . s (17.2-10) Next we calculate the reduced conditions for the prediction (Tr = 1.30, p, = 2.90) and read the value (cg,,), = 1.31 from Fig. 17.2-1. The predicted value of c9,, is therefore Experimental measurements8 give c9,, = 6.0 X so that the predicted value is 23% high. Deviations of this magnitude are not unusual in the estimation of c9,, at high densities. An alternative solution may be obtained by method (iii). Substitution into Eq. 17.4-3 gives Multiplication by (caAB), at the desired condition gives This is in closer agreement with the measured value.8 V. J. Berry, Jr., and R. C.

As in the earlier kinetic theory discussions in 951.4 and 9.3, we start with a simplified derivation to illustrate the mechanisms involved and then pre- sent the more accurate results of the Chapman-Enskog theory. Consider a large body of gas containing molecular species A and A*, which are iden- tical except for labeling. We wish to determine the self-diffusivity 9,* in terms of the molecular properties on the assumption that the molecules are rigid spheres of equal mass m, and diameter dA. Since the properties of A and A* are nearly the same, we can use the following re- sults of the kinetic theory for a pure rigid-sphere gas at low density in which the gradi- ents of temperature, pressure, and velocity are small: ii = @ = mean molecular speed relative to u (17.3-1) Z = inii = wall collision frequency per unit area in a stationary gas (17.3-2) A = = mean free path find2n The molecules reaching any plane in the gas have, on the average, had their last collision at a distance a from the plane, where 2 a = $i (17.3-4) In these equations n is the number density (total number of molecules per unit volume). To predict the self-diffusivity BAA*, we consider the motion of species A in the y di- rection under a mass fraction gradient dw,/dy (see Fig. 17.3-I), where the fluid mixture moves in the y direction at a finite velocity mass average velocity vy throughout. The temperature T and the total molar mass concentration p are considered constant. We as- sume that Eqs. 17.3-1 to 4 remain valid in this nonequilibrium situation. The net mass flux of species A crossing a unit area of any plane of constant y is found by writing an ex- pression for the mass of A crossing the plane in the positive y direction and subtracting the mass of A crossing in the negative y direction: Here the first term is the mass transport in the y direction because of the mass motion of the fluid-that is, the convective transport-and the last two terms give the molecular transport relative to vy. Y Mole-fraction profile oA(y) // Molecule arriving at y after collision at y -a. The fraction of such \\ molecules that are of species A is uAl - a Fig. 17.3-1. Molecular transport of species A from the plane at (y - a) to the plane at y. 526 Chapter 17 Diffusivity and the Mechanisms of Mass Transport It is assumed that the concentration profile wA(y) is very nearly linear over distances of several mean free paths. Then we may write Combination of the last two equations then gives for the combined mass flux at plane y: This is the convective mass flux plus the molecular mass flux, the latter being given by Eq. 17.1-1. Therefore we get the following expression for the self-diffusivity: Finally, making use of Eqs. 17.3-1 and 3, we get which can be compared with Eq. 1.4-9 for the viscosity and Eq. 9.3-12 for the thermal conductivity. The development of a formula for %AB for rigid spheres of unequal masses and di- ameters is considerably more difficult. We simply quote the result' here: That is, l/mA is replaced by the arithmetic average of l/mA and l/mB, and dA by the arithmetic average of dA and dB. The preceding discussion shows how the diffusivity can be obtained by mean free path arguments. For accurate results the Chapman-Enskog kinetic theory should be used. The Chapman-Enskog results for viscosity and thermal conductivity were given in 551.4 and 9.3, respectively. The corresponding formula for c9,, Or, if we approximate c by the ideal gas law p = cRT, we get for 9,, In the second line of Eqs. 17.3-11 and 12, 9JAB [=] cm2/s, OAB [=I A, T [=I K, and p [=I atm.

The parameters aAB and EAB are those ap- pearing in the Lennard-Jones potential between one molecule of A and one of B (cf. Eq. 1.4-1 0): This function In,,,, is given in Table E.2 and Eq. E.2-2. From these results one can com- pute that 9JAB increases roughly as the 2.0 power of T at low temperatures and as the 1.65 power of T at very high temperatures; see the p, -+ 0 curve in Fig. 17.2-1. For rigid spheres, would be unity at all temperatures and a result analogous to Eq. 17.3-10 would be obtained. The parameters o,, and EAB could, in principle, be determined directly from accurate measurements of 9,, over a wide range of temperatures. Suitable data are not yet avail- able for many gas pairs, and one may have to resort to using some other measurable property, such as the viscosity4 of a binary mixture of A and B. In the event that there are no such data, then we can estimate a,, and E,, from the following combining rules:5 for nonpolar gas pairs. Use of these combining rules enables us to predict values of 9,, within about 6% by use of viscosity data on the pure species A and B, or within about 10% if the Lennard-Jones parameters for A and B are estimated from boiling point data by use of Eq. 1.4-12.~ For isotopic pairs, u,,* = UA = a,, and EM. = .FA = that is, the intermolecular force fields for the various pairs A-A*, A\"-A*, and A-A are virtually identical, and the parameters a, and may be obtained from viscosity data on pure A. If, in addition, MA is large, Eq. 17.3-11 simplifies to I The corresponding equation for the rigid-sphere model is given in Eq. 17.3-9. Comparison of Eq. 17.3-16 with Eq. 1.4-14 shows that the self-diffusivity BAA* and the viscosity p (or kinematic viscosity v) are related as follows for heavy isotopic gas pairs at low density: in which 0, = 1.1I1,,,* over a wide range of KT/&,, as may be seen in Table E.2. Thus 9AA* = 1.32~ for the self-difusivify. The relation between v and the binary difusivity '?JAB is not so simple, because v may vary considerably with the composition. The Schmidt number Sc = p/p9,, is in the range from 0.2 to 5.0 for most gas pairs. Equations 17.3-11, 12, 16, and 17 were derived for monatomic nonpolar gases but have been found useful for polyatomic nonpolar gases as well. In addition, these equa- tions may be used to predict QAB for interdiffusion of a polar gas and a nonpolar gas by using combining laws different7 from those given in Eq. 17.3-14 and 15. * S.

Substitution of the preceding values in Eq. 17.3-12 gives s17.4 THEORY OF DIFFUSION IN BINARY LIQUIDS The kinetic theory for diffusion in simple liquids is not as well developed as that for di- lute gases, and it cannot presently give accurate analytical predictions of diffusivities.'-3 As a result our understanding of liquid diffusion depends primarily on the rather crude hydrodynamic and activated-state models. These in turn have spawned a number of em- pirical correlations, which provide the best available means for prediction. These corre- lations permit estimation of diffusivities in terms of more easily measured properties such as viscosity and molar volume. The hydrodynamic theory takes as its starting point the Nernst-Einstein equation: which states that the diffusivity of a single particle or solute molecule A through a sta- tionary medium B is given by = KT(~A/FA) (17.4-1) in which uA/FA is the \"mobility\" of a particle A (that is, the steady-state velocity attained by the particle under the action of a unit force). The origin of Eq. 17.4-1 is discussed in $17.5 in connection with the Brownian motion of colloidal suspensions. If the shape and size of A are known, the mobility can be calculated by the solution of the creeping-flow equation of motion5 (Eq. 3.5-8). Thus, if A is spherical and if one takes into account the possibility of \"slip\" at the fluid-solid interface, one obtains6 R. J. Bearman and J. G. Kirkwood,]. Chem. Phys., 28,136-145 (1958). R. J.

The limiting cases of DAB = and DAB = 0 are of particular interest: a. fiAB = ~4 (no-slip condition) In this case Eq. 17.4-2 becomes Stokes' law (Eq. 2.6-15) and Eq. 17.4-1 becomes which is usually called the Stokes-Einstein equation.

The hydrodynamic model has proven less useful for binary diffusion (that is, for A not identical to B) although the predicted temperature and viscosity depen- dences are approximately correct. Keep in mind that the above formulas apply only to dilute solutions of A in B. Some attempts have been made, however, to extend the hydrodynamic model to solutions of finite concentrations.\" The Eyring activated-state theory attempts to explain transport behavior via a quasi- crystalline model of the liquid state.12 It is assumed in this theory that there is some uni- molecular rate process in terms of which diffusion can be described, and it is further assumed that in this process there is some configuration that can be identified as the \"ac- tivated state.\" The Eyring theory of reaction rates is applied to this elementary process in a manner analogous to that described in s1.5 for estimation of liquid viscosity.

For the special case of self-diffusion, 5 is found to be very close to 27r, so that Eqs. 17.4-5 and 6 are in good agreement despite the difference between the models from which they were developed. The Eyring theory is based on an oversimplified model of the liquid state, and con- sequently the conditions required for its validity are not clear. However, Bearman has shown2 that the Eyring model gives results consistent with statistical mechanics for \"reg- ular solutions,\" that is, for mixtures of molecules that have similar size, shape, and inter- molecular forces. For this limiting situation, Bearman also obtains an expression for the concentration dependence of the diffusivity, in which 9,, and pB are the diffusivity and viscosity of the mixture at the composition XA, and a, is the thermodynamic activity of species A. For regular solutions, the partial molar volumes, VA and V,, are equal to the molar volumes of the pure components. Bearman suggests on the basis of his analysis that Eq. 17.4-7 should be limited to regular solutions, and it has in fact been found to apply well only to nearly ideal solutions. Because of the unsatisfactory nature of the theory for diffusion in liquids, it is neces- sary to rely on empirical expressions. For example, the Wilke-Chang equation14 gives the diffusivity for small concentrations of A in B as Here 6 is the molar volume of the solute A in cm3/g-mole as liquid at its normal boiling point, p is the viscosity of the solution in centipoises, t+!~~ is an llassociation parameter\" for the solvent, and T is the absolute temperature in K. Recommended values of $, are: 2.6 for water; 1.9 for methanol; 1.0 for benzene, ether, heptane, and other unassociated solvents.

Specifically we consider a finely divided, dilute suspension of spherical particles of material A in a sta- tionary liquid B. When the spheres of A are sufficiently small (but still large with respect to the molecules of the suspending medium), the collisions between the spheres and the molecules of B will result in an erratic motion of the spheres. This random motion is re- ferred to as Brownian rnoti~n.~ The movement of each sphere can be described by an equation of motion, called the Langevin equation: in which u, is the instantaneous velocity of the sphere of mass m. The term -luA gives the Stokes' law drag force: 5 = 6rpBR, being the \"friction coefficient.\" Finally F(t) is the rapidly oscillating, irregular Brownian motion force. Equation 17.5-1 cannot be \"solved\" in the usual sense, since it contains the randomly fluctuating force F(t). Equations such as Eq. 17.5-1 are called \"stochastic differential equations.\" If it is assumed that (i) F(t) is independent of uA and that (ii) the variations in F(t) are much more rapid than those of u,, then it is possible to extract from Eq. 17.5-1 the proba- bility W(uA,t;uA0)duA that at time t the particle will have a velocity in the range of uA to UA + du,. Physical reasoning requires that the probability density W(U~,~;U~~) approach a Maxwellian (equilibrium) distribution as t -+ w: Here, T is the temperature of the fluid in which the particles are suspended.

Actually the phenomenon had been discovered and reported earlier in 1789 by Jan Ingenhousz (1730-1799) in the Netherlands. %s can be seen from Example 4.2-1, Stokes' law is valid only for the steady, unidirectional motion of a sphere through a fluid. For a sphere moving in an arbitrary manner, there are, in addition to the Stokes' contribution, an inertial term and a memory-integral term (the Basset force). See A. 8. Basset, Phil.

In applying the Langevin equation to polymer kinetic theory, the role of the Basset force has been investigated by J. D. Schieber, J. Chem. Phys., 94,7526-7533 (1991). 532 Chapter 17 Diffusivity and the Mechanisms of Mass Transport Another quantity of interest that can be obtained from the Langevin equation is the probability, W(r,t;ro,uAo)dr, that at time t the particle will have a position in the range r to r + dr if its initial position and velocity were ro and UAO. For long times, specifically t >> m/{, this probability is given by However, this expression turns out to have just the same form as the solution of Fick's second law of diffusion (see Eq. 19.1-18 and Problem 20B.5) for the diffusion from a point source. One simply has to identify W with the concentration cA, and KT/~ with B,,. In this way Einstein (see Ref. 1 on page 531) arrived at the following expression for the diffusivity of a dilute suspension of spherical colloid particles: Thus, is related to the temperature and the friction coefficient 5 (the reciprocal of the friction coefficient is called the \"mobility\"). Equation 17.5-4 was already given in Eq. 17.4-3 for the interdiffusion of liquids. s17.6 THEORY OF DIFFUSION OF POLYMERS For a dilute solution of a polymer A in a low-molecular-weight solvent B, there is a de- tailed theory,' in which the polymer molecules are modeled as bead-spring chains (see Fig. 8.6-2). Each chain is a linear arrangement of N beads and N - 1 Hookean springs. The beads are characterized by a friction coefficient 6, which describes the Stokes' law resistance to the bead motion through the solvent. The model further takes into account the fact that, as a bead moves around, it disturbs the solvent in the neighborhood of all the other beads; this is referred to as hydrodynamic interaction. The theory ultimately predicts that the diffusivity should be proportional to N-I'2 for large N. Since the num- ber of beads is proportional to the polymer molecular weight M, the following result is obtained: The inverse square-root dependence is rather well borne out by experiment.' If hydrody- namic interaction among beads were not included, then one would predict %,, - 1 /M. The theory of self-diffusion in an undiluted polymer has been studied from several points of vie^.^,^ These theories, which are rather crude, lead to the result that ' J. G.

Although a very general theory for diffusion of polymers has been de~eloped,~ not very much has been done with it. So far it has been used to show that, in flowing dilute solutions of flowing polymers, the diffusivity tensor (see Eq. 17.1-1 0) becomes anisotropic and dependent on the velocity gradients. It has also been shown how to generalize the Maxwell-Stefan equations (see 517.9 and s24.1) for multicomponent polymeric liquids. Further advances in this subject can be expected through use of molecular simulation^.^ 517.7 MASS AND MOLAR TRANSPORT BY CONVECTION In 517.1, the discussion of Fick's (first) law of diffusion was given in terms of mass units: mass concentration, mass flux, and the mass average velocity. In this section we extend the previous discussion to include molar units. Thus most of this section deals with questions of notation and definitions. One might reasonably wonder whether or not this dual set of notation is really necessary. Unfortunately, it really is. When chemical reactions are in- volved, molar units are usually preferred. When the diffusion equations are solved to- gether with the equation of motion, mass units are usually preferable. Therefore it is necessary to acquire familiarity with both. In this section we also introduce the concept of the convective flux of mass or moles. Mass and Molar Concentrations Earlier we defined the mass concentration p, as the mass of species a per unit volume of solution. Now we define the molar concentration c, = p,/M, as the number of moles of a per unit volume of solution. Similarly, in addition to the mass fraction o, = pJp, we will use the mole fraction x, = c,/c. Here p = Zap, is the total mass of all species per unit volume of solution, and c = Z,c, is the total number of moles of all species per unit volume of solution. By the word \"solution\" we mean a one-phase gaseous, liquid, or solid mixture. In Table 17.7-1 we summarize these concentration units and their interrelation for multicomponent systems. It is necessary to emphasize that p, is the mass concentration of species a in a mix- ture. We use the notation p'\"i for the density of pure species a when the need arises. Mass Average and Molar Average Velocity In a diffusing mixture, the various chemical species are moving at different velocities. By v,, the \"velocity of species a,\" we do not mean the velocity of an individual molecule of species a. Rather, we mean the average of all the velocities of molecules of species a within a small volume. Then, for a mixture of N species, the local mass average velocity v is defined as P. F. Green, in Diffusion in Polymers (P. Neogi, ed.), Dekker, New York (1996), Chapter 6. According to T. P. ~odge, Phys. Rev. Letters, 86,3218-3221 (1999), measurements on undiluted polymers show that the exponent on the molecular weight should be about 2.3. \". F. Curtiss and R. B. Bird, Adv. Polym.

This is the local velocity one could measure by means of a Pitot tube or by laser-Doppler velocimetry, and corresponds to the v used in the equa- tion of motion and in the energy equation in the preceding chapters for pure fluids. Similarly, one may define a local molar average velocity v* by Note that cv* is the local rate at which moles pass through a unit cross section placed perpendicular to the molar velocity v*. Both the mass average velocity and the molar average velocity will be used extensively throughout the remainder of this book. Still g17.7 Mass and Molar Transport by Convection 535 Table 17.7-2 Notation for Velocities in Multicomponent Systems Basic definitions: V, velocity of species a with respect to fixed coordinates (A) N v = 2 O,V, mass average velocity a=l N V* = x X,V, molar average velocity a=l (C) v, - v diffusion velocity of species a with respect to the mass average velocity v (D) va - v* diffusion velocity of species a with respect to the molar average velocity v* (E) Additional relations: other average velocities are sometimes used, such as the volume average velocity (see Problem 17C.1). In Table 17.7-2 we give a summary of the various relations among these velocities. Molecular Mass and Molar Fluxes In 517.1 we defined the molecular mass flux of a as the flow of mass of a through a unit area per unit time: j, = p,(v, - v). That is, we include only the velocity of species a rela- tive to the mass average velocity v. Similarly, we define the molecular molar flux of species a as the number of moles of a flowing through a unit area per unit time: J: = cA(vA - vr). Here we include only the velocity of species a relative to the molar average velocity v*. Then in 517.1 we presented Fick's (first) law of diffusion, which describes how the mass of species A in a binary mixture is transported by means of molecular motions. This law can also be expressed in molar units. Hence we have the pair of relations for bi- nary systems: The differences v~ - v and v, - v* are sometimes referred to as diffusion velocities. Equa- tion 17.7-4 can be derived from Eq. 17.7-3 by using some of the relations in Tables 17.7-1 and 2. Convective Mass and Molar Fluxes In addition to transport by molecular motion, mass may also be transported by the bulk motion of the fluid. In Fig. 9.7-1 we show three mutually perpendicular planes of area dS at a point P where the fluid mass average velocity is v. The volume rate of flow across the plane perpendicular to the surface element dS perpendicular to the x-axis is v,dS. The rate at which mass of species a is being swept across the same surface element is then p,v,dS. We can write similar expressions for the mass flows of species a across the sur- face elements perpendicular to the y- and z-axes as p,v,dS and p,v,dS, respectively. If we 536 Chapter 17 Diffusivity and the Mechanisms of Mass Transport now multiply each of these expressions by the corresponding unit vector, add them, and divide by dS, we get as the convective mass flux vector, which has units of kg/m2 . s. If one goes back and repeats the story of the preceding paragraph, but using every- where molar units and the molar average velocity v*, then we get as the convective molar flux vector, which has units of kg-mole/m2 s. To get the convective mass and molar fluxes across a unit surface whose normal unit vector is n, we form the dot products (n . p,v) and (n . c,v*), respectively. 517.8 SUMMARY OF MASS AND MOLAR FLUXES In Chapters 1 and 9 we introduced the combined momentum flux tensor + and the com- bined energy flux vector e, which we found useful in setting up the shell balances and equations of change. We give the corresponding definitions here for the mass and molar flux vectors. We add together the molecular mass flux vector and the convective mass flux vector to get the combined mass flux vector, and similarly for the combined molar flux vector: Com bined mass flux: Combined molar flux: In the first three lines of Table 17.8-1 we summarize the definitions of the mass and molar fluxes discussed so far. In the shaded squares we also give the definitions of the fluxes j: (mass flux with respect to the molar average velocity) and J, (molar flux with re- spect to mass average velocity). These \"hybrid\" fluxes should normally not be used. In the remainder of Table 17.8-1 we give a summary of other useful relations, such as the sums of the fluxes and the interrelations among the fluxes. By using Eqs. 0) and (M) we can rewrite Eqs. 17.8-1 and 2 as When simplified for binary systems, these relations can be combined with Eqs. 17.7-3 and 17.7-4, to get Eqs. (C) and (D) of Table 17.8-2, which are equivalent forms of Fick's (first) law. The forms given in Eqs. (E) and (F) of Table 17.8-2, in terms of the relative ve- locities of the species, are interesting because they involve neither v nor vr. In Chapter 18 we will write Fick's law exclusively in the form of Eq. (D) of Table 17.8-2. It is this form that has generally been used in chemical engineering. In many problems something is known about the relation between NA and N, from the stoi- chiometry or from boundary conditions. Therefore N, can be eliminated from Eq. (D), giving a direct relation between NA and VxA for the particular problem. In s1.7 we pointed out that the total molecular momentum flux through a surface of orientation n is the vector In m]. In 59.7 we mentioned the analogous quantity for the mol- ecular heat flux-namely, the scalar (n . q). The analogous mass transport quantities are the scalars (n * j,) and (n . J:), which give the total mass and molar fluxes through a surface of orientation n. Similarly, for the combined fluxes through a surface of orientation n, we have for momentum [n +I, for energy (n e), and for species (n . n,) and (n . N,). 517.8 Summary of Mass and Molar Fluxes 537 Table 17.8-1 Notation for Mass and Molar Fluxes* *Entries in the shaded boxes, involving the \"hybrid fluxes\" j,$ and J,, are seldom needed; they are included only for the sake of completeness.

There- fore, for an N-component system, ~N(N - 1) binary diffusivities are required. Equations 17.9-1 are referred to as the Maxwell-Stefan equations, since Maxwell3 suggested them for binary mixtures on the basis of kinetic theory, and Stefanhener- alized them to describe the diffusion in a gas mixture with N species. Later Curtiss and Hirschfelder obtained Eqs. 17.9-1 from the multicomponent extension of the Chapman-Enskog theory. For dense gases, liquids, and polymers it has been shown that the Maxwell-Stefan equations are still valid, but that the strongly concentration-dependent diffusivities ap- pearing therein are not the binary diff~sivities.~ There is an important difference between binary diffusion and multicomponent dif- f~sion.~ In binary diffusion the movement of species A is always proportional to the neg- ative of the concentration gradient of species A. In multicomponent diffusion, however, other interesting situations can arise: (i) reverse diffusion, in which a species moves against its own concentration gradient; (ii) osmotic diffusion, in which a species diffuses even though its concentration gradient is zero; (iii) dimsion barrier, when a species does not diffuse even though its concentration gradient is nonzero. In addition, the flux of a species is not necessarily collinear with the concentration gradient of that species. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION How is the binary diffusivity defined? How is self-diffusion defined? Give typical orders of magnitude of diffusivities for gases, liquids, and solids. Summarize the notation for the molecular, convective, and total fluxes for the three transport processes.

What ranges of Pr and Sc can one expect to encounter for gases and liquids? How can you estimate the Lennard-Jones potential for a binary mixture, if you know the pa- rameters for the two components of the mixture? Of what value are the hydrodynamic theories of diffusion?

In Chapter 9 we saw further how steady-state heat-conduction problems can be handled by means of a shell energy balance. In this chapter we show how steady-state diffusion problems may be formulated by shell mass balances. The procedure used here is virtually the same as that used previously: a. A mass balance is made over a thin shell perpendicular to the direction of mass transport, and this shell balance leads to a first-order differential equation, which may be solved to get the mass flux distribution. b. Into this expression we insert the relation between mass flux and concentration gradient, which results in a second-order differential equation for the concentra- tion profile. The integration constants that appear in the resulting expression are determined by the boundary conditions on the concentration and/or mass flux at the bounding surfaces. In Chapter 17 we pointed out that several kinds of mass fluxes are in common use. For simplicity, we shall in this chapter use the combined flux NA-that is, the number of moles of A that go through a unit area in unit time, the unit area being fixed in space. We shall relate the molar flux to the concentration gradient by Eq. (D) of Table 17.8-2, which for the z-component is combined moIecuIar convective flux flu flux Before Eq. 18.0-1 is used, we usually have to eliminate NBZ. This can be done only if something is known beforehand about the ratio Nh/NAZ. In each of the binary diffusion 544 Chapter 18 Concentration Distributions in Solids and in Laminar Flow problems discussed in this chapter, we begin by specifying this ratio by physical or chemical reasoning. In this chapter we study diffusion in both nonreacting and reacting systems. When chemical reactions occur, we distinguish between two reaction types: homogeneous, in which the chemical change occurs in the entire volume of the fluid, and heterogeneous, in which the chemical change takes place only in a restricted region, such as the surface of a catalyst. Not only is the physical picture different for homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, but there is also a difference in the way the two types of reactions are described mathematically. The rate of production of a chemical species by homogeneous reaction ap- pears as a source term in the differential equation obtained from the shell balance, just as the thermal source term appears in the shell energy balance. The rate of production by a heterogeneous reaction, on the other hand, appears not in the differential equation, but rather in the boundary condition at the surface on which the reaction occurs. In order to set up problems involving chemical reactions, some information has to be available about the rate at which the various chemical species appear or disappear by reaction. This brings us to the vast subject of chemical kinetics, that branch of physical chemistry that deals with the mechanisms of chemical reactions and the rates at which they occur.' In this chapter we assume that the reaction rates are described by means of simple functions of the concentrations of the reacting species. At this point we need to mention the notation to be used for the chemical rate con- stants. For homogeneous reactions, the molar rate of production of species A may be given by an expression of the form Homogeneous reaction: R - k\"' n A - ~CA (18.0-2) in which RA [=I moles/cm3 . s and cA [=I moles/cm3. The index n indicates the \"order\" of the rea~tion;~ for a first-order reaction, kp [=I l/s. For heterogeneous reactions, the molar rate of production at the reaction surface may often be specified by a relation of the form Heterogeneous reaction: NAZI surface = k;c]12 Isuriace (18.0-3) in which NAZ [=I moles/cm2 . s and c, [=I moles/cm3. Here k',' [=I cm/s. Note that the triple prime on the rate constant indicates a volume source and the double prime a sur- face source. We begin in 518.1 with a statement of the shell balance and the kinds of boundary conditions that may arise in solving diffusion problems. In 518.2 a discussion of diffu- sion through a stagnant film is given, this topic being necessary to the understanding of the film models of diffusional operations in chemical engineering. Then, in 5518.3 and 18.4 we given some elementary examples of diffusion with chemical reaction-both het- erogeneous and homogeneous. These examples illustrate the role that diffusion plays in chemical kinetics and the important fact that diffusion can significantly affect the rate of a chemical reaction. In 5518.5 and 6 we turn our attention to forced-convection mass transfer-that is, diffusion superimposed on a flow field. Although we have not in- ' R. J. Silbey and R. A. Alberty, Physical Chemistry, 3rd edition, Wiley, New York (2001), Chapter 18. Not all rate expressions are of the simple form of Eq. 18.0-2. The reaction rate may depend in a complicated way on the concentration of all species present. Similar remarks hold for Eq. 18.0-3.

Next, in 518.7 we dis- cuss diffusion in porous catalysts. Finally, in the last section we extend the evaporation problem of 518.2 to a three-component system. 818.1 SHELL MASS BALANCES; BOUNDARY CONDITIONS The diffusion problems in this chapter are solved by making mass balances for one or more chemical species over a thin shell of solid or fluid. Having selected an appropriate system, the law of conservation of mass of species A in a binary system is written over the volume of the shell in the form rate of rate of rate of production of (18.1-1) homogeneous reaction The conservation statement may, of course, be expressed in terms of moles. The chemical species A may enter or leave the system by diffusion (i.e., by molecular motion) and also by virtue of the overall motion of the fluid (i.e., by convection), both of these being in- cluded in NA. In addition, species A may be produced or consumed by homogeneous chemical reactions. After a balance is made on a shell of finite thickness by means of Eq. 18.1-1, we then let the thickness become infinitesimally small. As a result of this process a differential equation for the mass (or molar) flux is generated. If, into this equation, we substitute the expression for the mass (or molar) flux in terms of the concentration gradient, we get a differential equation for the concentration. When this differential equation has been integrated, constants of integration appear, and these have to be determined by the use of boundary conditions. The boundary con- ditions are very similar to those used in heat conduction (see §10.1): a. The concentration at a surface can be specified; for example, xA = x,,. b. The mass flux at a surface can be specified; for example, NAz = N,,. If the ratio NB,/NAz is known, this is equivalent to giving the concentration gradient. c. If diffusion is occurring in a solid, it may happen that at the solid surface sub- stance A is lost to a surrounding stream according to the relation in which NAO is the molar flux at the surface, CAO is the surface concentration, cAb is the concentration in the bulk fluid stream, and the proportionality constant kc is a \"mass transfer coefficient.\" Methods of correlating mass transfer coefficients are discussed in Chapter 22. Equation 18.1-2 is analogous to \"Newton's law of cool- ing\" given in Eq. 10.1-2. d. The rate of chemical reaction at the surface can be specified. For example, if sub- stance A disappears at a surface by a first-order chemical reaction, then NA@ = k;cA0. That is, the rate of disappearance at a surface is proportional to the surface concentration, the proportionality constant k; being a first-order chemical rate coefficient. $18.2 DIFFUSION THROUGH A STAGNANT GAS FILM Let us now analyze the diffusion system shown in Fig. 18.2-1 in which liquid A is evapo- rating into gas B. We imagine there is some device that maintains the liquid level at z = 2,. Right at the liquid-gas interface, the gas-phase concentration of A, expressed as mole 546 Chapter 18 Concentration Distributions in Solids and in Laminar Flow Gas stream of A and B 9 F I I I I ;; I m I H I + I 2' 1; I I I - I I 9 * Liquid A Fig. 18.2-1. Steady-state diffusion of A through stagnant B with the liquid- vapor interface maintained at a fixed position. The graph shows how the concentration profiles deviate from straight lines because of the convective contribution to the mass flux. fraction, is xAl. This is taken to be the gas-phase concentration of A corresponding to equilibrium1 with the liquid at the interface. That is, xAl is the vapor pressure of A di- vided by the total pressure, pFp/p, provided that A and B form an ideal gas mixture and that the solubility of gas B in liquid A is negligible. A stream of gas mixture A-B of concentration XA2 flows slowly past the top of the tube, to maintain the mole fraction of A at x,, for z= z2. The entire system is kept at con- stant temperature and pressure. Gases A and B are assumed to be ideal. We know that there will be a net flow of gas upward from the gas-liquid interface, and that the gas velocity at the cylinder wall will be smaller than that in the center of the tube. To simplify the problem, we neglect this effect and assume that there is no depen- dence of the z-component of the velocity on the radial coordinate. When this evaporating system attains a steady state, there is a net motion of A away from the interface and the species B is stationary. Hence the molar flux of A is given by Eq. 17.0-1 with NBz = 0. Solving for NAz, we get A steady-state mass balance (in molar units) over an increment Az of the column states that the amount of A entering at plane z equals the amount of A leaving at plane z + Az: Here S is the cross-sectional area of the column. Division by SAz and taking the limit as Az + 0 gives L. J. Delaney and L. C. Eagleton [AICkE Journal, 8,418420 (196211 conclude that, for evaporating systems, the interfacial equilibrium assumption is reasonable, with errors in the range of 1.3 to 7.0% possible. 518.2 Diffusion Through a Stagnant Gas Film 547 Substitution of Eq. 18.2-1 into Eq. 18.2-3 gives For an ideal gas mixture the equation of state is p = cRT, so that at constant temperature and pressure c must be a constant. Furthermore, for gases aAB is very nearly indepen- dent of the composition. Therefore, can be moved to the left of the derivative opera- tor to get This is a second-order differential equation for the concentration profile expressed as mole fraction of A. Integration with respect to z gives A second integration then gives If we replace C, by -In K, and C2 by -In K,, Eq. 18.2-7 becomes The two constants of integration, K, and K,, may then be determined from the boundary conditions B.C. 1: B.C. 2: at z = z,, xA = xA, at z = z2, x, = x~2 When the constants have been obtained, we get finally The profiles for gas B are obtained by using xB = 1 - x,. The concentration profiles are shown in Fig. 18.2-1. It can be seen there that the slope dxA/dz is not constant although N, is; this could have been anticipated from Eq. 18.2-1. Once the concentration profiles are known, we can get average values and mass fluxes at surfaces. For example, the average concentration of B in the region between 2, and z, is obtained as follows: in which 5 = (z - z,)/(z, - z,) is a dimensionless length variable. This average may be rewritten as That is, the average value of xB is the logarithmic mean, (x,),,, of the terminal concen- trations. 548 Chapter 18 Concentration Distributions in Solids and in Laminar Flow Main fluid stream - in turbulent flow Fig. 18.2-2. Film model for mass transfer; component A is diffusing from the surface into the gas stream through a hypothetical stagnant gas film. The rate of mass transfer at the liquid-gas interface-that is, the rate of evapora- tion-may be obtained from Eq. 18.2-1 as follows: By combining Eqs. 18.2-13 and 14 we get finally This expression gives the evaporation rate in terms of the characteristic driving force XAl - x~2. By expanding the solution in Eq. 18.2-15 in a Taylor series, we can get (see 5C.2 and Problem 18B.18) The expression in front of the bracketed expansion is the result that one would get if the convection term were entirely omitted in Eq. 18.0-1. The bracketed expansion then gives the correction resulting from including the convection term. Another way of interpreting this expression is that the simple result corresponds to joining the end points of the x, curve in Fig. 18.2-1 by a straight line, and the complete result corresponds to using the curve of x, versus z. If the terminal mole fractions are small, the correction term in brack- ets in Eq. 18.2-16 is only slightly greater than unity. The results of this section have been used for experimental determinations of gas diffusivities.' Furthermore, these results find use in the \"film models\" of mass transfer. In Fig. 18.2-2 a solid or liquid surface is shown along which a gas is flowing. Near the surface is a slowly moving film through which A diffuses. This film is bounded by the surfaces z = z, and z = z2 In this \"model\" it is assumed that there is a sharp transition from a stagnant film to a well-mixed fluid in which the concentration gradients are negli- gible. Although this model is physically unrealistic, it has nevertheless proven useful as a simplified picture for correlating mass transfer coefficients. * C. Y. Lee and C. R. Wilke, Ind. Eng.

The liquid level goes down very slowly as the liquid evaporates. A gas mixture of composition xA2 flows across the top of the tube. Liquid A We want now to examine a problem that is slightly different from the one just discussed. In- stead of maintaining the liquid-gas interface at a constant height, we allow the liquid level to Diffusion with a subside as the evaporation proceeds, as shown in Fig. 18.2-3. Since the liquid retreats very Moving Interface slowly, we can use a quasi-steady state method with confidence. SOLUTION First we equate the molar rate of evaporation of A from the liquid phase with the rate at which moles of A enter the gas phase: Here p(A' is the density of pure liquid A and MA is the molecular weight. On the right side of Eq. 18.2-17 we have used the steady-state evaporation rate evaluated at the current liquid column height (this is the quasi-steady-state approximation). This equation can be integrated to give in which h(t) = zl(0) - z,(t) is the distance that the interface has descended in time t, and H = 2, - q(0) is the initial height of the gas column. When we abbreviate the right side of Eq. 18.2-18 by iCt, the equation can be integrated and then solved for h to give One can use this experiment to get the diffusivity from measurements of the liquid level as a function of time. Determination of Diffusivity The diffusivity of the gas pair 0,-CC1, is being determined by observing the steady-state evaporation of carbon tetrachloride into a tube containing oxygen, as shown in Fig. 18.2-1. The distance between the CCl, liquid level and the top of the tube is 2, - z, = 17.1 cm. The total pressure on the system is 755 mm Hg, and the temperature is 0°C. The vapor pressure of CCl, at that temperature is 33.0 mm Hg. The cross-sectional area of the diffusion tube is 0.82 cm2. It is found that 0.0208 cm3 of CCl, evaporate in a 10-hour period after steady state has been attained. What is the diffusivity of the gas pair 02-CCl,? SOLUTION Let A stand for CCl, and B for 02. The molar flux of A is then 550 Chapter 18 Concentration Distributions in Solids and in Laminar Flow Then from Eq. 18.2-14 we get This method of determining gas-phase diffusivities suffers from several defects: the cooling of the liquid by evaporation, the concentration of nonvolatile impurities at the interface, the climbing of the liquid up the walls of the tube, and the curvature of the meniscus. (a) Derive expressions for diffusion through a spherical shell that are analogous to Eq. 18.2-11 (concentration profile) and Eq. 18.2-14 (molar flux). The system under consideration is shown Diffusion through a in pin. 18.2-4. Nonisothermal Spherical Film SOLUTION - (b) Extend these results to describe the diffusion in a nonisothermal film in which the tem- perature varies radially according to where TI is the temperature at r = r,. Assume as a rough approximation that varies as the $-power of the temperature: in which is the diffusivity at T = TI. Problems of this kind arise in connection with dry- ing of droplets and diffusion through gas films near spherical catalyst pellets. The temperature distribution in Eq. 18.2-22 has been chosen solely for mathematical sim- plicity. This example is included to emphasize that, in nonisothermal systems, Eq. 18.0-1 is the correct starting point rather than NAz = -gAB(dcA/dz) + xA(NAz + NBz), as has been given in some textbooks. (a) A steady-state mass balance on a spherical shell leads to Fig. 18.2-4.

(b) For the nonisothermal problem, combination of Eqs. 18.2-22 and 23 gives the variation of diffusivity with position: When this expression is inserted into Eq. 18.2-25 and c is set equal to p/RT, we get After integrating between Y, and r,, we obtain (for n # -2) For n = 0, this result simplifies to that in Eq. 18.2-27. 518.3 DIFFUSION WITH A HETEROGENEOUS CHEMICAL REACTION Let us now consider a simple model for a catalytic reactor, such as that shown in Fig. 18.3-la, in which a reaction 2A + B is being carried out. An example of a reaction of this type would be the solid-catalyzed dimerization of CH,CH = CH,. We imagine that each catalyst particle is surrounded by a stagnant gas film through which A has to diffuse to reach the catalyst surface, as shown in Fig. 18.3-lb At the catalyst surface we assume that the reaction 2A + B occurs instantaneously, and that the product B then diffuses back out through the gas film to the main turbu- lent stream composed of A and B. We want to get an expression for the local rate of conversion from A to B when the effective gas-film thickness and the main stream concentrations x,,, and x,, are known. We assume that the gas film is isothermal, al- though in many catalytic reactions the heat generated by the reaction cannot be neglected. For the situation depicted in Fig. 18.3-lb, there is one mole of B moving in the minus z direction for every two moles of A moving in the plus z direction. We know this from the stoichiometry of the reaction. Therefore we know that at steady state 552 Chapter 18 Concentration Distributions in Solids and in Laminar Flow Gas A - Gases A and B -f \\ Spheres with coating 1 of catalytic material I (a) I=L Edge of hypothetical / stagnant gas film Fig. 18.3-1.

This relation may be substituted into Eq. 18.0-1, which may then be solved for NAZ to give Hence, Eq. 18.0-1 plus the stoichiometry of the reaction have led to an expression for Nh in terms of the concentration gradient. We now make a mass balance on species A over a thin slab of thickness Az in the gas film. This procedure is exactly the same as that used in connection with Eqs. 18.2-2 and 3 and leads once again to the equation Insertion of the expression for NAt, developed above, into this equation gives (for con- stant %,,) Integration twice with respect to z gives It is somewhat easier to find the integration constants K, and K, than C1 and C2. The boundary conditions are B.C. 1: B.C. 2: The final result is then s18.3 Diffusion with a Heterogeneous Chemical Reaction 553 for the concentration profile in the gas film. Equation 18.3-2 may now be used to get the molar flux of reactant through the film: The quantity N, may also be interpreted as the local rate of reaction per unit area of cat- alytic surface. This information can be combined with other information about the cat- alytic reactor sketched in Fig. 18.3-l(a) to get the overall conversion rate in the entire reactor. One point deserves to be emphasized. Although the chemical reaction occurs instan- taneously at the catalytic surface, the conversion of A to B proceeds at a finite rate be- cause of the diffusion process, which is \"in series\" with the reaction process. Hence we speak of the conversion of A to B as being difision controlled. In the example above we have assumed that the reaction occurs instantaneously at the catalytic surface. In the next example we show how to account for finite reaction ki- netics at the catalytic surface. Rework the problem just considered when the reaction 2A -+ B is not instantaneous at the cat- alytic surface at z = 6. Instead, assume that the rate at which A disappears at the catalyst- with a coated surface is proportional to the concentration of A in the fluid at the interface, Heterogeneous Reaction NAz = k;cA = k;cxA (18.3-10) in which k; is a rate constant for the pseudo-first-order surface reaction. SOLUTION We proceed exactly as before, except that B.C. 2 in Eq. 18.3-7 must be replaced by B.C. 2': NA, being, of course, a constant at steady state. The determination of the integration constants from B.C. 1 and B.C. 2' leads to From this we evaluate (dxA/dz)l,=, and substitute it into Eq. 18.3-2, to get This is a transcendental equation for NAz as a function of xA,, k;, &IAB, and 6. When k; is large, the logarithm of 1 - :(~,,/k:c) may be expanded in a Taylor series and all terms discarded but the first. We then get NA~ = 2c9~d6 in( ) (k, large) (18.3-14) 1 + 9,,/k;'~ 1 - PA, Note once again that we have obtained the rate of the combined reaction and diffusion process. Note also that the dimensionless group 9A,/k;6 describes the effect of the surface reaction ki- netics on the overall diffusion-reaction process. The reciprocal of this group is known as the second Damkohler number' Da\" = k;6/gA,. Evidently we get the result in Eq. 18.3-9 in the limit as Dan -+ w. ' G. Damhohler, Z.

Absorption of A by B with a homogeneous reaction in the liquid phase. 518.4 DIFFUSION WITH A HOMOGENEOUS CHEMICAL REACTION As the next illustration of setting up a mass balance, we consider the system shown in Fig. 18.4-1. Here gas A dissolves in liquid B in a beaker and diffuses isothermally into the liquid phase. As it diffuses, A also undergoes an irreversible first-order homogeneous re- action: A + B + AB. An example of such a system is the absorption of CO, by a concen- trated aqueous solution of NaOH. We treat this as a binary solution of A and B, ignoring the small amount of AB that is present (the pseudobinay assumption). Then the mass balance on species A over a thick- ness Az of the liquid phase becomes in which kq' is a first-order rate constant for the chemical decomposition of A, and S is the cross-sectional area of the liquid. The product kq'cA represents the moles of A consumed by the reaction per unit volume per unit time. Division of Eq. 18.4-1 by SAz and taking the limit as Az -+ 0 gives If the concentration of A is small, then we may to a good approximation write Eq. 18.0-1 as since the total molar concentration c is virtually uniform throughout the liquid. Combin- ing the last two equations gives This is to be solved with the following boundary conditions: B.C. I: B.C. 2: at z = 0, C~ = C~O at z = L, NA, = 0 (or dcn/dz = 0) The first boundary condition asserts that the concentration of A at the surface in the liq- uid remains at a fixed value c,,. The second states that no A diffuses through the bottom of the container at z = L. If Eq. 18.4-4 is multiplied by then it can be written in dimensionless vari- ables in the form of Eq. C.l-4 s18.4 Diffusion with a Homogeneous Chemical Reaction 555 where r = cA/cAO is a dimensionless concentration, 5 = z/L is a dimensionless length, and 4 = d k;\"L2/91AB is a dimensionless group, known as the Thiele modulus.' This group represents the relative influence of the chemical reaction kycAO and diffusion c~~~~~/L~. Equation 18.4-7 is to be solved with the dimensionless boundary conditions that at 5 = 0, r = 1, and at 5 = 1, dr/dc = 0. The general solution is I' = C, cosh $5 + C, sinh +c (18.4-8) When the constants of integration are evaluated, we get cosh 4 cosh $5 - sinh 4 sinh 45 cosh[+(l - 5)1 r = - - (18.4-9) cosh $ cosh 4 Then reverting to the original notation The concentration profile thus obtained is plotted in Fig. 18.4-1. Once we have the complete concentration profile, we may evaluate other quantities, such as the average concentration in the liquid phase Also, the molar flux at the plane z = 0 can be found to be This result shows how the chemical reaction influences the rate of absorption of gas A by liquid B. The reader may wonder how the solubility cAo and the diffusivity QAB can be de- termined experimentally if there is a chemical reaction taking place. First, kr can be measured in a separate experiment in a well-stirred vessel. Then, in principle, cAO and 9AR can be obtained from the measured absorption rates for various liquid depths L. Estimate the effect of chemical reaction rate on the rate of gas absorption in an agitated tank (see Fig. 18.4-2). Consider a system in which the dissolved gas A undergoes an irreversible Gas with first order reaction with the liquid B; that is, A disappears within the liquid phase at a rate Chemical Reaction in proportional to the local concentration of A. An example of such a system is the absorption of an Agitated Tank2 SO, or H2S in aqueous NaOH solutions. E. W. Thiele, Ind. Eng. Chem., 31,916-920 (1939).

Gas-absorption apparatus. An exact analysis of this situation is not possible because of the complexity of the gas-absorp- tion process. However, a useful semiquantitative understanding can be obtained by the analysis of a relatively simple model. The model we use involves the following assumptions: Each gas bubble is surrounded by a stagnant liquid film of thickness 6, which is small relative to the bubble diameter. A quasi-steady concentration profile is quickly established in the liquid film after the bubble is formed. The gas A is only sparingly soluble in the liquid, so that we can neglect the convection term in Eq. 18.0-1. The liquid outside the stagnant film is at a concentration CA& which changes so slowly with respect to time that it can be considered constant. The differential equation describing the diffusion with chemical reaction is the same as that in Eq. 18.4-4, but the boundary conditions are now B.C. 1: B.C. 2: The concentration cA, is the interfacial concentration of A in the liquid phase, which is as- sumed to be at equilibrium with the gas phase at the interface, and cA, is the concentration of A in the main body of the liquid.

Next we use assumption (d) above and equate the amount of A entering the main body of liquid at z = S over the total bubble surface S in the tank to the amount of A consumed in the bulk of the liquid by chemical reaction: Substitution of cA from Eq. 18.4-15 into Eq. 18.4-16 gives an expression for B: B = 1 cash 4 + (V/SS)Q, sinh + When this result is substituted into Eq. 18.4-15, we obtain an expression for cA/cAO in terms of Q, and V/SS.

It is seen here that the dimensionless absorption rate per unit area of interface, I?, in- creases with + for all finite values of V/SS. At very low values of +-that is, for very slow re- actions-I? approaches zero. For this limiting situation the liquid is nearly saturated with dissolved gas, and the \"driving force\" for absorption is very small. At large values of 4 the di- mensionless surface mass flux N increases rapidly with 4 and becomes very nearly indepen- dent of V/SS. Under the latter circumstances, the reaction is so rapid that almost all of the dissolving gas is consumed within the film. Then B is very nearly zero, and the bulk of the liq- uid plays no significant role. In the limit as 4 becomes very large, I? approaches +. Somewhat more interesting behavior is observed for intermediate values of +. It may be noted that, for moderately large V/SS, there is a considerable range of + for which fi is very nearly unity. In this region the chemical reaction is fast enough to keep the bulk of the solu- tion almost solute free, but slow enough to have little effect on solute transport in the film. Such a situation will arise when the ratio V/SS of bulk to film volume is sufficient to offset the higher volumetric reaction rate in the film. The absorption rate is then equal to the physical absorption rate (that is, the rate for k',\" = 0) for a solute-free tank. This behavior is frequently observed in practice, and operation under such conditions has proven a useful means of char- acterizing the mass transfer behavior of a variety of gas absorbers.' 558 Chapter 18 Concentration Distributions in Solids and in Laminar Flow Fig. 18.5-1. Absorption of A into a falling film of liquid B. 518.5 DIFFUSION INTO A FALLING LIQUID FILM (GAS ABSORPTION)' In this section we present an illustration of forced-convection mass transfer, in which vis- cous flow and diffusion occur under such conditions that the velocity field can be con- sidered virtually unaffected by the diffusion. Specifically, we consider the absorption of gas A by a laminar falling film of liquid B. The material A is only slightly soluble in B, so that the viscosity of the liquid is unaffected. We shall make the further restriction that the diffusion takes place so slowly in the liquid film that A will not \"penetrate\" very far into the film-that is, that the penetration distance will be small in comparison with the film thickness. The system is sketched in Fig. 18.5-1. An example of this kind of system occurs in the absorption of 0, in H,O. Let us now set up the differential equations describing the diffusion process. First, we have to solve the momentum transfer problem to obtain the velocity profile vz(x) for the film; this has already been worked out in 52.2 in the absence of mass transfer at the fluid surface, and we know that the result is provided that \"end effects\" are ignored. Next we have to establish a mass balance on component A. We note that cA will be changing with both x and z. Hence, as the element of volume for the mass balance, we select the volume formed by the intersection of a slab of thickness Az with a slab of thick- ness Ax. Then the mass balance on A over this segment of a film of width W becomes Dividing by W Ax Az and performing the usual limiting process as the volume element becomes infinitesimally small, we get S. Lynn, J. R. Straatemeier, and H. Kramers, Chem. Engr. Sci., 4,4947 (1955). s18.5 Diffusion Into a Falling Liquid Film (Gas Absorption) 559 Into this equation we now insert the expression for NA, and NA,, making appropriate simplifications of Eq. 18.0-1. For the molar flux in the z direction, we write, assuming constant c, We discard the dashed-underlined term, since the transport of A in the z direction will be primarily by convection. We have made use of Eq. (M) in Table 17.8-1 and the fact that v is almost the same as vW in dilute solutions. The molar flux in the x direction is ~CA ~CA NAx = - + xA(NAx + NBx) -QAB -- (18.5-5) dx -----------..----- dx Here we neglect the dashed-underlined term because in the x direction A moves pre- dominantly by diffusion, there being almost no convective transport normal to the wall on account of the very slight solubility of A in B. Combining the last three equations, we then get for constant 9,, Finally, insertion of Eq. 18.5-1 for the velocity distribution gives as the differential equation for cA(x, z). Equation 18.5-7 is to be solved with the following boundary conditions: B.C. 1: atz=O, cA=O (18.5-8) B.C. 2: at x = 0, c, = c,, (18.5-9) B.C. 3: ~CA atx=6, -=O dx (18.5-10) The first boundary condition corresponds to the fact that the film consists of pure B at the top (Z = O), and the second indicates that at the liquid-gas interface the concentration of A is determined by the solubility of A in B (that is, cAo). The third boundary condition states that A cannot diffuse through the solid wall. This problem has been solved analytically in the form of an infinite series? but we do not give that solution here. Instead, we seek only a limiting expression valid for \"short contact times,\" that is, for small values of L/vm,,. If, as indicated in Fig. 18.5-1, the substance A has penetrated only a short distance into the film, then the species A \"has the impression\" that the film is moving throughout with a velocity equal to v,,,. Furthermore if A does not penetrate very far, it does not \"sense\" the presence of the solid wall at x = 6. Hence, if the film were of infinite thick- ness moving with the velocity v,,,, the diffusing material \"would not know the differ- ence.\" This physical argument suggests (correctly) that we will get a very good result if we replace Eq. 18.5-7 and its boundary conditions by B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: R. L. Pigford, PhD thesis, University of Illinois (1941). 560 Chapter 18 Concentration Distributions in Solids and in Laminar Flow An exactly analogous problem occurred in Example 4.1-1, which was solved by the method of combination of variables. It is therefore possible to take over the solution to that problem just by changing the notation. The solution is\" Then the total molar flow of A across the surface at x = 0 (i.e., being absorbed by a liquid film of length L and width W) is C A X X - = 1 - erf = erfc c~~ d49ABz/vrnax v4%ABz/vmax The same result is obtained by integrating the product vm,,cA over the flow cross section at z = L (see Problem 18C.3). Equation 18.5-18 shows that the mass transfer rate is directly proportional to the square root of the diffusivity and inversely proportional to the square root of the \"expo- sure time,\" texP = L/vrnax. This approach for studying gas absorption was apparently first proposed by Higbie.5 The problem discussed in this section illustrates the \"penetration model\" of mass transfer. This model is discussed further in Chapters 20 and 22. (18.5-16) Estimate the rate at which gas bubbles of A are absorbed by liquid B as the gas bubbles rise at their terminal velocity v, through a clean quiescent liquid. Gas Absorption from Rising Bubbles In these expressions \"erf x\" and \"erfc x\" are the \"error function\" and the \"complemen- tary error function\" of x, respectively. They are discussed in gC.6 and tabulated in stan- dard reference works4 Once the concentration profiles are known, the local mass flux at the gas-liquid in- terface may be found as follows: The solution is worked out in detail by the method of combination of variables in Example 4.1-1.

Ralph Wilmarth Higbie (190&1941), a graduate of the University of Michigan, provided the basis for the \"penetration model\" of mass transfer. He worked at E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc., and also at Eagle-Picher Lead Co.; then he taught at the University of Arkansas and the University of North Dakota. 518.5 Diffusion Into a Falling Liquid Film (Gas Absorption) 561 SOLUTION Liquid B Fig. 18.5-2. Absorption of gas A into liquid B. 3 Gas bubbles of moderate size, rising in liquids free of surface-active agents, undergo a toroidal circulation (Rybczynski-Hadamard circulation) as shown in Fig. 18.5-2. The liquid moves downward relative to each rising bubble, enriched in species A near the interface in the manner of the falling film in Fig. 18.5-1. The depth of penetration of the dissolved gas into the liquid is slight over the major part of the bubble, because of the motion of the liquid rela- tive to the bubble and because of the smallness of the liquid-phase diffusivity 9AB. Thus, as a rough approximation, we can use Eq. 18.5-18 to estimate the rate of gas absorption, replacing the exposure time t,,, = L/v,,, for the falling film by D/v, for the bubble, where D is the in- stantaneous bubble diameter. This gives an estimate5 of the molar absorption rate, averaged over the bubble surface, as I Here cAO is the solubility of gas A in liquid B at the interfacial temperature and partial pres- sure of gas A. Interestingly, the result in Eq. 18.5-19 turns out to be correct for potential flow of the liquid around the bubble (see Problem 4B.5). This equation has been approximately confirmed6 for gas bubbles 0.3 to 0.5 cm in diameter rising through carefully purified water. This system has also been analyzed for creeping flow7 and the result is (see Example 20.3-1) instead of Eq. 18.5-19. Trace amounts of surface-active agents cause a marked decrease in absorption rates from small bubbles, by forming a \"skin\" around each bubble and thus effectively preventing inter- nal circulation. The molar absorption rate in the small-diffusivity limit then becomes propor- tional to the $ power of the diffusivity, as for a solid sphere (see $3522.2 and 3). A similar approach has been used successfully for predicting mass transfer rates during drop formation at a capillary tip.8 D. Hammerton and F. H. Garner, Trans. Inst. Chem. Engrs.

Liquid B is flowing in laminar motion down a vertical wall as shown in Fig. 18.6-1. The film begins far enough up the wall so that v, depends only on y for z 0. For 0 < z < L the wall is made of a species A that is slightly soluble in B. For short distances downstream, species A will not diffuse very far into the falling film. That is, A will be present only in a very thin boundary layer near the solid surface. Therefore the diffusing A molecules will experience a velocity distribution that is charac- teristic of the falling film right next to the wall, y = 0. The velocity distribution is given in Eq. 2.2-18. In the present situation cos 8 = 1, and x = 6 - y, and At and adjacent to the wall (~/6)~ << (y/6), so that for this problem the velocity is, to a very good approximation, v, = (pg6/p)y = ay. This means that Eq. 18.5-6, which is ap- plicable here, becomes for short distances downstream ~CA d2cA ay- = 9,,- a2 ay2 where a = pg6/p. This equation is to be solved with the boundary conditions B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: In the second boundary condition, c,, is the solubility of A in B. The third boundary con- dition is used instead of the correct one (dc,/dy = 0 at y = 6), since for short contact times we feel intuitively that it will not make any difference. After all, since the mole- H. Kramers and P. J. Kreyger, Chem. Eng. Sci., 6,4248 (1956); see also R. L. Pigford, Chem. Eng. Puog.

The same kind of reasoning was encountered in Example 12.2-2 and Problem 12B.4. The form of the boundary conditions in Eqs. 18.6-3 to 5 suggests the method of com- bination of variables. Therefore we try cA/cAO = f($, where 7 = ~(a/99~,z)'/~. This com- bination of the independent variables can be shown to be dimensionless, and the factor of \"9\" is included to make the solution look neater. When this change of variable is made, the partial differential equation in Eq. 18.6-2 reduces to an ordinary differential equation with the boundary conditions f(0) = 1 and f(w) = 0. This second-order equation, which is of the form of Eq. C.1-9, has the solution The constants of integration can then be evaluated using the boundary conditions, and one obtains finally I I for the concentration profiles, in which ~(2) = 0.8930 . . . is the gamma function of $. Next the local mass flux at the wall can be obtained as follows Then the molar flow of A across the entire mass transfer surface at y = 0 is where I?($) = 4 r($) = 1.1907. . . . The problem discussed in 518.5 and the one discussed here are examples of two types of asymptotic solutions that are discussed further in 920.2 and 520.3 and again in Chapter 22. It is therefore important that these two problems be thoroughly understood. Note that in s18.5, wA K (QAB~)1/2, whereas in this section wA cc (%AB~)2'3. The differences in the ex- ponents reflect the nature of the velocity gradient at the mass transfer interface: in 518.5, the velocity gradient was zero, whereas in this section, the velocity gradient is nonzero. 518.7 DIFFUSION AND CHEMICAL REACTION INSIDE A POROUS CATALYST Up to this point we have discussed diffusion in gases and liquids in systems of simple geometry. We now wish to apply the shell mass balance method and Fick's first law to describe diffusion within a porous catalyst pellet. We make no attempt to describe the 564 Chapter 18 Concentration Distributions in Solids and in Laminar Flow I Concentration at concentrations CAR and CB K CAR lyst Fig. 18.7-1.

Pores in the catalyst, in which diffusion and chemical reac- tion occur. diffusion inside the tortuous void passages in the pellet. Instead, we describe the \"aver- aged diffusion of the reactant in terms of an \"effective diff~sivity.\"',~,~ Specifically, we consider a spherical porous catalyst particle of radius R, as shown in Fig. 18.7-1. This particle is in a catalytic reactor, where it is submerged in a gas stream containing the reactant A and the product B. In the neighborhood of the surface of the particular catalyst particle under consideration, we presume that the concentration is cA, moles of A per unit volume. Species A diffuses through the tortuous passages in the cata- lyst and is converted to B on the catalytic surfaces, as sketched in Fig. 18.7-2. We start by making a mass balance for species A on a spherical shell of thickness Ar within a single catalyst particle: Here NAr(, is the number of moles of A passing in the r direction through an imaginary spherical surface at a distance r from the center of the sphere. The source term X, . 4m2Ar is the molar rate of production of A by chemical reaction in the shell of thickness Ar. Dividing by 437 Ar and letting Ar -+ 0 gives or, using the definition of the first derivative, This limiting process is clearly in conflict with the fact that the porous medium is granu- lar rather than continuous. Consequently, in Eq. 18.7-3 the symbols NAu and RA cannot be interpreted as quantities having a meaningful value at a point. Rather we have to inter- pret them as quantities averaged over a small neighborhood of the point in question-a neighborhood small with respect to the dimension R, but large with respect to the di- mensions of the passages within the porous particle.

Wheeler, Advances in Catalysis, Academic Press, New York (1950), Vol. 3, pp. 250-326. 518.7 Diffusion and Chemical Reaction Inside a Porous Catalyst 565 We now define an \"effective diffusivity\" for species A in the porous medium by in which cA is the concentration of the gas A contained within the pores. The effective diffusivity 9, must be measured experimentally. It depends generally on pressure and temperature and also on the catalyst pore structure. The actual mechanism for diffusion in pores is complex, since the pore dimensions may be smaller than the mean free path of the diffusing molecules. We do not belabor the question of mechanism here but as- sume only that Eq. 18.7-4 can adequately represent the diffusion process (see 524.6). When the preceding expression is inserted into Eq. 18.7-3, we get, for constant diffusivity We now consider the situation where species A disappears according to a first-order chemical reaction on the catalytic surfaces that form all or part of the \"walls\" of the winding passages. Let a be the available catalytic surface per unit volume (of solids + voids). Then RA = -k','acA, and Eq. 18.7-5 becomes (see Eq. C.l-6) This equation is to be solved with the boundary conditions that cA = cA, at r = R, and that cA is finite at r = 0. Equations containing the operator (1/r2)(d/dr)[r2(d/dr)l can frequently be solved by using a \"standard trick-namely, a change of variable cA/cA, = (1 /r)f(r). The equation for f(r) is then This is a standard second-order differential equation, which can be solved in terms of ex- ponential~ or hyperbolic functions. When it is solved and the result divided by r we get the following solution of Eq. 18.7-6 in terms of hyperbolic functions (see 5C.5): Application of the boundary conditions gives finally In studies on chemical kinetics and catalysis one is frequently interested in the molar flux NAX or the molar flow WAR at the surface r = R: When Eq. 18.7-9 is used in this expression, we get This result gives the rate of conversion (in moles/sec) of A to B in a single catalyst particle of radius R in terms of the parameters describing the diffusion and reaction processes. 566 Chapter 18 Concentration Distributions in Solids and in Laminar Flow If the catalytically active surface were all exposed to the stream of concentration c,,, then the species A would not have to diffuse through the pores to a reaction site. The molar rate of conversion would then be given by the product of the available surface and the surface reaction rate: WAR,, = ($d3)(a)( -k;cAR> (18.7-12) Taking the ratio of the last two equations, we get TIA=-=-(4 W~R coth 4 - 1) w~~,~ 42 in which 4 = -R is the Thiele modulus,l encountered in s18.4. The quantity 7, is called the efectiveness factor.'-4 It is the quantity by which WAR,, has to be multiplied to ac- count for the intraparticle diffusional resistance to the overall conversion process. For nonspherical catalyst particles, the foregoing results may be applied approxi- mately by reinterpreting R. We note that for a sphere of radius R the ratio of volume to external surface is R/3. For nonspherical particles, we redefine R in Eq. 18.7-13 as where Vp and S, are the volume and external surface of a single catalyst particle. The ab- solute value of the conversion rate is then given approximately by in which the quantity A = -(V,/S,) is a generalized mod~lus.~,~ The particular utility of the quantity A may be seen in Fig. 18.7-3. It is clear that when the exact theoretical expressions for 17, are plotted as functions of A, the curves Fig. 18.7-3. Effectiveness factors for porous solid catalysts of various shapes [R.

To illustrate the setting up of multi- component diffusion problems for gases, we rework the initial evaporation problem of 518.2 when liquid water (species 1) is evaporating into air, regarded as a binary mixture of nitrogen (2) and oxygen (3) at 1 atrn and 352K. We take the air-water interface to be at z = 0 and the top end of the diffusion tube to be at z = L. We consider the vapor pressure of water to be known, so that x, is known at z = 0 (that is, x,, = 341/760 = 0.449), and the mole fractions of all three gases are known at z = L: x,, = 0.10, x,, = 0.75, x,, = 0.15. The diffusion tube has a length L = 11.2 cm. The conservation of mass leads, as in 518.2, to the following expressions: From this it may be concluded that the molar fluxes of the three species are all constants at steady state. Since species 2 and 3 are not moving, we conclude that N2, and N3, are both zero. Next we need the expressions for the molar fluxes from Eq. 17.9-1. Since x, + x2 + x, = 1, we need only two of the three available equations, and we select the equations for species 2 and 3. Since N2, = 0 and N,, = 0, these equations simplify considerably: Note that the diffusivity Enz3 does not appear here, because there is no relative motion of species 2 and 3. These equations can be integrated from an arbitrary height z to the top of the tube at L, to give for constant ~9,~ Integration then gives and the mole fraction profile of water vapor in the diffusion column will be I I When we apply the boundary condition at z = 0, we get which is a transcendental equation for N,,. 568 Chapter 18 Concentration Distributions in Solids and in Laminar Flow According to Reid, Prausnitz, and poling,' 9,, = 0.364 cm2/s and Q13 = 0.357 cm2/s at 352K and 1 atm. At these conditions c = 3.46 X lov5 g-moles/cm3. To get a quick solu- tion to Eq. 18.8-9, we take both diffusivities to be equal2 to 0.36 cm2/s. Then we get 0.449 = 1 - 0.90 exp - Nlz(l 1.2) ( (3.462 X 10-~)(0.36) from which we find that N,, = 5.523 X g-moles/cm2 s. This can be used as a first guess in solving Eq. 18.8-9 more exactly, if desired. Then the entire profiles can be calcu- lated from Eqs. 18.8-6 to 8. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1.

Two-bulb experiment for measuring gas diffusivity-quasi-steady-state analysis6 (Fig. 18B.6). One way of measuring gas diffusivities is by means of a two-bulb experiment. The left bulb and the tube from z = - L to z = 0 are filled with gas A. The right bulb and the tube from z = 0 to z = +L are filled with gas B. At time t = 0 the stopcock is opened, and diffusion begns; then the concentrations of A in the two well-stirred bulbs change. One measures xi as a function of time, and from this deduces 9,,. We wish to derive the equations describing the diffusion. Since the bulbs are large compared with the tube, xi and xi change very slowly with time. Hence the diffusion in the tube can be treated as a quasi-steady-state problem, with the boundary conditions that x, = xi and z = -L, and that x, = xi at z = +L.

Method for separating helium from natural gas (Fig. 18B.8). Pyrex glass is almost imperme- able to all gases but helium. For example, the diffusivity of He through pyrex is about 25 times the diffusivity of Hz through pyrex, hydrogen being the closest \"competitor\" in the dif- fusion process. This fact suggests that a method for separating helium from natural gas could be based on the relative diffusion rates through pyre^.^ Suppose a natural gas mixture is contained in a pyrex tube with dimensions shown in the figure.

In studying the rate of leaching of a substance A from solid par- ticles by a solvent B, we may postulate that the rate-controlling step is the diffusion of A from the particle surface through a stagnant liquid film thickness 6 out into the main stream. The molar solubility of A in B is c,,, and the concentration in the main stream is c,,.

Toluene (1) and ethanol (2) are evaporating at z = 0 in a vertical tube, from a binary liquid mixture of uniform composition x, through stagnant nitro- gen (3), with pure nitrogen at the top. The unequal diffusivities of toluene and ethanol through nitrogen shift the relative evaporation rates in favor of ethanol. Analyze this effect for an isothermal system at 60 F and 760 mm Hg total pressure, if the predicted8 diffusivities at 60\" F are cg12 = 1.53 X BI3 = 2.98 X cg2, = 4.68 X g-moles/cm s. (a) Use the Maxwell-Stefan equations to obtain the steady-state vapor-phase mole fraction pro- files y,(z) in terms of the molar fluxes No, in this ternary system. The molar fluxes are known to be constants from the equations of continuity for the three species. Since nitrogen has a negligible solubility in the liquid at the conditions given, N,, = 0. As boundary conditions, set y1 = y2 = 0 at z = L, and let y, = ylo and y2 = y2, at z = 0; the latter values remain to be determined. Show that A suggested strategy for the calculation is as follows: (i) guess a liquid composition x,; (ii) cal- culate ylof y2,, and y3, using lines 2 and 3 of the table; (iii) calculate A from Eq. 18B.10-l, with z = 0; (iv) use the result of iii to calculate LN2,, LB, LC, and LD, and finally yl (0) for assumed values of LN,,; (v) interpolate the results of iv toy, (0) = y,, to obtain the correct LN,, and LN,, for the guessed x,. Repeat steps i-v with improved guesses for x, until N,,/(N,, + N,,) con- verges to x,. The final x, is the constant evaporating composition. (b) A constant evaporating liquid mixture is one whose composition is the same as that of the evaporated material, that is, for which N,,/(N1, + N,) = x,. Use the results of part (a) along with the equilibrium data in the table below to calculate the constant-evaporating liquid com- position at a total pressure of 760 mm Hg. In the table, row I gives liquid-phase compositions. Row I1 gives vapor-phase compositions in two-component experiments; these are expressed as nitrogen-free values yl/(y, + y2) for the ternary system. Row I11 gives the sum of the partial pressures of toluene and ethanol. 18B.11. Diffusion with fast second-order reaction (Figs. 18.2-2 and 18B.11). A solid A is dissolving in a flowing liquid stream S in a steady-state, isothermal flow system.

(a) Develop an expression for the rate of dissolution of A into the liquid if the concentration of A in the main liquid stream is negligible. (b) Develop a corresponding expression for the dissolution rate if the liquid contains a sub- stance B, which, at the plane z = ~6, reacts instantaneously and irreversibly with A: A + B + P.

In the oxidation of most metals (excluding the alkali and aIka- line-earth metals) the volume of oxide produced is greater than that of the metal consumed. This oxide thus tends to form a compact film, effectively insulating the oxygen and metal from each other. For the derivations that follow, it may be assumed that (a) For oxidation to proceed, oxygen must diffuse through the oxide film and that this diffu- sion follows Fick's law. (b) The free surface of the oxide film is saturated with oxygen from the surrounding air. (c) Once the film of oxide has become reasonably thick, the oxidation becomes diffusion con- trolled; that is, the dissolved oxygen concentration is essentially zero at the oxide-metal surface. (dl The rate of change of dissolved oxygen content of the film is small compared to the rate of reaction. That is, quasi-steady-state conditions may be assumed. (e) The reaction involved is ~XO, + M + MO,. We wish to develop an expression for rate of tarnishing in terms of oxygen diffusivity through the oxide film, the densities of the metal and its oxide, and the stoichiometry of the reaction. Let c, be the solubility of oxygen in the film, cf the molar density of the film, and zf the thickness of the film. Show that the film thickness is This result, the so-called \"quadratic law,\" gives a satisfactory empirical correlation for a num- ber of oxidation and other tarnishing reactions.1° Most such reactions are, however, much more complex than the mechanism given above.'' lo G.

Diffusion and heterogeneous reaction in a slender cylindrical tube with a closed end (Fig. 18B.15). A slender cylindrical pore of length L, cross-sectional area Sf and perimeter P, is in contact at its open end with a large body of well-mixed fluid, consisting of species A and B. Species A, a minor constituent of this fluid, disappears into the pore, diffuses in the z direc- tion and reacts on its walls. The rate of this reaction may be expressed as (n . n,)l,,,,,, = f(oA,); that is, at the wall the mass flux normal to the surface is some function of the mass fraction, WA~, of A in the fluid adjacent to the solid surface. The mass fraction w, depends on z, the dis- tance from the inlet.

Under suitable circumstances the rate of oxygen metabolism by bacterial cells is very nearly zero order with respect to oxygen concentration. We examine such a case here and focus our attention on a spherical aggregate of cells, which has a radius R. We wish to determine the total rate of oxygen uptake by the aggregate as a function of aggregate size, oxygen mass concentration po at the aggregate surface, the meta- bolic activity of the cells, and the diffusional behavior of the oxygen. For simplicity we con- sider the aggregate to be homogeneous. We then approximate the metabolic rate by an effective volumetric reaction rate rO2 = -k! and the diffusional behavior by Fick's law, with an effective pseudobinary diffusivity BO2,. Because the solubility of oxygen is very low in this system, both convective oxygen transport and transient effects may be neglected.12 l2 J. A. Mueller, W. C. Boyle, and E. N.

In this chapter we start by making a mass bal- ance over an arbitrary differential fluid element to establish the equation of continuity for the various species in a multicomponent mixture. Then insertion of mass flux ex- pressions gives the diffusion equations in a variety of forms. These diffusion equations can be used to set up any of the problems in Chapter 18 and more complicated ones as well. Then we summarize all of the equations of change for mixtures: the equations of continuity, the equation of motion, and the equation of energy. These include the equa- tions of change that were given in Chapters 3 and 11. Next we summarize the flux ex- pressions for mixtures. All these equations are given in general form, although for problem solving we generally use simplified versions of them. The remainder of the chapter is devoted to analytical solutions and dimensional analyses of mass transfer systems. 519.1 THE EQUATIONS OF CONTINUITY FOR A MULTICOMPONENT MIXTURE In this section we apply the law of conservation of mass to each species a in a mixture, where a = 1,2,3, . . . , N. The system we consider is a volume element Ax Ay Az fixed in space, through which the fluid mixture is flowing (see Fig. 3.1-1). Within this mixture, re- actions among the various chemical species may be occurring, and we use the symbol r, to indicate the rate at which species a is being produced, with dimensions of mass/vol- ume time. The various contributions to the mass balance are rate of increase of mass of (dp,/Jt)~x ~y AZ a in the volume element rate of addition of mass of nffrlx AY a across face at x 519.1 The Equations of Continuity for a Multicomponent Mixture 583 rate of removal of mass of n,,l,+~, 4 Az a across face at x + Ax rate of production of mass of r,Ax Ay Az a by chemical reactions The combined mass flux n,, includes both the molecular flux and the convective flux. There are also addition and removal terms in the y and z directions. When the entire mass balance is written down and divided by Ax Ay Az, one obtains, after letting the size of the volume element decrease to zero, This is the equation of continuity for species a in a multicomponent reacting mixture. It de- scribes the change in mass concentration of species a with time at a fixed point in space by the diffusion and convection of a, as well as by chemical reactions that produce or consume a. The quantities n,,, n,,, n,, are the Cartesian components of the mass flux vec- tor n, = p,v, given in Eq. (D) of Table 17.8-1. Equation 19.1-5 may be rewritten in vector notation as Alternatively we can use Eq. (S) of Table 17.8-1 to write I rate of net rate of net rate of rate of increase addition addition production of mass of mass of of mass of of mass of of A per A per unit A per unit A per unit unit volume by volume by volume by volume convection diffusion reaction Addition of all N equations in either Eq. 19.1-6 or 7 gives which is the equation of continuity for the mixture. This equation is identical to the equation of continuity for a pure fluid given in Eq. 3.1-4. In obtaining Eq. 19.1-8 we had to use Eq. (J) of Table 17.8-1 and also the fact that the law of conservation of total mass gives Car, = 0. Finally we note that Eq. 19.1-8 becomes for a fluid mixture of constant mass density p. In the preceding discussion we used mass units. However, a corresponding deriva- tion is also possible in molar units. The equation of continuity for species a in molar quantities is ' J.

To get this we used Eq. (M) of Table 17.8-1. We also note that the chemical reaction term does not drop out because the number of moles is not necessarily conserved in a chemical reaction. Finally we note that for a fluid mixture of constant molar density c. We have thus seen that the equation of continuity for species a may be written in two forms, Eq. 19.1-7 and Eq. 19.1-11. Using the continuity relations in Eqs. 19.1-8 and 19.1-12 the reader may verify that the equation of continuity for species a! can be put into two additional, equivalent forms: These two equations express exactly the same physical content, but they are written in two different sets of notation-the first in mass quantities and the second in molar quan- tities. To use these equations we have to insert the appropriate expressions for the fluxes and the chemical reaction terms. In this chapter we give only the results for binary sys- tems with constant p%,,, with constant or with zero velocity. Binary Systems with Constant p9lAB For this assumption, Eq. 19.1-14 becomes, after inserting Fick's law from Eq. (A) of Table 17.8-2, with a corresponding equation for species B. This equation is appropriate for describing the diffusion in dilute liquid solutions at constant temperature and pressure. The left side can be written as pDoA/Dt. Equation 9.1-16 without the r, term is of the same form as Eq. 11.2-8 or 9. This similarity is quite important, since it is the basis for the analogies that are frequently drawn between heat and mass transport in flowing fluids with con- stant physical properties. s19.1 The Equations of Continuity for a Multicomponent Mixture 585 Binary Systems with Constant &,, For this assumption, Eq. 19.1-15 becomes, after inserting Fick's law from Eq. (B) of Table 17.8-2, with a corresponding equation for species B. This equation is useful for low-density gases at constant temperature and pressure. The left side can not be written as cDx,/Dt be- cause of the appearance of v\" rather than v. Binary Systems with Zero Velocity If there are no chemical reactions occurring, then the chemical production terms are all zero. If, in addition v is zero and p constant in Eq. 19.1-16, or v\" is zero and c constant in Eq. 19.1-17, then we get which is called Fick's second law of diffusion, or sometimes simply the diffusion equation. This equation is usually used for diffusion in solids or stationary liquids (that is, v = 0 in Eq. 19.1-16) and for equimolar counter-diffusion in gases (that is, v\" = 0 in Eq. 19.1-17). By equimolar counter-diffusion we mean that the net molar flux with respect to stationary coordinates is zero; in other words, that for every mole of A that moves, say, in the posi- tive z direction, there is a mole of B that moves in the negative z direction. Note that Eq. 19.1-18 has the same form as the heat conduction equation in Eq. 11.2-10. This similarity is the basis for analogies between many heat conduction and diffusion problems in solids. Keep in mind that many hundreds of problems described by Fick's second law have been solved. Solutions are tabulated in the monographs of Crank1 and of Carslaw and Jaeger.' In Tables B-10 and 11 we give Eq. 19.1-14 (multicomponent equation of continuity in terms of j,) and Eq. 19.1-16 (binary diffusion equation for constant p and '?JAB) in the three standard coordinate systems. Other forms of the equation of continuity can be pat- terned after these. In Fig. 19.1-1 we show a system in which a liquid, B, moves slowly upward through a slightly soluble porous plug of A. Then A slowly disappears by a first-order reaction after it has dis- solved. Find the steady-state concentration profile c,(~), where z is the coordinate upward and Chemical Reaction3 from the plug. Assume that the velocity profile is approximately flat across the tube. Assume further that CAO is the solubility of unreacted A in B. Neglect temperature effects associated with the heat of reaction. SOLUTION Equation 19.1-16 is appropriate for dilute liquid solutions. Dividing this equation by the mol- ecular weight MA and specializing for the one-dimensional steady-state problem at hand, we get for constant p: H. S. Carslaw and J. C.

A trial function CA = eaz leads to two values of a, one of which violates the boundary con- dition at z = a. The final solution is then This example illustrates the use of the equation of continuity of A for setting up a diffusion problem with convection and chemical reaction. 519.2 SUMMARY OF THE MULTICOMPONENT EQUATIONS OF CHANGE In the three main parts of this book we have by stages introduced the conservation laws known as the equations of change. In Chapter 3 conservation of mass and conservation of momentum in pure fluids were presented. In Chapter 11 we added the conservation of energy in pure fluids. In 519.1 we added mass conservation equations for the various species present. We now want to summarize the conservation equations for multicom- ponent systems. We start, in Table 19.2-1, by giving the equations of change for a mixture of N chemical species in terms of the combined fluxes with respect to stationary axes. The equation num- bers indicate where each equation first appeared. By tabulating the equations of change in this way, we can gain an appreciation for the unity of the subject. The only assumption made here is that all the species are acted on by the same external force per unit mass, g; note (b) of Table 19.2-1 explains the modifications needed when this is not the case. The important feature of these equations is that they are all of the form rate of net rate rate of increase of = of addition + production (19.2-1) {entity ] [ofentity ] jOf entity ] in which \"entity\" stands for mass, momentum, or energy, respectively. In each equation the net rate of addition of the entity per unit volume is the negative of a divergence term. The \"rates of production\" arise from chemical reactions in the first equation and from the external force field in the other two. Each equation is a statement of a conservation law. Usually we think of the conservation statements as laws that have gradually 519.2 Summary of the Multicomponent Equations of Change 587 Table 19.2-1 Equations of Change for Multicomponent Mixtures in Terms of the Combined Fluxes Mass of a: d pw, = -(V . nu) + r, (a = 1,2, ...,A9 at Momentum: d pv = -[V.+] + pg dt (A)\" (Eq. 19.1-6) Energy: d-' Zp(u + :v2) = -(V.e) + (pv-g) (CIb (Eq. 11.1-6) \" When all N equations of continuity are added, the equation of continuity for the fluid mixture is obtained. Here v is the mass average velocity defined in Eq. 17.7-1. If species a is acted on by a force per unit volume given by L, then pg has to be replaced by X,p,g, in Eq. (B), and (pv . g) has to be replaced by ZJn, g,) in Eq. (C). These replacements are required, for example, if some of the species are ions with different charges on them, acted on by an electric field. Problems of this sort are discussed in Chapter 24. evolved by experience and experiment and therefore are generally accepted by the scien- tific community.' The three \"combined fluxes,\" which appear in Eqs. (A) to (C) of Table 19.2-1, can be written as the convective fluxes plus the molecular (or diffusive) fluxes. These various fluxes are displayed in Table 19.2-2, where the equation numbers corresponding to their first appearance are given. When the flux expressions of Table 19.2-2 are substituted into the conservation equations of Table 19.2-1 and then converted to the D/Dt form by means of Eqs. 3.5-4 and 5, we get the multicomponent equations of change in their usual forms. These are tabulated in Table 19.2-3. In addition to these conservation equations, one needs also to have the expressions for the fluxes in terms of the gradients and the transport properties (the latter being func- tions of temperature, density, and composition). Finally one nceds Aalso the thermal equation of state, p = p(p, T, x,), and the caloric equation of state, U = U(p, T, x,), and in- formation about the rates of any homogeneous chemical reactions occurring2 Actually the conservation laws for energy, momentum, and angular momentum follow from Lagrange's equation of motion, together with the homogeneity of time, the homogeneity of space, and the isotropy of space, respectively (Noether's theorem). Thus there is something very fundamental about these conservation laws, more than is apparent at first sight. For more on this, see L. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, Mechanics, Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass. (1960), Chapter 2, and Emrny Noether, Nachr. Kgl. Ges. Wiss. Gottingen (Math.-phys. Kl.) (19181, pp. 235-257. Amalie Emmy Noether (1882-1935), after doing the doctorate at the University of Erlangen, was a protkgke of Hilbert in Gottingen until Hitler's purge of 1933 forced her to move to the United States, where she became a professor of mathematics at Bryn Mawr College; a crater on the moon is named after her. One might wonder whether or not we need separate equations of motion and energy for species a. Such equations can be derived by continuum arguments, but the species momentum and energy fluxes are not measurable quantities and molecular theory is required in order to clarify their meanings. These separate species equations are not needed for solving transport problems. However, the species equations of motion have been helpful for deriving kinetic expressions for the mass fluxes in multicomponent systems [see C. F. Curtiss and R. B. Bird, Proc. Nut. Acad. Sci. USA, 93,7440-7445 (1996) and I. Chem.

See note (b) of Table 19.2-1 for the modifications needed when the various species are acted on by different forces. We conclude this discussion with a few remarks about special forms of the equa- tions of motion and energy. In 511.3 it was pointed out that the equation of motion as pre- sented in Chapter 3 is in suitable form for setting up forced-convection problems, but that an alternate form (Eq. 11.3-2) is desirable for displaying explicitly the buoyant forces resulting from temperature inequalities in the system. In binary systems with concentra- tion inequalities as well as temperature inequalities, we write the equation of motion as in Eq. (B) of Table 3.5-1 and use an approximate equation of state formed by making a double Taylor expansion of p(T, w,) about the state &: 519.2 Summary of the Multicomponent Equations of Change 589 Table 19.2-4 The Equations of Energy for Multicomponent Systems, with Gravity as the Only External Forcearb H, a For multicomponent mixtures q = -kVT + - j, + q'\"', where q'\" is a usually negligible term w=l M, associated with the diffusion-thermo effect (see Eq. 24.2-6).

Here the coefficient 5 = -(l /p)(dp/doA) evaluated at T and relates the density to the composition. This coefficient is the mass transfer analog of the coefficient p introduced in Eq. 11.3-1. When this approximate equation of state is substituted into the pg term (but not into the pDv/Dt term) of the equation of motion, we get the Boussinesq equation of motion for a binary mixture, with gravity as the only external force: The last two terms in this equation describe the buoyant force resulting from the temper- ature and composition variations within the fluid. Next we turn to the equation of energy. Recall that in Table 11.4-1 the energy equation for pure fluids was given in a variety of forms. The same can be done for mixtures, and a representative selection of the many possible forms of this equation is given in Table 19.2-4. Note that it is not necessary to add a term S, (as we did in Chapter 10) to describe the thermal energy released by homogeneous chemical reactions. This information is in- cluded implicitly in the functions H and k and appears explicitly as -xaEa~, and -X,U,R, in Eqs. (F) and (G). Remember that in calculating H and fi/ the energies of for- mation and mixing of the various species must be included (see Example 23.5-1). 590 Chapter 19 Equations of Change for Multicomponent Systems 519.3 SUMMARY OF THE MULTICOMPONENT FLUXES The equations of change have been given in terms of the fluxes of mass, momentum, and energy. To solve these equations, we have to replace the fluxes by expressions involving the transport properties and the gradients of concentration, velocity, and temperature. Here we summarize the flux expressions for mixtures: Mass: jA = -p9ARV~A binary only Momentum: 7 = -,u[Vv + (vv)~] + ($,u - K)(V v)S Energy: Now we append a few words of explanation: a. The mass flux expression given here is for binary mixtures only. For multicom- ponent gas mixtures at moderate pressures, we can use the Maxwell-Stefan equations of Eq. 17.9-1. There are additional contributions to the mass flux cor- responding to driving forces other than the concentration gradients: forced difu- sion, which occurs when the various species are subjected to different external forces; pressure diffusion, proportional to Vp; and thermal diffusion, proportional to VT. These other diffusion mechanisms, the first two of which can be quite important, are covered in Chapter 24. b. The momentum flux expression is the same for multicomponent mixtures as for pure fluids. Once again we point out that the contribution containing the dilata- tional viscosity K is seldom important. Of course, for polymers and other vis- coelastic fluids, Eq. 19.3-2 has to be replaced by more complex models, as explained in Chapter 8. c. The energy-flux expression given here for multicomponent fluids consists of two terms: the first term is the heat transport by conduction which was given for pure materials in Eq. 9.1-4, and the second term describes the heat transport by each of the diffusing species. The quantity is the partial molar enthalpy of species a. There is actually one further contribution to the energy flux, related to a concen- tration driving force-usually quite small-and this diffusion-thermo effect will be discussed in Chapter 24. The thermal conductivity of a mixture-the k in Eq. 19.3-3-is defined as the proportionality constant between the heat flux and the temperature gradient in the absence of any mass fluxes. We conclude this discussion with a few comments about the combined energy flux e. By substituting Eq. 19.3-3 into Eq. (C) of Table 19.2-2, we get after some minor rearranging: In some situations, notably in films and low-velocity boundary layers, the contributions ipv2v and [T . V] are negligible. Then the dashed-underlined terms may be discarded. This leads to 919.3 Summary of the Multicomponent Fluxes 591 Then use of Eqs. (G) and (H) of Table 17.8-1 leads finally to Finally, for ideal gas mixtures, this expression can be further simplified by replacing the partial molar enthalpies by the molar enthalpies &. Equation 19.3-6 provides a stan- dard starting point for solving one-dimensional problems in simultaneous heat and mass transfer.' The partial molar enthalpy E,, which appears in Eqs. 19.3-3 and 19.3-6, is defined for a multi- component mixture as The Partial Molar , ~ Enthalp y in which n, is the number of moles of species a in the mixture, and the subscript np indicates that the derivative is to be taken holding the number or moles of each species other than a constant. The enthalpy H(n,, n,, n,, . . .) is an \"extensive property,\" since, if the number of moles of each component is multiplied by k, the enthalpy itself will be multiplied by k: H(kn,, kn,, kn,, . a) = kH(n,, n,, n,, . .) (19.3-8) Mathematicians refer to this kind of function as being \"homogeneous of degree 1.\" For such functions Euler's theorem2 can be used to conclude that (a) Prove that, for a binary mixture, the partial molar enthalpies at a given mole fraction can be determined by plotting the enthalpy per mole as a function of mole fraction, and then de- termining the intercepts of the tangent drawn at the mole fraction in question (see Fig. 19.3-1). This shows one way to get the partial molar enthalpy from data on the enthalpy of the mixture. (b) How else could one get the partial molar enthalpy? Fig. 19.3-1.

Thomas Kilgore Sherwood (1903-1976) was a professor at MIT for nearly 40 years, and then taught at the University of California in Berkeley. Because of his many contributions to the field of mass transfer, the Sherwood number (Sh) was named after him. M. D. Greenberg, Foundations of Applied Mathematics, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. (1978), p. 128; R. J. Silbey and R. A. Alberty, Physical Chemistry, 3rd edition, Wiley, New York (2001), §§1.10,4.9, and 6.10. 592 Chapter 19 Equations of Change for Multicomponent Systems SOLUTION (a) Throughout this example, for brevity we omit the subscripts p, T indicating that these quantities are held constant. First we write expressions for the intercepts as follows: in which H = H/(nA + n,) = H/n. To verify the correctness of Eq. 19.3-10, we rewrite the ex- pression in terms of H: NOW the expression HA = (dH/dnA),B implies that H is a function of nA and nB, whereas (dH/dxA), implies that His a function of x, and n. The relation between these kinds of deriva- tives is given by the chain rule of partial differentiation. To apply this rule we need the rela- tion between the independent variables, which, in this problem, are Therefore we may write Substitution of this into Eq. 19.3-12 and use of Euler's theorem (H = nAEA + n,~,) then gives an identity. This proves the validity of Eq. 19.3-10, and the correctness of Eq. 19.3-11 can be proved similarly. (b) One can also get HA by using the definition in Eq. 19.3-7 and measuring the slope of the curve of H versus n~, holding n, constant. One can also get HA by measuring the enthalpy of mixing and using Often the enthalpy of mixing is neglected and the enthalpies of the pure substances are given as = cPA(~ - T\") and a similar expression for i?,. This is a standard assumption for gas mixtures at low to moderate pressures. Other methods for evaluating partial molar quantities may be found in current textbooks on thermodynamics. 519.4 USE OF THE EQUATIONS OF CHANGE FOR MIXTURES The equations of change in 519.2 can be used to solve all the problems of Chapter 18, and more difficult ones as well. Unless the problems are idealized or simplified, mixture transport phenomena are quite complicated and usually numerical techniques are re- quired. Here we solve a few introductory problems by way of illustration. (a) Develop expressions for the mole fraction profile x,(y) and the temperature profile T(y) for the system pictured in Fig. 19.4-1, given the mole fractions and temperatures at both film Simulfaneous Heat and boundaries (y = 0 and y = 6).

Cold surface . properties to be constant, evaluated at some mean temperature and composition. Neglect ra- diative heat transfer. (b) Generalize the result for the situation where both A and B are condensing on the wall, and allow for unequal film thicknesses for heat and mass transport. (a) To determine the desired quantities, we must solve the equations of continuity and en- ergy for this system. Simplification of Eq. 19.1-10 and Eq. C of Table 19.2-1 for steady, one- dimensional transport, in the absence of chemical reactions and external forces, gives Continuity of A: Energy: Therefore, both NAY and e, are constant throughout the film. To determine the mole fraction profile, we need the molar flux for diffusion of A through stagnant B: Insertion of Eq. 19.4-3 into Eq. 19.4-1 and integration gives the mole fraction profile (see 918.2) Here we have taken to be constant, at the value for the mean film temperature. We can then evaluate the constant flux NAY from Eqs. 19.4-3 and 4: Note that NAY is negative because species A is condensing. The last two expressions may be combined to put the concentration profiles in an alternative form: 594 Chapter 19 Equations of Change for Multicomponent Systems To get the temperature profile, we use the energy flux from Eq. 19.3-6 for an ideal gas along with Eq. 9.8-8: Here we have chosen To as the reference temperature for the enthalpy. Insertion of this ex- pression for e, into Eq. 19.4-2 and integration between the limits T = To at y = 0, and T = T, at y = 6 gives It can be seen that the temperature profile is not linear for this system except in the limit as NA,&/k + 0. Note the similarity between Eqs. 19.4-6 and 8. The conduction energy flux at the wall is greater here than in the absence of mass trans- fer. Thus, using a superscript zero to indicate the conditions in the absence of mass transfer, we may write We see then that the rate of heat transfer is directly affected by simultaneous mass transfer, whereas the mass flux is not directly affected by simultaneous heat transfer. In applications at temperatures below the normal boiling point of species A, the quantity ~,,&/k is small, and the right side of Eq. 19.4-9 is very nearly unity (see Problem 19A.1). The interaction between heat and mass transfer is further discussed in Chapter 22. (b) If both A and B are condensing at the wall, then Eqs. 19.4-1 and 2, when integrated, lead to NAY = NAO and e, = e,, where the subscript \"0\" quantities are evaluated at y = 0. We also in- tegrate the analog of Eq. 19.4-1 for B to get N,, = NBo and obtain In the second of these equations, we replace HA by ?,*(T - To) and by $. (T - To), and since the reference temperature is To, we may replace e, by q,, the conductive heat flux at the wall. In the first equation, we subtract xAO(NAO + NBO) from both sides to make the equation similar in form to the temperature equation just obtained. Thus Integration with respect to y and application of the boundary conditions at y = 0 gives s19.4 Use of the Equations of Change for Mixtures 595 These are the concentration and temperature profiles in terms of the mass and heat fluxes. Applications of the boundary conditions at the outer edges of the films-that is, at y = 6, and y = ST, respectively-give These equations relate the fluxes to the film thicknesses and the transport properties. When Eq. 19.4-14 is divided by Eq. 19.4-16 and Eq. 19.4-15 is divided by Eq. 19.4-17, we get the con- centration profiles in terms of the transport coefficients (analogously to Eqs. 19.4-6 and 8). Equations 19.4-16 and 17 will be encountered again in 522.8. A catalytic tubular reactor is shown in Fig. 19.4-2. A dilute solution of solute A in a solvent S is in fully developed, laminar flow in the region z < 0.

Write the diffusion equation appropriate for this problem, and find the solution for short distances into the reactor. Assume that the flow is isothermal and neglect the presence of B. SOLUTION For the conditions stated above, the flowing liquid will always be very nearly pure solvent S. The product @BAS can be considered constant, and the diffusion of A in S can be described by the steady-state version of Eq. 19.1-14 (ignoring the presence of a small amount of the reaction product B). The relevant equations of change for the system are then Continuity of A: Motion: We make the usual assumption that axial diffusion can be neglected with respect to axial con- vection, and therefore delete the dashed-underlined term (compare with Eqs. 10.8-11 and 12). Equation 19.4-19 can be solved to give the parabolic velocity profile v,(r) = v,,,,,[l - (r/M21. When this result is substituted into Eq. 19.4-18, we get From z = 0 to z = L the ~il~t~ solution of inner surface of the tube is A B in coated with a catalyst / /' Fully-developed A + B irreversibly laminar flow before and instantaneously z = 0 is reached on catalyst surface Fig. 19.4-2. Boundary conditions for a tubular reactor. 596 Chapter 19 Equations of Change for Multicomponent Systems This is to be solved with the boundary conditions B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: at z = 0, c, = c,, at r = R, c, = 0 at r = 0, c, = finite For short distances z into the reactor, the concentration c, differs from c,, only near the wall, where the velocity profile is practically linear. Hence we can introduce the variable y = R - r, neglect curvature terms, and replace B.C. 3 by a fictitious boundary condition at y = w (see Example 12.2-2 for a detailed discussion of this method of treating the entrance region of the tube). The reformulated problem statement is then with the boundary conditions B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: This problem can be solved by the method of combination of independent variables by seeking a solution of the form c,/cA0 = f($, where r] = (y/R)(2~~,,,,~~/9~~~z)\"~. One thus obtains the ordinary differential equation f\" + 3r12f' = 0, which can be integrated to give (see Eq. C.l-9) This problem is mathematically analogous to the Graetz problem of Problem 12D.4, O of that problem being analogous to 1 - (c,/c,,) here. Experiments of the type described here have proved useful for obtaining mass transfer data at high Schmidt numbers.' A particularly attractive reaction is the reduction of ferri- cyanide ions on metallic surfaces according to the reaction in which ferricyanide and ferrocyanide take the place of A and B in the above development. This electrochemical reaction is quite rapid under properly chosen conditions. Furthermore, since it involves only electron transfer, the physical properties of the solution are almost en- tirely unaffected. The forced diffusion effects neglected here may be suppressed by the addi- tion of an indifferent electrolyte in ex~ess.~,~ Figure 19.4-3 shows schematically how oxygen and carbon monoxide combine at a catalytic surface (palladium) to make carbon dioxide, according to the technologically important Catalytic Oxidation reaction5 of Carbon Monoxide 0, + 2C0 + 2C02 (1 9.4-30) D.

Three-compo- Outer edge of nent system with a catalytic stagnant gas film ,- consisting of chemical reaction. For this analysis, the reaction is assumed to occur instantaneously and irreversibly at the cat- alytic surface. The gas composition at the outer edge of the film (at z = 0) is presumed known, and the catalyst surface is at z = 6. The temperature and pressure are assumed to be independent of position throughout the film. We label the chemical species by: O2 = 1, CO = 2, co2 = 3. For steady-state, one-dimensional diffusion without homogeneous reactions, Eq. 19.1-10 gives which tells us that all of the molar fluxes are constants across the film.

Toor, AIChE Journal, 3,198-207 (1957). 598 Chapter 19 Equations of Change for Multicomponent Systems EXAMPLE 19.4-4 Thermal Conductivity of a Polyatomic Gas SOLUTION From this equation and a similar one for x2, we can get x, at z = 8. Then from Eq. 19.4-35 we get which gives the rate of production of carbon dioxide at the catalytic surface. This result can then be substituted into Eqs. 19.4-35 and 36 and the three mole fractions can be calculated as functions of z. In 59.3 we pointed out that the thermal conductivities of polyatomic gases deviate from the formula for monatomic gases, because of the effects of the internal degrees of freedom in the complex molecules. When the Eucken formula for polyatomic gases (Eq. 9.3-15) is divided by the formula for monatomic gases (Eq. 9.3-14) and use is made of the ideal gas law, one can write the ratio of the polyatomic gas thermal conductivity to that of a monatomic gas as Derive a result of this form by modeling the polyatomic gas as an interacting gas mixture, in which the various \"species\" are the polyatomic gas molecules in the various rotational and vi- brational states. The heat flux for a gas mixture is given in Eq. 19.3-3. All \"species\" will have the same thermal conductivity because they differ only in their internal quantum states. Therefore we expect each k, to be Lon. Similarly, the mass flux for each \"species\" should be given by Fick's law for a pure gas j, = -pB,,Vw,, with all the a,, having a common value 9,,,. Thus we get since the molecular weights of all the \"species\" are the same. If now it is postulated that the distribution over the various quantum states is in equilib- rium with the local temperature, then Vx, = (dx,/dT)VT. Then we can define the effective ther- mal conductivity of the mixture by and write kp0ly -- -1+ kon =1+ =1+ Here the temperature-dependent quantity can be calculated from the kinetic theory of gases at low density. It varies ogly very slowly with temperature, and a suitable mean value is 1.106. The quantity ~p,poIy = dH/dT is the heat capacity for a gas in which the equilibrium among the various quantum states is maintained 519.5 Dimensional Analysis of the Equations of Change for Nonreacting Binary Mixtures 599 - during the change of temperature, whereas Cp,m,, is the heat capacity for a gas in which tran- sitions between quantum states are not allowed, so that C,,,,, = $R. When the numerical value A = 1.106 is inserted in Eq. 19.4-41, we get finally which is the formula recommended by Hir~chfelder.~ Although the predictions of Eq. 19.4-43 are not much better than those of the older Eucken formula, the above development does at least give some feel for the role of the internal degrees of freedom in heat cond~ction.~,~ 519.5 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE EQUATIONS OF CHANGE FOR NONREACTING BINARY MIXTURES In this section we dimensionally analyze the equations of change summarized in 519.2, using special cases of the flux expressions of 919.3. The discussion parallels that of 511.5 and serves analogous purposes: to identify the controlling dimensionless parameters of representative mass transfer problems, and to provide an introduction to the mass trans- fer correlations of Chapter 22. Once again we restrict the discussion primarily to systems of constant physical properties. The equation of continuity for the mixture then takes the familiar form Continuity: (V . v) = 0 (19.5-1) The equation of motion may be approximated in the manner of Boussinesq (see g11.3) by putting Eqs. 19.3-2 and 19-5.1 into Eq. 19.2-3, and replacing -Vp + pg by -V9. For a constant-viscosity Newtonian fluid this gives Motion: The energy equation, in the absence of chemical reactions, viscous dissipation, and exter- nal forces other than gravity, is obtained from Eq. (F) of Table 19.2-4, with Eq. 19.3-3. In using the latter we further neglect the diffusional transport of energy relative to the mass average velocity. For constant thermal conductivity this leads to Energy: in which n = k/p?,, is the thermal diffusivity. For nonreacting binary mixtures with con- stant p and B,,, Eq. 19.1-14 takes the form Continuity of A: For the assumptions that have been made, the analogy between Eqs. 19.5-3 and 4 is clear. - - - J. 0.

Kaper, Mathematical Theory of Transport Processes in Gases, North Holland, Amsterdam (1977), g511.2 and 3. 600 Chapter 19 Equations of Change for Multicomponent Systems We now introduce the reference quantities I,, v,, and Yo, used in 93.7 and 911.5, the reference temperatures To and T, of 511.5, and the analogous reference mass fractions o,, and w,,. Then the dimensionless quantities we will use are Here it is understood that v is the mass average velocity of the mixture. It should be recognized that for some problems other choices of dimensionless variables may be preferable. In terms of the dimensionless variables listed above, the equations of change may be expressed as Continuity: (9 . i;) = 0 (1 9.5-8) Motion: Energy: Continuity of A: -- ~i RePr DGA - I v2&A ~i ReSc The Reynolds, Prandtl, and thermal Grashof numbers have been given in Table 11.5-1. The other two numbers are new: sc = 1-1 = = Schmidt number PB AB Gr, = [gi(w~l - mAu)C] = diffusional Grashof number 4 The Schmidt number is the ratio of momentum diffusivity to mass diffusivity and repre- sents the relative ease of molecular momentum and mass transfer. It is analogous to the Prandtl number, which represents the ratio of the momentum diffusivity to the thermal diffusivity. The diffusional Grashof number arises because of the buoyant force caused by the concentration inhomogeneities. The products RePr and ReSc in Eqs. 19.5-10 and 11 are known as Pkclet numbers, Pk and PkAB, respectively. The dimensional analysis of mass transfer problems parallels that for heat transfer problems. We illustrate the technique by three examples: (i) The strong similarity be- tween Eqs. 19.5-10 and 11 permits the solution of many mass transfer problems by anal- ogy with previously solved heat transfer problems; such an analogy is used in Example 19.5-1. (ii) Frequently the transfer of mass requires or releases energy, so that the heat and mass transfer must be considered simultaneously, as is illustrated in Example 19.5-2. (iii) Sometimes, as in many industrial mixing operations, diffusion plays a subordinate role in mass transfer and need not be given detailed consideration; this situation is illus- trated in Example 19.5-3. We shall see then that, just as for heat transfer, the use of dimensional analysis for the solution of practical mass transfer problems is an art. This technique is normally most useful when the effects of at least some of the many dimensionless ratios can be ne- glected. Estimation of the relative importance of pertinent dimensionless groups nor- mally requires considerable experience. 519.5 Dimensional Analysis of the Equations of Change for Nonreacting Binary Mixtures 601 We wish to predict the concentration distribution about a long isothermal cylinder of a volatile solid A, immersed in a gaseous stream of a species B, which is insoluble in solid A. Concentration The system is similar to that pictured in Fig. 11.5-1, except that here we consider the transfer Distribution about a of mass rather than heat. The vapor pressure of the solid is small compared to the total pres- Long Cylinder sure in the gas, so that the mass transfer system is virtually isothermal. Can the results of Example 11.5-1 be used to make the desired prediction? SOLUTION The results of Example 11.5-1 are applicable if it can be shown that suitably defined dimen- sionless concentration profiles in the mass transfer system are identical to the temperature profiles in the heat transfer system: ijA(X, ij, 2) = f(X, ij, i) (19.5-14) This equality will be realized if the differential equations and boundary conditions for the two systems can be put into identical form. We therefore begin by choosing the same reference length, velocity, and pressure as in Example 11.5-1, and an analogous composition function: ij, = (w, - w~~)/(o~~ - ~~~1. Here w,, is the mass fraction of A in the gas adjacent to ths interface, and wAco is the value far from the cylinder. We also specify that ZA = w,, so that & = 0. The equations of change needed here are then Eqs. 19.5-8,9, and 11. Thus the differential equations here and in Problem 11.5-1 are analogous except for the viscous heating term in Eq. 11.5-3. As for the boundary conditions, we have here: B.C. 1: as X2 + ij2 + m, c + tix + 1 (19.5-15) B.C. 2: at f2 + ij2 = Z 1 (wA0 - @Am) v=- Vij, ijA = 0 (19.5-16) ReSc (I - wA0) The boundary condition on +, obtained with the help of Fick's first law, states that there is an interfacial radial velocity resulting from the sublimation of A. If we compare the above description with that for heat transfer in Example 11.5-1, we see that there is no mass transfer counterpart of the viscous dissipation term in the energy equa- tion and no heat transfer counterpart to the interfacial radial velocity component in the boundary condition of Eq. 19.5-16. The descriptions are otherwise analogous, however, with G,, Sc, and Gr, taking the places of T, Pr, and Gr. When the Brinkman number is sufficiently small, viscous dissipation will be unimpor- tant, and that term in the energy equation can be neglected. Neglecting the Brinkman number term is appropriate, except for flows of very viscous fluids with large velocity gradients, or in hypersonic boundary layers (510.4). Similarly, when (l/ReSc)[(w,, - wA,)/(l - wAo)l is very small, it may be set equal to zero without introducing appreciable error. If these limiting con- ditions are met, analogous behavior will be obtained for heat and mass transfer. More pre- cisely, the dimensionless concentration G, will have the same dependence on i, q,Z, i, Re, Pr, and Gr, as the dimensionless temperature ? will have on f, jl, i, t, Re, Pr, and Gr. The concen- tration and temperature profiles will then be identical at a given Re whenever Sc = Pr and Gr, = Gr. The thermal Grashof number can, at least in principle, be varied at will by changing To - T,. Hence it is likely that the desired Grashof numbers can be obtained. However, it can be seen from Tables 9.1-1 and 17.1-1 that Schmidt numbers for gases can vary over a considerably wide range than can the Prandtl numbers. Hence it may be difficult to obtain a satisfactory thermal model of the mass transfer process, except in a limited range of the Schmidt number. Another possibly serious obstacle to achieving similar heat and mass transfer behavior is the possible nonuniformity of the surface temperature. The heat of sublimation must be ob- tained from the surrounding gas, and this in turn will cause the solid temperature to become lower than that of the gas. Hence it is necessary to consider both heat and mass transfer si- multaneously. A very simple analysis of simultaneous heat and mass transfer is discussed in the next example. 602 Chapter 19 Equations of Change for Multicomponent Systems EXAMPLE 19.5-2 Fog Formation during Dehumidification SOLUTION Refrigerant vapor out at Tr Air in at d / Liquefied refrigerant in at T, Fig. 19.5-1. Schematic representation of a dehumidifier. Air enters with inlet temperature TI and humidity owl (the mass fraction of water vapor). It leaves with outlet temperature T2 and humidity ow, Because the heat transfer to the refrigerant is very effective, the temperature at the air- condensate interface is close to the refrigerant temperature T,. Wet air is being simultaneously cooled and dehumidified by passage through a metal tube chilled by the boiling of a liquid refrigerant. The tube surface is below the dew point of the entering air and therefore becomes covered with a water film. Heat transfer from the refriger- ant to this condensate layer is sufficiently effective that the free water surface may be consid- ered isothermal and at the boiling point of the refrigerant. This system is shown in Fig. 19.5-1. We wish to determine the range of refrigerant temperatures that may be used without danger of fog formation. Fog is undesirable, because most of the tiny water droplets constitut- ing the fog will pass through the cooling tube along with the air unless special collectors are provided. Fog can form if the wet air become supersaturated at any point in the system. Let species A be air and W be water. It is convenient here to choose the dimensionless variables The subscripts are further defined in Fig. 19.5-1. For the air-water system at moderate temperatures, the assumption of constant p and BAW is reasonable, with air regarded as a single species. The heat capacities of water vapor and air are unequal, but the diffusional transport of energy is expected to be small. Hence Eqs. 19.5-9 to 11 provide a reasonably reliable description of the dehumidification process. The boundary conditions needed to integrate these equations include L, = i = 1 at the tube inlet, Lw = !f = 0 at the gas-liquid boundary, and no-slip and inlet conditions on the velocity G. We find then that the dimensionless profiles are related by ijw(f, 9, if Re, Gr,, Gr, Sc, Pr) = ?(?, ij, 2, Re, Gr, Gr,, Pr, Sc) (19.5-19) Thus ZiW is the same function of its arguments as f is of its arguments in the exact order given. Since in general Gr, is not equal to Gr and Sc is not equal to Pr, the two profiles are not simi- lar. This general result is too complex to be of much value. However, for the air-water system, at moderate temperatures and near-atmospheric pressure, Sc is about 0.6 and Pr is about 0.71. If we assume for the moment that Sc and Pr are equal, the dimensional analysis becomes much simpler. For this special situation, the energy and species continuity equations are iden- g19.5 Dimensional Analysis of the Equations of Change for Nonreacting Binary Mixtures 603 Fig. 19.5-2. A representative dehumidifica- tion path. The dehumidification path shown here corresponds to T,,,,,, the low- est refrigerant temperature ensuring the absence of fog. The dehumidification path for this situation is a tangent to the satura- tion curve through the point (w,,, T,), rep- resenting the given inlet-air conditions. Calculated dehumidification paths for lower refrigerant temperatures would cross the saturation curve. Saturation water vapor concentrations would then be ex- ceeded, making fog formation possible. 0 L 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Temperature, OF tration and temperature profiles are then identical. It should be noted that equality of Gr, and Gr is not required. This is because the Grashof numbers affect the concentration and tempera- ture profiles only by way of the velocity v, which appears in both the continuity equation and the energy equation in the same way. Therefore, with the assumption that Sc = Pr, we have at each point in the system. This means, in turn, that evey concentration-temperature pair in the tube lies on a straight line between (owl, Tl) and (ow, T,) on a psychrometric chart. This is shown graphically in Fig. 19.5-2 for a representative set of conditions. Note that (w,,., Tr) must lie on the saturation curve, since equilibrium is very closely approximated. It follows that there can be no fog formation if a straight line drawn between (w,, TI) and (w,,, T,) does not cross the saturation curve. Then the lowest refrigerant temperature that cannot produce fog is represented by the point of tangency of a straight line through (ow, TI) with the saturation curve. It should be noted that all of the conditions along the line from the inlet (ow,, TI) to (w,, T,) will occur in the gas even though the bulk or cup-mixing conditions vary only from (w,, TI) to (o,, T,). Thus some fog can form even if saturation is not reached in the bulk of the flowing gas. For air entering at 90°F and 50% relative humidity, the minimum safe refrigerant temperature is about 45°F. It may also be seen from Fig. 19.5-2 that it is not necessary to bring all of the wet air to its dew point in order to dehumidify it. It is only necessary that the air be saturated at the cooling surface. The exit bulk conditions (w,, T,) can be anywhere along the dehumidification path between (w,, TI) and (w,, TJ, depending on the effectiveness of the apparatus used. Calculations based on the assumed equality of Sc and Pr have proven very useful for the air-water system. In addition, it can be seen, by considering the physical significance of the Schmidt and Prandtl numbers, that the above-outlined calculation procedure is conservative. Since the Schmidt number is slightly smaller than the Prandtl number, dehumidification will proceed proportionally faster than cooling, and concentration-temperature pairs will lie slightly below the dehumidification path drawn in Fig. 19.5-2. In condensing organic vapors from air, the reverse situation often occurs. Then the Schmidt numbers tend to be higher than the Prandtl numbers, and cooling proceeds faster than condensation. Conditions then lie above the straight line of Fig. 19.5-2, and the danger of fog formation is increased. 604 Chapter 19 Equations of Change for Multicomponent Systems Fig. 19.5-3. Blending of miscible fluids. At zero time, the z = H upper half of this tank is solute free, and the lower half contains a uniform distribution of solute at a dimen- sionless concentration of unity, and the fluid is motion- less. The impeller is caused to turn at a constant rate of H rotation N for all time greater than zero. Positions in the z=- 2 tank are given by the coordinates r, 8, z, with r measured radially from the impeller axis, and z upward from the bottom of the tank. Develop by dimensional analysis the general form of a correlation for the time required to blend two miscible fluids in an agitated tank. Consider a tank of the type described in Fig. of 19.5-3, and assume that the two fluids and their mixtures have essentially the same physical Fluids properties. SOLUTION It will be assumed that the achievement of \"equal degrees of blending\" in any two mixing op- erations means obtaining the same dimensionless concentration profile in each. That is, the dimensionless solute concentration &, is the same function of suitable dimensionless coordi- nates (?, 0,i) of the two systems when the degrees of blending are equal. These concentration profiles will depend on suitably defined dimensionless groups appearing in the pertinent conservation equations and their boundary conditions, and on a dimensionless time. In this problem we select the following definitions for the dimensionless variables: Here D is the impeller diameter, N is the rate of rotation of the impeller in revolutions per unit time, and p, is the prevailing atmospheric pressure. The dimensionless pressure j3 is used here rather than the quantity 9 defined in 53.7; the formulation with ji is simpler and gives equivalent results. Note that i is equal to the total number of turns of the impeller since the start of mixing. The conservation equations describing this system are Eqs. 19.5-8, 9, and 11 with zero Grashof numbers. The dimensionless groups arising in these equations are Re, Fr, and Sc. The boundary conditions include the vanishing of v on the tank wall and of p on the free liquid surface. In addition we have to specify the initial conditions C. 1: 1H H atf 50, &,=O for--<?<- 20 D (19.5-22) C. 2: 1 H att 50, 1 forO<i<-- 20 (19.5-23) and the requirement of no slip on the impeller (see Eq. 3.7-34). We find then that the concentration profiles are functions of Re, Sc, Fr, the dimensionless time t, the tank geometry (via H/D and B/D), and the relative proportions of the two fluids. That is, &, = f (Re, Fr, Sc, t, geometry, initial conditions) (19.5-25) It is frequently possible to reduce the number of variables to be investigated. Questions for Discussion 605 It has been observed that, if the tank is properly baffled,' no vortices of importance occur; that is, the free liquid surface is effectively level. Under these circumstances, or in the absence of a free liquid surface, the Froude number does not appear in the system description, as we found in 53.7. It is further found, in most operations on low-viscosity liquids, that the rate-limiting step is the creation of a finely divided dispersion of one fluid in the other. In such a dispersion, the diffusional processes take place over very small distances. As a result, molecular diffusion is not rate limiting, and the Schmidt number (Sc) has little importance. It is further found that the effect of the Reynolds number (Re) is negligible under most commonly encountered con- ditions. This is because most of the mixing takes place in the interior of the tank where vis- cous effects are small, rather than in the boundary layers adjacent to the tank and impeIler surfaces, where they are large.' For most impeller-tank combinations in common use, the Reynolds number (Re) is unimportant when its value is above about lo4. This behavior has been substantiated by a number of investigator^.^ We thus arrive, after extensive experimentation, at a surprisingly simple result. When all of the assumptions above are valid, the concentration profile depends only on I. Hence the di- mensionless time required to produce any desired degree of mixing is a constant for a given system geometry. In other words, the total number of turns of the impeller during the mixing process determines the degree of blending, independently of Re, Fr, Sc, and tank size-provided, of course, that the tanks and impellers are geometrically similar. For the same reasons, in a properly baffled tank, the dimensionless velocity distribution and the volumetric pumping efficiency of the impeller are nearly independent of the Froude number (Fr) and of the Reynolds number (Re), when Re > lo4. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1. How do the various equations of change given in Chapters 3 and 11 have to be modified for reacting mixtures? 2. What modifications in the flux expressions given in Chapters 3 and 11 are needed to describe chemically reacting mixtures? 3. Under what conditions is (V . v) = O? (V . v\") = O? 4. Equations 19.1-24 and 15 are physically equivalent. For what kinds of problems is there a preference for one form over the other? 5. Interpret physically each term in the equations in Table 19.2-3. 6. The thermal conductivity of a mixture is defined as the ratio of the heat flux to the negative of the temperature gradient when all the diffusional mass fluxes are zero. Interpret this state- ment in terms of Eq. 19.3-3. A common and effective baffling arrangement for vertical cylindrical tanks with axially mounted impellers is a set of four evenly spaced strips along the tank wall, with their flat surfaces in planes through the tank axis, extending from the top to the bottom of the tank and at least two-tenths of the distance to the tank center. The insensitivity of the required mixing time to the Reynolds number can be seen intuitively from the fact that the term (l/~e)?% in Eq. 19.5-9 becomes small compared to the acceleration term LX/DZ at large Re. Such intuitive arguments are dangerous, however, and the effect of Re is always important in the immediate neighborhood of solid surfaces. Here the amount of mixing taking place in the immediate neighborhood of solid surfaces is small and can be neglected. The insensitivity of the required mixing time to the Schmidt number can be seen from the time- averaged equation of continuity in Chapter 21. At large Re, the turbulent mass flux is much greater than that due to molecular diffusion, except in the immediate neighborhood of the solid surfaces. E. A. Fox and V. E.

Concentration-dependent diffusivity. A stationary liquid layer of B is bounded by planes z = 0 (a solid wall) and z = b (a gas-liquid interface).

Oxidation of silicon (Fig. 19B.4).' A slab of silicon is exposed to gaseous oxygen (species A) at pressure p, producing a layer of silicon dioxide (species B).

The thick- ness 6(t) of the growing oxide layer is to be predicted. A quasi-steady-state method is useful here, inasmuch as the advancement of the reaction front is very slow.

(a) In this chapter the species equation of continuity is given in three different forms: Eq. 19.1-7, Eq. (A) of Table 19.2-1, and Eq. (B) in Table 19.2-3. Show that these three equations are equivalent. (b) Show hdv to get Eq. 19.1-15 from Eq. 19.1-11. 19C.1. Alternate form of the binary diffusion equation. In the absence of chemical reactions, Eq. 19.1-17 can be written in terms of v rather than v* by using a different measure of concentra- tion-namely, the logarithm of the mean molecular weight:' in which M = xAMA + xBMB. (Caution: Solution is lengthy.) Equation 19C.1-1 is difficult to solve even for the stagnant gas film of 518.2, because of the variable mass density p that appears in the continuity equation (Eq. A of Table 19.2-3). 19D.1. Derivation of the equation of continuity. In s19.1 the species equation of continuity is de- rived by making a mass balance on a small rectangular volume Ax Ay Az fixed in space. (a) Repeat the derivation for an arbitrarily shaped volume element V with a sufficiently smooth fixed boundary S. Show that the species mass balance can be written as Use the Gauss divergence theorem to convert the surface integral to a volume integral, and then obtain Eq. 19.1-6.

Derivation of the equation of change for temperature for a multicomponent system. De- rive Eq. (F) in Table 19.2-4 from Eq. (E). We suggest the following sequence of steps: (a) Since the enthalpy is an extensive thermodynamic property, we can write in which the m, are the masses of the various species, is the sum of the ma, and the w, = m,/m are the corresponding mass fractions.

(E) can be expanded by regarding the enthalpy per unit mass to be a function of p, T, and the first (N - 1) mass fractions: Next, verify that the coefficients of the substantial derivatives can be identified as The coefficient of p(Dw,/ Dt) has already been given in Eq. 19D.2-4. (c) Substitute the coefficients into Eq. 19D.2-5, and then use Eq. 19.1-14 to eliminate p(Dw,/Dt), and verify that (dH/dma)p,T,,y is the same as (HJM,). The summation on a, which goes from 1 to N - 1, now has to be appropriately rewritten as a summation from 0 to N, by using Eq. (K) of Table 17.8-1 and the fact that Z,ra = 0. (d) Then combine the results of (a), (b), and (c) with Eq. (E) to get Eq. (F). 19D.3. Gas separation by atmolysis or \"sweep diffusion\" (Fig. 19D.3). When two gases A and B are forced to diffuse through a third gas C, there is a tendency of A and B to separate because of the difference in their diffusion rates. This phenomenon was first studied by Hertz? and later by Maier.* Benedict and Boas5 studied the economics of the process particularly with regard to isotope separation.

We want to study the details of the three-component diffusion taking place in the diffu- sion tube of length L, when the apparatus is operated at steady state. Obtain an expression re- lating the concentrations x,, and xB1 at the feed end of the tube to the concentrations X,q and xB2 at the product end. This expression will contain the molar fluxes of the three species, which are controlled by the rates of addition of materials in the two entering streams. Use the following notation for dimensionless quantities: 5 = z/L for the distance down the tube from the feed entrance; rA = 9lAB/BAc and r, = gAB/9BC for the diffusivity ratios; and v, = N,,L/c~~~ for the molar fluxes (with a = A, B, C). (a) Shows that, in terms of these dimensionless quantities, the Maxwell-Stefan equations for the diffusion are where YAA = vz + rA(vA + vC), YAS = vA(rA - I), and YA = -YAVA, and the remaining quantities are obtained by interchanging A and B. (b) By using Laplace transforms, solve Eqs. 19D.3-1 and 2 to get the concentration profiles for A and B in the tube.

Keyes and Pigford6 give further results for spe- cial cases. 19D.4. Steady-state diffusion from a rotating disk.7 A large disk is rotating with an angular veloc- ity fl in an infinite expanse of liquid B. The surface is coated with a material A that is slightly soluble in B. Find the rate at which A dissolves in B. (The solution to this problem can be ap- plied to a disk of finite radius R with negligible error.) The fluid dynamics of this problem was developed by von KBrmBn8 and later corrected by C~chran.~ It was found that the velocity components can be expressed, except near the edge, as in which 5 = zmv. The functions F, G, and H have the following expansions: in which a = 0.510 and b = -0.616. It is further known that, in the limit as l + m, H + -0.886, and F, G, F', and G' all approach zero. Also it is known that the boundary layer thick- ness is proportional to m, except near the edge of the disk. ' V. G. Levich, Physicochemical Hydrodynamics, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.

Problems 611 The diffusion equation of Eq. 19.1-16 with the known velocity components is to be solved under the boundary conditions that: p, = p,, at z = 0; p, = 0 at z = m; and dp,/dr = 0 at r = 0, m. Since there can be but one solution to this linear problem, it may be seen that a solution of the form p,(z) can be found that satisfies the differential equation and all the boundary con- ditions. Thus, the solution for p~ does not depend on the radial coordinate in the region considered.

Steady-state boundary layer theory for flow around objects 520.4. Boundary layer mass transport with complex interfacial motion 520.5. Taylor dispersion in laminar tube flow Most of the diffusion problems discussed in the preceding two chapters led to ordinary differential equations for the concentration profiles. In this chapter we use the general equations of Chapter 19 to set up and solve some diffusion problems that lead to partial differential equations. A large number of diffusion problems can be solved by simply looking up the solu- tions to the analogous problems in heat conduction. When the differential equations and the boundary and initial conditions for the diffusion process are of exactly the same form as those for the heat conduction process, then the heat conduction solution may be taken over with appropriate changes in notation. In Table 20.0-1 the three main heat transport equations used in Chapter 12 are shown along with their mass transport analogs. Many solutions to the nonflow equations may be found in the monographs of Carslaw and Jaeger' and of Crank.' Because the diffusion problems described by the equations in Table 20.0-1 are analo- gous to the problems of Chapter 12, we do not discuss them extensively here. Instead, we focus primarily on problems involving diffusion with chemical reactions, diffusion with a moving interface, and diffusion with rapid mass transfer. In 920.1 we discuss a variety of time-dependent diffusion problems. In s20.2 we pre- sent some steady-state boundary layer problems involving binary mixtures. This is fol- lowed by two boundary layer analyses for more complicated systems: the diffusion in steady flow around arbitrary objects in 920.3, and the diffusion in flows yvith complex in- terfacial motion in 920.4. Finally, in 520.5 we explore an asymptotic solution to the \"Tay- lor dispersion\" problem. H. S. Carslaw and J. C. Jaeger, Conduction of Heat in Solids, 2nd edition, Oxford University Press (1959).

The first deals with evaporation of a volatile liquid and illustrates the deviations from Fick's second law that arise at high mass-transfer rates. The second and third examples deal with unsteady- state diffusion with chemical reactions. In the last example we examine the role of inter- facial-area changes in diffusion. The method of combination of variables is used in Examples 20.1-1,2, and 4, and Laplace transforms are used in Example 20.1-3. We wish to predict the rate at which a volatile liquid A evaporates into pure B in a tube of in- finite length. The liquid level is maintained at z = 0 at all times. The temperature and pres- Unsteady-State sure are assumed constant, and the vapors of A and B form an ideal gas mixture. Hence the Evaporation of a Liquid molar density c is constant throughout the gas phase, and BAB may be considered to be con- (the \"Amold Problem'') stant. It is further assumed that species B is insoluble in liquid A, and that the molar average velocity in the gas phase does not depend on the radial coordinate. 614 Chapter 20 Concentration Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable SOLUTION For this system the equation of continuity for the mixture, given in Eq. 19.1-12, becomes in which v: is the z-component of the molar average velocity. Integration with respect to z gives Here and elsewhere in this problem, the subscript \"0\" indicates a quantity evaluated at z = 0. According to Eq. (M) of Table 17.8-1, this velocity can be written in terms of the molar fluxes of A and B as However, N,,, is zero because of the insolubility of species B in liquid A. Then use of Eq. (D) of Table 17.8-2 gives finally in which XAO is the interfacial gas-phase concentration, evaluated here on the assumption of interfacial equilibrium. For an ideal gas mixture this is just the vapor pressure of pure A di- vided by the total pressure. The equation of continuity of Eq. 19.1-17 then becomes This is to be solved with the initial and boundary conditions: LC.: B.C. 1: B.C. 2: We can try the same kind of combination of variables used in Example 4.1-1; namely, X = xA/xA0 and Z = z/-. However, since Eq. 20.1-5 contains the parameter XA~, we can an- ticipate that X will depend not only on Z but also parametrically on xAo. In terms of these dimensionless variables, Eq. 20.1-5 can be written as Here the quantity is a dimensionless molar average velocity, 9 = v:m, as can be seen by comparing Eqs, 20.1-10 and 20.1-4. The initial and boundary conditions in Eqs. 20.1-6 to 8 now become B.C. 1: B.C. 2 and I.C.: Equation 20.1-9 can be attacked by first letting dX/dZ = Y. This gives a first-order differential equation for Y that can be solved to obtain 920.1 Time Dependent Diffusion 615 This gives on integration Combining this result with Eqs. 20.1-11 and 12, we get Then we use the definition of the error function and some of the properties of this function, in particular, -erf(-cp) = erf cp and erf = 1 (see 5C.6). This leads to the final expression for the mole fraction distribution:' erf(Z - cp) + erf cp 1 - erf(Z - cp) X(Z) = 1 - - - erf + erf cp 1 + erf cp To get the function cp(xA0), this mole fraction distribution has to be substituted into Eq. 20.1-10. This gives Rather than solving this to get (D as a function of xAo, it is easier to evaluate xAo as a function of 9: 1 X~~ = 1 + [l/;f(l + erf q)cp exp cp21-' A small table of p(xAo) is given in Table 20.1-1, and the concentration profiles are shown in Fig. 20.1-1.

Concentration profiles in time-dependent evaporation, showing that the deviati~ from Fick's law increases with the volatility of the evapo- rating liquid. Integration with respect to t then gives This relation can be used to calculate the diffusivity from the rate of evaporation (see Problem 20A.1). We can now assess the importance of including the convective transport of species A in the tube. If Fick's second law (Eq. 19.1-18) had been used to determine X, we would have ob- tained Thus we can rewrite Eq. 20.1-20 as The factor I) = (Pfi/~AO, tabulated in Table 20.1-1, is a correction for the deviation from the Fick's second law results caused by the nonzero molar average velocity. We see that the devi- ation becomes especially significant when xAO is large-that is, for liquids with large volatility. In the preceding analysis it is assumed that the system is isothermal. Actually, the inter- face will be cooled by the evaporation, particularly at large values of xA0. This effect can be minimized by using a small-diameter tube made of a good thermal conductor. For applica- tion to other mass transfer systems, however, the analysis given here needs to be extended by including the solution to the energy equation, so that the interfacial temperature and compo- sitions can be calculated (see Problem 20B.2). This analysis can be extended2 to include interphase transfer of both species, with any time-independent flux ratio NAzO/NBzo and any initial gas composition x,,. A simple example of such a system is the diffusion-controlled reaction 2A -+ B on a catalytic solid at z = 0, with W. E. Stewart, J. B. Angelo, and E. N. Lightfoot, AlChE Journal, 16,771-786 (19701, have generalized this example and the following one to forced convection in three-dimensional flows, including turbulent systems. g20.1 Time Dependent Diffusion 617 EXAMPLE 20.1-2 Gas Absorption with Rapid the heat of reaction removed through the solid.

The last one is a key result for mass transfer calculations (see 522.8). Gas A is absorbed by a stationary liquid solvent S, the latter containing solute B. Species A re- acts with B in an instantaneous irreversible reaction according to the equation aA + bB + Products. It may be assumed that Fick's second law adequately describes the diffusion processes, since A, B, and the reaction products are present in S in low concentrations. Obtain expressions for the concentration profiles. Because of the instantaneous reaction of A and B, there will be a plane parallel to the liquid-vapor interface at a distance z, from it, which separates the region containing no A from that containing no B. The distance z, is a function of t, since the boundary between A and B retreats as B is used up in the chemical reaction.

The fourth boundary condition is the stoichiometric requirement that a moles of A consume b moles of B (see Problem 20B.2). T. K. Sherwood, R. L. Pigford, and C. R.

Finally, insertion of these solutions into B.C. 4 gives the following implicit equation from which zR(t) can be obtained: Here y is a constant equal to z;/4t. Thus zR increases as V% To calculate the concentration profiles, one first solves Eq. 20.1-37 for G, and then in- serts this value for z,/fi in Eqs. 20.1-35 and 36. Some calculated concentration profiles are shown in Fig. 20.1-2 (for a = b), to illustrate the rate of movement of the reaction zone.

In this section we ex- tend the set of boundary layer equations to binary reacting mixtures, adding the equa- tion of continuity for species A so that the concentration profiles can be evaluated.

Spalding, ed.), Advance Publications Ltd., London, Vol. I (1977), pp. 22-63. 624 Chapter 20 Concentration Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable Consider the steady, two-dimensional flow of a binary fluid around a submerged ob- ject, such as that in Fig. 4.4-1. In the vicinity of the solid surface, the equations of change given in 5918.2 and 3 may be simplified as follows, provided that p, p, k, ep, and 9AB are essentially constant (except in the pg term), and that viscous dissipation can be neglected: Continuity: Motion: Energy: Continuity of A: dv, dv, -- + - = 0 dx dy The equation of ~ontinuity is the same as Eq. 12.4-1. The equation of motion, obtained from Eq. 19.2-3, differs from Eq. 12.4-2 by the addition of the binary buoyant force term %z(oA - oAm). The energy equation, obtained from Eq. (F) of Table 19.2-4, differs from Eq. 12.4-3 by the addition of the chemical heat-source term -[(KIM,) - (%/~,)lr,.,. Equation 20.2-4 is obtained from Eq. 19.1-16 by setting oA = wA(x, y) and neglecting the diffusion in the x direction. More complete equations, valid for high-velocity, variable- property boundary layers, are available elsewhere.' The usual boundary conditions on v, are that v, = 0 at the solid surface, and v, = v,(x) at the outer edge of the velocity boundary layer. The usual boundary conditions on T in Eq. 20.2-3 are that T = T,(x) at the solid surface, and T = T, at the outer edge of the thermal boundary layer. The corresponding boundary conditions on w, in Eq. 20.2-4 are that o, = w,,(x) at the surface and o, = o,, at the outer edge of the difusional boundary layer. Thus there are now three boundary layers to consider, each with its own thickness. In fluids with constant physical properties and large Prandtl and Schmidt numbers, the thermal and diffusional boundary layers usually lie within the velocity boundary layer, whereas for Pr < 1 and Sc < 1 they may extend beyond it. For mass transfer systems the velocity vy at the surface is usually not zero, but de- pends on x. Hence we set vy = v,(x) at y = 0. This boundary condition is appropriate when- ever there is a net mass flux between the surface and the stream, as in melting, drying, sublimation, combustion of the wall, or transpiration of the fluid through a porous wall. Clearly, some of these processes are possible with pure fluids, but for simplicity we have deferred their consideration to this chapter (see also 5918.3 and 22.8 for related analyses). With the help of the equation of continuity, Eqs. 20.2-1 to 4 can be formally inte- grated, with the boundary conditions just given, to obtain the following set of boundary layer balances: Continuity + motion: Continuity + energy: See, for example, W.

Boundary layer techniques have been of considerable value in developing the the- ory of high-speed flight, separations processes, chemical reactors, and biological mass transfer systems. A few of the interesting problems that have been studied are chemical reactions in hypersonic boundary layers: mass transfer from dropletsI2 electrode polar- ization in forced convection2 and free convection,3 reverse-osmosis water desalination: and interphase transfer in packed-bed reactors and distillation c~lumns.~ EXAMPLE 20.2-1 Diffusion and Chemical An appropriate mass transfer analog to the problem discussed in Example 12.4-1 would be the flow along a flat plate that contains a species A slightly soluble in the fluid B. The concen- tration at the plate surface would be c,,, the solubility of A in B, and the concentration of A far Ih~tion in Is~t~~~al from the plate would be cA,.

The concentration of dissolved A is assumed to be small, so that the physical proper- ties p, p, and %,, are virtually constant throughout the fluid. We wish to analyze the system, sketched in Fig. 20.2-1, by the von KArmAn method. SOLUTION We begin by postulating forms for the velocity and concentration profiles.

In order to relate this problem to that of Example 12.4-1, we introduce the quantity A = 6J6, which in this case is a function of x because of the chemical reaction occurring. We restrict the discussion to A 5 1, for which the concentration boundary layer lies entirely within the velocity boundary layer. We can also neglect the interfacial velocity vo = v,l,=,, which is small here because of the small solubility of A. Insertion of these expressions into Eqs. 20.2-5 and 7 then gives the differential equations for the boundary layer thicknesses 6 and 6, = SA. Equation 20.2-10 is readily integrated to give I Insertion of this regult into Eq. 20.2-11 and multiplication by -6A/vc,, gives as the differential equation for A. Thus A depends on the Schmidt number, Sc = p/pQAB, and on the dimensionless position coordinate shown in the square brackets. The bracketed quan- tity is 1 /(n + 1) times the first Damkohler number6 based on the distance x. When no reaction is occurring, ky is zero, and Eq. 20.2-13 becomes a linear first-order reac- tion for A3. When that equation is integrated, we get in which C is a constant of integration. Because A does not become infinite as x --+ 0, we obtain in the absence of chemical reaction (cf. Eq. 12.4-15): That is, when there is no reaction and Sc > 1, the concentration and velocity boundary layer thicknesses bear a constant ratio to one another, dependent only on the value of the Schmidt number. When a slow reaction occurs (or when x is small), a series solution to Eq. 20.2-13 can be ob- tained: A = SC~'/~(~ + a,t + a2t2 + . . a) in which Substitution of this expression into Eq. 20.2-13 gives Because a, is negative, the concentration boundary layer thickness is diminished by the chem- ical reaction.

For large t, we assume that the dominant term is of the form A = const. e 5\" where rn < 0. Substitution of this trial function into Eq. 20.2-13 then shows that A = (sc@-~/~ for large 5 (20.2-19) Combination of Eqs. 20.2-12 and 19 shows that, at large distances from the leading edge, the concentration boundary layer thickness 6, = 6A becomes a constant independent of v, and v. Once A@, Sc) is known, then the concentration profiles and the mass transfer rate at the surface may be found. A more refined treatment of this problem has been given else- where.7 The laminar boundary layer on a flat plate (see Fig. 20.2-2) has been a popular system for heat and mass transfer studies. In this example, we give an analysis of subsonic forced convection Forced Convection from in this geometry at high mass-transfer rates, and discuss the analogies that hold in this situa- a Flat Plate at High tion.

This function will be specified later. Equation 20.2-20 can be integrated, with the boundary condition of Eq. 20.2-26, to give This expression isto be inserted for v, into Eqs. 20.2-21 to 23. To capitalize on the analogous form of Eqs. 20.2-21 to 23 and the first six boundary condi- tions, we define the dimensionless profiles and the dimensionless physical property ratios With these definitions, and the above equation for v,, Eqs. 20.2-21 to 23 all take the form and the boundary conditions on the dependent variables reduce to the following: Thus the dimensionless velocity, temperature, and composition profiles all satisfy the same equation, but with their individual values of A. The form of the boundary conditions on n suggests that a combination of variables be tried. By analogy with Eq. 4.4-20 we select the combination: Then by treating l7 and as functions of 77 (see Problem 20B.3), we obtain the differential equation with the boundary conditions 520.2 Steady-State Transport in Binary Boundary Layers 629 From the last three equations we conclude that the profiles will be expressible in terms of the single coordinate q, if and only if the interfacial velocity vo(x) is of the form Any other functional form for v,(x) would cause the left side of Eq. 20.2-34 to depend on both x and q, SO that a combination of variables would not be possible. The boundary layer equa- tions would then require integration in two dimensions, and the calculations would become more difficult. Equation 20.2-37 specifies that vo(x) vary as 1/fi, and thus, inversely with the boundary layer thickness 6 of Eq. 4.4-17.This equation has the same range of validity as Eq. 20.2-34, that is, 1 << (v,x/v) < (v,x/v),,, (see Fig. 20.2-2). Fortunately the condition in Eq. 20.3-37 is a useful one. It corresponds to a direct propor- tionality of pv, to the interfacial fluxes 70, qO, and jAO. Conditions of this type arise naturally in diffusion-controlled surface reactions, and also in certain cases of drying and transpiration cooling. The determination of K for these situations is considered at the end of this example. Until then we treat K as given. With the specification of v,(x) according to Eq. 20.2-37, the problem statement is com- plete, and we are ready to discuss the calculation of the profiles. This is best done by numeri- cal integration, with specified values of the parameters A and K. The first step in the solution is to evaluate the velocity profile ll,. For this purpose it is convenient to introduce the function which is a generalization of the dimensionless stream function f used in Example 4.4-2. Then setting A = 1 in Eq. 20.2-34 and making the substitutions f' = df/dq = II,, f\" = d2f/dV2 = dII,/dv, and so on, gives the equation of motion in the form and Eqs. 20.2-35,36, and 38 give the boundary conditions Equation 20.2-39 can be solved numerically with these boundary conditions to obtain f as a function of q for various values of K. Once the function f(q, K) has been evaluated, we can integrate Eq. 20.2-34 with the boundary conditions in Eqs. 20.2-35 and 36 to obtain Some profiles calculated from this equation by numerical integration are given in Fig. 20.2- 3. The velocity profiles are given by the curves for A = 1. The temperature and composition profiles for various Prandtl and Schmidt numbers are given by the curves for the corre- sponding values of A. Note that the velocity, temperature, and composition boundary lay- ers get thicker when K is positive (as in evaporation) and thinner when K is negative (as in condensation). 630 Chapter 20 Concentration Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable Fig. 20.2-3.

Thus the fluxes can be computed directly when K is known. These expressions are obtained from the flux expressions of Newton, Fourier, and Fick, and the profiles as given in Eq. 20.2-43. The energy flux qo here corresponds to the conduction term -kVT of Eq. 19.3-3; the diffusive flux j,, is obtained by using Eq. 20.2-47 above. The fluid properties p, p, ep, k, and PA, have been treated as constants in this develop ment. However, Eqs. 20.2-45 to 47 have been found to agree closely with the corresponding variable-property calculation^,^'^ provided that K is generalized as follows, and that p, p, $, k, and are evaluated at the \"reference conditions\" Ti = :(T, + T.) and UA~ = $bAO + @Am). In many situations, one of the following dimensionless quantities is known or readily computed. These flux ratios, R, are independent of x under the present boundary conditions and are related to A and K as follows, according to Eqs. 20.2-45 to 51. From Eq. 20.2-52 we see that the dimensionless interfacial mass flux K can be tabulated as a function of R and A, by use of the results in Table 20.2-1. Then K can be found by interpolation if the numerical values of R and A are given for one of the three profiles (i.e., if we can specify R,, or R, and Pr, or R, and Sc.) Convenient plots of these relations are given in Figures 22.8-5 to 7. As a simple illustration, suppose that the flat plate is porous and is saturated with liquid A, which vaporizes into a gaseous stream of A and B. Suppose also that gas B is noncondens- able and insoluble in liquid A, and that wAo and o,, are given. Then R, can be calculated from - - For calculations of momentum and energy transfer in gas flows with K = 0, see E. R. G. Eckert, Trans. A.S.M.E., 78,1273-1283 (1956).

For moderate values of K, the calculations can be simplified by representing II'(0, A, K) as a truncated Taylor series in the parameter K: This expansion can be written more compactly as in which a and b are slowly varying functions of A, given in Table 20.2-2. Insertion of Eq. 20.2-54 into Eq. 20.2-52 gives the convenient expression for the dimensionless interfa- cial mass flux K for calculations with unknown parameter K.

This example illustrates the related effects of the interfacial velocity v, on the velocity, temperature, and composition profiles. The effect of vo on a given profile, II, is small if R << 1 for that profile (as in most separation processes) and large if R 2 1 (as in many combustion and transpiration cooling processes).

Now we want to enlarge'-7 on the ideas presented there and consider the flow around objects of other shapes such as the one shown in Fig. 12.4-2. Although we present the material in this section in terms of mass transfer, it is understood that the results can be taken over directly for the analogous heat transfer problem by appropriate changes of notation. The concentration boundary layer is presumed to be very thin, which means that the results are restricted either to small diffusivity or to short exposure times. The results are applicable only to the region between the forward stagnation locus (from which x is measured) and the region of separation or turbulence, if any, as indicated in Figure 12.4-2. The concentration of the diffusing species is called c,, and its concentration at the surface of the object is c,,. Outside the concentration boundary layer, the concentration of A is zero. Proceeding as in Example 12.4-3, we adopt an orthogonal coordinate system for the concentration boundary layer, in which x is measured along the surface everywhere in the direction of the streamlines. The y-coordinate is perpendicular to the surface, and the z-coordinate is measured along the surface perpendicular to the streamlines. These are \"general orthogonal coordinates,\" as described in Eqs. A.7-10 to 18, but with h, = 1, and h, = hx(x, z) and h, = h,(x, z).

The diffusion equation for the concentration boundary layer is then where Eqs. A.7-15 and 17 have been used. In writing these equations it has been as- sumed that: (i) the x- and z-components of the diffusion flux are negligible, (ii) the boundary layer thickness is small compared to the local interfacial radii of curvature, and (iii) the density and diffusivity are constant. We now want to get formal expressions for the concentration profiles and mass fluxes for two cases that are generalizations of the problems solved in 518.5 and 518.6. When we get the expressions for the local molar flux at the interface, we will find that the dependences on the diffusivity ($power in 518.5 and the $-power in 918.6) correspond to cases (a) and (b) below. This turns out to be of great importance in the establishment of dimensionless correlations for mass transfer coefficients, as we shall see in Chapter 22. Zero Velocity Gradient at the Mass Transfer Surface This situation ariges in a surfactant-free liquid flowing around a gas bubble. Here vx does not depend on y, and v, can be obtained from the equation of continuity given above. Therefore, for small mass-transfer rates we can write general expressions for the velocity components as V, = v,(x, Z) (20.3-3) where y depends on x and z. When this is used in Eq. 20.3-2, we get for the diffusion in the liquid phase which is to be solved with the boundary conditions B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: The nature of the boundary conditions suggests that a combination of variables treatment might be appropriate. However, it is far from obvious how to construct an appropriate di- mensionless combination. Hence we try the following: let cA/cA0 = fir)), where 77 = y/6,(x, z), and 6,(x, z) is the boundary layer thickness for species A, to be determined later. When the indicated combination of variables is introduced into Eq. 20.3-5, the equa- tion becomes with the boundary conditions: f(0) = 1 and f(w) = 0. If, now, the coefficient of the r)(df/dr)) term were a constant, then Eq. 20.3-9 would have the same form as Eq. 4.1-9, which we know how to solve. For convenience we specify the constant as Next we insert the expression for y from Eq. 20.3-4 and rearrange the equation thus: 920.3 Steady-State Boundary Layer Theory for Flow Around Objects 635 Linear Velocity Profi This is a linear, first-order equation for 6:, which has to be solved with the boundary condition 6, = 0 at x = 0. Integration of Eq. 20.3-11 gives as the thickness function for the diffusional boundary layer. Since Eq. 20-3-9 and the bound- ary conditions then contain 7 as the only independent variable, the postulated combination of variables is valid, and the concentration profiles are given by the solution of Eq. 20.3-9: 2T f(7) = 1 - -- exp (-7') dTj = 1 - erfq * 0 Equations 20.3-12 and 13 are the solution to the problem at hand. Next, we combine this solution with Fick's first law to evaluate the molar flux of species A at the interface: This result shows the same dependence of the mass flux on the .$power of the diffusivity that arose in Eq. 18.5-17, for the much simpler gas absorption problem solved there. In fact, if we set the scale factors h, and h, equal to unity and replace v, by v,,,, we recover Eq. 18.5-17 exactly. .le Near the Mass-Transfer Surface This velocity function is appropriate for mass transfer at a solid surface (see Example 12.4-3) when the concentration boundary layer is very thin. Here v, depends linearly on y within the concentration boundary layer, and vy can be obtained from the equation of continuity. Consequently, when the net mass flux through the interface is small, the ve- locity components in the concentration boundary layer are in which y depends on x and z. Substituting these expressions into Eq. 20.3-2 gives the diffusion equation for the liquid phase which is to be solved with the boundary conditions B.C. 1: B.C. 2: B.C. 3: atx = 0, CA = 0 aty = 0, C~ = C~o asy+m, cA+O Once again, we use the method of combination of variables, by setting cA/cA0 = f(q), where 7 = y/SA(x, z). When the change of variables is made, the diffusion equation becomes 636 Chapter 20 Concentration Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable EXAMPLE 20.3-1 Mass Transfer for Creeping Flow Around a Gas Bubble with the boundary conditions: f(0) = 1 and f(m) = 0. A solution of the form f(q) is possi- ble only if the factor in parentheses is a constant. Setting the constant equal to 3 reduces Eq. 20.3-21 to Eq. 18.6-6, for which the solution is known. Therefore we now get the boundary layer thickness by requiring that The solution of this first-order, linear equation for 61 is Hence the solution to the problem in this subsection is < /vmexp (-ij3) dij c A - = f(q) = C~~ r (3 which reduces to Eq. 18.6-10 for the system considered there. Finally, we get the expression for the molar flux at the interface, which is For a plane surface, with h, = h, = 1 and P = constant, Eq. 20.3-26 reduces to Eq. 18.6-11. A liquid B is flowing very slowly around a spherical bubble of gas A of radius R. Find the rate of mass transfer of A into the surrounding fluid, if the solubility of gas A in liquid B is c~,. (a) Show how to use Eq. 20.3-14 to get the mass flux at the gas-liquid interface for this system. (b) Then get the average mass flux over the entire spherical surface. SOLUTION (a) Select as the origin of coordinates the upstream stagnation point, and define the coordi- nates x and z as follows: x = RO and z = R(sin 8)4, in which 6 and 4 are the usual spherical coordinates. The y direction is then the same as the r direction of spherical coordinates. The interfacial velocity is obtained from Eq. 4B.3-3 as v, = iv, sin 8, where v, is the approach velocity. When these quantities are inserted into Eq. 20.3-14 we get (R sin 13)~(iv, sin 8)' 0 = (R)(R sin 8)2(:v, sin 8)d(R8) s20.4 Boundary Layer Mass Transport with Complex Interfacial Motion 637 (b) To get the surface-averaged value of the mass flux, we integrate the above expression over all 8 and 4 and divide by the sphere surface: R sin 8 d8 d+ In going from the second to the third line, we made the change of variable cos 8 = u, and to get the fourth line, we factored out (1 - u) from the numerator and denominator. Equa- tion 20.3-28 was cited in Eq. 18.5-20 in connection with absorption from gas bubbles.' This equation is referred to again in Chapter 22 in connection with the subject of mass transfer coefficients. 520.4 BOUNDARY LAYER MASS TRANSPORT WITH COMPLEX INTERFACIAL Time-dependent interfacial motions and turbulence are common in fluid-fluid transfer operations. Boundary layer theory gives useful insight and asymptotic relations for these systems, utilizing the thinness of the concentration boundary layers for small 9,, (as in liquids) or for flows with frequent boundary layer separation (as at rippling or oscillating interfaces). Mass transfer with simple interfacial motions has been discussed in 918.5 for a laminar falling film and a circulating bubble, and in Example 20.1-4 for a uniformly ex- panding interface. Here we consider mass transfer with more general interfacial motions. Consider the time-dependent transport of species A between two fluid phases, with initially uniform but different compositions. We start with the binary continuity equa- tion for constant p and 9,, (Eq. 19.1-16, divided by p): We now want to reduce this to boundary layer form for small %,,, and then present so- lutions for various forced-convection problems with controlling resistance in one phase. We use the following boundary layer approximations: (i) that the diffusive mass flux is collinear with the unit vector n normal to the nearest interfacial element. (This approximation is used throughout the bound- ary layer sections of this book. Higher-order approximations: not treated here, are appropriate for describing boundary layer diffusion near edges, wakes, and separation loci.) 9. G.

(This approximation is satisfactory for fluid-fluid systems free of surfactants, when the interfacial drag is not too large.) (iii) that the concentration boundary layer along each interface is thin relative to the local radii of interfacial curvature. (iv) that the concentration boundary layers on nonadjacent interfacial elements do not overlap. Each of these approximations is asymptotically valid for small 9,, in nonrecirculating flows with nonrigid interfaces and nonzero Dw,/Dt-that is, with time-dependent con- centration as viewed by an observer moving with the fluid. The systems considered in part (a) of 520.3 are thus included, because they are time-dependent for such an observer (though steady for a stationary one). Interfacially embedded coordinates are used in this discussion, with a piecewise smooth interfacial grid as in Fig. 20.4-1. Each interfacial element in the system is perma- nently labeled with surface coordinates (u, w), and its position vector is r,(u, w, t). Each point in a boundary layer is identified by its distance y from the nearest interfacial point, together with the surface coordinates (u, w) of that point. The instantaneous position vector of each point (u, w, y) at time t is then relative to a stationary origin, as illustrated in Fig. 20.4-2. The function r,(u, w, t) gives the trajectory of each interfacial point (u, w, O), and the associated function n(u, w, t) = (d/dy)r gives the instantaneous normal vector from each surface element toward its posi- tive side. These functions are computable from fluid mechanics for simple flows, and provide a framework for analyzing experiments in complex flows. Drop 1 Drop 2 Composite drop Fig. 20.4-1.

The second equality follows because n is collinear with the vector product of the local interfacial base vectors, which lie in the plane of the interface. Correspondingly, the instantaneous area of the interfacial element du dw in Fig. 20.4-2 is in which s(u, w, t) is the following product of the interfacial basis vectors: 640 Chapter 20 Concentration Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable In these interfacially embedded coordinates, the mass average velocity V relative to sta- tionary coordinate axes takes the form In this section, v is the mass average fluid velocity relative to an observer at (u, w, y), and (d/at)r(u, w, y, t) is the velocity of that observer relative to the stationary origin. Taking the divergence of this equation gives the corollary2 (see Problem 20D.5) This equation states that the divergence of V differs from that of v by the local rate of ex- pansion or contraction of the embedded coordinate frame. The last term in Eq. 20.4-8 arises when interfacial deformation occurs. Its omission in such problems gives inaccurate predictions, which ~igbie~ and ~anckwerts~,~ then ad- justed by introducing hypothetical surface residence times5f6 or surface rej~venation.~ Such hypotheses are not needed in the present analysis. ~pplication'of Eq. 20.4-8 at y = 0 and use of the constant-density condition along with the no-slip condition on the tangential part of v, gives the derivative Hence, the truncated Taylor expansion describes the normal component of v in an incompressible fluid near a deforming interface. The corresponding expansion for the tangential part of v gives in which B 11 (u, w, t) is the interfacial y-derivative of v 11. With these results (neglecting the 0(y2) terms) and approximation (i), we can write Eq. 20.4-1 for wA(u, w, y, t) as Here (V, n) is the surface divergence of n at the nearest interfacial point and is the sum of the principal curvatures of the surface there. The + . . . stands for terms of higher order, which are here neglected. To select the dominant terms in Eq. 20.4-13, we introduce a dimensionless coordinate ' R. Higbie, Trans.

When Eq. 20.4-14 is written in terms of this new variable, we get for w, in terms of u, w, Y, and t. Since, on physical grounds, K will decrease with decreas- ing %ABf the dominant terms for small gAB are those of lowest order in K-namely, all but the B 11 and (V, . n) contributions. The subdominance of the latter terms confirms the as- ymptotic validity of approximations (ii) and (iii) in non-recirculating flows. Now, the coefficients of all the dominant terms must be proportional over the range of BAB, in order that these terms remain of comparable size in the small-EbAB limit. Such a \"dominant balance principle\" was applied previously in 513.6. Here it gives the orders of magnitude 9AB/~2 = o(1) and V~,/K = o(1) (20.4-16, 17) for the terms of the lowest order with respect to K. Equation 20.4-16 is consistent with the previous examples of $power dependence of the diffusional boundary layer thickness on 9,, in free-surface flows. It also confirms the asymptotic correctness of assumption (iv) for small values of aAB. Equation 20.4-17 is consistent with the proportionality of v: to shown under Eq. 20.1-10 for the Arnold problem. Thus, the boundary layer equation for o, in either phase near a deforming interface is to lowest order in K. At the next order of approximation, terms proportional to K would appear, and these involve the tangential velocity yB I and the interfacial curvature (V, n). The latter term appears in Problems 20C.1 and 20C.2. Multiplication of Eq. 20.4-18 by p/MA (a constant for the assumptions made here), and use of z as the coordinate normal to the interface as in Example 20.1-1, give the cor- responding equation for the molar concentration cA(u, w, z, t) which allows convenient extension of several earlier examples. Another useful corollary is the binary boundary layer equation in terms of xA and v* in which c and 9IAB have been treated as constants, as in Example 20.1-1. EXAMPLE 20.4-1 Mass Transfer with Equation 20.4-19 readily gives a generalized form of Eq. 20.1-65, by omitting the reaction source term RA and neglecting the normal velocity term v,, (thus assuming the interfacial net mass flux to be small). The equation thus obtained has the form of Eq. 20.1-65, except Nonuniform Interfacial that the total surface growth rate d In S/dt is replaced by the local growth rate, given by Deformation d In s(u, w, t)/dt. The resulting partial differential equation has two additional space vari- ables (u and w), but is solvable in the same manner, since no derivatives with respect to the added variables appear. 642 Chapter 20 Concentration Distributions with More Than One Independent Variable SOLUTION Rewriting Eq. 20.1-66 with a boundary layer thickness function Nu, w, t) leads by analogous steps to the relation EXAMPLE 20.4-2 Gas Absorption with Rapid Reaction and Intetfacial Deformation and the corresponding generalizations of Eqs. 20.1-71 and 72: CA -- z - 1 - erf (20.4-22) c~~ d4?bAB Sb [s(u, Wr ~)/s(u, W/ t)12 di These solutions, unlike Eq. 20.1-71 and Eq. 20.1-72, include the spatial variations of the boundary layer thickness and interfacial molar flux NAZO that occur in nonuniform flows. Local stretching of the interface (as at stagnation loci) thins the boundary layer and enhances NAzO. Local interfacial shrinkage (at separation loci) diminishes NAz0, but also ejects stale fluid from the boundary layer, allowing its mixing into the interior of the same phase. Observa- tions of mass transler enhancement by such mixing have been interpreted by some workers as \"surface renewal,\" even though creation of new surface elements in an existing surface is not permitted in continuum fluid mechanics. These results, and others for negligible v,,, are obtainable conveniently by introducing the following new variables into Eq. 20.4-19: Z = ZS(U, W, t) and 7 = (20.4-24/25) In the absence of chemical reactions, the resulting differential equation for the concentration function c,(u, w, Z, 7) becomes This is a generalization of Fick's second law to an asymptotic relation for forced convection in free-surface flows. Show how to generalize Example 20.1-2 to flow systems, by using Eq. 20.4-26 for the two re- action-free zones. SOLUTION Using Eq. 20.4-26, we get the following replacements for Eqs. 20.1-26 and 27: Now the reaction plane z = z, of the original example is a time-dependent suuface, Z = Z,, or z,(u, w, t) = Z,/S(U, W, t). The initial and boundary conditions remain as before, subject to this generalization of the reaction-front location. The solutions for c, and cB then take the forms in Eqs. 20.1-35 and 36, with z/lh replaced by z/G, and zR/~ by qY. The latter constant is again given by Eq. 20.1-37. The enhance- ment of the absorption rate by the chemical reaction accordingly parallels the expressions that will be given in Eq. 22.5-10, and simplified in Eqs. 22.5-11 through 13. s20.5 \"Taylor Dispersion\" in Laminar Tube Flow 643 I Fig. 20.5-1.

A pulse of mass m, is introduced at the inlet z = 0 over a very short period near time t = 0, and its progress through the tube is to be analyzed in the long- time limit. Problems of this type arise frequently in process control (see Problem 20C.41, medical diagnostic procedures,' and in a variety of environmental applications.2 A short distance downstream from the inlet, the &dependence of the mass fraction distribution will die out.

No exact analytical solution is available for the mass fraction profile wA(r, z, t)-even if an initial condition were clearly formulated-but Tay- l0$r4 gave a useful approximate analysis that we summarize here.

Here (v,) = $v,,,,~ is the mean speed of the flow. Taylor sought a solution valid for long times. He estimated the condition for the va- lidity of his result to be When the pulse length Lp attains this range, enough time has elapsed that the initial shape of the pulse no longer matters. In order to follow the development of the concentration profile as the fluid moves downstream, it is useful to introduce the shifted axial coordinate When this is used in Eq. 20.5-1 (without the dashed-underlined term), we get the follow- ing diffusion equalion for wA(rf Z, t), in which 6 = r/R is the dimensionless radial coordinate. The time derivative here is under- stood to be taken at constant 2, and, under the condition of Eq. 20.5-4, it may be neglected relative to the radial diffusion term. As a result we have a quasi-steady-state equation For the condition of Eq. 20.5-4, the mass fraction can be expressed as where (w,) is a function of 2 and t. Substituting this expression into the right side of Eq. 20.5-7, and accordingly neglecting wi, we then get from which the radial dependence of the mass fraction can be obtained under the condi- tion of Eq. 20.5-4. Integration of Eq. 20.5-9 with the boundary conditions of Eq. 20.5-2 then yields The average of this profile over the cross section is fl Subtracting this equation from the previous one, and replacing v,,,,, by 2(vz), gives finally as Taylor's approximate solution of Eq. 20.5-6. 520.5 \"Taylor Dispersion\" in Laminar Tube Flow 645 The total mass flow of A through a plane of constant Z (that is, the flow relative to the average velocity (v,)) is Next we note that, with the assumption of p = constant, p(wA(vz)) = (pA)(v,) and p(oAvz) = (pAvA,) = (nAz). (Replacing v, by VAz is allowed here because, with axial mol- ecular diffusion neglected, species A and B are moving with the same axial speed). Therefore when Eq. 20.5-13 is divided by TR~, we obtain the averaged mass flux expression relative to stationary coordinates. Here K is an axial dispersion coefficient, given by Tay- lor's analysis as This formula indicates that axial dispersion (in the range P6 >> 1 considered so far) is enhanced by the radial variation of v, and reduced by radial molecular diffusion. Although Eq. 20.5-14 has the form of Fick's law in Eq. (C) of Table 17.8-2, the present equation does not include any axial molecular diffusion. Also it should be emphasized that K is not a property of the fluid mixture, but depends on R and (v,) as well as on %,,. Next we write the equation of continuity of Eq. 19.1-6, averaged over the tube cross section, as When the expression for the mass flux of A from Eq. 20.5-14 is inserted, we get the fol- lowing axial dispersion equation: This equation can be solved to get the shape of the traveling pulse resulting from a 6- function input of a mass m~ of solute A into a stream of otherwise pure B: This can be used along with Eq. 20.5-15 to extract gAB from data on the concentrations in the traveling pulse. In fact, this is probably the best method for reasonably quick mea- surements of liquid diffusivities. Taylor's development laid the foundation for an extensive literature on convective dis- persion.

From this result, we see that molecular diffusion enhances the axial dispersion when the Pkclet number Pk = R(V,)/%~ is less than V'% and inhibits axial dispersion at larger Peclet numbers, where Taylor's mode of transport predominates.

For turbulent flows in straight tubes, Taylor15 derived and experimentally verified the axial dispersion formula K/Rv* = 10.1, where v* is the friction velocity used in Eq. 5.3-2. Bassingthwaighte and Goresky' investigated models of solute and water exchange in the cardiovascular sys- tem, and Chatwin and Allen2 give mathematical models of turbulent dispersion in rivers and estuaries. Equations 20.5-1 and 19 are limited to the conditions of Eqs. 20.5-2 and 4. Therefore, they are not appropriate for describing entrance regions of steady-state reactor opera- tions or systems with heterogeneous reactions. Equation 20.5-1 is a better starting point for laminar flows. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1.

Problems 649 20A.4. Effect of bubble size on interfacial composition (Fig. 20A.2). Here we examine the assump- tion of time-independent interfacial composition, WA~, for the system in Fig. 20A.2. We note that, because of the interfacial tension, the gas pressure p, depends on the instantaneous bubble radius r,. The equilibrium expression is adequate unless dr,/dt is very large. Here p, is the ambient liquid pressure at the mean ele- vation of the bubble, and CT is the interfacial tension. For a sparingly soluble solute, the interfacial liquid composition WAO depends on pA ac- cording to Henry's law in which the Henry's law constant, H, depends on the two species and on the liquid tempera- ture and pressure.

A semi-infinite medium of material B extends from the plane boundary x = 0 to x = m.

Dissociation of a gas caused by a temperature gradient. A dissociating gas (for example, Na, + 2Na) is endosed in a tube, sealed at both ends, and the two ends are maintained at dif- ferent temperatures. Because of the temperature gradient established, there will be a continu- ous flow of Na, molecules from the cold end to the hot end, where they dissociate into Na atoms, which in turn flow from the hot end to the cold end.

Critical size of an autocatalytic system. It is desired to use the result of Example 20.1-3 to dis- cuss the critical size of a system in which an \"autocatalytic reaction\" is occurring. In such a sys- tem the reaction products increase the rate of reaction. If the ratio of the system surface to the system volume is large, then the reaction products tend to escape from the boundaries of the sys- tem. If the surface to volume ratio is small, however, the rate of escape may be less than the rate of creation, and the reaction rate will increase rapidly. For a system of a given shape, there will be a critical size for which the rate of production just equals the rate of removal. One example is that of nuclear fission. In a nuclear pile the rate of fission depends on the local neutron concentration. If neutrons are produced at a rate that exceeds the rate of escape by diffusion, the reaction is self-sustaining and a nuclear explosion occurs. Similar behavior is also encountered in many chemical systems, although the behavior here is generally more complicated. An example is the thermal decomposition of acetylene gas, which is thermodynamically unstable according to the overall reaction. This reaction appears to proceed by a branched-chain, free-radical mechanism, in which the free radicals behave qualitatively as the neutrons in the preceding paragraph, so that the de- composition is autocatalytic. However, the free radicals are effectively neutralized by contact with an iron surface, so that the free-radical concentration is maintained near zero at such a surface. Acetylene gas can then be stored safely in an iron pipe below a \"critical\" diameter, which is smaller the higher the pressure or temperature of the gas. If the pipe is too large, the formation of even one free radical is likely to cause a rapidly increasing rate of decomposition, which may result in a serious explosion.

Turbulent mixing and turbulent flow with second-order reaction In preceding chapters we have derived the equations for diffusion in a fluid or solid, and we have shown how one can obtain expressions for the concentration distribution, pro- vided no fluid turbulence is involved. Next we turn our attention to mass transport in turbulent flow. The discussion here is quite similar to that in Chapter 13, and much of that material can be taken over by analogy. Specifically, 5513.4, 13.5, and 13.6 can be taken over di- rectly by replacing heat transfer quantities by mass transfer quantities. In fact, the prob- lems discussed in those sections have been tested more meaningfully in mass transfer, since the range of experimentally accessible Schmidt numbers is considerably greater than that for Prandtl numbers. We restrict ourselves here to isothermal binary systems, and make the assumption of constant mass density and diffusivity. Therefore the partial differential equation de- scribing diffusion in a flowing fluid (Eq. 19.1-16) is of the same form as that for heat con- duction in a flowing fluid (Eq. 11.2-9), except for the inclusion of the chemical reaction term in the former. ,1 CONCENTRATION FLUCTUATIONS AND THE TIME-SMOOTHED CONCENTRATION The discussion in 513.1 about temperature fluctuations and time-smoothing can be taken over by analogy for the molar concentration c,. In a turbulent stream, c, will be a rapidly oscillating function that can be written as the sum of a time-smoothed value ZA and a tur- bulent concentration fluctuation c: which is analogous to Eq. 13.1-1 for the temperature. -- By virtue of the definition of c; we see that = 0. However, quantities such as vick, v$;, and a are not zero, because the local fluctuations in concentration and velocity are not independent of one another. The time-smoothed concentration profiles G(x, y, z, t) are those measured, for exam- ple, by the withdrawal of samples from the fluid stream at various points and various 658 Chapter 21 Concentration Distributions in Turbulent Flow times. In tube flow with mass transfer at the wall, one expects that the time-smoothed concentration CA will vary only slightly with position in the turbulent core, where the transport by turbulent eddies predominates. In the slowly moving region near the bound- ary surface, on the other hand, the concentration % will be expected to change within a small distance from its turbulent-core value to the wall value. The steep concentration gradient is then associated with the slow molecular diffusion process in the viscous sub- layer in contrast to the rapid eddy transport in the turbulent core. 521.2 TIME-SMOOTHING OF THE EQUATION OF CONTINUITY OF A We begin with the equation of continuity for species A, which we presume is disappearing by an nth-order chemical reaction.' Equation 19.1-16 then gives, in rectangular coordinates, Here kr is the reaction rate coefficient for the nth-order chemical reaction, and is pre- sumed to be independent of position. In subsequent equations we shall consider n = 1 and n = 2 to emphasize the difference between reactions of first and higher order. When cA is replaced by & + c;, and vi by Ei + ul!, we obtain after time-averaging Comparison of this equation with Eq. 21.2-1 indicates that the time-smoothed equation differs in the appearance - of some extra terms, marked here with dashed underlines. The terms containing vlc; describe the turbulent mass transport and we designate them by FA!, the ith component of the turbulent molar flux vector. We have now met the third of the turbulent fluxes, and we may summarize their components thus: - - turbulent molar flux (vector) Ti; = ui c; (21.2-3) - - turbulent momentum flux (tensor) .$) = Pv;v; (21.2-4) - turbulent heat flux (vector) 4i ct) - -P c v!~t (21.2-5) All of these are defined as fluxes with respect to the mass average velocity. It is interesting to note that there is an essential difference between the behaviors of chemical reactions of different orders. The first-order reaction has the same form in the time-smoothed equation as in the original equation. The second-order reaction, on the other hand, contributes on time-smoothing an extra term -k;\"c, this being the manifes- tation of the interaction between the chemical kinetics and the turbulent fluctuations. We now summarize all three of the time-smoothed equations of change for turbu- lent flow of an isothermal, binary fluid mixture with constant p, gA,, and p: continuity (V -5) = 0 (21.2-6) motion continuity of A Here J$) = and it is understood that the op'erator DIE is to be written with the time-smoothed velocity V in it.

To solve mass transport problems in turbulent flow, it may be useful to postulate a relation be- tween 2; and the time-smoothed concentration gradient. A number of empirical expres- sions can be found in the literature, but we present here only the two most popular ones. Eddy Diffusivity By analogy with Fick's first law of diffusion, we may write as the defining equation for the turbulent diffusivity @&, also called the eddy diffusivity. As is the case with the eddy viscosity and the eddy thermal conductivity, the eddy diffusiv- ity is not a physical property characteristic of the fluid, but depends on position, direc- tion, and the nature of the flow field. The eddy diffusivity 92)B and the eddy kinematic viscosity v\"' = p't'/p have the same dimensions-namely, length squared divided by time. Their ratio is a dimensionless quantity, known as the turbulent Schmidt number. As is the case with the turbulent Prandtl number, the turbulent Schmidt number is of the order of unity (see the discussion in 513.3). Thus the eddy diffusivity may be estimated by replacing it by the turbulent kinematic viscosity, about which a fair amount is known. This is done in 921.4, which follows. The Mixing-Length Expression of Prandtl and Taylor According to the mixing-length theory of Prandtl, momentum, energy, and mass are all transported by the same mechanism. Hence by analogy with Eqs. 5.4-4 and 13.3-3 we may write where I is the Prandtl mixing length introduced in Chapter 5. The quantity 121 dE,/dyl ap- pearing here corresponds to 9zL of Eq. 21.3-1, and to the expressions for v'\" and a'\" im- plied by Eqs. 5.4-4 and 13.3-3. Thus, the mixing-length theory satisfies the Reynolds annIogy v(f) = = 9\") AB, or ~r'~) = SC\") = 1. 521.4 ENHANCEMENT OF MASS TRANSFER BY A FIRST-ORDER REACTION IN TURBULENT FLOW' We now examine the effect of the chemical reaction term in the turbulent diffusion equa- tion. Specifically we study the effect of the reaction on the rate of mass transfer at the wall for steadily driven turbulent flow in a tube, where the wall (of material A) is slightly ' 0. T. Hanna, 0. C. Sandall, and C. L. Wilson, Ind. Eng. Chem. Research, 26,2286-2290 (1987). An analogous problem dealing with falling films is given by 0. C. Sandall, 0. T. Hanna, and F. J. Valeri, Chem. Eng. Communications, 16,135-147 (1982). 660 Chapter 21 Concentration Distributions in Turbulent Flow soluble in the fluid (a liquid B) flowing through the tube. Material A dissolves in liquid B and then disappears by a first-order reaction. We shall be particularly interested in the behavior with high Schmidt numbers and rapid reaction rates. For tube flow with axial symmetry and with EA independent of time, Eq. 21.2-8 becomes Here we have made the customary assumption that the axial transport by both molecu- lar and turbulent diffusion can be neglected. We want to find the mass transfer rate at the wall where CA~ and are the concentrations of A at the wall and at the tube axis. As pointed out in the preceding section, the turbulent diffusivity is zero at the wall, and consequently does not appear in Eq. 21.4-2. The quantity kc is a mass transfer coefficient, analogous to the heat transfer coefficient h. The coefficient h was discussed in Chapter 14 and mentioned in Chapter 9 in connection with \"Newton's law of cooling.\" As a first ap- proximation' we take to be zero, assuming that the reaction is sufficiently rapid that the diffusing species never reaches the tube axis; then dZA/dr must also be zero at the tube axis. After analyzing the system under this assumption, we will relax the as- sumption and give computations for a wider range of reaction rates. We now define the dimensionless reactant concentration C = ZA/cA0. Then under the further assumption' that, for large z, the concentration will be independent of z, Eq. 21.4-1 becomes This equation may now be multiplied by r and integrated from an arbitrary position to the tube wall to give Here the boundary conditions at r = 0 have been used, as well as the definition of the mass transfer coefficient. Then a second integration from r = 0 to r = R gives Here we have used the boundary conditions C = 0 at r = 0 and C = 1 at r = R. Next we introduce the variable y = R - r, since the region of interest is right next to the wall. Then we get in which C(y) is not the same function of iJi as C(7) is of 7. For large Sc the integrands are important only in the region where y << R, so that R - y may be safely approximated by R. Furthermore, we can use the fact that the turbulent diffusivity in the neighborhood g21.4 Enhancement of Mass Transfer by a First-Order Reaction in Turbulent Flow 661 of the wall is proportional to the third power of the distance from the wall. When the in- tegrals are rewritten in terms of a = y/R, we get the dimensionless equation This equation contains several dimensionless groupings: the Schmidt number Sc = v/9,,, a dimensionless reaction-rate parameter Rx = k;\"R2/v, and a dimensionless mass transfer coefficient Sh = k,D/gAB known as the Sherwood number (D being the tube diameter). In the limit that Rx + m, the solution to Eq. 21.4-3 under the given boundary condi- tions is C = exp(-Shu/2). Substitution of this solution into Eq. 21.4-7 then gives after straightforward integration in which This can be solved' to give Sh as a function of Sc, Rx, and K. The foregoing solution of Eq. 21.4-3 is reasonable when Sc, Rx, and z are sufficiently large, and is an improvement over the result given by Vieth, Porter and Sherwo~d.~ However, in the absence of chemical reaction, Eq. 21.4-3 fails to describe the downstream increase of C caused by the transfer of species A into the fluid. Thus, the mass-transfer enhancement by the chemical reaction cannot be assessed realistically from the results of either Ref. 1 or Ref. 2. For a better analysis of the enhancement problem, we use Eq. 21.4-1 to get a more complete differential equation for C: The assumption that C = 0 at r = 0 is then replaced by the zero-flux condition dC/dr = 0 there. We represent '3:b in this geometry as l2 IdEJdrl for fully developed flow, by use of a position-dependent mixing length 1 as in Eq. 21.3-3. Introducing dimensionless nota- tions v+ = EJv,, z+ = zv,/v, r+ = rv,/v, and It' = lv,/v based on the friction velocity v, = of 95.3, we can then express Eq. 21.4-11 in the dimensionless form in which a Damkohler number Da = kyv/v$ has been introduced. An excellent model for the mixing length 1 is available in Eq. 5.4-7, developed by Hanna, Sandall, and Mazet3 by modifying the model given by van Drie~t.~ This model -- W. R. Vieth, J. H.

Such a function is obtainable by integrating the differential equation in the dimensionless variables u+ = &/u, and y+ = yvJv of Fig. 5.5-3, with the bound- ary conditions uf = 0 at y+ = 0 (the wall) and du+/dy+ = 0 at y+ = R+ (the centerline). Equation 21.4-13 is obtained (see Problem 21B.5) by combining the cylindrical-coordinate versions of Eqs. 5.5-3 and 5.4-4 with the dimensionless form of the mixing-length model shown in Eq. 5.4-7. Equation 21.4-13 is solvable via the qua- dratic formula to give and v+ is then computable by quadrature using, for example, the subroutines trapzd and qtrap of Press et aL5 The resulting v+ function closely resembles the plotted line in Fig. 5.5-3, with small changes near y' = 30 where the plotted line has a slope discontinuity, and near the centerline where the calculated v+ function attains a maximum value de- pendent on the dimensionless wall radius R+ whereas the line in Fig. 5.5-3 improperly does not. Equations 21.4-12 through 15 were solved numerically6 for fully developed flow of a fluid of kinematic viscosity v = 0.6581 cm2/s in a smooth tube of 3 cm inner diameter, at Re = 10,000, Sc = 200 and various Damkohler numbers Da. These calculations were done with the software package Athena Visual W~rkbench.~ The resulting Sherwood numbers Sh = kcD/9,,, based on kc as defined in Eq. 21.4-2, are plotted in Fig. 21.4-1 as Axial position, zi Fig. 21.4-1.

These results lead to the following conclusions: 1. In the absence of reaction (that is, when Da = O), the Sherwood number falls off rapidly with increasing distance into the mass-transfer region. This behavior is consistent with the results of Sleicher and ribu us' for a corresponding heat trans- fer problem, and confirms that the convection term of Eq. 21.4-11 is essential for this system. This term was neglected in References 2 and 3 by regarding the con- centration profiles as \"fully developed.\" 2. In the presence of a pseudo-first-order homogeneous reaction of the solute (that is, when Da > O), the Sherwood number falls off downstream less rapidly, and ulti- mately attains a constant asymptote that depends on the Damkohler number. Thus, the enhancement factor, defined as Sh (with reaction)/Sh (without reaction), can increase considerably with increasing distance into the mass-transfer region. g21.5 TURBULENT MIXING AND TURBULENT FLOW WITH SECOND-ORDER REACTION We now consider processes occurring within turbulent fluid systems, with particular ref- erence to the two mixers shown in Fig. 12.5-1. In Fig. 12.5-l(a) is shown a steady state sys- fem, in which two input streams enter a system of fixed geometry at constant rates, and in Fig. 12.5-l(b) an unsteady state system, in which two initially stationary, segregated, miscible fluids are mixed by turning an impeller at a constant angular velocity, starting at time t = 0. One stream [in (a)] or one initial region [in (b)] contains solute A in solvent S, and the other contains solute B in solvent S. All solutions are sufficiently dilute that the solutes do not appreciably affect the viscosity, density, or species diffusivities. Then the behavior of the solute (A or B) in either system [(a) or (b)] is described by the non-time- smoothed diffusion equations with suitable initial and boundary conditions. For these systems, we may write that at z = 0 [in (a)] or t = 0 [in (b)] C, = C,O and c, = 0 (21.5-3,4) over the A inlet port [in (a)] or the initial region [in (b)], and C, = cBO and c, = 0 (21.5-5,6) over the B inlet port [in (a)] or the initial region [in (b)]. In addition, we consider all con- fining surfaces to be inert and impenetrable.' No Reaction Occurring For this situation, the terms RA and RB are identically zero. We now define a single new independent variable C. A. Sleicher and M. Tribus, Trans. ASME, 79,789-797 (1957). In system (a), these boundary conditions are only approximations. The indicated values of c~ and c, are regarded as asymptotic values for z << 0. 664 Chapter 21 Concentration Distributions in Turbulent Flow Then both Eqs. 21.5-1 and 2 take the following form over the whole system: Here the subscript i can represent either solute A or solute B, and r = 0 for (a) the entering A-rich stream, or (b) initially A-rich region (21.5-9) r = 1 for (a) the entering B-rich stream, or (b) initially B-rich region (21.5-10) It follows that, for equal diffusivities, the time-smoothed concentration profiles, - T(x, y, z, t) are identical for both solutes, where However, the fluctuating quantities r' are also of interest, as they are measures of \"un- mixedness.\" These can be equal only in a statistical sense. To show this, we subtract Eq. 21.5-11 from Eq. 21.5-7, and then square the result and time-smooth it to give Here d(x, y, z, t) is a dimensionless decay function, which decreases toward zero at large z [for the motionless mixer in Fig. 21.5-l(a)I, or at large t [for the mixing tank of Fig. 21.5- I@)]. Cross-sectional averages of this quantity can be measured, and are shown in Fig. 21.5-2. It remains to determine the functional dependence of the decay function, and to do this we introduce the dimensionless variables: Then Eq. 21.5-8 becomes Dr - 1 +zr D ReSc in which Re = I,u,p/p. In order to be able to draw specific conclusions, we now focus our attention on mix- ing tanks [see Fig. 21.5(b)], and further assume low-viscosity liquids and low-molecular- weight solutes. For these systems 1, is normally chosen to be the diameter of the impeller, and v, to be I&, where N is the rate of impeller rotation in revolutions per unit time. 1 B+ Fig. 21.5-1.

The decay function for a specific device for the mixing of two streams emerging from a tube and from an annular region. This figure is patterned after one by E. L. Cus- sler, Diffusion: Mass Transfer in Fluid Systems, Cambridge University Press (1997), p. 422, based on data of R. S. Brodkey, Turbulence in Mixing Opera- tions, Academic Press, New York (1975), p. 65, Fig. 6, upper curve. The radius of the outer tube is fi times that of the inner one. It is now useful to consider experience gained in the study of such systems and to classify the overall mixing process as follow^:^ (i) macromixing, in which large-scale motions spread the A-rich and B-rich fluids over the entire tank region, into subregions that are large compared to the dis- tances solute molecules have moved by diffusion. (ii) micromixing, in which diffusion provides the final blending over scales of mole- cular dimensions. It has been found1 that macromixing is normally much the slower process, and this ob- servation can be explained in terms of dimensional analysis. This finding is consistent with experience in large-scale mixing. For industrial systems, Reynolds numbers are normally well over lo4 and Schmidt numbers on the order of lo5. The diffusion term in Eq. 21.5-14 thus tends to be small al- most everywhere in the system. This term is negligible during the period of macromix- ing, where diffusion, and hence the Schmidt number, have no significant effect. Then for many practical purposes one may write We may then relax the requirement of equal diffusivities in extrapolating experience to a new system. It follows that Reynolds numbers as well as Schmidt numbers should have no significant effect on the macromixing process, and that the effective degree of un- mixedness, d2, depends mainly on the dimensionless time. For large-scale mixing tanks, this prediction is amply ~onfirmed.~ These normally operate at large Reynolds numbers (typically greater than lo4), where the large-scale mo- tions, expressed in terms of +(?, jl, if t), are observed to be independent of both Reynolds number and system size. Thus a very large number of investigators have observed using M. L. Hanks and H. L. Toor, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 34,3252-3256 (1995). J. Y. Oldshue, Fluid Mixing Technology, McGraw-Hill, New York (1983); H. Benkreira, Fluid Mixing, Institution of Chemical Engineers, Rugby, UK, Vol. 4 (1990), Vol. 6 (1999); I. Bouwmans and H. E. A. van den Akker, in Vol. 4 of Fluid Mixing, Institution of Chemical Engineers, Rugby, UK (1990), pp. 1-12. 666 Chapter 21 Concentration Distributions in Turbulent Flow many different mixer geometries, that the product of the required mixing time t,, and rotation rate N is a constant independent of mixer size and Reynolds number: That is, the required mixing time t,, corresponds, for a given tank geometry, essen- tially to the required number of turns of the impeller. This expectation is confirmed by experience. This finding is consistent with observations2 that both the dimensionless volume flow rate through the impeller, Q/ND~, and the tank friction factor, plpIV3D5, are con- stants, depending only on the tank and impeller geometries (see Problem 6C.3). Here Q is the volumetric flow in the jet produced by the impeller, and P is the power required to turn it. Similar remarks usually apply to motionless mixers, where increasing the flow ve- locities typically has little effect on the degree of mixing. However, approximations like this must be tested, and such tests should be considered as first steps in an experimental program. As a practical matter, these approximations are almost always reliable on scale-up, since Reynolds numbers normally increase with equipment size. Reaction Occurring We next consider the effects of a homogeneous, irreversible chemical reaction, and for simplicity we write this as A + B 4 products. Again we assume dilute solutions, so that the heat of reaction and the presence of reaction products have no significant effect. In addition, we assume equal diffusivities for the two solutes. We next define Then when we subtract Eq. 21.5-2 from Eq. 21.5-1, we find that the description of ~,e,cti,, is identical to that for its nonreactive counterpart. Hence By subtracting from this its time-smoothed counterpart, we find that an equation like Eq. 21.5-18 must hold for the fluctuations: (4-4) =(\") CAO + CBO reactive nonreactive The time-smoothed mean square of the quantity on the right side is equal to d2, which is measurable as illustrated in Fig. 21.5-2, and therefore we have a way of predicting the corresponding quantity for reacting systems. Equation 21.5-19 suggests that the fluctuations in cA and cB in reactive problems occur on the same time and distance scales as for nonreactive problems. Note that this is true for arbitrary geometry, flow conditions, and reaction kinetics. We are now ready to consider special cases. We begin with a fast reaction, for which the two solutes cannot coexist, and the rate of the reaction is controlled by the diffusion of the species toward each other. Then, for the first (macromixing) stage of the blending process, where diffusion is very slow com- pared to the larger-scale convective processes, there is no significant reaction. In this, typically dominant, stage of the blending process (\") =(\") reactive nonreactive Questions for Discussion 667 It has been suggested4 that Eq. 21.5-20 is also true for the micromixing stage. Where this can be assumed (e.g., in the common situation where macromixing is rate controlling), it follows that reactive and nonreactive processes lead to identical descriptions of solute fluctuations. In practice, fast reactions (e-g., neutralization of acids with bases) are often used to determine the effectiveness of mixers, as these are much easier to follow experimentally than nonreactive mixing. Frequently one can use simple macroscopic measures such as temperature rise or an indicator color change. However, the measurement of concentra- tion fluctuations can provide more insight into the nature and the course of the mixing process. Slow reactions are also important, and we consider the special case of irreversible sec- ond-order kinetics, defined by When this is time-smoothed, we get We find, therefore, that the fluctuations in solute concentration increase the time- smoothed reaction rate relative to that when a simple product of time-smoothed concen- trations is used. It is, however, difficult to assess the practical importance of this effect. We illustrate this point by a simple order-of-magnitude analysis, beginning with the definition of a reaction time constant tA for one of the reactants, here solute A: To a first approximation, we may write tA = l/krcB0 Fast and slow reactions may then be defined as those for which t,, >> tA fast reaction t,, < < tA slow reaction We have already discussed the case of fast reaction. For slow reactions, turbulence has no significant effect, because fluctuations become negligible before any appreciable reac- tion has taken place. If the mixing and reaction time constants are of the same order of magnitude, a deeper analysis than the above is needed. Such an analysis must include a model for the turbulent motion, and does not appear to be presently available. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1.

Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures Definition of transfer coefficients in one phase Analytical expressions for mass transfer coefficients Correlation of binary transfer coefficients in one phase Definition of transfer coefficients in two phases Mass transfer and chemical reactions Combined heat and mass transfer by free convection Effects of interfacial forces on heat and mass transfer Transfer coefficients at high net mass transfer rates Matrix approximations for multicomponent mass transport Here we build on earlier discussions of binary diffusion to provide means for predicting the behavior of mass transfer operations such as distillation, absorption, adsorption, ex- traction, drying, membrane filtrations, and heterogeneous chemical reactions. This chap- ter has many features in common with Chapters 6 and 14. It is particularly closely related to Chapter 14, because there are many situations where the analogies between heat and mass transfer can be regarded as exact. There are, however, important differences between heat and mass transfer, and we will devote much of this chapter to exploring these differences. Since many mass transfer operations involve fluid-fluid interfaces, we have to deal with distortions of the interfa- cial shape by viscous drag and by surface tension gradients resulting from inhomo- geneities in temperature and composition. In addition, there may be interactions between heat and mass transfer, and there may be chemical reactions occurring. Further- more, at high mass transfer rates, the temperature and concentration profiles may be dis- torted. These effects complicate and sometimes invalidate the neat analogy between heat and mass transfer that one might otherwise expect. In Chapter 14 the interphase heat transfer involved the movement of heat to or from a solid surface, or the heat transfer between two fluids separated by a solid surface. Here we will encounter heat and mass transfer between two contiguous phases: fluid-fluid or fluid-solid. This raises the question as to how to account for the resistance to diffusion provided by the fluids on both sides of the interface. We begin the chapter by defining, in 522.1, the mass and heat transfer coefficients for binary mixtures in one phase (liquid or gas). Then in 522.2 we show how analytical solutions to diffusion problems lead to explicit expressions for mass transfer coefficients. In that section we give some analytic expressions for mass transfer coefficients at high 672 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures Schmidt numbers for a number of relatively simple systems. We emphasize the different behavior of systems with fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interfaces. In 522.3 we show how dimensional analysis leads to predictions involving the Sher- wood number (Sh) and the Schmidt number (Sc), which are the analogs of the Nusselt number (Nu) and the Prandtl number (Pr) defined in Chapter 14. Here the emphasis is on the analogies between heat transfer in pure fluids and mass transfer in binary mix- tures. Then in 522.4 we proceed to the definition of mass transfer coefficients for systems with diffusion in two adjoining phases. We show there how to apply the information about mass transfer in single phases to the understanding of mass transfer between two phases. Finally, in the last five sections of the chapter, we take up some effects that are pecu- liar to mass transfer systems: mass transfer with chemical reactions (§22.5), the interac- tion of heat and mass transfer processes in free convection (§22.6), the complicating factors of interfacial tension forces and Marangoni effects (522.71, the distortions of tem- perature and concentration profiles that arise in systems with large net mass transfer rates across the interface (S22.8); and finally the matrix analysis of mass transport in mul- ticomponent systems. In this chapter the emphasis is on the non-analogous behavior of heat and mass transfer systems. In this chapter we have limited the discussion to a few key topics on mass transfer and transfer coefficient correlations. Further information is available in specialized text- books on these and related topics.14 g22.1 DEFINITION OF TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS IN ONE PHASE In this chapter we relate the rates of mass transfer across phase boundaries to the rele- vant concentration differences, mainly for binary systems. These relations are analogous to the heat transfer correlations of Chapter 14 and contain mass transfer coeficients in place of the heat transfer coefficients of that chapter. The system may have a true phase boundary, as in Fig. 22.1-1,2, or 4, or an abrupt change in hydrodynamic properties, as in the system of Fig. 22.1-3, containing a porous solid. Figure 22.1-1 shows the evapora- tion of a volatile liquid, often used in experiments to develop mass transfer correlations. Figure 22.1-2 shows a permselective membrane, in which a selectively permeable sur- face permits more effective transport of solvent than of a solute that is to be retained, as in ultrafiltration of protein solutions and the desalting of sea water. Figure 22.1-3 shows a macroscopically porous solid, which can serve as a mass transfer surface or can pro- vide sites for adsorption or reaction. Figure 22.1-4 shows an idealized liquid-vapor con- tactor where the mass transfer interface may be distorted by viscous or surface-tension forces.

Two chemical species A and B are mov- ing from the downward-flowing liquid stream into the upward-flowing gas stream in a cylindrical tube. 674 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures In each of these systems, there will be both heat and mass transfer at the interface, and each of these fluxes will have a molecular (diffusive) and a convective term (here we have moved the convective term to the left side of the equation): These equations are just Eq. 18.0-1 and Eq. 19.3-6 written at the mass transfer interface (y = 0). They describe the interphase molar flux of species A and the interphase flux of energy (excluding the kinetic energy and the contribution from [T . vl). Both NAo and e, are defined as positive for transfer into the local phase except in 522.4 where the fluxes in each phase are defined as positive for transfer toward the liquid. In Chapter 14 we defined the heat transfer coefficient in the absence of mass transfer by Eq. 14.1-1 (Q = hA AT). For surfaces with mass and heat transfer, Eqs. 22.1-1 and 2 suggest that the following definitions are appropriate: Here WAo is the number of moles of species A per unit time going through the transfer surface at y = 0, and E, is the total amount of energy going through the surface. The transfer coefficients kxA and h are not defined until the area A and the driving forces Ax, and AT have been specified. All the comments in Chapter 14 regarding these definitions may be taken over in this chapter, with the result that a subscript 1, In, a, m, or loc can be added to make clear the type of driving force that is used. In this chapter, however, we shall mainly use the local transfer coefficients and occasionally the mean transfer coeffi- cients. Also, in this chapter, molar fluxes of the species will be used, since in chemical en- gineering this is traditional. The relations between the mass-transfer expressions in molar and mass units are summarized in Table 22.2-1. Local transfer coefficients are defined by writing Eqs. 22.1-3 and 4 for a differential area. Since d WA,/dA = NAO and dE,/dA = e,, we get the definitions Next, we note that the left side of Eq. 22.1-5 is J;,, and that the left side of a similar equa- tion written for species B is J&. However, since J;, = -J& and AX, = -AxB, we find that kxA,loc = kxB,loc, and therefore we can write both mass transfer coefficients as kx,lOc, which has units of (moles)/(area)(time). - Furthermore, if the heat of mixing is zero (as in ideal gas mixtures), we can replace HA, by (?,,,(T, - To), where To is an arbitrarily chosen ref- erence temperature, as explained in Example 19.3-1. A similar replacement may be made for &,. With these changes we get We remind the reader that rapid mass transfer across phase boundaries can distort the velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles, as we have already seen in 518.2 and in Example 19.4-1. The correlations provided in s22.2, as well as their analogs in Chap- ters 6 and 14, are all for small net mass-transfer rates, that is, for situations in which the convective terms in Eqs. 22.1-7 and 8 are negligible relative to the first term. Such situa- tions are common, and most correlations in the literature suffer from the same limita- tion. In 522.8 we consider the deviations associated with high net mass-transfer rates and decorate the transfer coefficients at these conditions with a superscript \"*\" (see 522.8). 6j22.1 Definition of Transfer Coefficients in One Phase 675 In much of the chemical engineering literature, the mass transfer coefficients are de- fined by The relation of this \"apparent\" mass transfer coefficient to that defined by Eq. 22.1-7 is in which r = NBo/NAo. Other widely used mass transfer coefficients are defined by for liquids and for gases. In the limit of low solute concentrations and low net mass transfer rates, for which most correlations have been obtained, The superscript 0 indicates that these quantities are applicable only for small mass-trans- fer rates and small mole fractions of species A. In many industrial contactors, the true interfacial area is not known. An example of such a system would be a column containing a random packing of irregular solid parti- cles. In such a situation, one can define a volumetric mass transfer coefficient, kg, incor- porating the interfacial area for a differential region of the column. The rate at which moles of species A are transferred to the interstitial fluid in a volume Sdz of the column is then given by Here the interfacial area, a, per unit volume is combined with the mass transfer coeffi- cient, S is the total column cross section, and z is measured in the primary flow direction. Correlations for predicting values of these coefficients are available, but they should be used with caution. Rarely do they include all the important parameters, and as a result they cannot be safely extrapolated to new systems. Furthermore, although they are usu- ally described as \"local,\" they actually represent a poorly defined average over a wide range of interfacial We conclude this section by defining a dimensionless group widely used in the mass-transfer literature and in the remainder of this book: which is called the Sherwood number based on the characteristic length lo. This quantity can be \"decorated with subscripts 1, a, m, In, and loc in the same manner as h. ' J. Stichlmair and J. F. Fair, Distillation Principles and Practice, Wiley, New York (1998). H. Z.

From these solutions we can now derive the corresponding mass transfer coefficients. These are usually presented in dimensionless form in terms of Sherwood numbers. We summarize these analytical expressions here for use in later sections of this chapter. All of the results given in this section are for systems with a slightly soluble component A, small diffusivities %AB, and small net mass-transfer rates, as defined in 9322.1 and 8. It may be helpful at this point to refer to Table 22.2-1, where the dimensionless groups for heat and mass transfer have been summarized. Mass Transfer in Falling Films on Plane Surfaces For the absorption of a slightly soluble gas A into a falling film of pure liquid B, we can put the result of Eq. 18.5-18 into the form of Eq. 22.1-3 (appropriately modified for molar concentration units in the manner of Eq. 22.1-ll), thus Table 22.2-1 Analogies Among Heat and Mass Transfer at Low Mass-Transfer Rates Heat transfer Binary mass transfer Binary mass transfer quantities quantities (isothermal quantities (isothermal (pure fluids) fluids, molar units) fluids, mass units) Profiles T *A w A Diffusivity a = k/pCp 9 AB 9 AB Effect of profiles on density Transfer coefficient Q h=- A AT Dimensionless groups Re = I,v,p/p Re = l,v@/p common to all three Fr = v;/gl, Fr = v;/gl, correlations Dimensionless groups Nu = hlO/k Sh = kxlO/&dAB Sh = ~,~O/P~AB that are different ~r = &p/k Sc = p/pgAB Sc = p/pEbAB Gr = l&2gpAT/p2 Gr, = I&2g5A~A/p2 Gr, = l~p2g[Aw,/p2 P6 = RePr = l,v,~,/k P6 = ReSc = IOvo/9AB P6 = ReSc = I,v,,/~~, Notes: (a) The subscript 0 on I, and v, indicates the characteristic length and velocity respectively, whereas the subscript 0 on the mole (or mass) fraction and molar (or mass) flux means \"evaluated at the interface.\" (b) All three of these Grashof numbers can be written as Gr = lipg AplP2, provided that the density change is caused only by a difference of temperature or composition. 522.2 Analytical Expressions for Mass Transfer Coefficients 677 Then, when the characteristic area is chosen to be the area of the interface WL, we see that Sh, = - = 1.128(~e~c)\"~ (22.2-2) This equation expresses the Sherwood number (the dimensionless mass transfer coeffi- cient) in terms of the Reynolds number and the Schmidt number, with Re defined in terms of the maximum velocity v,,, in the film and the film length L. The Reynolds num- ber could also be defined in terms of the average film velocity with a different numerical coefficient. Similarly, for the dissolution of a slightly soluble material A from the wall into a falling liquid film of pure B, we can put Eq. 18.6-10 into the form of Eq. 22.1-3 as follows: Then, using the definition a = ~g6/p given just after Eq. 18.6-1 and the expression for the maximum velocity in the film in Eq. 2.2-19, we find the Sherwood follows: In this instance we have not only the Reynolds number and Schmidt number but also the ratio of the film length to the film thickness. number as (22.2-4) appearing, These two problems-gas absorption by a falling film and the dissolution of a solid wall into a falling film-illustrate two important situations. In the first problem, there is no velocity gradient at the gas-liquid interface, and the quantity ReSc appears to the $-power in the expression for the Sherwood number. In the second problem, there is a velocity gradient at the solid-liquid interface, and the quantity ReSc appears to the in the Sherwood number expression. Mass Transfer for Flow Around Spheres Next we consider the diffusion that occurs in the creeping flow around a spherical gas bubble and around a solid sphere of diameter D. This pair of systems parallels the two systems discussed in the previous subsection. For the gas absorption from a gas bubble surrounded by a liquid in creeping flow, we can put Eq. 20.3-28 in the form of Eq. 22.1-5 thus: The Sherwood number is then Here the Reynolds number is defined using the approach velocity v, of the fluid (or, al- ternatively, the terminal velocity of the rising bubble). 678 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures For the creeping flow around a solid sphere with a slightly soluble coating that dis- solves into the approaching fluid, we may modify the result in Eq. 12.4-34 to get This result may be rewritten in terms of the Sherwood number as As in the preceding subsection we have ReSc to the :-power for the gas-liquid system and ReSc to the $-power for the liquid-solid system. Both Eq. 22.2-6 and Eq. 22.2-8 are valid only for creeping flow. However, they are not valid in the limit that Re goes to zero. As we know from Problem 10B.l and Eq. 14.4- 5, if there is no flow past the solid sphere or the spherical bubble, Sh, = 2. It has been found that a satisfactory description of the mass transfer all the way down to Re = 0 can be obtained by using the simple superpositions: Sh,, = 2 + 0.6415(~e~c)'/~ and Sh, = 2 + 0.991 (~eSc)'/~ in lieu of Eqs. 22.2-6 and 8. Mass Transfer in Steady, Nonseparated Boundary Layers on Arbitrarily Shaped Objects For systems with a fluid-fluid interface and no velocity gradient at the interface, we found the mass flux at the surface to be given by Eq. 20.3-14: The local Sherwood number is in which the constant, 1 /G, is equal to 0.5642 and Re = lovop/p. Similarly for systems with fluid-solid interfaces and a velocity gradient at the inter- face, the mass flux expression is given in Eq. 20.3-26 as The analogous Sherwood number expression is where the numerical coefficient has the value 0.5384. In these equations 1, and v, are a characteristic length and a characteristic velocity that can be chosen after the shape of the body has been defined. Here again we see that the on ReSc appears in the fluid-fluid system, and the $-power on ReSc appears in the fluid-solid system- regardless of the shape. The radicands of the Sherwood number expressions are dimensionless. g22.3 Correlation of Binary Transfer Coefficients in One Phase 679 Mass Transfer in the Neighborhood of a Rotating Disk For a disk of diameter D coated with a slightly soluble material A rotating with angular velocity fl in a large region of liquid B, the mass flux at the surface of the disk is inde- pendent of position. According to Eq. 19D.4-7 we have This may be expressed in terms of the Sherwood number as Here the characteristic velocity in the Reynolds number is chosen to be DO. 522.3 CORRELATION OF BINARY TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS IN ONE PHASE In this section we show that correlations for binary mass transfer coefficients at low mass-transfer rates can be obtained directly from their heat transfer analogs simply by a change of notation. These correspondences are quite useful, and many heat transfer cor- relations have, in fact, been obtained from their mass transfer analogs. To illustrate the background of these useful analogies and the conditions under which they apply, we begin by presenting the diffusional analog of the dimensional analysis given in 514.3. Consider the steadily driven, laminar or turbulent isothermal flow of a liquid solution of A in B, in the tube shown in Fig. 22.3-1. The fluid enters the tube at z = 0 with velocity uniform out to very near the wall and with a uniform inlet composition XAl From z = 0 to z = L, the tube wall is coated with a solid solution of A and B, which dissolves slowly and maintains the interfacial liquid composition con- stant at xAO. For the moment we assume that the physical properties p, p, c, and 9AB are constant. The mass transfer situation just described is mathematically analogous to the heat transfer situation described at the beginning of 514.3. To emphasize the analogy, we pre- sent the equations for the two systems together. Thus the rate of heat addition by con- duction between 1 and 2 in Fig. 14.3-1 and the molar rate of addition of species A by Nozzle Fluid enters with uniform 4 composition XA, ; composition XAb2 -k - C - - assumed to be small Fig. 22.3-1. Mass transfer in a pipe with a soluble wall. 680 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures diffusion between 1 and 2 in Fig. 22.3-1 are given by the following expressions, valid for either laminar or turbulent flow: heat transfer: Equating the left sides of these equations to hl(.rrDL)(To - TI) and kxl(.rrDL)(xAo - xA1) re- spectively, we get for the transfer coefficients heat transfer: h,(t) = .rrDL(To - TI) IL o /2w(+k$r=JR o dB dz /L/2*(+c9AB$ir=J~d~dz mass transfer: kXl(f) = - xA,) We now introduce the dimensionless variables ? = r/D, i = z/D, f = (T - To)/(Tl - To), and ?A = (x, - xAO)/(xAl - xAO) and rearrange to obtain heat transfer: hlD /\"\"[\"(-g NU,@) = - = - k 2nL/Do dr ?=+ mass transfer: kXlD - / \"\" lo2\" (-5 1 di Shl(t) = 7 - ------- &JAB 2vLID o dr -,=? Here Nu is the Nusselt number for heat transfer without mass transfer, and Sh is the Sherwood number for isothermal mass transfer at small mass-transfer rates. The Nus- selt number is a dimensionless temperature gradient integrated over the surface, and the Sherwood number is a dimensionless concentration gradient integrated over the surface. These gradients can, in principle, be evaluated from Eqs. 11.5-7, 8, and 9 (for heat transfer) and Eqs. 19.5-8, 9, and 11 (for mass transfer), under the following boundary conditions (with ir and 6' defined as in 514.3 and with time averaging of the solutions if the flow is turbulent): velocity and pressure: at i = 0, ir = 6, forO~?<f \" 1 atr=,,ir=O for5 L 0 at?=Oand i=O,@ =O temperature: concentration: The boundary condition in Eq. 22.3-8, on the velocity at the wall, is accurate for the heat- transfer system and also for the mass-transfer system provided that xA&WAO + WBO) is small; the latter criterion is discussed in 5322.1 and 8. No boundary conditions are needed at the outlet plane, z = L/D, when we neglect the d2/dz2 terms of the consenra- tion equations in the manner of 34.4 and 514.3. 522.3 Correlation of Binary Transfer Coefficients in One Phase 681 If we can neglect the heat production by viscous dissipation in Eq. 11.5-9 and if there is no production of A by chemical reaction as in Eq. 19.5-11, then the differential equa- tions for heat and mass transport are analogous along with the boundary conditions. It follows then that the dimensionless profiles of temperature and concentration (time smoothed, when necessary) are similar, ? = F(F, 8,i, Re, Pr); 2, = F(?, O,i, Re, Sc) (22.3-14,15) with the same form of F in both systems. Thus, to get the concentration profiles from the temperature profiles, one replaces $! by k, and Pr by Sc. Finally, inserting the profiles into Eqs. 22.3-5 and 6 and performing the integrations and then time-averaging give for forced convection Nu, = G(Re, Pr, LID); Shl = G(Re, Sc, LID) (22.3-1 6,171 Here G is the same function in both equations. The same formal expression is obtained for Nu,, Nul,, Nu,,, as well as for the corresponding Sherwood numbers. This important analogy permits one to write down a mass transfer correlation from the corresponding heat transfer correlation merely by replacing Nu by Sh, and Pr by Sc. The same can be done for any geometry and for both laminar and turbulent flow. Note, however, that to get this analogy one has to assume (i) constant physical properties, (ii) small net mass- transfer rates, (iii) no chemical reactions, (iv) no viscous dissipation heating, (v) no ab- sorption or emission of radiant energy, and (vi) no pressure diffusion, thermal diffusion, or forced diffusion. Some of these effects will be discussed in subsequent sections of this chapter; others will be treated in Chapter 24. For free convection around objects of any given shape, a similar analysis shows that Nu, = H(Gr, Pr); Sh, = H(Gr,, Sc) (22.3-18,191 Here H is the same function in both cases, and the Grashof numbers for both processes are defined analogously (see Table 22.2-1 for a summary of the analogous quantities for heat and mass transfer). To allow for the variation of physical properties in mass transfer systems, we extend the procedures introduced in Chapter 14 for heat transfer systems. That is, we generally evaluate the physical properties at some kind of mean film composition and tempera- ture, except for the viscosity ratio pb/pO. We now give three illustrations of how to \"translate\" from heat transfer to mass transfer correlations: Forced Convection Around Spheres For forced convection around a solid sphere, Eq. 14.4-5 and its mass-transfer analog are: Nu, = 2 + 0.60 ~e~/~ Pr1/3; Sh,,, = 2 + 0.60 Sc'l3 (22.3-20,21) Equations 22.3-20 and 21 are valid for constant surface temperature and composition, re- spectively, and for small net mass-transfer rates. They may be applied to simultaneous heat and mass transfer under restrictions (i)-(vi) given after Eq. 22.3-17. Forced Convection along a Flat Plate As another illustration of the use of analogies, we can cite the extension of Eq. 14.4-4 for the laminar boundary layer along a flat plate, to include mass transfer: 682 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures The Chilton-Colburn j-factors, one for heat transfer and one for diffusion, are defined as1 The three-way analogy in Eq. 22.3-22 is accurate for Pr and Sc near unity (see Table 12.4-1) within the limitations mentioned after Eq. 22.3-17. For flow around other objects, the friction factor part of the analogy is not valid because of the form drag, and even for flow in circular tubes the analogy with ifio, is only approximate (see 514.4). The Chilton-Colburn Analogy The more widely applicable empirical analogy j, = j, = a function of Re, geometry, and boundary conditions (22.3-25) has proven to be useful for transverse flow around cylinders, flow through packed beds, and flow in tubes at high Reynolds numbers. For flow in ducts and packed beds, the \"approach velocity\" v, has to be replaced by the interstitial velocity or the superficial ve- locity. Equation 22.3-25 is the usual form of the Chilton-Colburn analogy. It is evident from Eqs. 22.3-20 and 21, however, that the analogy is valid for flow around spheres only when Nu and Sh are replaced by (Nu - 2) and (Sh - 2). It would be very misleading to leave the impression that all mass transfer coeffi- cients can be obtained from the analogous heat transfer coefficient correlations. For mass transfer we encounter a much wider variety of boundary conditions and other ranges of the relevant variables. Non-analogous behavior is addressed in gs22.5-8. A spherical drop of water, 0.05 cm in diameter, is falling at a velocity of 215 cm/s through dry, still air at 1 atm pressure with no internal circulation. Estimate the instantaneous rate of from a evaporation from the drop, when the drop surface is at To = 70°F and the air (far from the Freely Falling Drop drop) is at T, = 140°F. The vapor pressure of water at 70°F is 0.0247 atm. Assume quasi- steady state conditions. SOLUTION Designate water as species A and air as species B. The solubility of air in water may be ne- glected, so that WBO = 0. Then assuming that the evaporation rate is small, we may write Eq. 22.1-3 for the entire spherical surface as The mean mass transfer coefficient, k,,, may be predicted from Eq. 22.3-21 in the assumed ab- sence of internal circulation. The film conditions needed for estimating the physical properties are obtained as follows: T. H. Chilton and A. P. Colburn, Ind. Eng. Chem., 26,1183-1187 (1934). s22.3 Correlation of Binary Transfer Coefficients in One Phase 683 In computing xAfr we have assumed ideal gas behavior, equilibrium at the interface, and com- plete insolubility of air in water. The mean mole fraction, xAf, of the water vapor is sufficiently small that it can be neglected in evaluating the physical properties at the film conditions: c = 3.88 X lop5 g-moles/cm3 p = 1.12 x g/cm3 p = 1.91 X lod4 g/cm . s (from Table 1.1-1) %AB = 0.292 cm2/s (from Eq. 17.2- 1) When these values are used in Eq. 22.3-21 we get Sh, = 2 + 0.60(63)~/~(0.58)'/~ = 5.96 and the mean mass transfer coefficient is then C~AB (3.88 X 1OP5)(O.292) (5.96) kxm = - D Sh, = 0.05 Then from Eq. 22.3-26 the evaporation rate is found to be This result corresponds to a decrease of 1.23 X lop3 cm/s in the drop diameter and indicates that a drop of this size will fall a considerable distance before it evaporates completely. In this example, for simplicity, the velocity and surface temperature of the drop were given. In general, these conditions must be calculated from momentum and energy balances, as discussed in Problem 22B.1. EXAMPLE 22.3-2 The Wet and D y Bulb We next turn to a problem for which the analogy between heat and mass transfer leads to a sur- prisingly simple and useful, if approximate, result. The system, shown in Fig. 22.3-2, is a pair of thermometers, one of which is covered with a cylindrical wick kept saturated with water. The Psychrometer wick will cool by evaporation into the moving air stream and for steady operation will ap- proach an asymptotic value known as the wet bulb temperature. The bare thermometer, on the other hand, will tend to approach the actual temperature of the approaching air, and this value is called the dry bulb temperature. Develop an expression for determining the humidity of the air from the wet and dry bulb temperature readings neglecting radiation and assuming that the re- placement of the evaporating water has no significant effect on the wet bulb temperature mea- surement. In Problem 228.2 we will see how radiation can be taken into account. SOLUTION For simplicity, we assume that the fluid velocity is high enough that the thermometer read- ings are unaffected by radiation and by heat conduction along the thermometer stems, but not so high that viscous dissipation heating effects become significant. These assumptions are usually satisfactory for glass thermometers and for gas velocities of 30 to 100 ft/s. The dry bulb temperature is then the same as the temperature T, of the approaching gas, and the wet bulb temperature is the same as the temperature To of the outside of the wick. Let species A be water and species B be air. An energy balance is made on a system that contains a length L of the wick (the distance between planes 1 and 2 in the figure). The rate of 684 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures Dry-bulb Wet-bulb / thermometer thermometer \\ q Surface 2 Wick saturated Fig. 22.3-2. Sketch of a wet-bulb and dry-bulb psychrometer installation. It is assumed that no heat or mass moves across plane 2. heat addition to the system by the gas stream is h,(nDL)(T, - To). Enthalpy also enters via plane 1 at a rate WAIHAl in the liquid phase and leaves at the mass transfer surface at a rate w~~J~~, both of these occurring at a temperature To. Hence the energy balance gives since the water enters the system at plane 1 at the same rate that it leaves as water vapor at the mass transfer interface 0. To a very good approximation, HA, - HA, may be replaced by A&,,, the molar heat of vaporization of water. From the definition of the mass transfer coefficient in which WBo = 0 as in the preceding example. Combination of Eqs. 22.2-32 and 33 gives then Then using the definitions of Nu, and Sh,, and noting that p?p = ct,, we may rewrite Eq. 22.3-34 as Because of the analogy between heat and mass transfer, we can expect that the mean Nusselt and Sherwood numbers will be of the same form: Nu, = F(Re)Prn; Sh, = F(Re)Scn (22.3-36,37) where F is the same function of Re in both expressions. Therefore, knowing the dry and wet bulb temperatures and the mole fraction of the water vapor adjacent to the wick (x,,), we can calculate the upstream composition XA, of the air stream from The exponent n depends to a slight extent on the geometry, but is not far from & and the quantity (Sc/PrI1-\" is not far from unity.* Furthermore, the wet bulb temperature is seen to be A somewhat different equation, with 1 - n = 0.56, was recommended for measurements in air by C. H. Bedingfield and T. B. Drew, Ind. Eng. Chem., 42,1164-1173 (1950). 522.3 Correlation of Binary Transfer Coefficients in One Phase 685 independent of the Reynolds number under the assumption introduced in Eqs. 22.3-36 and 37. This result would also have been obtained by using the Chilton-Colburn relations, which would give n = $ directly. The interfacial gas composition xAo can be accurately predicted, at low mass-transfer rates, by neglecting the heat and mass transfer resistance of the interface itself (see s22.4 for further discussion of this point). One can then represent xAO by the vapor-liquid equilibrium relationship: A relation of this kind will hold for given species A and B if the Iiquid is pure A as assumed above A commonly used approximation of this relationship is in which PA,\",, is the vapor pressure of pure A at temperature To. This relation assumes tacitly that the presence of B does not alter the partial pressure of A at the interface, and that A and B form an ideal gas mixture. If an air-water mixture at 1 atm pressure gives a wet bulb temperature of 70°F and a dry bulb temperature of 140°F, then pA,vap = 0.0247 atm xA0 = 0.0247, from Eq. 22.3-40 C, = 6.98 Btu/lb-mole. F at 105\"F, the film temperature A&, = 18,900 Btu/lb-mole at 70°F Sc = 0.58 (see Example 22.2-1) Pr = 0.74, from Eq. 9.3-16 Substitution into Eq. 22.3-37, with n = $, then gives From this the mole fraction of water in the approaching air is Since we assumed that the film concentration was XA = 0 as a first approximation, we could go back and make a second approximation by using an average film concentration of i(0.0247 + 0.0033) = 0.0140 in the physical property calculations. The physical proper- ties are not known accurately enough here to justify recalculation. The calculated result in Eq. 22.3-43 is in only fair agreement with published humidity charts, because these are typically based on the adiabatic saturation temperature rather than the wet bulb tem~erature.~ EXAMPLE 22.3-3 Mass Transfer in Creeping Flow Through Many important adsorptive operations, from purification of proteins in modern biotechnol- ogy to the recovery of solvent vapor by dry-cleaning establishments, occur in dense particu- late beds and are typically carried out in steady creeping flow-that is, at Re = D,vg/p < 20. Here D, is the effective particle diameter and v, is the superficial velocity, defined as volumet- Packed Beds ric flow rate divided by the total cross section of the bed (see 56.4). It follows that the dimen- sionless velocity v/vo will have a spatial distribution independent of the Reynolds number. Detailed information is available only for spherical packing particles. 0. A.

Ragatz, Chemical Process Principles, Part I, 2nd edition, Wiley, New York, (1954), p. 120. 686 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures SOLUTION Using the dimensional analysis discussion at the beginning of this section, predict the form of the steady-state mass transfer coefficient correlation for creeping flow. The dimensional analysis procedure in s19.5 may be used, with Dp as the characteristic length and v, the characteristic velocity. Then, from Eq. 19.5-11, we see that the dimensionless con- centration depends only on the product ReSc, in addition to the dimensionless position coor- dinates and the geometry of the bed. The most extensive data are for creeping flow at large Peclet numbers. Experimental data on the dissolution of benzoic acid spheres in water4 have yielded the result 1 09 Sh, = E (R~sc)\"~ ReSc >> 1 (22.3-43) where E is the volume fraction of the bed occupied by the flowing fluid. Equation 22.3-43 is reasonably consistent with the relation Sh, = 2 + 0.991(Re~c)~'~ (22.3-44) which incorporates the creeping flow solution for flow around an isolated sphere5 (E = 1) (see 5522.2b). This suggests that the flow pattern around an isolated sphere is not much different from that around a sphere surrounded by other spheres, particularly near the sphere surface where most of the mass transport takes place. No reliable data are available for the limiting behavior at very low values of ReSc, but numerical calculations for a regular packing6 predict that the Sherwood number asymptoti- cally approaches a constant near 4.0 if based on a local difference between interfacial and bulk compositions. Behavior within the solid phase is far more complex, and no simple approximation is wholly trustworthy. However, experiments to date7 show that where intraparticle mass trans- port is described by Fick's second law, one can use the approximation where kc, is the effective mass transfer coefficient within the solid phase and 9,, is the diffu- sivity of A in the solid phase. The equation is for \"slow\" changes in the solute concentration bathing the particle. This is an asymptotic solution for a linear change of surface concentra- tion with time: and has been justified9 by calculations. For a Gaussian (bell-shaped) concen- tration wave, \"slow\" means that the passage time (temporal standard deviation) of the wave is long relative to the particle diffusional response time, which is of the order of D;/69,,. Fick's second law must be solved with the detailed history of surface concentration when this inequality is not satisfied. In packed beds, as with tube flow, one must keep in mind the fact that there will be nonuniformities in the concentration as a function of the radial coordinate. This was dis- cussed in 514.5 and s20.3. E. J. Wilson and C. J. Geankopolis, Ind. Eng. Chem. Fundamentals, 5,9-14 (1966). See also J. R. Selman and C. W.

Contrast their mass transfer behavior with that of solid spheres. Mass Transfer to Drops and Bubbles SOLUTION Many different types of behavior are encountered, and surface forces can play a very impor- tant role. We discuss surface forces in some detail in 522.7. Here we consider only some limit- ing cases and refer readers to the above-cited references. Very small drops and bubbles behave like solid spheres and can be treated by the corre- lations in Example 22.3-3 and in Chapter 14. However, if both adjacent phases are free of sur- factants and small particulate contaminants, the interior phase circulates and carries the adjacent regions of the exterior phase along. This stress-driven \"Hadamard-Rybczinski circu- lation\"12 increases the mass transfer rates markedly, often by almost an order of magnitude, and the rates can be estimated from of the \"penetration model\" discussed in 518.5. Thus, for a spherical bubble of gas A with diameter D rising through a clean likid B, the Shenvood number on the liquid side lies in the range16 where v, is the terminal velocity (see Eqs. 18.5-19 and 20). The size at which the transition from the solid-like behavior to circulation occurs de- pends on degree of surface contamination and is not easily predicted. Very large drops or bubbles ~scillate,'~ and both phases follow a modified penetration model, with angular frequency of o~cillation'~ where u is the interfacial tension, and p~ and p, are the densities of the drops and the continu- ous medium. The success of this model implies that the boundary layer is refreshed once every oscilla- tion, but there is also a small effect of periodic stretching of the surface. 522.4 DEFINITION OF TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS IN TWO PHASES Recall that in g10.6 we introduced the concept of an overall heat transfer coefficient, U, to describe the heat transfer between two streams separated from each other by a wall. This overall coefficient accounted for the thermal resistance of the wall itself, as well as the thermal resistance in the fluids on either side of the wall. lo J. Stichlmair and J. F.

Concentration profiles in the neighborhood of a gas-liquid interface Distance from interface We now treat the analogous situation for mass transfer, except that here we are con- cerned with two fluids in intimate contact with one another, so that there is no wall resis- tance or interfacial resistance. This is the situation most commonly met in practice. Since the interface itself contains no significant mass, we may begin by assuming continuity of the total mass flux at the interface for any species being transferred. Then for the system shown in Fig. 22.4-1 we write for the interfacial flux of A toward the liquid phase. Then using the definition given in Eq. 22.1-9, we get in which we are now following the tradition of using x for mole fractions in the liquid phase and y for mole fractions in the gas phase. We now have to interrelate the interfa- cial compositions in the two phases. In nearly all situations this can be done by assuming equilibrium across the inter- face, so that adjacent gas and liquid compositions lie on the equilibrium curve (see Fig. 22.4-2), which is regarded as known from solubility data: 8 Equilibrium curve F aJ S s. .3 T 'C 0 .3 Y U 2 a, - : II 2 xA = mole fraction of A in the liquid Fig. 22.4-2. Relations among gas- and liquid- phase compositions, and the graphical interpreta- tions of m, and my. s22.4 Definition of Transfer Coefficients in Two Phases 689 Exceptions to this are: (i) extremely high mass-transfer rates, observed for gas phases at high vacuum, where N,, approaches pAO/s~, the equilibrium rate at which gas molecules impinge on the interface; and (ii) interfaces contaminated with high concen- trations of adsorbed particles or surfactant molecules. Situation (i) is quite rare, and situ- ation (ii) normally acts indirectly by changing the flow behavior rather than causing deviations from equilibrium. In extreme cases surface contamination can provide addi- tional transport resistances. To describe rates of interphase transport, one can either use Eqs. 22.4-2 and 3 to cal- culate interface concentrations and then proceed to use the single-phase coefficients, or else work with overall mass transfer coefficients Here yAe is the gas phase composition in equilibrium with a liquid at composition xAb, and x,, is the liquid phase composition in equilibrium with a gas at composition yAb. The quantity q,Io, is the overall mass transfer coefficient \"based on the gas phase,\" and e,,,, is the overall mass transfer coefficient \"based on the liquid phase.\" Here again the molar flux NAO is taken to be positive for transfer to the liquid phase. Equating the quantities in Eqs. 22.4-2 and 4 gives two relations connecting the two-phase coefficients with the single-phase coefficients. The quantities xA, and yAe introduced in the above three relations may be used to de- fine quantities m, and my as follows: As we can see from Fig. 22.4-2, m, is the slope of the line connecting points (xAO, yAO) and (x,,, yAb) on the equilibrium curve, and my is the slope of the line from (xAb, yAe) to (~'40, YAO). From the above relations we can then eliminate the concentrations and get relations among the single-phase and two-phase mass transfer coefficients: The first of these was obtained from Eqs. 22.4-5,2, and 7, and the second from Eqs. 22.4- 6,2, and 8. If the equilibrium curve is nearly linear over the range of interest, then m, = my = m, which is the local slope of the curve at the interfacial conditions. We see, then, that the expressions in Eqs. 22.4-9, 10 both contain a ratio of single-phase coefficients weighted with a quantity m. This quantity is of considerable importance: If k~,loc/rnk~,lo, << 1, the mass-transport resistance of the gas phase has little ef- fect, and it is said that the mass transfer is liquid-phase controlled. In practice, this means that the system design should favor liquid-phase mass transfer. If kO,,loc/m$,loc >> 1, then the mass transfer is gas-phase controlled. In a practical situation, this means that the system design should favor gas-phase mass transfer. If 0.1 < ko,,loc/m$,loc < 10, roughly, one must be careful to consider the interac- tions of the two phases in calculating the two-phase transfer coefficients. Out- side this range the interactions are usually unimportant. We return to this point in the example below. 690 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures The mean two phase mass transfer coefficients must be defined carefully, and we con- sider here only the special case where bulk concentrations in the two adjacent phases do not change significantly over the total mass-transfer surface S. We may then define e,,, by so that, when Eq. 22.3-9 is used, Frequently area mean overall mass transfer coefficients are calculated from area mean coefficients for the two adjoining phases: The two mean values in Eqs. 22.4-12 and 13 can be significantly different (see Example 22.4-3). Oxygen is to be removed from water using nitrogen gas at atmospheric pressure and 20°C in the form of bubbles exhibiting internal circulation, as shown in Fig. 22.4-3. Estimate the rela- Determination of the tive importance of the two mass transfer coefficients k: ,<,, and k: ,,,<. Let A stand for O,, B for Controlling Resistance H,O, and c for N~. SOLUTION We can do this by assuming that the penetration model (see s18.5) holds in each phase, so that 7 where c, and cg are the total molar concentrations in the liquid and gas phases, respectively. The effective exposure time, t,,,, is the same for each of the phases. Nitrogen gas Oxygen- , containing water Fig. 22.4-3. Schematic diagram of an oxygen stripper, in which oxygen from the water diffuses into the nitrogen gas bubbles. 522.4 Definition of Transfer Coefficients in Two Phases 691 The solubility of 0, in water at 20°C is 1.38 X moles per liter at an oxygen partial pressure of 760 mm Hg, the vapor pressure of water is 17.535 mm Hg, and the total pressure in the solubility measurements is 777.5 mm Hg. At 20°C, the diffusivity of O2 in water is 91AB = 2.1 X lop5 cm2/s, and in the gas phase the diffusivity for O2 - N2 is = 0.2 cm2/s. We can then write (22.4-15) Into this we must substitute It follows that Therefore, only the liquid-phase resistance is significant, and the assumption of penetration behavior in the gas phase is not critical to the determination of liquid-phase control. It may also be seen that the dominant factor is the low solubility of oxygen in water. One may gener- alize and state that absorption or desorption of sparingly soluble gases is almost always liq- uid-phase controlled. Correction of the gas-phase coefficient for net mass transfer is clearly not significant, and the correction for the liquid phase is negligible. EXAMPLE 22.4-2 Interaction of Phase There are many situations for which the one-phase transfer coefficients are not available for the boundary conditions of the two-phase mass transfer problem, and it is common practice to use one-phase models in which interfacial boundary conditions are assumed, without re- Resistances gard to the interaction of the diffusion processes in the two phases. Such a simplification can introduce significant errors. Test this approximate procedure for the leaching of a solute A from a solid sphere of B of radius R in an incompletely stirred fluid C, so large in volume that the bulk fluid concentration of A can be neglected. SOLUTION The exact description of the leaching process is given by the solution of Fick's second law written for the concentration of A in the solid in the region 0 < r < R: The boundary and initial conditions are: B.C. 1: at r = 0, B.C. 2: at u = R, I.C.: at t = 0, The diffusional process on the liquid side of the solid-liquid interface is described in terms of a mass transfer coefficient, defined by in which c,,(t) is the concentration in the liquid phase adjacent to the interface. The behavior of the diffusion in the two phases is coupled through Eq. 22.4-22, which describes the equilibrium 692 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures at the interface. Because of the coupling, it is convenient to use the method of Laplace trans- form. First, however, we restate the problem in dimensionless form, using ,$ = r/R, T = BABt/R2, Cs = CAs/Co, C1 = (mCAl + b)/Co, and N = k$./m%AB. E~s. 22.3-20 and 24 become with C, finite at the sphere center, C, = C1 at the sphere surface, and C, = 1 throughout the sphere initially. When we take the Laplace transform of this problem, we get with Cs finite at the sphere center, and C, = Cl at the sphere surface. The solution of Eqs. 22.4- 27 (which is a nonhomogeneous analog of Eq. C.l-6a) and 28 is The Laplace transform of MA, the total amount of A within the sphere at any time t, is Inversion by using the Heaviside partial fractions expansion theorem for repeated roots' gives The constants A, and B, are found to be, for finite kc (or N), I\\IZ sin2 A, A, cot A, - (1 - N) = 0; B = - hi (A, - sin A, cos A,) (22.4-32,33) and for infinite kc (or N), Note that we have succeeded in getting the total amount of A transferred across the interface, MA(t), without finding the expression for the concentration profile in the system. This is an advantage in using the Laplace transform. We may now define two overall mass transfer coefficients: (i) the correct overall coeffi- cient for this system based on the solid phase where cAb is the volume-average concentration of A in the solid phase, and (ii) an approximate overall coefficient, based on the separately calculated behavior of the two phases, calculated by Eq. 22.4-13, where the superscript 0 indicates \"zero external resistance\" and kc is the liquid-phase transfer coefficient.

We do this only for large values of 9,,t/R2, for which the leading term of the sum in Eq. 22.4-31 suffices. For this situation, we obtain and where A, is to be calculated for the actual value of kc; keep in mind that A, is obtained from Eq. 22.4-32, in which N = kJ!/mgA,. A plot of Eq. 22.4-39 is shown in Fig. 22.4-4. There we see that the maximum error in the two-film model occurs near r2/3N = 1, and that departures from the two-film theory are appreciable but not very large. Consider a characteristic section of a packed tower for which the separately measured single- phase mass transfer coefficients yield a calculated ratio Area Averagin$ ln but in which the liquid phase wets only half of the packing surface. Here the subscript m refers to the mean value over a typical area S of the packing surface. The gas-phase transfer coefficient, on the other hand, is uniform over the entire surface. This hypothetical example is a special case of nonuniform wetting. Calculate the true and approximate values of k:,,/C, according to Eqs. 12.4-12 and 13. SOLUTION We begin with Eq. 22.4-12 and note that for half of the area = 0, and that over the other half whereas, for the gas phase k!,~oc = k0ym Eq. 22.4-12 thus yields C. J. King, AIChE Journal, 10,671-677 (1964). 694 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures From this and Eqs. 22.4-40 and 22.4-9, we find that the correct value for k;,/grn is whereas the approximate value from Eq. 22.4-13 is Thus the maldistribution of the liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient halves the rate of mass transfer, even though the liquid phase resistance \"on the average\" is very low. The general unavailability of such detailed information is one more reason for the uncertainty in predict- ing the behavior of complex contactors. 522.5 MASS TRANSFER AND CHEMICAL REACTIONS Many mass transfer operations are accompanied by chemical reactions, and the reaction kinetics can have a profound effect on transport rates. Important examples include ab- sorption of reactive gases and reactive distillation. There are two situations of particular interest: (i) Absorption of a sparingly soluble substance A into a phase containing a second reactant B in large concentration. Absorption of carbon dioxide into NaOH or amine solutions is an industrially important example, and here the reaction may be considered pseudo-first-order because reactant B is present in great excess: An example of this type of problem was given in 918.4. (ii) Absorption of a rapidly reacting solute A into a solution of B. Here to a first ap- proximation it may be assumed that the two species react so rapidly that they cannot coexist. An illustration of this was given in Example 20.1-2. We shall be particularly interested in liquid boundary layers, and heat-of-reaction effects tend to be modest because the ratio of Sc to Pr is usually very large. Macroscopic heating effects do occur, and these are discussed in Chapter 23. Here we limit ourselves to a few illustrative examples showing how one can use models of absorption with chemical reaction to predict the performance of operating equipment.' EXAMPLE 22.5-1 Estimation of the Mass transfer measurements with irreversible first-order reaction have often been used to es- timate interfacial area in complex mass transfer equipment. Show here how this method can be justified. Interfacial Area in a Packed Coluwn SOLUTION The system we consider here is the absorption of carbon dioxide into a caustic solution, which is limited by hydration of dissolved C02 according to the reaction ' T. K. Shemood, R. L. Pigford, and C. R. Wilke, Mass Transfer, McGraw-Hill, New York (1975), Chapter 8. 522.5 Mass Transfer and Chemical Reactions 695 The carbonic acid then reacts with NaOH at a rate proportional to carbon dioxide concentra- tion. The kinetics of this reaction are well characterized.' The solution of this diffusion problem has been given in Problem 20C.3. From Eq. 20.3-3, we find that for long times2r3 WAD = (22.5-3) which can be solved for the total surface area. It follows that the total surface area A under consideration is given by here MA,tot is the number of moles of carbon dioxide absorbed by time t. This development is readily extended to a falling film of length L and surface velocity v,, provided that k,L/v, >> 1. First-order reaction in mass transfer boundary layers is discussed in Example 18.4-1 for a simple film model and in Example 20.1-3. The development can be further extended to estimate the interfacial area in packed columns, in which the liquid phase is supported as a falling film on solid surfaces, a common design. We next consider gas absorption with first-order reaction in an agitated tank and take as a starting point the reaction Estimation of Volumetric Mass O2 + 2Na2S03 + 2Na2S04 (22.5-5) Transfer Coefficients already discussed in Example 18.4-1, using a thin stagnant film of liquid as a mass transfer model. SOLUTION This is not a realistic model, but the development in Example 18.4-1 can be rephrased in a model-insensitive form by writing so that The subscript AB should be changed to 02S, where S represents the sulfite solution. One can now test the model sensitivity of the system by comparing the film model with the penetration model. This is done in Fig. 22.5-1, where it can be seen that there is no signifi- cant difference between the two.4 Moreover, there is a substantial region of parameter space where the predicted rate of oxygen absorption is identical to that for physical absorption in an oxygen-free tank. This chemical system has therefore proven a popular means for estimat- ing volumetric mass transfer coefficients. It has long been used to characterize the oxygena- tion effectiveness of aerobic biorea~tors.~ P. V. Danckwerts, Trans. Faraday Soc., 46,300-304 (1950). R. A. T. 0.

Equation 22.5-13 is useful because it is valid for both large and very small values of a~,,~,~/bc~~~,,. In addition, the exact solution always lies in the space between the curve of Eq. 22.5-13 and those portions of the curves of Eqs. 22.5- 11 and 12 that are closest to it. This is shown in Fig. 22.5-2, where these bounding approxima- tions are compared to the exact solution. We next note that we can replace the diffusivity ratio by the corresponding ratio of non- reactive Sherwood numbers, where the superscript 0 denotes the observed Sherwood number in the absence of chemical reaction. We may thus obtain a set of model-insensitive bounding solutions These equations have been shown7 to provide convenient bounds for laminar and turbulent boundary layers as well as the penetration model of Example 20.1-2.

This is an extension of our earlier discus- sion of free-convection heat transfer in 514.6 and is reasonably well understood. Combined heat and mass transfer by free convection is among the simple examples of interaction between all three transport phenomena. The dimensionless equations de- scribing them have been given in Eqs. 19.5-8 to ll. Numerical integration of these equa- tions is possible,' but we can obtain simple, useful results via boundary layer theory. We consider two particularly simple problems in the examples that follow. Develop an expression for the combined free-convection heat and mass transfer for the spe- cial case of equal Prandtl and Schmidt numbers. Assume that transfer is between a surface of of Grashof constant temperature and composition, and a large uniform surrounding fluid. Numbers SOLUTION This is a direct extension of the boundary conditions of Example 11.4-5. Then if the dimen- sionless temperature and composition are defined analogously, it follows that ? = 5, every- where within the system under investigation. It then follows that the solution of this mixed convection problem is identical to that for heat or mass transfer alone, but with Gr or Gr, replaced by the sum (Gr + Gr,). This simplifi- cation is widely used for the air-water system, where the small difference between the Sc and Pr numbers does not have a significant effect. Thus for evaporation from a water-wetted vertical plate (with Sc = 0.61 and Pr = 0.73), one may use Eq. 11.4-11 with C = 0.518 to obtain Nu, = 0.518[0.73(Gr + ~r,)]'/~ Sh, = 0.518[0.61(Gr + ~r,)]'/~ Note that the i-th powers of Pr and Sc are 0.92 and 0.88, respectively. This difference is hardly significant in view of the uncertainties of any actual situation and the boundary layer model on which these results are based. Note also that the thermal Grashof number is nor- mally by far the larger, so that neglect of this interaction would greatly underestimate the evaporation rates. There are many situations-for example, the evaporation of solvents with low volatility- where thermal Grashof numbers are much larger than their mass transfer counterparts (Gr > Free-Convecti0n Heat Gr,) and the Schmidt numbers exceed the Prandtl numbers (Sc > Pr). Under these conditions, Transfer as a Source of the thermal buoyant forces provide a momentum source, which in turn provides a convective Forced-Convection flow to drive mass transfer. It has been shown2 that the thermally induced gradient of up- Mass Transfer ward velocity at the surface of a vertical flat plate of length L is given by Here z is the distance measured upward along the plate, y is measured outward into the fluid, and AT is the difference between the plate temperature and the temperature of the surround- ings. This is an asymptotic expression for large Prandtl number, but is also useful for gases. Develop expressions for the local and mean Sherwood numbers. ' W. R. Wilcox, Chem. Eng.

Fluids, 3,657-658 (1960). 522.7 Effects of Interfacial Forces on Heat and Mass Transfer 699 SOLUTION The thermal free convection provides a velocity field within which the mass transfer bound- ary layer develops. Given this velocity field, we may use the mass transfer analog of Eqs. 12.4-30 and 29 along with the definition NuIoc = D/I'($)& to obtain a description of the mass transfer rate in two-dimensional flow: Here is the dimensionless velocity gradient at the wall (I, and v, are arbitrary reference quantities used in the definition of the Reynolds number). For free convection it is convenient to use the plate height L for I, and v/L for v,. Then the Reynolds number is unity, and the quantity To is To = (L2/v)(dv,/dy)ly,,. Then Eq. 22.6-4 becomes The mean Sherwood number, obtained by averaging over the plate surface, is Sh, = 0.79(GrS~)\"~ - w2 Note that these last two equations show features of both free and forced convection in lami- nar boundary layers: the $-power of the Grashof number for free convection and the $power of the Schmidt number for forced convection. Moreover, we can now test the effect of Sc/Pr, because we know from the preceding ex- ample and Table 14.6-1 that, for Pr = Sc, Sh, = 0.67(GrS~)'/~ (22.6-8) in which the coefficient is lower than that in Eq. 22.6-7 by the ratio 0.85. The Sherwood num- ber Sh, will lie between the predictions of Eqs. 22.6-7 and 8 for Sc r Pr and Pr >> 1. Arguments similar to those used in Eq. 14.6-6 now suggest the following extension of Eqs. 22.67 and 68, Sh, = 0.73(1 + 0.1) (G~SC)'/~(SC/P~)\"'* [l + (0.492/~r)~/'~]~'~ for Sc r Pr and Pr 1 0.73. This result is correct for the limits Pr = 0.73 and Pr = and hence can include the evaporation of solvents in air. This analysis can also be extended to other shapes. 522.7 EFFECTS OF INTERFACIAL FORCES ON HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER In this section we consider briefly some important interactions among the three transfer processes, with emphasis on the effects of variable interfacial tension (Marangoni effects). The importance of this subject stems from the prevalence of direct fluid-fluid contact in mass transfer systems, but it can also be important in similar heat transfer operations. Still poorly understood diffusional processes permit violation of the no-slip condition on 700 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures fluid flow over solid surfaces in the neighborhood of advancing menisci.' As for the dis- torting effects of surface tension gradients on mass and heat transfer in gas-liquid con- tacting, these will enter through a description of the boundary conditions. According to Eq. llC.6-4, if the stresses in the gas (phase 11) are ignored, the interfa- cial tangential stresses acting on an interface with normal unit vector n are given bf [(6 - nn) [n 711 = -VSa (22.7-1) where u is the surface tension V9s the two-dimensional gradient operator in the inter- face, and (8 - nn) is a \"projection operator\" that selects those components of [n - 71 that lie in the interfacial tangent plane. For example, if n is taken to be the unit vector in the z direction, Eq. 22.7-1 gives which are the interfacial tension forces in the x and y directions acting in the xy-plane. The surface-tension-induced stresses are typically of the same order as their hydro- dynamic counterparts, and the flow phenomena that may result from them are known collectively as Marangoni effect^.^ It has been shown4 that mass transfer rates can be in- creased up to threefold by Marangoni effects, but can also be reduced in other circum- stances. The nature and extent of Marangoni effects depend strongly on the system geometry and the transport properties, and it will be convenient to consider here four specific examples: (i) drops and bubbles surrounded by a liquid continuum (ii) sprays of drops in a gaseous continuum (iii) supported liquid films in a gaseous or liquid continuum (iv) foams of gas bubbles in a liquid continuum These systems, each important in practice, show very different behavior from one an- other. For drops and bubbles moving through a liquid continuum, the primary problems are surfactants or microscopic particles that can reduce or eliminate the \"Hadamard- Rybczinski circulation\" and also hinder the periodic mixing accompanying oscillation in V.

A good overview of Marangoni effects and related phenomena, with emphasis on liquid-liquid systems, is provided in J. C. Godfrey and M. J. Slater, Liquid-Liquid Extraction Equipment, Wiley, New York (1994), pp. 68-75. A theory offered by C. V. Sternling and L. E. Scriven, AlChE Journal, 5,514-523 (1959), provides useful insight but is considered too simple to give reliable predictions of the onset of instabilities. s22.7 Effects of Interfacial Forces on Heat and Mass Transfer 701 larger drops or bubble^.^ These are discussed briefly in Example 22.3-4. These situations are important in gas absorbers and liquid extractors. For sprays of drops in a gas, impor- tant in large distillation columns, Marangoni forces play no significant role.6 Foam beds, important in smaller distillation columns, and supported films, impor- tant in a wide variety of packed columns, are particularly interesting. Both are strongly affected by surface-tension gradients resulting from the changes of surface tension with composition of the adjoining streams. Foam beds are stabilized when the buik liquid has a lower surface tension than that in equilibrium with the bulk gas, called a \"positive system.\" In such a situation, interfacial tension tends to be higher where bubbles are close together than where they are far apart, and the shrinking of high-surface-tension regions tends to drive the bubbles apart, thus stabilizing the foam. Where there are only small differences in surface tension, or where the direction is reversed, a \"negative system,\" there is no stabilizing effect and the foaming is poor. Concentration of ethanol from water is interesting, because it has strong positive surface tension gradients where the relative volatility is high, but becomes very nearly neutral as the azeotrope is approached. Thus, for a bubble-cap column, stage efficiencies are high where least needed and low as the azeotropic composition is approached. In packed columns, where the descending liquid is supported on solid surfaces as thin films, the situation is quite different. Here the surface tension of the descending liq- , uid decreases downward for a positive system and is subject to hydrodynamic instabil- ity to form narrow rivulets. These markedly decrease interfacial area and mass transfer effectiveness. In negative systems, on the other hand, films are stabilized, and mass transfer is more effective than for neutral systems. No quantitative analysis of this situa- tion appears to be available, but it has been shown that instabilities found by Zuiderweg and Harmens for wetted-wall columns can be predicted by linearized stability analy~is.~ Stability analysis also suggests that the presence of a positive surface-tension gradient should improve the efficiency of condensers. Another study of stability for very small films opens up new possibilities for microfluidic processors.8 EXAMPLE 22.7-1 Elimination of The presence of surfactants can stop Hadamard-Rybczinski circulation in a rising gas bubble. Explain this phenomenon (see Fig. 22.7-1). Circulation in a SOLUTION Rising Gas Circulation results in stretching of the surface at the top of a rising bubble and shrinking of the surface at the bottom. As a result, surfactant accumulates at the bottom, producing a higher than average concentration there, whereas a lower-than-average concentration exists at the top. Since surfactants reduce surface tension, this results in a surface-tension-induced stress (in spherical coordinates) tending to oppose the interfacial deformation (see Eq. 22.7-1). If the magnitude of this stress reaches the value that would occur on a rising solid sphere (see Eq. 2.6-6) - 3 w'm rrol r=R - 7 sin 0 circulation will stop. J. B. Angelo and E. N.

Small con- centration of microscopic suspended particulates have a similar effect, being swept to the rear of bubbles and forming a rigid surface. Among the simplest mass-transfer-induced Marangoni effects is instability in a falling film re- sulting from counterflow adsorption of vapors with a high heat of solution. An important Marangoni Instability representative example is the counterflow absorption of HCI vapor into water, which is so in- in a Falling Film efficient that cocurrent flow is preferable. Explain this effect. S 0 L UTION This situation can be simulated by allowing a film of water to flow down a plate that is colder at the top than at the bottom. If sufficient care is taken, one can obtain a sinusoidally varying film thickness, as shown9 by interferometry in Fig. 22.7-2(a). Here each new dark line repre- sents a line of constant thickness, differing from its neighbors by one-half wavelength of light in the water. This situation corresponds to a series of parallel roll cells of the type pictured in Fig. 22.7- 2(b), driven by lateral surface tension gradients. These gradients, in turn, result from small variations in film thickness caused by inevitable small spatial variations of surface velocity: the thicker regions move faster and thus tend to be colder than the thin regions. A simple per- turbation analysis1 shows that perturbations of some widths grow faster than others, and the fastest growing ones tend to dominate. The periods of the sinusoidal lines in Fig. 22.7-2(a) correspond to these fastest growing disturbances. Such regularity is, however, seldom observed in practice. More commonly one sees occa- sional thick rivulets surrounded by large thin regions. These thin regions, taking up most of the available surface, are both slowly moving and quickly saturated and are thus ineffective for mass transfer. Only the rivulets are effective, and their total surface area is very small. Similar behavior is observed for surface-tension gradients caused by vertical variations in composition. However, in that case the behavior is more complicated and requires an analy- sis of interphase mass tran~fer.~ 522.8 Transfer Coefficients at High Net Mass Transfer Rates 703 Fig. 22.7-2. (a) Initiation of Marangoni instability in a draining liquid fluid film. (b) Fully developed Marangoni instability. (c) Qualitative picture of vertical roll-cell disturbances [V. Ludviksson and E. N. Lightfoot, AIChE Journal, 14,620-626 (1968)l. 522.8 TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS AT HIGH NET MASS TRANSFER RATES High net mass transfer rates across phase boundaries distort the boundary-layer profiles of velocity and temperature as well as species concentration, and they also alter the boundary layer thicknesses. Both of these effects tend to increase friction factors and the heat and mass transfer coefficients, if the mass transfer is toward the boundary, and to reduce them in the reverse situation. These usual trends are reversed, however, in free convection and in flows driven by a rotating surface. The magnitudes of such changes are dependent on the system geometry, boundary conditions, and the magnitudes of the governing parameters such as the Reynolds, Prandtl, and Schmidt numbers, and they are accompanied by the effects of changes in physical properties. They can also either in- crease or decrease the hydrodynamic stability. Accurate allowance for the effects of net mass transfer thus requires extensive calculation and/or experimentation, but some of the more salient features can be illustrated by using idealized physical models, and this is the approach we follow here. We begin with the classic stagnant-film model, which provides simple estimates of the profile distortion, but is incapable of predicting changes in the effective film thickness. We then discuss the perzetratiorz model and the flat-plate laminar boundary layer model. We conclude with several illustrative examples, the last of which is a complete numerical ex- 704 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures ample of boundary layers on a spinning disk. This example will provide a useful ap- praisal of model sensitivity. As pointed out in 922.1, when high net mass transfer rates are being considered, we introduce a modified notation for the transfer coefficients: The black dots in k;,,,, and hioc imply that the distortions of the concentration and temper- ature profiles resulting from high net mass transfer rates are being included. The relations between these transfer coefficients and those defined in Eqs. 22.1-7 and 8 are = lim &,,oc 4'10c NAo+NB,,-+O (22.8-2a) This shows explicitly the limiting process that relates the two types of transfer coefficients. The Stagnant-Film We have already discussed this model briefly in 518.2 and more fully in Example 19.4-1. By combining the expressions in Eqs. 19.4-16 and 17 with the definitions in Eqs. 22.8-la and lb, we get for the system in Fig. 22.8-1 Interface Velocity Temperature Concentration profile profile profile Fig. 22.8-1.

Note 3208 (1954). s22.8 Transfer Coefficients at High Net Mass Transfer Rates 705 By following the limiting processes indicated in Eqs. 22.8-2a and 2b, we then get expres- sions for the transfer coefficients in the low net mass transfer limit: These limiting values are found by expanding the right sides of Eqs. 22.8-3 and 4 in Tay- lor series and retaining two terms. Substitution of Eqs. 22.7-5 and 6 into Eqs. 19.4-16 and 17 enables us to eliminate the film thicknesses (which are ill-defined) in favor of the transfer coefficients at low mass-transfer rates (which are measurable): These equations are the principal results of the film model. They show how the conduc- tive energy flux and the diffusion flux at the wall depend on NAo and NBo. In this model, the effects of net mass transfer on the conductive and diffusive interfacial fluxes are clearly analogous. Although these relations were derived for laminar flow and constant physical properties, they are also useful for turbulent flow and for variable physical properties (see Problem 22B.3). The results for heat and mass transfer can be summarized in two equations: Equation 22.8-9 gives the correction factors 6, and OT by which the coefficients kX,,,, and bloc must be multiplied to obtain the coefficients at high net mass transfer rates. Equation 22.8-10 gives the concentration and temperature profiles. The meanings of the symbols are summarized in Table 22.8-1.

The variation of the transfer coefficients with mass transfer rate, as given by the film model (see Eq. 22.8-9). Equation 22.8-9 is given graphically in Fig. 22.8-2. This shows that for net transfer of A and B into the stream (positive +), the transfer coefficients decrease, whereas net trans- fer of A and B out of the stream (negative 4) causes the transfer coefficients to increase. Some sample profiles from Eq. 22.8-10 are shown in Fig. 22.8-3. In the limit of small mass-transfer rates (i.e., 4 + 0 or R + O), Eq. 22.8-10 becomes simply IT = q. The film model regards the region outside the film as perfectly mixed, thus giving a profile that is flat beyond q = 1. The Penetration Model We next turn to the transfer coefficient at large net mass transfer rates for systems in which there is no significant drag at the interface. We have already studied several sys- tems of this type: gas absorption into a falling liquid film and from a rising bubble (§18.5), and unsteady-state evaporation (520.1). These systems are generally lumped to- gether under the heading of penetration theory. Fig. 22.8-3. Temperature and concentra- 1.0 tion profiles in a laminar film, as calcu- lated by the film model (see Eq. 22.8-10). 522.8 Transfer Coefficients at High Net Mass Transfer Rates 707 A falling film system is shown in Fig. 22.8-4. The time of travel from the liquid inlet to the liquid outlet (the \"exposure time\") is sufficiently short that the diffusing species does not penetrate very far into the liquid. In such a situation, we can (from a mathemat- ical point of view) regard the falling film as infinitely thick. We may then take over the results from Example 20.1-1. Equation 20.1-23 gives the concentration profiles for a corresponding unsteady-state system with large net mass transfer rate, and an analogous equation can be written down for the temperature profiles: T - To erf(qT - 9,) + erf (0, rIT = - - Tm - TO 1 + erf p, Here Q = y/m and q, = y/G are dimensionless distances from the interface, and p in each formula is a dimensionless molar average velocity at the interface: From these results and the definitions for the transfer coefficients in Eqs. 22.8-1 and 2, we may now get the rate factors 4, the flux ratios R, and the correction factors 0, defined in the preceding subsection: From the definitions in Eqs. 22.8-1 and 2 and the profiles in Eqs. 22.8-11 and 12, we can also get the expressions for the transfer coefficients at low net mass transfer rates: z = distance into liquid film Liquid Liquid in out Fig. 22.8-4. Diffusion into a falling liquid film. Here tmp is the total time of exposure of a typical element of volume near the surface. 708 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures The corresponding coefficients at high net mass transfer rates can be obtained by multi- plying by the correction factor in Eq. 22.8-16. From the last two equations we get the relation A similar relation, with an exponent of $ (instead of 3) is obtained from the Chilton-Col- burn relations given in Eqs. 22.3-23 to 25. The latter are valid for flows adjacent to rigid boundaries, whereas Eq. 22.8-19 pertains to fluid-fluid systems with no velocity gradient at the interface. The proportionality of k,,,,, to the square root of the diffusivity, given in Eq. 22.8-17, has been confirmed experimentally for the liquid phase in several gas-liquid mass trans- fer systems, including short wetted-wall columns, packed columns, and liquids around gas bubbles in certain instances. The penetration model has also been applied to absorp- tion with chemical reactions (see Example 20.1-2). The Flat-Plate Boundary Layer Model The steady-state transport in the boundary layer along a flat plate for a fluid with con- stant physical properties was discussed in g20.2. The eneral expression for the profiles, n(q, A, K), was given in Eq. 20.2-43. There q = y e vJ2vx is a dimensionless position co- ordinate measured from the plate, A is the physical property group (i.e., 1, Pr, or Sc), and K = (v,/v,)w is a dimensionless net mass flux from the plate. Once again we introduce the notations defined in Table 22.8-1. Then for the bound- ary layer calculation we have In the boundary layer calculation it was assumed that the heat capacities of both species are identical. The momentum, heat, and mass fluxes for the flat plate are given in Fig. 22.8-5. Then in the following two figures, Figs. 22.8-6 and 22.8-7, two plots are given, comparing the correction factors, 8, for the film model, the penetration model, and the boundary layer model. The boundary layer model gives a dependence on A that is not found in the other models, because this model includes the effect of the tangential velocity profiles on the temperature and concentration profiles. The film model predicts the smallest depen- dence of the transfer coefficients on net mass-transfer rate. Correction factors considerably different from 1 arise when either $J or R is of mag- nitude 1 or greater for T or XA; see Figures 22.8-6, 7 and 8, and the relation 0 = +/R. Large net interfacial mass fluxes, by these measures, are common when the mass trans- fer is mechanically driven as in ultrafiltration (Example 22.8-5) and transpiration cooling (Problem 20B.7(c)). Large net mass fluxes can also occur in vaporization, condensation, melting and other changes of state, and in heterogeneous chemical reactions, when ac- companied by correspondingly large temperature differences or radiation intensities to transfer the requisite latent heat or energy of reaction. More moderate net fluxes, and correction factors near unity, are common in multistage and packed-column separation processes, where the differences of temperature and composition within a separation stage or flow cross-section are normally rather small. The energy flux ratio R, is an im- portant criterion for assessing the net-flux corrections, as illustrated in Examples 22.8-2 and 3. s22.8 Transfer Coefficients at High Net Mass Transfer Rates 709 l+RforR<O Asymptote for 4 + -m: R + -1 Fig. 22.8-6.

EXAMPLE 22.8-1 Rapid Evaporation of a Liquid from a Solvent A is evaporating out of a coat of lacquer on a plane surface exposed to a tangential stream of noncondensable gas B. At a given point on the surface, the gas-phase mass transfer coefficient k,,,,, at the prevailing average fluid properties is given as 0.1 lb-mole/hr . ft2; the Schmidt number is Sc = 2.0. The interfacial gas composition is XAO = 0.80. Estimate the local Plane Surfnce rate of evaporation, using (a) the stagnant film model, (b) the flat-plate boundary layer model, and (c) the uncorrected mass transfer coefficient k,,,,,. SOLUTION (a) Since B is noncondensable, NBo = 0. Application of Eq. 22.8-7 (which is the same as 1 + R, = exp 4,) to the gas phase then gives From this we get, after taking the logarithm, as the result of the stagnant-film model. This corresponds to a correction factor 8, = +,/R, = 0.40. (b) As in part (a), R, = 4.0. Then from Fig. 22.8-5, at R, = 4.0 and A, = 2.0, we find that 4, = 1.3. By setting NBo = 0 in the formula for 4, in Table 22.8-1, we get as the result of the flat-plate boundary layer model. The corresponding correction factor 0, is 0.33. (c) If the mass transfer coefficient k,,l,, is used without correction for the net interfacial flux, we get from Eq. 22.1-5, with NBO = 0 whence NAO = 0.400. This result is much too high and shows that the corrections for net molar flux are important at these conditions. The boundary layer solution in part (b) should be accu- rate if the flow is laminar and the variation in the physical properties is not too great. g22.8 Transfer Coefficients at High Net Mass Transfer Rates 711 Adjust the results of Example 22.3-1 for the net molar flux by applying the correction factors 6, and 19, from the film model and from the flat-plate boundary layer model. Correction Factors in Droplet Evaporation SOLUTION In Example 22.3-3 the molar flux ratio R, at any point on the surface of the drop is From Eq. 22.8-9 (film model) or Fig. 22.8-7 (flat-plate boundary layer model), the predicted correction factor 6, is about 0.99 at all points on the drop. Hence the corrected mass transfer rate is (by adjustment of Eq. 22.3-31) This result differs only slightly from that obtained in Example 22.3-1. Thus the assumption of a small mass-transfer rate was satisfactory under the given conditions. Extend the analysis of Example 22.3-2 to include the corrections for net mass-transfer rate, using the stagnant film model. Wet-Bulb Performance Corrected for ass- Transfer Rate SOLUTION By rewriting the energy balance, Eq. 22.3-32, for any point on the wick, we obtain for finite mass-transfer rate Multiplication of both sides by CpA/(AiiArVaphioc) gives, since Nm = 0, NAO& - &(T- - To) RT=~- bloc ~~A,uap The right-hand member of this equation is easily calculated if TO, T,, and p are given. Next we write the expression r#~ = ln(1 + R) for both heat and mass transfer, taking into account the fact that NBO = 0: Solving both equations for NA, and equating the resulting expressions gives hloc In(1 + RJ = - ln(1 + R,) (22.8-33) kx,locC,A Then substituting the expressions for R, and RT from Table 22.8-1 yields This equation shows that xAo and To will be constant over the surface of the wick if h,,/(k&,,,) is constant and thus equal to h,,,/(k,,l<,A). This constancy is assumed here for 712 Chapter 22 Interphase Transport in Nonisothermal Mixtures EXAMPLE 22.8-4 Comparison of Film and Penetration Models for Unsteady Evaporation in a Long Tube simplicity. Such an assumption is particularly satisfactory for the water-air system, for which Pr and Sc are nearly equal. With this substitution, Eq. 22.8-34 becomes This solution simplifies exactly to Eq. 22.3-35 at low mass-transfer rates. For the numerical problem in Example 22.3-2, the following values apply: xAo = 0.0247 CPA = 8.03 Btu/lb-mole . F for water vapor at 105°F h,/k,, = 5.93 Btu/lb-mole . F from the Chilton-Colburn analogy (Eq. 22.3-25) Insertion of these values into Eq. 22.8-35 gives Solving this equation, we get x,, = 0.0034 (22.8-37) This result differs only slightly from the value 0.0033 obtained in Example 22.3-2 and justifies the previous omission of the correction factors under the given conditions. Numerical studies indicate that the simple Eq. 22.3-34 gives a close approximation to Eq. 22.8-35 for the air-water system under all likely wet-bulb conditions. Eqs. 22.3-32 and 33 overestimate the mass transfer rate almost equally, and when these equations are combined, the errors largely compensate. Compare the effects of net mass transfer for the unsteady evaporation system described in Example 20.1-1 with the predictions of (a) the generalized penetration model, and (b) the stagnant-film model introduced above. The latter calculation amounts to a quasi-steady-state treatment of this time-dependent system. SOLUTION We begin by noting that for this system x,, = 0 and N,, = 0. It follows from Eq. 22.8-la and Table 22.8-1 that The correction factor 8, is thus the ratio of the flux corrected for net mass transfer to the un- corrected flux. (a) The penetration model. We note that the concentration gradient at the liquid surface can be obtained by differentiating Eq. 20.1-16 and rewriting the result in terms of x, and z. The re- sult is 2 exp(-q2) x,, 1 + erf cp .\\/= For negligible net mass transfer, cp = 0. Thus, the ratio of the mass flux in the presence of net mass transfer to the flux in the absence of net mass transfer is s22.8 Transfer Coefficients at High Net Mass Transfer Rates 713 Table 22.8-2 Comparison of Film and Penetration Models. 8, from penetration model 8, from film model X~~ (Eq. 22.8-41) (Eq. 22.8-42) in agreement with Eqs. 22.8-14 and 16. To get 8, as a function of x,,, we may use Fig. 22.8-7, or use Eq. 20.1-17 to write 8, = (1 - xAO)+(xAO) (penetration model) (22.8-41) where +(xAO) is the quantity defined just after Eq. 20.1-22 and given in Table 20.1-1.

The film model result may be obtained from Eq. 22.8-9 in the form 8 = (1 /R) ln(1 + R) to obtain 1 - XAO X~O lxAO) (film model) 0, = - ln - Numerical values for both models are provided in Table 22.8-2 and also in Fig. 22.8-7. It is seen that the penetration model predicts a stronger correction 8, for net mass transfer than does the film model. This is in part because the net flow thickens the boundary layer, an effect that the film model does not consider. It may also be noted that this example is a realis- tic use of the penetration model, as there is little effect of solute concentration on the physical properties in this simple isothermal system. A much different situation is seen in the next example. Ultrafiltration of proteins is a concentration process, in which water from an aqueous protein solution is forced through a membrane impermeable to the protein but permeable to water Concentration and small solutes such as inorganic salts. Protein then accumulates in a polarization layer, or Polarization in region of high protein concentration adjacent to the membrane surface, as indicated in Fig. Ultrafiltration 22.8-8.

Describe the effect of net mass transfer on the mass transfer coefficient for protein transport. Assume that the membrane is completely impermeable to protein so that the net transport of protein across the membrane surface is zero. For simplicity we choose a spinning-disk geometry as shown in Fig. 22.8-8, for which the pro- tein concentration will be a function only of the distance y from the disk surface and not of ra- dial position5 (see Problem 19D.4). However, we will have to consider the dependence of density, viscosity, and protein-water diffusivity on the protein concentration, and we will need the concept of osmotic pres~ure.~ The basis for our solution is the concept of hydraulic permeability of the filtration membrane: Here v, is the velocity, or volumetric flux, of the solvent leaving the downstream surface of the membrane. Equation 22.8-43 defines KH, the hydraulic permeability of the membrane. The quantities p, and p6 are the hydrodynamic pressures against the membrane as indicated in Fig. 22.8-8, and 7~ is the osmotic pressure at the upstream surface of the membrane. The inclu- sion of .rr recognizes that it is really the total thermodynamic potential that drives the trans- membrane transport (this point will be discussed further in Chapter 24.) For this situation, the interfacial protein velocity is zero, so that a solvent mass balance across the protein boundary layer gives in which y is the distance from the upstream membrane surface into the protein boundary layer. The quantity p'S' is the density of the pure solvent, and pso = PS(y=O and vso = vSy(y=O are the mass concentration and velocity of solvent at the upstream membrane surface. The osmotic pressure ?.r is a function of the protein concentration p,, and we will provide an example of this in Problem 22C.1. We find then that the water flux across the membrane depends on the protein concentration at the membrane surface as well as the hydrodynamic pressure drop across the membrane. This concentration, in turn, can be related to v, through the membrane impermeability condition for the protein and the definition of the mass trans- fer coefficient. Then at y = 0, we describe the impermeability of the membrane to protein by where k;, has been defined analogously to k;.. Combination with Eq. 22.8-44 then gives This equation may now be solved for the filtrate velocity: Here p, = pp, + pso and 0 = &/kp is a mass transfer correction factor, analogous to O,, which now must include the effects of property changes as well as the net velocity correction intro- duced in Table 22.8-1. We return to a discussion of this quantity below (see Eq. 22.8-48). The term p,, is the solution density at the upstream membrane surface. We can now calculate the desired quantities, v, and the transmembrane pressure differ- ence, if we have sufficient information about the transport and equilibrium properties. Here we consider the approaching protein concentration pp, to be given, and for convenience we D. R. Olander, J. Heat Transfer, 84,185 (1972). R. J. Silbey and R. A. Alberty, Physical Chemistry, 3rd edition, Wiley, New York (20011, p. 206. 522.8 Transfer Coefficients at High Net Mass Transfer Rates 715 begin by selecting values of the protein concentration p,, at the membrane surface over the range between p,, and the solubility limit of the protein: (i) For any chosen value of pp,, we can calculate the corresponding value of v, from Eq. 22.8-47 with appropriate values for k, and 8. These values also permit calculation of osmotic pressure 7~ from the appropriate equilibrium relationship. (ii) We may then calculate the transmembrane pressure difference required for this flow from Eq. 22.8-43 and an appropriate value of K,. The strong effects of protein concentration on system properties mean that the solution must be obtained numerically. We content ourselves here to summarize the results of Kozinski and Lightfoot7 for bovine serum albumin; they were the first to make such calculations and seem still to have provided the best documentation. In their publications it is shown that the effective mass transfer coefficient can be expressed as the product of two factors, one accounting for the con- centration effects and another taking account of the additional effect of property variations: where, over the parameter space investigated, and Equations 22.8-49 to 52 must be considered empirical. Equation 22.8-47 overpredicts us for small polarization levels, but for that situation the effect of osmotic pressure on flow is small. The subscript re1 means \"relative to the free-stream value.\" The mass transfer coefficient in the limit of slow mass transfer and small property varia- tions is given7 as v(m) kpL = 0.6205(&)1/2(-)1'3 Sh, = Shl,, = - 9pJw) v(a) %ps(m) in which L is the disk diameter and IR is the rate of rotation in radians per unit time. The inde- pendence of mass transfer rate on disk size is the reason that this geometry is so popular for careful mass transfer studies. Other geometries are considered briefly by Kozinski and Light- A comparison of a priori predictions from the above model with experimental data is shown in Fig. 22.8-9, where we see that the two agree well. This good agreement may result in part because the albumin molecules behave much like incompressible particles at the high solvent ionic strength at which the data were taken. It may also be seen that osmotic effects are negligible below pressure drops of about 5 psi; here the predicted behavior is indistin- guishable from that of the protein-free solvent, essentially water. It is only in this unimpor- tant region that Eq. 22.8-48 is unreliable. Details of the calculations are provided in Problem 22C.1. The effect of increasing pressure difference across the protein boundary layer is quite dif- ferent from that for a nonselective membrane. At first, the concentration boundary layer gets thinner, as would be expected, and the mass transfer coefficient &, increases. However, with A. A.

In practice, these asymptotes are closely approached before the effect of po- larization becomes appreciable, relative to the membrane flow resistance, and these asymp- totes suffice to predict the relation between the transmembrane pressure difference and transmembrane flow. The behavior can be seen more clearly inserting Eq. 22.8-48 and 49 and the approximate formula into Eq. 22.8-47. Then, to a surprisingly good approximation, Eq. 22.8-47 takes the form 06 lo 20 30 40 1 The quantity in the first set of parentheses has the form of the simple film model, but with k, multiplied by 1.39. It is probably Eq. 22.8-55 that has made the simple film model attractive to many for correlating ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis data. However, neglect of the multi- plier 1.39 has caused corresponding underestimation of v,, even before addressing the effects of property variations.

Here we review some matrix approximation methods for mass transport by convection and ordinary diffusion in multicomponent gases. A fuller treatment, including mass trans- port in liquids, is given in the text by Taylor and Krishna.' Multicomponent mass transport problems are commonly approximated by lin- earization-that is, by replacing the variable properties in the governing equations with constant reference values. This approach is a useful complement to purely numerical methods, especially for complex flows, and can give good predictions when the property R. Taylor and R. Krishna, Multicomponent Mass Transfer, Wiley, New York (1993). s22.9 Matrix Approximations for Multicomponent Mass Transport 717 variations are not too large. Multicomponent analyses of this sort have been presented by many investigators, for quiescent media2 and for forced-convection systems.\"' We begin with the species continuity equations as given in Eq. 19.1-15, and apply them to an N-component gas system with N - 1 independent mole fractions x, and an equal number of independent diffusion fluxes J:. Let [XI and [J\"] denote, respectively, the column arrays of independent mole fractions x,, . . . , x,-, and independent diffusion fluxes J:, . . . , JG-,; then approximating the molar density c in Eq. 19.1-15 by a reference value c,,, gives the linearized equation system for laminar or turbulent flows free of homogeneous chemical reactions. For multicomponent ordinary diffusion, the flux expression may be written either as a matrix generalization2f4 of Fick's first law (Eq. B of Table 17.8-2), or as a matrix statement3t5 of the Maxwell-Stefan equation (Eq. 17.9-1): The matrices [Dl and [A] must be (N - 1) X (N - 1) and nonsingular to give the stated number of independent fluxes (in Eq. 22.9-2), and of independent mole fractions (in Eq. 22.9-3). Consistency of these two equations then requires that [Dl = [Alp' at any given state. In the moderate-density gas region, the elements of the matrix [A] are predictable accurately from Eq. 17.9-1, giving in which the divisors BOP are the binary diffusivities of the corresponding pairs of species. In the first approximation of the Chapman-Enskog kinetic theory of gases, the coefficient for a given pair a, p depends only on c and T, as in Eq. 17.3-11. These simple expressions lead us to prefer Eq. 22.9-3 over Eq. 22.9-2, unless measurements of [Dl are available at the desired conditions. Formally similar equations may be written in mass- or volume-based compositions and fluxes, after appropriate transformation of the coeffi- cient matrix [A] or [Dl. Mass units are preferred if the equation of motion is included in the problem formulation, since the mass average velocity is then essential as indicated in 919.2. L. Onsager, Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Equation 22.9-3 can be decoupled by use of the transformation [PI -'[A] [PI = [\" . v ] (22.9-5) AN- 1 \" \" in which [PI is the matrix of column eigenvectors of [A], and A,, . . . , A,-, are the corre- sponding eigenvalues. These eigenvalues, the roots of the equation det[A - A11 = 0, are positive at any locally stable state of the mixture; they are also invariant to similarity transformations of [A] to other composition units. Here I is the unit matrix of order N - 1. The matrix [Dl, when used, is reducible in like manner with the same matrix [PI, and its eigenvalues Dl, . . . , DN-, are the reciprocals of A,, . . . , AN-,. For economy of effort, [A] (or [Dl) and the arrays derived therefrom will always be evaluated at reference property values, so will not need the subscript ,,*; however, a subscript w will be added in [A], [Dl, [PI, and [PI-' when these arrays are based on quantities in mass units. Equation 22.9-5 suggests that the following transformed compositions and trans- formed diffusion fluxes should be useful: Hereafter, an accent (') will be placed on such transformed yariabks and on the corre- sponding diagonal matrix elements, including the eigenvalues A, and D,. Premultiplication of Eq. 22.9-3 by [PI-' and use of Eqs. 22.9-5 through 9 then gives uncoupled flux equations formally equivalent to Fick's first law for N - 1 binary systems. The multicomponent continuity equation 22.9-1 correspondingly transforms to Thus, the transformed compositions %a and fluxes j: for each a satisfy the continuity and flux equations of a binary problem with the same v\" function (laminar or turbulent) as the multicomponent system, and with a diffusivity 91AB equal to the eigenvalue D, = 1 /A,. The initial and boundary conditions on [?I and [j'] are obtained from those on 1x1 and [ J\"1 by application of Eqs. 22.9-6 and 8. The resulting quasi-binary problems may then be solved, using theory or correlations of experiments, and the results combined5 via Eqs. 22.9-7 and 9 to get the multicomponent solution in terms of [XI and [ J\"]. Local mass transfer rates in binary systems are expressible in the form as indicated in Eq. 22.1-7 and s22.8. The notation . . . after 9,, stands for any additional variables (such as 4, of 922.8) on which the binary mass transfer coefficient k; may de- pend. The corresponding set of equations in the notation of Eqs. 22.9-10 and 11 is 522.9 Matrix Approximations for Multicomponent Mass Transport 719 or in matrix form, Transformation of this result into the original variables gives the interfacial diffusion fluxes J:,, . . . , J&,,, into the gas phase as or the composition differences for given fluxes Jao as Here [kl is the diagonal matrix shown in Eq. 22.9-14, and [h-' is formed from the reci- procals of the same diagonal elements. As for binary systems, further information is needed to calculate the species fluxes N,, relative to the interface, which give the local transfer rates. A flux ratio r = NAo/NBo was specified in Eq. 21.1-9 to solve for N,,; analogous specifications are required for multicomponent systems. The calculation of the fluxes N,, from diffusion fluxes co and relative transfer rates is called the \"bootstrap problem,\"',7 and is treated well in Ref. 1. This problem becomes simpler if Eq. 22.9-14 is rewritten as follows, using the array [No] of interfacial molar fluxes N,,,, . . . , NN-l,O relative to the interface, to allow direct insertion of relations among the species transfer rates. The corresponding result for the array [no] of interfacial mass fluxes n,,,, . . . , n,-,,, relative to the interface is: Several special forms of these results will now be given. For systems with no net molar interfacial flux, the N-term summation in Eq. 22.9-17 vanishes, and this equation takes the convenient form in which the diagonal array [k] needs no net-flux correction. This result can be extended to moderate net molar interfacial flux by approximating each transfer coefficient kx(Da, $,,I in Eq. 22.9-14 as a linear function of the net molar interfacial flux, using the tangent line at 4 = 0 of the 8-curve in Fig. 22.8-2 for the chosen mass transfer model. This gives the linear equation system8 for the stagnant-film model given in 322.8. In the same manner, one obtains ' R. Krishna and G. L. Standart, Chem. Eng. Commun., 3,201-275 (1979). W. E.

For a given flow field, the product [~][k,l[~l~' in Eqs. 22.9-19 through 22 is a func- tion of the matrix [A]. This matrix triple product, here called [k,], is non-diagonal for N r 3 whereas [kl is diagonal as noted above. A simple, efficient method for approxi- mating such functions has been developed by Alopaeus and Nord6n.lo Let f be a scalar real-valued function defined on the eigenvalues of a matrix [A], in which the diagonal el- ements are dominant as in Eq. 22.9-4. The proposed approximations to the elements of the matrix [B] = f [A] are then as follows: for diagonal elements, Bii = f(Aii) (22.9-24) df(Aii) A\" d~, if A~~ = A~~ for off-diagonal elements, Bij = f(AJ - f(Aji) (22.9-25) Aij A-A,. otherwise. \" I1 Alopaeus and Nordenlo tested these approximations to mass-transfer coefficient matrices [k,] of the form b[DI1-P or the form b[AlP-', and to the corresponding fluxes N,,, in sys- tems of 3 to 25 gaseous species. Exponents p from 0.25 to 0.66 were used; values from 0 to 0.5 appear in the mass transfer expressions of this chapter. Comparisons were made against exact calculations of elements kxap and N,, via Eq. 22.9-19, and against a film model given by Krishna and Standart\" in which each element kXop is calculated independently with the corresponding binary diffusivity gap. The calculations from Eqs. 22.9-24 and 25 were 3 to 5 times quicker than those with Eq. 22.9-19 and proved quite accurate (relative errors typically less than 1% and seldom as large as lo%), especially when done directly from the diagonally dominant Stefan-Maxwell matrix [A] rather than from its inverse, [Dl. Calculations with the Krishna-Standart film model were slower than those with Eqs. 22.9- 24 and 25, and the typical errors were several times as large. Therefore, Eqs. 22.9-24 and 25 are recommended as practical approximations to the elements of the product matrix [B] = [~l[k,][P]-' in Eqs. 22.9-19 through 22 whenever Eq. 22.9-4 is used. This approxima- tion may be used in Eq. 22.9-23 also, with [Bl transformed at the end into mass-based units; however, Eq. 22.9-20 or 22 will be more convenient and comparably accurate at the moderate net molar fluxes normally encountered in heterogeneous catalysis. The accuracy of the linearized solutions depends on the choice of the reference prop- erty values, especially when the property variations are large.

Equations 22.9-17, 18 and several other approximations for multicomponent mass transfer have been tested\" against detailed variable-property integrations for isothermal systems. The conclusions from this study were as follows: For twenty problems of unsteady-state gaseous diffusion, covering a wide range of net mass transfer rates, linearization in molar units approximated the exact so- lutions best. Rates of isobutane evaporation and condensation, for the system i- C4H,,-N2-H, in the geometry of Example 20.1-1, were approximated with a standard deviation of 1.6% by Eq. 22.9-17, using reference mole fractions calcu- lated from Eq. 22.9-26 with a, = 0.5. Linearization in mass-based units, via Eq. 22.9-18, proved inferior because of the large variations in p and [A,]. This method, with its preferred a, value of 0.8, gave a standard deviation of 3.8% for the interfacial fluxes N,, of the single transferable species (isobutane). Quasi- steady-state film approximations proved less accurate; use of correction factors Ox, = $,,/(exp$,, - 1) (as given by Stewart and Prober5 for the film model of 522.8) gave a standard deviation of 7.88% with n, optimized to 1.0. The film model of Krishna and Standart,'' which does not use linearization, gave a stan- dard deviation of 14.3% independent of a, and a,. These results favor the use of Eq. 22.9-17 (or, for moderate transfer rates, Eq. 22.9-21) with a, = 0.5 for the gas phase in transfer operations described by a penetration model. 2. For twenty problems of momentum and mass transfer in laminar gaseous bound- ary layers of Hz, Nz and CO, on a porous flat plate, solved accurately by Prober; linearization in mass-based units approximated the exact solutions best. The de- tailed variable-property solutions for n,, were approximated12 for all three species with a standard deviation of 0.55% by Eq. 22.9-18, using mass transfer co- efficients ib predicted via Eq. 20.2-47 and 22.9-27 with a, optimized to 0.4. The film models of Stewart and Prober5 and of Standart and ~rishna'~ gave standard deviations of 4.78% (with a, = 1.0) and 8.25%, respectively, for the species trans- fer rates. The methods presented here are coming into widespread use in the engineering of multicomponent separation processes. Advances in computing technology have facili- tated the use of these methods and stimulated investigations toward better ones, to deal with nonlinear phenomena including complex chemical reactions.

Then verify that Eqs. 22.8-7 and 8 remain valid. Thus it is not necessary to work with the inte- grals in calculating transfer rates if hloc and kX,,,, can be predicted. (c) Show that h,,, and kx,loc have to be evaluated in terms of the physical properties and flow regime (laminar or turbulent) that prevail at the conditions for which hi,, and k&, are desired. 22B.4. An evaporative ice maker. Consider a circular shallow dish of water 0.5 m in diameter and filled to the brim, resting on an insulating layer, such as loose straw, and in a windless area. At what air temperature can the water be cooled to freezing if the relative humidity of the air is 30%? Make the following assumptions: (i) neglect radiation, (ii) consider radiation to a night sky of effective temperature 150K, and (iii) assume that the dish has a lip around the edge 2 mm high. 228.5. Oxygen stripping. Calculate the rate at which oxygen transfers from quiescent oxygen- saturated water at 20°C to a bubble of pure nitrogen 1 mm in diameter, if the bubble acts as a rigid sphere. Note that it will first be necessary to determine the bubble velocity of rise through the water. 22B.6. Controlling diffusional resistance. Water drops 2 mm in diameter are being oxygenated by falling freely through pure oxygen at 20°C and a pressure of 1 atm. Do you need to know the gas-phase diffusivity to calculate the rate of oxygen transport? Why? The solubility of oxy- gen under these conditions is 1.39 mmols/liter, and its diffusivity in the liquid phase is about 2.1 x cm2/s. Curve fit: log ~H~O = 0.6715 + 0.030 T - 0.0000798 T' Fig. 22B.7.

The diffusivity of water vapor in nitrogen is to be determined at a pressure of 1 atm over the temperature range from 0°C to 100°C by means of the \"Arnold experiment\" of Example 20.1-1. It will, therefore, be necessary to use the correc- tion factor OA, to the penetration model. Calculate this factor as a function of temperature. The vapor pressure of water in this range may be obtained from Fig. 22B.7 or calculated from where p~~~ is the vapor pressure in mm Hg, and T is the temperature in degrees centigrade. 22B.8. Marangoni effects in condensation of vapors. In many situations the heat transfer coeffi- cient for condensing vapors is given as h = k/S, where k is the thermal conductivity of the condensate film, and 6 is the film thickness. Correlations available in the literature are nor- mally based on the assumption of zero shear stress at the free surface of the film, but if the surface temperature decreases downward, there will be a shear stress 7, = duldz, where u is the surface tension, and z is measured downward, that is, in the direction of flow. How much will this effect change a heat transfer coefficient of 5000 kcal/hr m2 . C for a water film? The kinematic viscosity of water may be assumed to be 0.0029 cm2/s, the density is 0.96 g/cm3, the thermal conductivity 0.713 kcal/hr. m . C, and du/dT = -0.2 dynes/cm C for the pur- poses of this problem. (p:i2)( 3 b ) Partial Answer: p(v,) = - I+-- 2 P@ The term in .r, represents the effect of surface tension gradients, and when this term is small, its denominator will be near the value for no gradient. For the conditions of this prob- lem, pg6 = 14.3 dyn/cm2. Surface tension effects will thus be small for systems such as the one under consideration, where the surface tension increases downward. In the opposite case, however, even small gradients can cause hydrodynamic instabilities and thus can have major effects. 22B.9. Film model for spheres. Derive the results that correspond to Eqs. 22.8-3,4 for simultaneous heat and mass transfer in a system with spherical symmetry. That is, assume a spherical mass transfer surface and assume that T and XA depend only on the radial coordinate r. Show that Eqs. 22.8-7 and 8 do not need to be changed. What difficulties would be encountered if one tried to use the film theory to calculate the drag on a sphere? 22B.10. Film model for cylinders. Derive the results that correspond to Eqs. 22.8-3, 4 for a system with cylindrical symmetry. That is, assume a cylindrical mass transfer surface and assume that T and XA depend only on r. Verify that Eqs. 22.8-7,8 do not need to be changed. 22C.1. Calculation of ultrafiltration rates.

In this chapter we continue the discussion by introducing three additional factors not encountered in the earlier chapters: (a) the fluid in the system is composed of more than one chemical species; (b) chemical reactions may be occurring, along with changes of composition and production or consumption of heat; and (c) mass may be entering the system through the bounding surfaces (that is, across surfaces other than planes 1 and 2). Various mechanisms by which mass may enter or leave through the bounding surfaces of the system are shown in Fig. 23.0-1. Fig. 23.0-1.

Each of these balances will now contain one extra term, to account for mass, momentum, or energy transport across the bounding surfaces. The balances thus obtained are capable of describing industrial mass transfer processes, such as ab- sorption, extraction, ion exchange, and selective adsorption. Inasmuch as entire treatises have been devoted to these topics, all we try to do here is to show how the material dis- cussed in the preceding chapters paves the way for the study of mass transfer opera- tions. The reader interested in pursuing these topics further should consult the available textbooks and treatises.'-\" The main emphasis on this chapter is on the mass balances for mixtures. For that reason, 523.1 is accompanied by five examples, which illustrate problems arising in envi- ronmental science, isotope separation, economic evaluation, and biomedical science. In ss23.2 to 23.4 the other macroscopic balances are given. In Table 23.5-1 they are summa- rized for systems with multiple inlets and outlets. The last two sections of the chapter il- lustrate applications of the macroscopic balances to more complex systems. 523.1 THE MACROSCOPIC MASS BALANCES The statement of the law of conservation of mass of chemical species a in a multicompo- nent macroscopic flow system is This is a generalization of Eq. 7.1-2. Here ma,,, is the instantaneous total mass of a in the system, and -Awn = w,, - w,, = p,l(v,)S, - pa2(v2)S2 is the difference between the mass rates of flow of species a across planes 1 and 2. The quantity w,,, is the mass rate of addi- tion of species a to the system by mass transfer across the bounding surface. Note that w,,, is positive when mass is added to the system, just as Q and W, are taken to be posi- tive in the total energy balance when heat is added to the system and work is done on the system by moving parts. Finally, the symbol r,,t,, stands for the net rate of produc- tion of species a by homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions within the system.' Recall that in Table 15.5-1 the molecular and eddy transport of momentum and en- ergy across surfaces 1 and 2 in the direction of flow were neglected with respect to the convective transport. The same is done everywhere in this chapter-in Eq. 23.1-1 and in the other macroscopic balances presented here. W. L. McCabe, J. C. Smith, and P.

The quantities ma,,,, w,,, and r,,,, may be expressed as integrals: in which n is the outwardly directed unit normal vector, and So is that portion of the bounding surface on which mass transfer occurs. The integrands in r,,,, are the net rates of production of species a by homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, respectively. 728 Chapter 23 Macroscopic Balances for Multicomponent Systems If all N equations in Eq. 23.1-1 are summed, we get in which w, = Saw,,,, and use has been made of the law of conservation of mass in the form Z,r,,,, = 0. It is often convenient to write Eq. 23.1-1 in molar units: Here the capital letters represent the molar counterparts of the lowercase symbols in Eq. 23.1-1. When Eq. 23.1-3 is summed over all species, the result is Note that the last term is not in general zero, because moles are produced or consumed in many reaction systems. In some applications, such as spatially continuous mass transfer operations, it is cus- tomary to rewrite Eq. 23.1-1 or 3 for a differential element of the system (that is, in the \"d-form\" discussed in 515.4). Then the differentials dw,, , or d W,, can be expressed in terms of local mass transfer coefficients. A fluid stream emerges from a chemical plant with a constant mass flow rate w and dis- charges into a river (Fig. 23.1-la). It contains a waste material A at mass fraction w,,, which is Disposal of an unstable and decomposes at a rate proportional to its concentration according to the expres- Unstable Waste sion r, = -k';bA-that is, by a first-order reaction. Product To reduce pollution it is decided to allow the effluent stream to pass through a holding tank of volume V, before discharging into the river (Fig. 23.1-lb).

At time t = 0 the fluid begins to flow into the empty tank. No liquid flows out until the tank has been filled up to the volume V. Develop an expression for the concentration of the fluid in the tank as a function of time, both during the tank-filling process and after the tank has been completely filled. (a) We begin by considering the period during which the tank is being filled-that is the pe- riod t 5 pV/w, where p is the density of the fluid mixture. We apply the macroscopic mass balance of Eq. 23.1-1 to the holding tank. The quantity mA,tot on the left side is wto, at time t. The mass rate of flow entering the tank is wwAo, and there is no outflow during the tank-filling stage. No A is entering or leaving through a mass transfer interface. The mass rate of produc- tion of species A is Y,,~,, = (wt/p)(-k;\"pA) = -k~m,,t,t. Therefore the macroscopic mass balance for species A during the filling period is This first-order differential equation can be solved with the initial condition that mA,tot = 0 at t = 0 to give This may be written in terms of the instantaneous mass fraction of A in the tank by using the relation mA,tot = wtw,: The mass fraction of A at the instant when the tank is full, o,, is then given by in which K = kYpv/w = k;\"V/Q. (b) The mass balance on the tank after it has been filled is or, in dimensionless form, with T = (w/pV)t, This first-order differential equation can be solved with the initial condition that w, = w,, at r = 1 to give This shows that as time progresses the mass fraction of the pollutant being discharged into the river decreases exponentially, with a limiting value of The curve for the mass concentration as a function of time after the filling of the tank is shown in Fig. 23.1-l(c). This curve can be used to determine conditions such that the effluent concen- tration will be in the permitted range. Equation 23.1-12 can be used to decide on the size of holding tank that is required. 730 Chapter 23 Macroscopic Balances for Multicomponent Systems product Fig. 23.1-2. Binary splitter, in which a feed stream is split into P, y, Y a product stream and a waste stream. EXAMPLE 23.1-2 Bind y Splitters Describe the operation of a binary splitter, one of the commonest and simplest separation de- vices (see Fig. 23.1-2). Here a binary mixture of A and B enters the apparatus in a feed stream at a molar rate F, and by some separation mechanism it is split into a product stream with a molar rate P and a waste stream with molar rate W. The mole fraction of A (the desired com- ponent) in the feed stream is z, and the mole fractions in the product and waste streams are y and x, respectively. SOL UTION We start by writing the steady-state macroscopic mass balances for component A and for the entire fluid as ZF =yP + XW (23.1-13) F=P+W (23.1-14) It is customary to define the ratio 0 = P/F of the molar rates of the product and feed streams as the cut. Equation 23.1-13 then becomes, after eliminating W by use of Eq. 23.1-14, Normally the cut 0 and the feed composition z are taken to be known. We now need a relation between the feed and waste compositions, and it is conventional to write an equation relating the compositions of the two outgoing streams: Here a is known as the separation facfor, also usually taken as known, and which characterizes the separation capability of the splitter. Here Y and X are the mole ratios defined by Y x=- and X = - x 1-x (23.1-17,18) 1-Y In terms of the mole fractions, Eq. 23.1-16 may be written as Equations 23.1-15 and 19 (or 20) describe completely the splitter operation. For vapor-liquid splitting-that is, equilibrium distillation-it is typical to define the ideal splitter in terms of an operation in which the product and waste streams are in equilib- rium. For this situation, a is the relative volatility, and for thermodynamically ideal systems, it is just the ratio of the component vapor pressures. Even for nonideal systems, a changes rela- tively slowly with composition. For real splitters one can then define a in terms of an empirical correction factor-for ex- ample, the eficiency-defined by a = Ea* (23.1-21) where a* is the separation factor for the ideal model, and E is a correction factor that accounts for the failure of the actual system to meet the ideal behavior. We thus find that, for a given feed composition, the enrichment (y - z)/z produced by the splitter is a function of the cut 0 and the separation factor a. The enrichment can be calculated from the following equation, which is obtained by combining Eqs. 23.1-15 and 20: s23.1 The Macroscopic Mass Balances 731 Fig. 23.1-3. Behavior of a binary splitter. N 1 N I 3 0 In 0 = cut This is a quadratic equation for y that can be solved when z is given, and then the enrichment (y - z)/z is obtained. An example is given in Fig. 23.1-3 where both (y - z)/z and 58(y - z)/z are plotted as functions of 8 for z = 5 and a = 1.25 (a reasonable value for many processes). It may be seen that, whereas the maximum enrichment (y - z)/z is obtained for vanishingly small cuts, the product of enrichment and product rate is greatest at an intermediate 9 value. Finding an optimum 8 value is a problem that must be addressed on economic grounds. Simple splitters of the general type pictured in Fig. 23.1-2 are very widely used as build- ing blocks in multistage separation processes. These include evaporators and crystallizers, which typically have a very high separation factor a per stage, and systems for distillation, gas absorption, and liquid extraction, where a can vary widely. All of these applications are well covered in standard texts on unit operations. Membrane processes are rapidly increasing in importance, and many of the design prin- ciples were developed for the isotope fractionation industry.' Discussions of modern applica- tions are also a~ailable.~ EXAMPLE 23.1-3 The Macroscopic Balances and Dirac's \"Separative Capacity\" and \"Value Function\" During the Manhattan Project of World War 11, the British physicist Dira~~,~,~ used the macro- scopic mass balances for a binary splitter to develop a criterion for comparing the effective- ness of different separation processes-for example, thermal diffusion and centrifugation. The same criterion has also proven useful in the evaluation of bioseparations. We imagine the simple separation system shown in Fig. 23.1-2 in which F is the molar rate of flow of the feed stream, which contains a binary mixture of A and B, and P and Ware the molar rates of flow of the product and waste streams. The mole fractions of species A in the three streams are z, y, and x, respectively. In the system there is some mechanism (for example, a membrane) for increasing the concentration of A in the product stream and decreasing it in the waste stream. We then may define a separation factor a as in Eqs. 23.1-16 to 18 E. Von Halle and J. Schacter, Diffusion Separation Methods, in Volume 8 of Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology (M.

Cohen, Theory of Isotope Separation, McGraw-Hill, New York (1951). 732 Chapter 23 Macroscopic Balances for Multicomponent Systems SOLUTION We have written this in a second form, because we will consider only systems in which there is only a slight enrichment of species A, so that a - 1 is a very small quantity. When Eq. 23.1- 23 is solved for y as a function of x we then get Next we define the Dirac separative capacity A of the system as the net increase in \"value\" (this could, for example, be the monetary value) of the streams that are participating in the system: in which v(x) is the Dirac value function. (In the separation science literature, the separative ca- pacity is often given the symbol 6U.) Show how the separative capacity and value function can be obtained by using the defin- ition in Eq. 23.1-25 along with the mass balances for the system. The total mass balance and the mass balance for species A are: We now divide Eq. 23.1-27 by F, and then use Eq. 23.1-26 to eliminate W. Then introducing the quantity 8 = P/F (called the \"cuV), we get Next we divide Eq. 23.1-25 by F and introduce 8 to get Inasmuch as the differences between the concentrations of the streams are quite small, we can expand v(y) and v(x) about z and get where the primes indicate differentiation with respect to z. When these expressions are put into Eq. 23.1-29 and we use Eq. 23.1-28, we get When we use Eq. 23.1-24, this last equation becomes We now assume that the separative capacity of the system is virtually independent of concen- tration. Therefore we set the concentration-dependent factor in Eq. 23.1-33 equal to unity, so that is the final expression for the separative capacity. According to this expression, the separative capacity has a maximum when the system is operated at 0 = f. It remains to obtain the Dirac value function, which must satisfy the differential equation g23.1 The Macroscopic Mass Balances 733 When this equation is integrated, we get The two integration constants may be assigned arbitrarily, and several different choices have been used. However, the most common choice is v($) = 0 and v1(;) = 0. This leads to which is the symmetrical solution, in the sense that v(l - z) = v(z) and vl(l - z) = -vl(z). The value function v(z) and the separative capacity A have proven useful in comparing separations made in different kinds of equipment as well as different concentration ranges. From an economic standpoint v(z) as given by Eq. 23.1-37 has been found useful for determin- ing price differences for isotope mixtures of differing purity. EXAMPLE 23.1-4 Compartmental One of the simplest and most useful applications of the species macroscopic mass balance is compartmental analysis, in which a complex system is treated as a network of perfect mixers, each of constant volume, connected by ducts of negligible volume, with no dispersion occur- Analysis ring in the connecting ducts. Imagine mixing units, labeled 1, 2,3, . . . , n, . . . , N, containing various species (labeled with indices a, P, y, . . .). Then the mass concentration p,, of species a in unit n changes with time according to the equation Here V, is the volume of unit n, Q,, is the volumetric flow rate of solvent flow from unit m to unit n, and r,, is the rate of formation of species a per unit volume in unit n. Show how such a model can be specialized to describe the removal of toxic metabolic products (that is, the toxic materials resulting from the human metabolism) from a patient by hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is the periodic removal of toxic metabolites achieved by contacting the blood and a dialysis fluid in countercurrent flow, separated by a cellophane membrane that is permeable to the metabolite. SOLUTION The simple two-compartment model of Fig. 23.1-4 has been found to be adequate for repre- senting the hemodialysis system. Here the large block, or compartment 1 (labeled \"body\") rep- resents the combined body fluids, except for those in the blood, which are represented by compartment 2. The blood circulates via a branching system of vessels through compartment 1 at a volumetric rate Q, and in the process extracts solute across the vessel walls. This process is highly efficient, and a single solute is assumed to leave compartment 1 at concentration p,, equal to the concentration throughout that compartment. At the same time, the solute is being formed within the body fluids at a constant rate GI and during dialysis it is being extracted from the blood by the dialyzer at a rate Dp,. The proportionality constant D is known as the \"dialyzer clearance\" and is fixed by the dialyzer design and operating conditions. Fig. 23.1-4. Two-compartment model used to analyze the functioning of a dialyzer. 734 Chapter 23 Macroscopic Balances for Multicomponent Systems The very complex process actually taking place is modeled by the two equations with D = 0 between the dialysis periods. Because we are considering a single solute, the con- centrations have only one subscript to indicate the compartment. We measure the time t from the start of a dialysis procedure, when the blood and body fluids are very nearly in equilib- rium with each other, so that we may write the initial conditions as 1. C.: at t = 0, PI = P2 = Po (23.1-41) where p, is a constant. We now want to get an explicit expression for the toxic metabolite con- centration in the blood as a function of time. We start by adding Eqs. 23.1-39 and 40 and solving for dp,/dt. The latter is then substi- tuted into the time derivative of Eq. 23.1-40 to obtain a differential equation for the metabolite concentration in the blood: with I. C.: at t = 0, The second initial condition is obtained by use of Eqs. 23.1-40 and 41. This equation is now to be solved with the following specific parameter values, which are typical for the removal of creatinine from a 70-kg adult human: v1 v2 Q D G Po Quantity (liters) (liters) (liters per min) (liters per min) (g/min) (g per liter) Magnitude 43 4.5 5.4 0.3 0.0024 0.140 The differential equation and initial conditions now take the form: I. C.: at time t = 0, P2 = Po and dp2 = -0.00933 (23.1-45) in which concentration is in grams per liter and time is in minutes. The complementary func- tion that satisfies the associated homogeneous equation is P,,~, = C, exp(0.006043t) + C2 exp(1.386t) (23.1-46) and the particular integral is p2,pi = 0.0080 The complete solution to the nonhomogeneous equation is given by the sum of the comple- mentary function and the particular integral. When the constants of integration are deter- mined from the initial conditions, we get during the dialysis period. s23.1 The Macroscopic Mass Balances 735 For the recovery period following dialysis, we assume here that the patient has no kid- ney function, so the clearance D is zero. Equation 23.1-42 takes the simpler form where p' is the concentration during the recovery period. The complementary function and particular integral are I Gt' = v1 + v2 in which t' is the time measured from the start of the recovery period. Inserting the numer- ical values, we then get for the concentration during the recovery period and its time derivative The integration constants are to be determined from the matching conditions at t' = 0, We need a second initial condition for determining the integration constants in Eq. 23.1-53. This can be obtained from Eq. 23.1-40 and the corresponding equation for p; (i.e., with D = O), combined with the two relations in Eqs. 23.1-55 and 56. This relation is For illustrative purposes, we shall end the dialysis at 50 min, for which We now have enough information to determine the constants of integration, and therefore we get for the concentration in the blood during the recovery period Equations 23.1-48 and 59 are plotted in Fig. 23.1-5. Of perhaps more interest is Fig. 23.1-6, which shows the application of Eqs. 23.1-39 and 40 to an actual patient. Here the points represent data and the lines are the model predictions.

The resulting model is then used to predict the next three cycles. We see that this approach does an excellent job of corre- lating the data and has predictive value. Note that the sudden rise in creatinine concentration at 50 min results from the fact that the dialyzer is no longer removing it from the blood. As a result, the disequilibrium between the blood and the rest of the body then becomes smaller. Similar compartmental models have wide application in medicine, where they are re- ferred to as pharmacokinetic model~.~ A priori pharmacokinetic modeling, where model para- meters are determined separately from the process being modeled, was pioneered by Bischoff and Dedri~k.~ In the foregoing example it is clear, even on casual inspection, that neither the body fluids nor the circulating blood have much in common with ideal mixing tanks, and it is therefore of Time and some interest to examine the success of the simple compartmental model critically. To make a Ahdel Insensitivity start in that direction, compare the response (that is, the output concentration) of two quite different systems in Fig. 23.1-7 to an exponentially decaying solute input: one in which the en- PFR Dimensionless time r = t/tO Fig. 23.1-7.

As shown in Fig. 23.1-7, the responses to a pulse input are quite different for the PFR and the CSTR. Assume steady flow at a volu- metric flow rate Q through each system, and further assume that the tracer being followed is too dilute to affect the flow behavior of the carrier solvent. Assume that no reaction is occurring. For both systems we assume that the concentration is initially zero throughout and that the concentration of species a in the inlet stream is pa = PO exp(- t/to) (23.1 -60) where p, and t, are constants, specific to the problem. For the PFR, the exit stream concentration shows only a time delay and decay, and we may write at once for X = p,/po X = 0 for t < t,,, (23.1-61) where t,,, = V/Q is the mean solute residence time, a second time constant imposed on the sys- tem. The result for longer time is which is of more interest to us here. For the CSTR we begin with the basic differential equation with the initial condition that X = 0 at t = 0. This first-order linear differential equation has the solution in which a = to/t,,, and .r = t/to. Exit concentrations are plotted in Fig. 23.1-8 as functions of the dimensionless time r = t/t, for each reactor and for l/a = t,,,/to of 0.1 and 1.0. It may be seen that for l/a = t,,,/t, = 1.0 the two reactors produce much different efflu- ent concentrations, as one might expect. However, for t,,,/to << 1 and t significantly greater than t,,,, the effluent curves for the two reactors are virtually indistinguishable. This is the re- gion of validity for compartmental analysis, and we see that in addition to the time constants imposed by the system itself, there is also another time constant tabs, the time at which the ob- PFR Fig. 23.1-8. Response of the PFR and the CSTR to an exponentially decaying input. 738 Chapter 23 Macroscopic Balances for Multicomponent Systems servations of the effluent concentration begin. We may then define the range of validity of compartmental analysis by the inequalities Thus, compartmental analysis is most useful as a long-time approximate description of a sys- tem that responds slowly relative to solute residence times of its component units. It may im- mediately be seen that these conditions are met in Example 23.1-4, where the long-time metabolite concentrations are of primary interest. Equation 23.1-66 summarizes the requirements for pharmacokinetics, which are met in a very wide variety of biological transport-reaction problems. They are also satisfied in a great many environmental situations.' 523.2 THE MACROSCOPIC MOMENTUM AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM BALANCES The macroscopic statements of the laws of conservation of momentum and angular mo- mentum for a fluid mixture, with gravity as the only external force, are These (seldom used) equations are the same as Eqs. 7.2-2 and 7.3-2, except for the addi- tion of the terms Fo and To, which are the net influxes' of momentum and angular mo- mentum into the system by mass transfer. For most mass transfer processes these terms are so small that they can be safely neglected. 523.3 THE MACROSCOPIC ENERGY BALANCE For a fluid mixture, the macroscopic statement of the law of conservation of energy is I I This equation is the same as Eq. 15.1-2, except that an additional term Qo has been added.' This term accounts for addition of energy to the system as a result of mass trans- ' F. H. Shair and K. L. Heitner, Envir. Sci. and Tech., 8,444-451 (1974). These terms may be written as integrals, F, = - [n . pw] dS; I To = - [n . {r x pw]] dS I (23.2-1 a, b) so 50 in which n is the outwardly directed unit normal vector. This term may be written as an integral, in which n is the outwardly directed unit normal vector. The origin of this term may be seen by referring to Eq. 19.3-5 and Eq. (H) of Table 17-8-1. s23.5 Use of the Macroscopic Balances to Solve Steady-State Problems 739 fer. It may be of considerable importance, particularly if material is entering through the bounding surface at a much higher or lower temperature than that of the fluid inside the flow system, or if it reacts chemically in the system. When chemical reactions are occurring, considerable heat may be released or ab- sorbed. This heat of reaction is automatically taken into account in the calculation of the enthalpies of the entering and leaving streams (see Example 23.5-1). In some applications, in which the energy transfer rates across the surface are func- tions of position, it is more convenient to rewrite Eq. 23.3-1 in the d-form-that is, over a differential portion of the flow system as described in 915.4. Then the increment of heat added, dQ, is expressible in terms of a local heat transfer coefficient. 523.4 THE MACROSCOPIC MECHANICAL ENERGY BALANCE A careful examination of the derivation of the mechanical energy balance in g7.8 shows that the result obtained there applies to mixtures as well as to pure fluids. If we now in- clude the surface So, then we get I I This is the same as Eq. 7.4-2, except for the addition of the term B,, which accounts for the mechanical energy transport across the mass transfer boundary.' The use of this equation is illustrated in Example 22.5-3. 823.5 USE OF THE MACROSCOPIC BALANCES TO SOLVE STEADY-STATE PROBLEMS The macroscopic balances are summarized in Table 23.5-1 for systems with more than one entry and exit plane. The terms with subscript 0 describe the addition or removal of mass, momentum, angular momentum, energy, and mechanical energy at mass- transfer surfaces. Usually these balances are not used in their entirety, but it is conve- nient to have a complete listing of them for problem-solving purposes. For steady-state problems, the left sides of the equations may be omitted. As we saw in Chapters 7 and 15, considerable intuition is required in using the macroscopic balances, and some- times it is necessary to supplement the equations with experimental observations. EXAMPLE 23.5-1 Energy Balances for a Sulfur Dioxide Converter Hot gases from a sulfur burner enter a converter, in which the sulfur dioxide present is to be oxidized catalytically to sulfur trioxide, according to the reaction SO2 + ;o, S SO3. How much heat must be removed from the converter per hour to permit a 95% conversion of the SO, for the conditions shown in Fig. 23.5-I? Assume that the converter is large enough for the components of the exit gas to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with one another. That is, the partial pressures of the exit gases are related by the equilibrium constraint In terms of a surface integral, this term is given by 740 Chapter 23 Macroscopic Balances for Multicomponent Systems Table 23.5-1 Unsteady-State Macroscopic Balances for Nonisothermal Multicomponent Systems Mass of species a: d - dt %,tot = Zw.1 - Zw,, + w,, + r.tot = 1.2,3,. . .N Momentum: Angular momentum: Mechanical energy: (Total) energy: Notes: (a) Bw,, = w,,, + walb + wale + . . , where w,,, = p,,,v,,S,,, and so on; Equations (A) and (B) can be written in molar units by replacing the lowercase symbols by capital letters and adding to Eq.

(a) ~etermination' of T,. We begin by writing the steady-state macroscopic mass balance, Eq. 23.1-3, for the various constituents in the two streams in the form: In addition, we take advantage of the two stoichiometric relations We can now get the desired molar flow rates through surface 2: Next, substituting numerical values into the equilibrium expression Eq. 23.5-1 gives This value of K, corresponds to an exit temperature T2 of about 510°C, according to the equi- librium data given above. (b) Calculation of the required heat removal. As indicated by the results of Example 15.3-1, changes in kinetic and potential energy may be neglected here in comparison with changes in enthalpy. In addition, for the conditions of this example, we may assume ideal gas behavior. Then, for each constituent, = ~I,(T).

The apparatus consists essentially of a vertical pipe filled with a randomly arranged packing of small rings of a chemically inert material. The liquid L is sprayed evenly over the top of the packing and trickles over the surfaces of these small rings. In so doing, it is intimately con- tacted with the gas mixture that is passing up the tower. This direct contacting between the two streams permits the transfer of A from the gas to the liquid. The gas and liquid streams enter the apparatus at molar rates of - WG and W,, respec- tively, on an A-free basis. Note that the gas rate is negative, because the gas stream is flowing from plane 2 to plane 1 in this problem. The molar ratio of A to G in the entering gas stream is YA2 = yA2/(1 - yA2), and the molar ratio of A to L in the entering liquid stream is X,, = xAl/(l - xAl). Develop an expression for the tower height z required to reduce the molar ratio YA in the gas stream from YA2 to Y,,, in terms of the mass transfer coefficients in the two streams and the stream rates and compositions. Assume that the concentration of A is always small in both streams, so that the operation may be considered isothermal and so that the high mass-transfer rate corrections to the mass transfer coefficients are not needed, and the mass transfer coefficients, k: and k!, defined in the second line of Eq. 22.2-14 can be used. Since the behavior of a packed tower is quite complex, we replace the true system by a hypo- thetical model. We consider the system to be equivalent to two streams flowing side-by-side with no back-mixing, as shown in Fig. 23.5-3, and in contact with one another across an inter- facial area a per unit volume of packed column (see Eq. 22.1-14). We further assume that the fluid velocity and composition of each stream are uniform over the tower cross section, and neglect both eddy and molecular transport in the flow direc- tion. We also consider the concentration profiles in the direction of flow to be continuous curves, not appreciably affected by the placement of the individual packing particles. The model resulting from these simplifying assumptions is probably not a very satisfac- tory description of a packed tower. The neglect of back-mixing and fluid-velocity nonunifor- mity are probably particularly serious. However, the presently available correlations for mass J. D. Seader and E. J.

Note that in this drawing WG is negative; that is, the gas is flowing from 2 toward 1. transfer coefficients have been calculated on the basis of this model, which should therefore be employed when these correlations are used. We are now in a position to develop an expression for the column height, and we do this in two stages: (a) First we use the overall macroscopic mass balance to determine the exit liquid-phase composition and the relation between bulk compositions of the two phases at Liquid stream in: Gas stream out: Solute-free liquid rate = WL It Solute-free gas rate = WG Mole ratio of solute = XAl Mole ratio of solute = YAl Liquid steam out: I I Gas stream in: Solute-free liquid rate = WL Solute-free gas rate = WG Mole ratio of solute = XA2 Mole ratio of solute = YA2 Fig. 23.5-3.

(b) We then use these results along with the differential form of the macroscopic mass balance to determine the interfacial conditions and the required tower height. (a) Overall macroscopic mass balances. For the solute A we write the macroscopic mass bal- ance of Eq. 23.1-3 for each stream of the system between planes l and 2 as liquid stream gas stream Here the subscripts A1 and Ag refer to the solute A in the liquid and gas streams, respectively. Since the number of moles leaving the liquid stream must enter the gas stream across the in- terface, WAlr0 = - W,,,,, and Eqs. 23.5-14 and 15 may be combined to give This can now be rewritten in terms of the compositions of the entering and leaving streams by setting WAl2 = WLXA2, and so on, and then rearrangement gives Thus we have found the concentration of A in the exit liquid stream. By replacing plane 2 by a plane at a distance z down the column, Eq. 23.5-17 may be used to obtain an expression relating bulk stream compositions at any point in the tower: Equation 23.5-18 (the \"operating line\") is shown in Fig. 23.5-4 along with the equilibrium dis- tribution for the conditions of Problem 23A.2. (b) Application of the macroscopic-balances in the d-form. We now apply Eq. 23.1-3 to a dif- ferential increment dz of the tower, first to estimate the interfacial conditions and then deter- mine the tower height required for a given separation. (i) Determination of interfacial conditions. Because only A is transferred across the in- terface, we may write, according to the second line of Eq. 22.1-14 (which presumes low concentrations of A and small mass-transfer rates): Here a is the interfacial area per unit volume of the packed bed tower, S is the cross- sectional area of the tower, XAO and yAO are the interfacial mole fractions of A in the liquid and gas phases, respectively, and xA and yA are the corresponding bulk con- centrations (the index b is being omitted here, so that XA, yA, XA, and YA are all bulk compositions). Then, since (for the dilute solutions considered here) xA = XA/(XA + 1) = XA and yA = YA/(YA + 1) = YA, Eqs. 23.5-19 and 20 may be combined to give This equation enables us to determine YAO as a function of YA. For any YA, one may locate XA on the operating line (mass balance). One then draws a straight line of slope -(@a)/($a) through the point (YA, XA), as shown in Fig. 23.5-4. The intersec- tion of this line with the equilibrium curve then gives the local interfacial composi- tions (YAO, XAO). 523.5 Use of the Macroscopic Balances to Solve Steady-State Problems 745 Fig. 23.5-4. Calculation of interfacial conditions in the absorption of cyclohexane from air in a packed column (see Problem 23A.2). (ii) Determination of required column height. Application of Eq. 23.1-1 to the gas stream in a volume S dz of the tower gives WG~YA = ~WA,O (23.5-22) This expression may be combined with Eq. 23.5-20 for the dilute solutions being considered to obtain - WGdYA = (kyOa)(YA - YAO)S dz (23.5-23) This equation may now be rearranged and integrated from z = 0 to z = Z: Equation 23.5-24 is the desired expression for the column height required to effect the speci- fied separation. In writing Eq. 23.5-24 we have neglected the variation of the mass transfer co- efficient k: with composition. This is usually permissible only for dilute solutions. In general, Eq. 23.5-24 must be integrated by numerical or graphical procedures. How- ever, for dilute solutions, it may frequently be assumed that the operating and equilibrium lines of Fig. 23.5-4 are straight. If, in addition, the ratio @/k; is constant, then YA - Y,, varies linearly with Y,. We may then integrate Eq. 23.5-24 to obtain (see Problem 23B.1) where Equation 23.5-25 can be rearranged to give 746 Chapter 23 Macroscopic Balances for Multicomponent Systems Comparison of Eq. 23.5-27 and Eq. 15.4-15 shows the close analogy between packed towers and simple heat exchangers. Expressions analogous to Eq. 23.5-24 but containing the overall mass transfer coefficient K! may also be derived (see Problem 23B.1). Again, we may use the final results, Eqs. 23.5-25 or 27, for either cocurrent or countercurrent flow. Keep in mind, however, that the simplified model used to describe the packed tower is not as reliable as the corresponding one used for heat exchangers. EXAMPLE 23.5-3 Linear Cascades We saw in Example 23.1-2 that the degree of separation possible in a simple binary splitter can be quite limited, and it is therefore often desirable to combine individual splitters in a countercurrent cascade such as that shown in Fig. 23.5-5. Here the feed to any splitter stage is the sum of the waste stream from the splitter immediately above it and the product from the splitter immediately below. Show how such an arrangement can increase the degree of separation relative to that ob- tained in a single splitter. SOLUTION For the system as a whole we can write a mass balance for the desired product and for the so- lution as a whole. That is, we treat the entire system as a splitter and write It will be assumed here that all of quantities in these equations are given, so that the problem is specified as far as the overall mass balances are concerned. It remains for us to determine the number of stages required to meet these conditions. We begin by writing a set of mass balances over the top portion of the column, here the top two stages for illustrative purposes (see Fig. 23.5-5): Here U, and D, are the upflowing and downflowing streams from stage n, and y, and x,, are the corresponding mole fractions of the desired solute. When P is eliminated between Eqs. 23.5-3 and 31, we get This equation gives the relation between the compositions of the downflowing and upflowing streams passing each other at any column cross section above the feed stage, in terms of the cor- responding flow rates. This relation, when shown on an x-y plot (which is called a McCabe-Tkiele diag~arn~,~) is known as the operating line for the system. We concentrate for the moment on com- positions and return later to the problem of determining stream rate ratios. F$4 I 5 Fig. 23.5-5. A linear cascade. Upward flows are shown by solid :+ lines, and downward flows by dashed lines. W. L. McCabe and E. W. Thiele, Ind. Eng. Chem., 17,605411 (1925). 523.5 Use of the Macroscopic Balances to Solve Steady-State Problems 747 The phase compositions in each stage are assumed to satisfy an equilibrium relation such as (see Eq. 23.1-19) or, more generally, y,, = f (xJ, where f (x) is taken to be a known function. Equations 23.5-32 and 33 (or its generalization) now permit determination of all composi- tions in the portion of the column above the feed point, usually known as the rectifying section, and similar calculations can be made for the stripping section, the portion below the feed point. We may then determine the number of stages required for the separation under consideration and the proper location of the feed stage. First, however, we need to determine the stream rate ratios required in Eq. 23.5-32, and we consider three special cases here: (a) Total reflux. This special mode of operation, in which P and Ware zero, is important, as it provides the smallest possible number of stages that can yield the desired output composi- tions. Here Un = Dn-l (23.5-34) for all n, and the operating line is given by This simple relation holds for all physical systems. The stage compositions are plotted in Fig. 23.5-6 (for a product mole fraction of 0.9 and a waste mole fraction of 0.0, along with an equi- librium curve of the form of Eq. 23.5-33 with a = 2.5. The steplike lines between the equilibrium and operating lines in this figure suggest a graphical method of determining stage compositions: each \"step\" between the equilibrium and operating lines represents an incremental one-component splitter or stage. The diagram thus suggests that six stages are required for this rather simple separation. However, for the situation of total reflux and constant relative volatility a, it is simplest to recognize that For the situation pictured in Fig. 23.5-6, we have then 0'9/0'1 = (N - 1) log 2.5 log (m) log 81 N = 1 + - = 5.796 log 2.5 which is more accurate but virtually equal to the graphical estimate. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Lower phase mole fraction, x Fig. 23.5-6. McCabe-Thiele diagram for total reflux, with a = 2.5 and 0.1 < x < 0.9. 748 Chapter 23 Macroscopic Balances for Multicomponent Systems If products are to be withdrawn, it is necessary to calculate the stream-rate ratios, and the means for doing so vary with the specific operation considered. (b) Thermodynamic constraints: adiabatic cascades and minimum reflux. For most of the common stagewise operations, stream ratios are determined by thermodynamic constraints, and these are thoroughly discussed in a wide variety of unit operations texts. We need not re- peat this readily accessible information here, but we briefly consider distillation, the most widely used of all, by way of example. In principle, stream ratios in distillation are deter- mined by assuming adiabatic columns and a set of \"enthalpy balances\" (see last paragraph of s15.1) corresponding to the mass balances just introduced. However, it is very often permissible to assume equal molar heats of vaporizatio_n for the various species and to neglect \"sensible heats\" (i.e., the CpAT contributions to AH). With these simplifications the stream rates U, and D, are constants. We may then write for any po- sition above the feed plate U= D + P and y,_lU=x,D +ypP (23.5-39/40) and below the feed plate D = U+ W and x,D = y,, ,U + x,W (23.5-41/42) Here the stage indices n and rn refer respectively to the upper or rectifying section (above the feed point) and to the lower or stripping section of the column (below the feed point). By way of example we consider the system in part (a) for a saturated liquid feed, equimo- lar in the two species involved, and operated at minimum reflux: the smallest amount of re- turning liquid from the top plate that can produce the desired separation. This situation will occur when the operating line touches the equilibrium curve, and in the system being consid- ered, this \"pinch will occur first at the feed plate. The vapor composition on the feed plate is then given by The operating line then has two branches, one above and one below the feed plate, as shown in Fig. 23.5-7. Any real column must operate between the limits of total and minimum reflux, but nor- mal operation is just a few percent above the minimum. This is because the cost of individual plates tends to be much lower than the costs associated with increasing the reflux (the liquid returned to the column by condensation of vapor from the top plate): increasing the steam load required to return vapor from the liquid leaving the bottom plate, the condenser load to return the overhead vapor, and the capital costs of larger column diameter, larger reboiler, to return vapor at the bottom, and condenser, to return liquid at the top. \"0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Lower phase mole composition, x Fig. 23.5-7.

McCabe-Thiele diagram for an ideal cascade, with a = 2.5 and 0.1 < x < 0.9. (c) Transport constraints and ideal cascades. For separation via selectively permeable mem- branes, the ratio of the product to waste streams is governed by the pressure exerted across the membrane, and the energy required to produce this pressure must be renewed for every stage of the cascade. This gives the designer an extra degree of freedom and has led to a wide variety of cascade configurations. First developed for isotopes; membrane cascades have now been developed for industrial gas separations6 and appear promising for many other applications. We consider here by example ideal cascades, which are those in which only streams of identical composition are mixed. In the terms of this example, that means and, by extension, It follows that just twice as many stages are needed as at total reflux, and that the operating line lies halfway between the \"equilibrium\" curve and the 45\" line. As shown in Fig. 23.5-8, the operating line has a continuous derivative across the feed stage. Ideal cascades provide the smallest possible total stage stream flows, but the flows now vary with position: they are highest at the feed stage and decrease toward the ends of the cas- cade. For this reason these systems are known as tapered cascades (see Problem 23B.6). An equimolar mixture of CO, and Hz is confined at lOOOK and 1.50 atm in the large insulated pressure tank shown in Fig. 15.5-9. Under these conditions the reaction Expansion of a Reactive Gas Mixture C02 + H, & CO + H20 (23.5-47) ntrough a may take place. After being stored in the tank long enough for the reaction to proceed to equi- Adiabatic Nozzle librium, the gas is allowed to escape through the small converging nozzle shown to the ambi- ent pressure of 1 atm.

In each case, assume that the expansion is adiabatic and frictionless. We begin by assuming quasi-steady-state operation, flat velocity profiles, and negligible changes in potential energy. We also assume constant heat capacities and ideal gas behavior, and we neglect diffusion in the direction of flow. We may then write the macroscopic energy balance, Eq. 23.3-1, in the form Here the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to conditions in the tank and at the nozzle throat, respec- tively, and, as in Example 15.5-4, the fluid velocity in the tank is assumed to be zero. To determine the enthalpy change, we equate d(iv2) from the d-form of the steady-state energy balance (Eq. 23.3-1) to d($v2) of the d-form of the steady-state mechanical energy bal- ance (Eq. 23.4-1) to get This result also follows from Eq: E of Table 19.2-4. In addition to Eq. 23.5-49, we use the ideal gas law and %n expression for H(T), obtained with the help of Table 17.1-1, Eq. 19.3-16, and the relation pH = ch, to get Here x, is the mole fraction of the species a at temperature T,and & is the molar enthalpy of species a at the reference temperature To. The evaluation of His discussed separately for the two approximations. Approximation (a):Assumption of very slow chemical reaction. Here the x, are constant at the equilibrium values for 1000K, and we may write Eq. 23.5-51 as Hence we may write Eq. 23.5-49 in the form - Since x, and C,, are assumed constant, this equation may to get T (23.5-53) be integrated from (p,, T,) to (p,, TJ We may now combine this expression with Eqs. 23.5-48 and 51 to obtain the desired expres- sion for the gas velocity at plane 2: 523.5 Use of the Macroscopic Balances to Solve Steady-State Problems 751 By substituting numerical values into Eqs. 23.5-54 and 55, we obtain (see Problem 23A.1) T2 = 920K and v, = 1726 ft/s. It may be seen that this treatment is very similar to that presented in Example 15.5-4. It is also subject to the restriction that the throat velocity must be subsonic; that is, the pressure in the nozzle throat cannot fall below that fraction of p, required to pro- duce sonic velocity at the throat (see Eq. 15B.6-2). If the ambient pressure falls below this criti- cal value of p,, the throat pressure will remain at the critical value, and there will be a shock wave beyond the nozzle exit. Approximation 0: Assumption of ve y rapid reaction. We may proceed here as in part (a), except that the mole fractions x, must now be considered functions of the temperature de- fined by the equilibrium relation and the stoichiometric relations The quantity KJT) in Eq. 23.5-56 is the known equilibrium constant for the reaction. It may be considered as a function only of temperature, because of the assumed ideal gas behavior and because the number of moles present is not affected by the chemical reaction. Equations 23.5- 57 and 58 follow from the stoichiometry of the reaction and the composition of the gas origi- nally placed in the tank. The expression for the final temperature is now considerably more complicated. For this reaction, where C.,x,M, is constant, Eqs. 23.5-49 and 50 may be combined to give where, with the heat capacities approximated as constar~ts, In general, the integral in Eq. 23.5-60 must be evaluated numerically, since the x, and the dx,/dT are all complicated functions of temperature governed by Eqs. 23.5-56 to 59. Once T2 has been determined from Eq. 23.5-61, however, v, may be obtained by use of Eqs. 23.548 and 51. By substituting numerical values into these expressions, we obtain (see Problem 23B.2) T2 = 937K and v2 = 1752 ft /s. We find, then, that both the exit temperature and the velocity from the nozzle are greater when chemical equilibrium is maintained throughout the expansion. The reason for this is that the equilibrium shifts with decreasing temperature in such a way as to release heat of re- action to the system. Such a release of energy will occur with decreasing temperature in any system at chemical equilibrium, regardless of the reactions involved. This is one consequence of the famous rule of Le Chatelier. In this case, the reaction is endothermic as written and the equilibrium constant decreases with falling temperature. As a result, CO and H,O are par- tially reconverted to H, and C02 on expansion, with a corresponding release of energy. It is interesting that in rocket engines the exhaust velocity, hence the engine thrust, are also increased if rapid equilibration can be obtained, even though the combustion reactions are strongly exothermic. The reason for this is that the equilibrium constants for these reac- tions increase with falling temperature so that the heat of reaction is again released on expan- sion. This principle has been suggested as a method for improving the thrust of rocket engines. The increase in thrust potentially obtainable in this way is quite large. This example was chosen for its simplicity. Note in particular that if a change in the num- ber of moles accompanies the chemical reaction, then the equilibrium constant, and hence the enthalpy, are functions of the pressure. In this case, which is quite common, the variables p 752 Chapter 23 Macroscopic Balances for Multicomponent Systems and T implicit in Eq. 23.5-60 cannot be separated, and a step-by-step integration of this equa- tion is required. Such integrations have been performed, for example, for the prediction of the behavior of supersonic wind tunnels and rocket engines, but the calculations involved are too lengthy for here. 523.6 USE OF THE MACROSCOPIC BALANCES TO SOLVE UNSTEADY-STATE PROBLEMS In 523.5 the discussion was restricted to steady state. Here we move on to the transient behavior of multicomponent systems. Such behavior is important in a large number of practical operations, such as leaching and drying of solids, chromatographic separations, and chemical reactor operations. In many of these processes heats of reaction as well as mass transfer must be considered. A complete discussion of these topics is outside the scope of this text, and we restrict ourselves to several simple examples. More extensive discussions may be found elsewhere.' EXAMPLE 23.6-1 Start-up of a Chemical Reactor SOLUTION It is desired to produce a substance B from a raw material A in a chemical reactor of volume V equipped with a stirrer that is capable of keeping the entire contents of the reactor fairly ho- mogeneous. The formation of B is reversible, and the forward and reverse reactions may be considered first order, with reaction-rate constants kyB and k;;, respectively. In addition, B un- dergoes an irreversible first-order decomposition, with a reaction-rate constant kqc, to a third component C. The chemical reactions of interest may be represented as At zero time, a solution of A at a concentration cA, is introduced to the initially empty reactor at a constant mass flow rate w. Develop an expression for the amount of B in the reactor, when it is just filled to its ca- pacity V, assuming that there is no B in the feed solution and neglecting changes of fluid properties. We begin by writing the unsteady-state macroscopic mass balances for species A and B. In molar units these may be expressed as Next we eliminate MA,tot from Eq. 23.6-3. First we differentiate this equation with respect to t to get In this equation, we replace dMA,tOt/dt by the right side of Eq. 23.6-2, and then use Eq. 23.6-3 to eliminate MArtot. In this way we obtain a linear second-order differential equation for M,,,, as a function of time: ' W. R. Marshall, Jr., and R. L. Pigford, The Application of Differential Equations to Chemical Engineering Problems, University of Delaware Press, Newark, Del. (1947); B. A. Ogunnaike and W. H. Ray, Process Dynamics, Modeling, and Control, Oxford University Press (1994). s23.6 Use of the Macroscopic Balances to Solve Unsteady-State Problems 753 This equation is to be solved with the initial conditions This equation can be integrated to give where 111 111 2.+ = -(k'l:, + kli, + kyc) 2 d( kyA + kk',i, + ky;l2 - 4 ~IB~IC (23.6-9) - Equations 23.6-8 and 9 give the total mass of B in the reactor as a function of time, up to the time at which the reactor is completely filled. These expressions are very similar to the equa- tions obtained for the damped manometer in Example 7.7-2 and the temperature controller in Example 15.5-2. It can be shown, however, that s+ and s- are both real and negative, and therefore MB,tot cannot oscillate (see Problem 23B.3). EXAMPLE 23.62 Unsteady Operation of a Packed Column There are many industrially important processes in which mass transfer takes place between a fluid and a granular porous solid: for example, recovery of organic vapors by adsorption on charcoal, extraction of caffeine from coffee beans, and separation of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons by selective adsorption on silica gel. Ordinarily, the solid is held fixed, as indi- cated in Fig. 23.6-1, and the fluid is allowed to percolate through it. The operation is thus in- herently unsteady, and the solid must be periodically replaced or \"regenerated,\" that is, returned to its original condition by heating or other treatment. To illustrate the behavior of such fixed-bed mass transfer operations, we consider as a physically simple case, the removal of a solute from a solution by passage through an adsorbent bed. In this operation, a solution containing a single solute A at mole fraction x,, in a solvent B is passed at a constant volumetric flow rate w/p through a packed tower. The tower pack- ing consists of a granular solid capable of adsorbing A from the solution. At the start of the Fluid phase in: Total molar flow rate = WL Solute concentration = CAO A- T Fluid phase out: Total molar flow rate = WL Solute concentration = cA(Z, t) (a) Fig. 23.6-1. A fixed-bed absorber: (a) pictorial representation of equipment; (b) a typical effluent curve. 754 Chapter 23 Macroscopic Balances for Multicomponent Systems SOLUTION percolation, the interstices of the bed are filled with pure liquid B, and the solid is free of A. The percolating fluid displaces this solvent evenly so that the solution concentration of A is always uniform over any cross section. For simplicity, it is assumed that the equilibrium concentration of A adsorbed on the solid is proportional to the local concentration of A in the solution. It is also assumed that the concentration of A in the percolating solution is always small and that the resistance of the porous solid to intraparticle mass transport is negligible. Develop an expression for the concentration of A in the column as a function of time and of distance down the column. Paralleling the treatment of the gas absorber in Example 23.5-2, we think of the two phases as being continuous and existing side by side as pictured in Fig. 23.6-2. We again define the con- tact area per unit packed volume of column as a. Now, however, one of the phases is station- ary, and unsteady-state conditions prevail. Because of this locally unsteady behavior, the macroscopic mass balances are applied locally over a small column increment of height Az. We may use Eq. 23.1-3 and the assumption of dilute solutions to state that the molar rate of flow of solvent, WE, is essentially constant over the length of the column and the time of oper- ation. We now proceed to use Eq. 23.1-3 to write the mass conservation relations for species A in each phase for a column increment of height Az. For the solid phase in this increment of column we may apply Eq. 22.3-3 locally, keeping in mind that now MA,,,, depends on both z and t: Here use has been made of Eq. 22.1-14, and the symbols have the following meaning: E = volume fraction of column occupied by the liquid S = cross-sectional area of (empty) column c,, = moles of adsorbed A per unit volume of the solid phase x, = bulk mole fraction of A in the liquid phase xAo = interfacial mole fraction of A in the fluid phase, assumed to be in equilibrium with cA, = fluid-phase mass transfer coefficient, defined in Eq. 22.1-14, for small mass-transfer rates Fluid in at total molar rate WL 1 Fig. 23.6-2. Schematic model for a fixed-bed absorber, Fluid ou; at total showing a differential element over which a mass balance molar rate WL is made. g23.6 Use of the Macroscopic Balances to Solve Unsteady-State Problems 755 Note that, in writing Eq. 23.6-11, we have neglected convective mass transfer through the solid-fluid interface. This is reasonable if xAO is much smaller than unity. We have also as- sumed that the particles are small enough so that the concentration of the solution surround- ing any given particle is essentially constant over the particle surface. For the fluid phase, in the column increment under consideration, Eq. 23.1-3 becomes Here c is the total molar concentration of the liquid. Equation 23.6-13 may be rewritten by the introduction of a modified time variable, defined by It may be seen that, for any position in the column, t' is the time measured from the instant that the percolating solvent \"front\" has reached the position in question. By rewriting Eqs. 23.6-13 and 11 in terms of t', we get Equations 23.6-15 and 16 combine the equations of conservation of mass for each phase with the assumed mass transfer rate expression. These two equations are to be solved simultane- ously along with the interphase equilibrium distribution, xAO = mcAsl in which m is a constant. The boundary conditions are B.C. 1: at t' = 0, B.C. 2: at z = 0, cAs = 0 for all z > 0 xA = XA, for all t' > 0 Before solving these equations, it is convenient to rewrite them in terms of the following di- mensionless variables: In terms of these variables, the differential equations and boundary conditions take the form with the boundary conditions Y(f; 0) = 0 and X(0, r) = 1. The solution2 to Eqs. 23.6-23 and 24 for these boundary conditions is Here JO(ix) is a zero-order Bessel function of the first kind. This solution is presented graphi- cally in several available reference^.^ ' This result was first obtained by A. Anzelius, Z. angew. Math. u. Mech., 6,291-294 (1926), for the analogous problem in heat transfer. One method of obtaining this result is outlined in Problem 23D.1. See also H. Bateman, Partial Differential Equations of Mathematical Physics, Dover, New York (19441, pp. 123-125. See, for example, 0. A. Hougen and K. M.

Their y/yo, b~, and aZ correspond to our X, 7, and l. 756 Chapter 23 Macroscopic Balances for Multicomponent Systems For many complex systems, complete descriptions are either infeasible or unnecessary, and it is sufficient to obtain only a few basic characteristics. Specifically, we may ask how one may The of Low- determine the system volume V and the volume flow rate Q through it from observations of Order Moments short tracer pulses of mass m introduced at the inlet and then measured at the outlet. Con- sider for this purpose the macroscopically steady flow through a closed system of arbitrary geometry, but with a single inlet and outlet, such as that suggested in Fig. 7.0-1, except that there are no moving surfaces. The flow and diffusional behavior are arbitrary, except that the tracer distribution must be described by the diffusion equation (Eq. 19.1-7 with Eq. 17.7-3 in- serted for the mass flux) in which p, is the local tracer concentration and 9Ts is the pseudobinary diffusivity for the tracer moving through the solution that fills the system. Turbulent systems may be included by using time-smoothed quantities and an effective turbulent diffusivity. In developing the macroscopic balances we shall need to use the condition that there is no flow or diffusion through the walls of the enclosure (n . v) = 0 and (n VpT) = 0 (23.6-27,281 and that the diffusive flux of the tracer is small compared to the convective flux at the inlet and outlet to the system Here n is the outwardly directed unit normal vector. We take the inlet tracer concentration to be zero up to t = 0 and also after some finite time t = t,. In practice the concentration pulse duration should be quite short. SOLUTION The analysis4 is based on the moments I\"') of the tracer concentration with respect to time, de- fined by: We now multiply Eq. 23.6-26 by t\" and integrate with respect to time over the range of nonzero exit tracer concentration When the first term is integrated by parts and we make use of the notation introduced in Eq. 23.6-30, we get for all systems that give finite moments. We now have a hierarchy of equations for the I'\"' in terms of the lower-order moments, and the structure of these equations is very convenient. In physical terms, it was first noted by Spalding5 that Eq. 23.6-32 has the same form as the diffusion equation with chemical reaction, Eq. 19.1-16, but with the concentration replaced by I(\") and the reaction term replaced by nI'\"-~\". Hence we can integrate these equations over the entire volume of the flow system and thereby develop a new set of macroscopic balances. E. N. Lightfoot, A. M. Lenhoff, and R. I. Rodrigues, Chem. Eng. Sci., 36,954-956 (1982). D. B. Spalding, Chem. Eng. Sci., 9,74-77 (1958). 523.6 Use of the Macroscopic Balances to Solve Unsteady-State Problems 757 We begin by integrating Eq. 23.6-33, for n = 0, over the entire volume of the flow system between planes 1 and 2: The volume integrals may be converted into surface integrals by using the Gauss divergence theorem to get where S = Sf + S, + SZ. The integral over the fixed surface Sf is zero according to Eq. 23.6-27 and 28, and the integrals over the inlet and outlet planes S, and S2 can be simplified, so that we get Here we have made use of Eq. 23.6-29 to drop the diffusive terms at planes 1 and 2. If we as- sume that to' is constant over a cross section, we may remove it from the integral, and then we get For an incompressible fluid, the volume rate of flow, Q, is constant, so that (u,)S, = (v&, and That is, I\"' evaluated at plane 1 is the same as Po' at plane 2, and at every point in the system. It is standard notation to abbreviate this quantity as Mo, the zeroth (absolute) moment. Equa- tion 23.6-38 is analogous to Eq. 23.1-2 for a steady-state system with no mass transport across the walls. Next we evaluate 4\" for the introduction of a mass m of tracer over a time interval that is very small with respect to the mean tracer residence time t,,, = V/Q: The replacement, in the second step, of the upper limit by Q/V is permitted by the finite du- ration of the tracer pulse. From the last two equations we then get This provides the possibility of measuring blood flow rate from the mass of an injected tracer and the value of Go' = M,. The latter can be obtained by means of a catheter inserted into the blood vessel or by NMR techniques. This simple formula6 was first introduced in 1829 and has been extensively used since 1897 for measurement of blood-flow rates,7 including cardiac output.' It is also widely used for many environmental systems, such as rivers, and also for systems in the process industries. Next we turn to Eq. 23.6-32, and integrate it over the volume of the flow system, once again making use of the fact that the diffusive tern over the inlet and outlet is much smaller than the convective term.

It has since found many other environmental and process-industry calculations. Higher moments have also proven useful, in particular the central moments These are commonly applied for the special case of an impulsive tracer input. Then the nor- malized second central moment, or variance, is This is the square of the standard deviation, when the exit tracer profile is a Gaussian distrib- ution. The third central moment is a measure of the asymmetry about ire,, and the fourth a measure of the kurtosis. In practice, the fourth moment is nearly impossible to determine ac- curately from experimental data, and obtaining even the third proves to be quite difficult. Use of the second moment has found some very important applications in studying tracer dynamics of biological tissue? and again the large literature in the medical field has been extended to many other applications. It is also interesting to note the additivity relation- ships in serially connected systems. Thus Mo is invariant to the number of included subsys- tems, and M,, p2, and p3 are additive, but higher-order moments are not. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1.

The gas stream enters the bottom of the tower at a volumetric rate of 363 ft3/min, at 30°C, and at 1.05 atm pressure. It contains 1% cyclohexane by volume. The oil enters the top of the tower at a rate of 20 lb-mol/hr, also at 30°C, and it contains 0.3% cyclohexane on a molar basis.

Irreversible first-order reaction in a continuous reactor. A well-stirred reactor of volume V is initially completely filled with a solution of solute A in a solvent S at concentration cAo.

Express your re- sults as fractions of the feed rate, and start from the bottom of the cascade. Use 12 stages as the closest integer providing the desired separation. It is suggested that you begin by calculat- ing the upflowing and downflowing stream compositions and then use the mass balances below the feed plate and the corresponding balances above it.

It is desired to purify a binary protein mixture using an ideal cascade of individual ultrafiltration stages of the type shown in the figure. The larger of the two membrane units is the source of separation and each protein flux across the mem- brane is expressed by where Ni is the transmembrane protein flux of species i, ci is its concentration in the upstream solution (assumed to be well mixed), v is the transmembrane superficial velocity, and Si is a protein-specific sieving factor.

Analogy between the unsteady operation of an adsorption column and a cross-flow heat exchanger1 (Fig. 23C.4). In the heat exchanger shown in the figure, the two fluid streams flow at right angles to one another, and the heat flux parallel to the wall is neglected. Here ex- change of heat is clearly less than for a countercurrent exchanger of the same surface and overall heat transfer coefficient under otherwise identical conditions. The heat flow in these exchangers may be expressed for constant Ul,, as Here Q is the total rate of heat transfer, A is the heat transfer surface area, and ATl, is the loga- rithmic mean of (T,ll - T,,) and (T,, - Tcl), as defined in the figure. Note that Th2 and T,, are the flow-averaged temperatures of the two exit streams. We may then regard Y as the ratio of heat transferred in cross flow to that which would be transferred in counterflow.

In Chapter 8 we gave Fourier's law, which says that molecular heat transport occurs because of a gradient in temperature. How- ever, when we discussed mixtures in Chapter 19, we pointed out an extra contribution to the molecular heat flux that accounts for the amount of enthalpy transported by the in- terdiffusion of the various species. In Chapter 17 we gave Fick's (first) law of diffusion, which says that molecular mass transport occurs as the result of a concentration gradi- ent. We indicated there that other driving forces may contribute to the mass flux. The purposes of this chapter are to describe the most important of these additional driving forces and to illustrate some applications. Important among these forces are the gradients of electrical potential and pressure, which govern the behavior of ionic systems and permselective membranes as well as ul- tracentrifuges. Electrokinetic phenomena in particular are rapidly gaining in importance. Induced dipoles can produce separations, such as dielectrophoresis and magnetophoresis, which are useful in specialized applications. In addition, we shall find that temperature gradients can cause mass fluxes by a process known as thermal diffusion1 or the Soret ef- fect, and that concentration gradients can produce heat transfer by the diffusion-therrn~,~ or the Dufour, effect. Finally, it is important to realize that in systems containing three or more components, the behavior of any one species is influenced by the concentration gradients of all other species present. Fortunately the wide range of behavior resulting from these various driving forces can be described compactly via the framework provided by nonequilibrium thermody- ' The effect was first observed in liquids by C.

In the remaining sections we show how various specializations of these equations can be used to provide convenient descriptions of se- lected diffusional processes. Those who do not wish to read the first two sections can go directly to the later sec- tions, where the essential results of nonequilibrium thermodynamics are summarized. 524.1 THE EQUATION OF CHANGE FOR ENTROPY Nonequilibrium thermodynamics makes use of four postulates above and beyond those of equilibrium thermodynamics:' The equilibrium thermodynamic relations apply to systems that are not in equi- librium, provided that the gradients are not too large (quasi-equilibrium postulate). All fluxes in the system may be written as linear relations involving all the forces (linearity postulate). No coupling of fluxes and forces occurs if the difference in tensorial order of the flux and force is an odd number (Curie's postulate).' In the absence of magnetic fields the matrix of the coefficients in the flux-force re- lations is symmetric (Onsager's reciprocal relationsh3 In this and the following section we will use these postulates, which arose from a need to describe various observed phenomena and also from kinetic theory developments. Note that the nonequilibrium theory we are using excludes consideration of non-Newtonian fluid^.^ In Problem 11D.1 we saw how to derive Jaumann's entropy balance equation, in which s is the entropy per unit mass of a multicomponent fluid, s is the entropy-flux vector, and g, is the rate of entropy production per unit volume. At this point we do not know what s and g, are, and hence our first task is to find expressions for these quantities The discussion here is for multicomponent systems.

Nobel laureate Lars Onsager (1903-1976) studied chemical engineering at the Technical University of Trondheim; after working with Peter Debye in Ziirich for two years, he held teaching positions at several universities before moving on to Yale University. His contributions to the thermodynamics of irreversible processes are to be found in L. Onsager, Pkys. Rev., 37,405426 (1931); 38,2265-2279 (1931).

To do this we have to use the assumption that the equations of equilibrium thermodynamics are valid locally (the \"quasi-equilibrium postulate\"), which means that equations such as can be used in a system that is not too far from equilibrium. In this equation & is the partial molar Gibbs free energy and M, the molecular weight of species a. We now apply this relation to a fluid element moving with the mass average velocity v. Then we can replace the differential operators by substantial derivative operators. In that form, Eq. 24.1-2 enables us to express DS/D~ in terms of DU/D~, D(l/p)/DL, and Dw,/Dt. Then the equation of change for internal energy [Eq. (D) of Table 19.2-41, the overall equation of continuity [Eq. (A) of Table 19.2-31, and the equation of continuity for species a [Eq. (B) of Table 19.2-31 can be used for the three substantial derivatives that have been introduced. Thus, after considerable rearranging, we find The entropy production has been written as a sum of products of fluxes and forces. However, there are only N - 1 independent mass fluxes j,, and, because of the Gibbs- Duhem equation, there are also only N - 1 independent forces. When we take into ac- count this lack of independencef5 we may rewrite the entropy flux and the entropy production in the following form: N ~g~ = - (@) . Vln T)- 2 j, -- a=l ( '::dm) -(T:vv)- in which q(h) is the heat flux with the diffusional enthalpy flux subtracted off, and The second form in Eq. 24.1-8 is obtained5 by using the relation d< = RTd In a,, where a, is the activity. In the operation V In a,, the derivative is to be taken at constant T and p, and the quantity 4, = c,K is the volume fraction of species a. The d, introduced here are called diffusional driving forces, and they account for the concentration diffusion (term For the intermediate steps, see C. F. Curtiss and R. B. Bird, Ind. Eng. Chem. Research, 38,2515-2522 (19991, errata 40,1791 (2001). s24.2 The Flux Expressions for Heat and Mass 767 with V In a,), pressure diffusion (term with Vp), and forced diffusion (term with g). The d, are so defined that Z,d, = 0. The entropy production in Eq. 24.1-6, which is a sum of products of fluxes and forces, is the starting point for the nonequilibrium thermodynamics development. Ac- cording to the \"linearity postulate\" each of the fluxes in Eq. 24.1-6 (q'\"', j,, 7, and - G,/M,) can be written as a linear function of all the forces (VT, d,, Vv, and r,). How- ever, because of \"Curie's postulate,\" each of the j, must depend linearly on all of the d, as well as on VT, and q(h) must depend linearly on VT as well as on all the d,, but neither j, nor q(h) can depend on Vv or r,. Similarly the stress tensor .r will depend on the tensor Vv, and also on the scalar driving forces r, multiplied by the unit tensor. Since the \"coupling\" between .r and the chemical reactions has not been studied, we omit any further consideration of it. In the next section we discuss the coupling among all the vector forces and vector fluxes and the consequences of applying the \"Onsager reciprocal relations.\" 524.2 THE FLUX EXPRESSIONS FOR HEAT AND MASS We now employ the \"linearity postulate\" to obtain for the vector fluxes In these equations the quantities a,,,, a,,, a,,, and asp are the \"phenomenological coeffi- cients\" (that is, the transport properties). Because the j, and d, are not all independent, it must be required that a,, + 2,a,, = 0, where the sums are over all y (except y = P) from 1 to N. Now according to the Onsager reciprocal relations, a,, = a,, and nap = a,, for all values of cr and /3 from 1 to N. Next we relate the phenomenological coefficients to the transport coefficients. First we relabel a,, and ao, as D:, the multicomponent thermal diffusion coefficients. These have the property that 2,~: = 0. Then we define the multicomponent Fick difisivities,' ID,,, by D,, = -cRTaap/papp. These diffusivities are symmetric (Elap = D,,) and obey the rela- tions C,U,D,~ = 0. Then Eq. 24.2-2 becomes , for the multicomponent mass fluxes. These are the generalized Fick equations. When the second form of Eq. 24.1-8 is substituted into Eq. 24.2-3 we see that there are four contri- butions to the mass-flux vector j,: the concentration diffusion term (containing the activ- ity gradient), the pressure diffusion term (containing the pressure gradient), the forced diffusion term (containing the external forces), and the thermal diffusion term (propor- tional to the temperature gradient).

Curtiss, and R. B. Bird, Molecular Theo y of Gases and Liquids, Wiley, New York (1954), second corrected printing (1964, Chapter 11. 768 Chapter 24 Other Mechanisms for Mass Transport Equation 24.2-3 can be turned \"wrong-side out\"',' and solved for the driving forces d,: These are the generalized Maxwell-Stefan equations, a special case of which was given in Eq. 17.9-1. The Bop are called the mulficomponent Maxwell-Stefan diffusivities, and they have been proven to be ~ymrnetric;~ their relation to the Dap will be discussed presently. When the expression for d, in Eq. 24.2-4 is substituted into Eq. 24.2-1, we get The thermal conductivity of a mixture is defined to be the coefficient of proportionality between the heat-flux vector and the temperature gradient when there are no mass fluxes in the system. Thus, the quantity in brackets is, by general agreement, the thermal conductivity k times the absolute temperature T. If we combine this result with the defin- ition in Eq. 24.1-7, w get for the final expression for the heat flux:3 We see that the heat flux vector q consists of three terms: the heat conduction term (con- taining the thermal conductivity), the heat diffusion term (containing the partial molar enthalpies and the mass fluxes), and finally the Dufour term (containing the thermal dif- fusion coefficients and the mass fluxes). The heat diffusion term, already encountered in Eq. 19.3-3, is generally important in diffusing systems. The Dufour term is usually small and can usually be neglected. Equations 24.2-3,4, and 6 are the principal results of nonequilibrium thermodynam- ics. We now have the mass- and heat-flux vectors expressed in terms of the transport properties and the fluxes. Next we discuss the relation between the matrix of Fick diffusivities Dep and that of the Maxwell-Stefan diffusivities Bag. Both matrices are symmetric and of order N X N, and both have ~N(N - 1) independent elements. The Bap are obtained thus:3 in which (Ba)pY = - DPy + Day-that is, the p y-component of a matrix called B,, which is of order (N - 1) x (N - 1)-and adj B, is the matrix adjoint to B,.

However, in Eq. 24.2-9, there are N(N + 1)/2 symmetric diffusivities, but the B,, (N of them) now appear, and therefore we have to supply an auxiliary relation Z,(x,/Bffp) = 0, in which the sum is over all a. Equation 24.2-9, with the auxiliary relation, is equivalent to Eq. 24.2-8, and both of these generalized Maxwell-Stefan equations are equivalent to the generalized Fick equations of Eq. 24.2-3, together with its auxiliary relation. For multicomponent diffusion in gases at low density, the activity may be replaced by the mole fraction, and furthermore, to a very good approximation, the Bop may be replaced by 5?hap. These are the binary diffusivities for all pairs of species in the mixture. Since the Bffp vary only slightly with concentration, whereas the DUp are highly concentration- dependent, it is preferable to use the Maxwell-Stefan form (Eq. 24.2-4) rather than the Fick form (Eq. 24.2-3). For binary diffusion in gases or liquids, Eq. (C) of Table 24.2-1 and Eq. 17B.3-1 may be used to simplify Eq. 24.2-8 as follows: In this equation we have introduced the thermal difusion ratio, defined by k, = - = + (Di/&B)(~A~B/~A~B). Other quantities encountered are the thermal diffusion factor a, and the Soret coefficient a,, defined by k, = cu, x,x, = a, xAxBT. For gases a, is almost inde- pendent of composition, and a, is the quantity preferred for liquids. When k, is positive, species A moves toward the colder region, and when it is negative, species A moves toward the warmer region. Some sample values of k, for gases and liquids are given in Table 24.2-3. For binary mixtures of dilute gases, it is found by experiment that the species with the larger molecular weight usually goes to the colder region. If the molecular weights are about equal, then usually the species with the larger diameter moves to the colder re- gion. In some instances there is a change in the sign of the thermal diffusion ratio as the temperature is lowered.\" In the remainder of the chapter, we explore some of the consequences of the mass- flux expressions in Eqs. 24.2-8,9, and 10. EXAMPLE 24.2-1 Thermal Diffusion and the Clusius-Dickel - - In this example we discuss the diffusion of species under the influence of a temperature gra- dient. To illustrate the phenomenon we consider the system shown in Fig. 24.2-1, two bulbs joined together by an insulated tube of small diameter and filled with a mixture of ideal gases A and B. The bulbs are maintained at constant temperatures TI and T,, respectively, and the Column diameter of the insulated tube is small enough to eliminate convection currents substantially. Ultimately the system arrives at a steady state, with gas A enriched at one end of the tube and depleted at the other. Obtain an expression for xA2 - x,,, the difference of the mole fractions at the two ends of the tube. %. Chapman and T. G.

After steady state has been achieved, there is no net motion of either A or B, so that Jz = 0. If we take the tube axis to be in the z direction, then from Eq. 24.2-10 we get Here the activity aA has been replaced by the mole fraction xA, as is appropriate for an ideal gas mixture. Usually the degree of separation in an apparatus of this kind is small. We may therefore ignore the effect of composition on kT and integrate this equation to get This bulb maintained This bulb maintained at temperature TI at temperature T2 7 Fig. 24.2-1. Steady-state binary thermal diffu- sion in a two-bulb apparatus. The mixture of gases A and B tends to separate under the in- fluence of the thermal gradient. 772 Chapter 24 Other Mechanisms for Mass Transport Because the dependence of k, on T is rather complicated, it is customary to assume k, constant at the value for some mean temperature T,. Equation 24.2-12 then gives (approximately) The recommended5 mean temperature is Equations 23.2-13 and 14 are useful for estimating the order of magnitude of thermal diffu- sion effects. Unless the temperature gradient is very large, the separation will normally be quite small. Therefore it has been advantageous to combine the thermal diffusion effect with free convection between two vertical walls, one heated and the other cooled. The heated stream then ascends, and the cooled one descends. The upward stream will be richer in one of the components-say, A-and the downward stream will be richer in B. This is the principle of the operation of the Clusius-Dickel c~lurnn.~~ By coupling many of these columns together in a \"cascade\" it is possible to perform a separation. During World War I1 this was one of the methods used for separating the uranium isotopes by using uranium hexafluoride gas. The method has also been used with some success in the separation of organic mixtures, where the components have very nearly the same boiling points, so that distillation is not an option. The thermal diffusion ratio can also be obtained from the Dufour (diffusion-thermo) ef- fect, but the analysis of the experiment is fraught with problems and experimental errors dif- ficult to avoid.9 Next we examine diffusion in the presence of a pressure gradient. If a sufficiently large pres- sure gradient can be established, then a measurable separation can be effected. One example Pressure Diffusion and of this is the ultracentrifuge, which has been used to separate enzymes and proteins.

Determine the distribution of the two components at steady state in terms of their partial molar volumes and the pressure gradient. The latter is obtained from the equation of motion as For simplicity, we assume that the partial molar volumes and the activity coefficients are con- stant over the range of conditions existing in the cell. At steady state j, = 0, and the relevant terms in Eq. 24.2-10 give for species A Inserting the appropriate expression for the pressure gradient and then multiplying by (V5/xA)dz, we get for species A Then we write a similar equation for species B, which is Subtracting Eq. 24.2-18 from Eq. 24.2-17 we get We now integrate this equation from z = 0 to some arbitrary value of z, taking account of the fact that the mole fractions of A and B at z = 0 are XAO and xBU, respectively. This gives If g, is treated as constant over the range of integration, then we get Then we take the exponential of both sides to find This describes the steady-state concentration distribution for a binary system in a constant centrifugal force field. Note that, since this result contains no transport coefficients at all, the same result can be obtained by an equilibrium thermodynamics analysis.\" However, if one wishes to analyze the time-dependent behavior of a centrifugation, then the diffusivity for the mixing A-B will appear in the result, and the problem cannot be solved by equilibrium thermodynamics. lo E.

On the other hand, in Eq. 24.2-10 it appears that the thermodynamics of irreversible processes dictates using the activity gradient as the driving force for concentration diffu- sion. In this section we show that either the activity gradient or the mass (or mole) frac- tion gradient driving force may be used, but that each choice requires a different diffusivity. These two diffusivities are related, and we illustrate this for a binary mixture. When we drop the pressure-, thermal-, and forced-diffusion terms from Eq. 24.2-10, we get This may be rewritten by making use of the fact that the activity coefficient is a function of xA to obtain dln UA J; = -cgAB(-) d In XA T,P vxA The activity may be written as the product of the activity coefficient and the mole frac- tion (a, = yAxA) SO that If the mixture is \"ideal,\" then the activity coefficient is equal to unity, Eq. 24.3-3 becomes the same as Eq. (B) of Table 17.8-2, and BA, = 9,,. If the mixture is \"nonideal,\" one can express the binary diffusivity 9AB as then Eq. 24.3-2 and 3 become which is one of the forms of Fick's law (see Eq. (B) of Table 17.8-2). In order to measure B,,, one has to have measurements of the activity as a function of concentration, and for this reason BAB has not been popular. a: Toluene (A) - Benzene (B) cn b: Toluene (A) - Carbon tetrachloride (B) Y . + G c: Decane (A) - Hexadecane (B) 1 rn 0.0 1 I I I I I I I I I 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 .O Mole fraction xA Fig. 24.3-1.

There is no compelling reason to prefer one diffusivity over the other. Most of the diffusivities reported in the literature are and not BAB. 924.4 APPLICATIONS OF THE GENERALIZED MAXWELL-STEFAN EQUATIONS The generalized Maxwell-Stefan equations were given in Eq. 24.2-4 in terms of the diffu- sional driving forces d,, and the expression for d, was given in Eq. 24.1-8. When these are combined we get the Maxwell-Stefan equations in terms of the activity gradient, the pressure gradient, and the external forces acting on the various species, given (Eqs. 24.2- 8 or 9): X,Xfi - d, = - (v, - vp) + thermal diffusion terms n=1 goo The thermal diffusion terms have not been displayed here, since they will not be needed in this section. The symbols m,, = cNl/, and w, designate, respectively, the volume frac- tion and mass fraction of species a. As explained in SS24.1 and 2, several auxiliary rela- tions have to be kept in mind: The first of these relations follows from the definition of the d,, the second is a conse- quence of the Onsager reciprocal relations, and the third is needed because of the intro- duction of an especially designated species y. The choice as to which species is designated as y is arbitrary; often setting y equal to a is convenient. The choice depends 776 Chapter 24 Other Mechanisms for Mass Transport on the nature of the system under study, and this point will be illustrated in the exam- ples that follow. In all previous chapters, the only external force that has been considered has been the gravitational force. In this section we set the external force per unit mass g, equal to a sum of forces Here g is the gravitational acceleration, z, is the elementary charge on species a (for ex- ample, -1 for the chloride ion C1-), F = 96485 abs.-coulombs/g-equivalent is the Fara- day constant, 4 is the electrostatic potential, and the subscript m on the Kronecker delta S,, refers to any mechanically restrained matrix, such as a permselective membrane. In sum, for solving multicomponent diffusion problems in isothermal systems, we now have N mass-flux equations (of which only N - 1 are independent), the species equations of continuity, and the equation of motion. This set of equations has proven to be useful for solving wide classes of mass transfer problems, and we discuss some of these in the following examples. Of course, in order to solve multicomponent diffusion problems one needs the Maxwell-Stefan diffusivities Bmp that occur in Eq. 24.4-1. Very few measurements have been made of these quantities, which require the simultaneous measurement of the ac- tivity as a function of concentration. Among the few examples of such measurements are those made by ~utten.' EXAMPLE 24.4-1 Centrifugation of Proteins Protein molecules are large enough that they can be concentrated by centrifugation against the dispersive tendencies of Brownian motion, and this process has proven useful for molecu- lar weight determination as well as for small-scale preparative separations. Show how the be- havior of protein molecules in a centrifugal field can be predicted, and the kind of information that can be obtained from their behavior in a centrifuge tube (see Fig. 24.4-1). As we shall see in Example 24.4-3, we may treat the protein and its attendant counter-ions as a single large electrically neutral molecule. Choose the protein as species y and begin with the mass-flux equation for it. The small ionic species needed for protein stability play no signifi- cant role in this development and can be ignored. SOLUTION We consider here a pseudobinary system of a single globular protein P in a solvent W, which is primarily water, and initially we restrict the discussion to a dilute solution rotating in a tube perpendicular to the axis of rotation (Fig. 24.,4-la) at a constant angular velocity R. For such a system x, = 1 and the solute flow field with respect to stationary axes will be that of rigid-body rotation-namely, v, = 6,Ru. f Initial protein band 2 4- 2 y.. 0 .II 2 Fig. 24.4-1. Ultracentrifugation of proteins, with two possi- I ble orientations of the centrifuge tube. Ph. W. M. Rutten, Diffusion in Liquids, Delft University Press, Delft, The Netherlands (1992). 524.4 Applications of the Generalized Maxwell-Stefan Equations 777 Then the radial diffusion of the protein is described by the r-component of the simplified Maxwell-Stefan equation We see immediately that the protein will move in the positive radial direction if its mass frac- tion is greater than its volume fraction-that is, if it is denser than the solvent. If Eq. 24.4-6 is multiplied through by cB,,, we get in which the usual pseudobinary Fickian diffusivity 9,+,, is introduced. The diffusivity in Eq. 24.4-7 can be estimated from Eq. 17.4-3 as in which Rp is the radius of a sphere having the volume of the protein molecule, ,uw is the sol- vent (water) viscosity, and fp is a hydrodynamic shape factor (that is, a correction factor to ac- count for the nonsphericity of the protein molecule). From the equation of motion for the solution, we get the pressure gradient in terms of the angular velocity of the ultracentrifuge, thus The term pf12r will not vary significantly over the length of the centrifugation tube, which is small compared with the radius of the ultracentrifuge rotor. Now we want to get an appreciation of the molecular weight dependence of the pressure- gradient term in Eq. 24.4-7. To do that we introduce the following approximations, valid in the dilute solution limit, common in protein processing: Here kp = V,/M~ is the partial specific volume of the protein. The p?rtial specific volume of the solvent may be taken as 1 ml/g without significant error, and V, for globular proteins is usually in the neighborhood of 0.75 ml/g. We see then that the decisive factor in permit- ting effective centrifugation is the ratio of molecular weights rather than the specific vol- umes, as the latter are not greatly different for the two species. When Eqs. 24.4-7,8,10, and 11 are combined, the protein flux takes the form which somewhat resembles Fick's first law. Here, the \"migration velocity\" for the protein is Note that the radial molar flux of water greatly exceeds that of protein, and that the convec- tive protein flux cpv,,,,,, is very small. 778 Chapter 24 Other Mechanisms for Mass Transport Next we substitute the molar flux of Eq. 24.4-11 into the species equation of continuity or, for constant 9,, which is the equation we want to solve for several specific situations. (a) Transient Behavior. We first consider migration of a thin protein band under conditions where fractional changes in r are small and no significant amount of protein reaches the far end of the tube. Then we can introduce a new independent variable u = r - v,,,t that enables us to transform cp(r, t) into cp(u, t). The diffusion equation becomes along with the initial condition where C is a constant that tells how much protein is contained in the band, and the boundary conditions Equation 24.4-17 is a long-tube approximation widely used in this application. Equations 24.4-15 to 17 describe a Gaussian distribution of the protein about its center of mass, resulting from diffusion and moving with the velocity vmig,. The migration velocity can be measured, and this measurement yields a product of protein diffusivity and molecu- lar weight. The broadness of the band in turn provides an independent measure of the dif- fusivity, and thus, combined with knowledge of the migration velocity and specific volumes, the molecular weight.2 If the molecular weight is known, for example, from mass spectrometry, the shape factor f, can be determined. This, in turn, is a useful measure of protein shape. (b) Steady Polarization. We next consider long-time behavior when the protein has been concentrated at the end of the tube and has attained a steady state. Under these circum- stances, there is no radial motion and Eqs. 24.4-6,9, and 10 give The concentration gradient may be measured, and all other quantities except for Mp may be determined independently of the centrifugation process. Protein activity coefficients may, for example, be obtained from osmotic pressure data. Therefore the molecular weight of the pro- tein may be unambiguously determined. Only mass spectrometry can provide better accu- racy, and it is not suitable for all proteins. (c) Preparative Operation. The speed of centrifugal separation can be greatly increased by tilting the tube as in Fig. 24.4-1b. Here the protein is forced toward the outer boundary of the tube by centrifugal action, and the resulting density gradient causes an axial bulk R. J. Silbey and R. A. Alberty, Physical Chemisty, 3rd edition, Wiley, New York (2001), p. 801. 924.4 Applications of the Generalized Maxwell-Stefan Equations 779 transport by free convection, a process similar to that used for larger particles in disk centrifuge^.^ Show that the results of the last example are equivalent to treating the proteins as small hy- drodynamic particles. Proteins as Hydrodynamic SOLUTION Particles If, in the previous example, we had not used the simplifications in Eqs. 24.4-9 and 10, we would have obtained for the migration velocity in steady-state operation If now we restrict ourselves to dilute solutions so that the activity coefficient is very close to unity, we can set Bp,, to 9,, and use Eq. 24.4-8 for the diffusivity and Eq. 24.4-9 for the pres- sure gradient. Then the migration velocity becomes Next we recognize that L12r = gey (an effective body force per unit mass resulting from the centrifugal field) and that K/ R = N (Avogadro's number), and we get where we have used the approximation w, = pp/(pp + pw) = pp/pw for a dilute protein_solu- tion. Next we set kp = ($TR$?, the volume per mole of protein, and pp/cP = ($.rr~;)(p(~))N, the mass per mole of protein; here p'P' is the pure protein density. When these quantities are in- serted into Eq. 24.4-21 we get Comparison with Eq. 2.6-17 shows that the migration velocity for a nonspherical protein in a centrifugal field is the same as the terminal velocity for a sphere in a corresponding gravita- tionaI field (divided by the factor fp to account for deviation from sphericity). One may also start with an equation of motion for a particle P initially at rest in a suspen- sion sufficiently dilute that particle-particle interactions are negligible. Then the particle ve- locity relative to a large body of quiescent fluid F is Here n, is the number concentration of particles, V, and R, are the particle volume and ra- dius, and the subscript m refers to the conditions \"far\" from the particle (that is, outside the hydrodynamic boundary layer). Equation 24.4-23 is the equation of motion with an added term for Brownian motion, which is important, for example, in aerosol c~llection.~ The sym- bol F,, stands for the electromagnetic force per particle. See, for example, Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, McGraw-Hill, New York, 7th edition (1997), p. 18-113. See L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, Fluid Mechanics, Pergamon Press, Oxford (1987), pp. 90-91, Problem 7. 780 Chapter 24 Other Mechanisms for Mass Transport EXAMPLE 24.4-3 Diffusion of Salts in an Aqueous Solution SOLUTION The diffusivity 9,, in this example corresponds to 9,, of Example 24.4-1, and it may be seen that there is a very close analogy between the molecular and particulate descriptions. There are, in fact, only three significant differences: 1. The thermodynamic activity coefficient is considered to be unity for the particle. 2. The instantaneous acceleration of the molecule is neglected. 3. The effects of past history (that is, the Basset force given by the integral in Eq. 24.4-23) are neglected for the molecule. In practice, activity coefficients tend to approach unity in dilute solutions, and the Basset forces tend to be small even for large particles. However, the instantaneous effects of accelera- tion can be appreciable for particles greater than about one micron in diameter. Consider now for simplicity a 1-1 electrolyte M'X-, such as sodium chloride, diffusing in a system such as that shown in Fig. 24.4-2. Here well-mixed reservoirs at two different salt concentrations are joined by a constriction in which diffusional transfer between the two reservoirs takes place. The potentiometer shown in the figure measures the potential dif- ference A+ between the electrodes, without drawing any current from the system. Show how the generalized Maxwell-Stefan equations can be used to describe the diffusional behavior. The salt (S) is considered to be fully dissociated, so that the system is being regarded as ternary, with Mi, Xp, and water as the three species. We neglect the pressure diffusion term: the reference pressure cRT in Eq. 24.4-1 is approximately 1350 atmospheres under normal am- bient conditions, and the pressure differences occurring in systems such as that pictured are of negligible importance. The assumption of electroneutrality and no current flow provide the following constraints: XM- = xx = xS = 1 xw (24.4-24) NM+ = Nx = Ns (24.4-25) Here the mole fractions of the cation M ' and the anion X are equal to that of the salt S.

The symbol G denotes (arbitrary geometry and flow conditions) a galvanometer. g24.4 Applications of the Generalized Maxwell-Stefan Equations 781 We may then select species y in Eq. 24.4-1 to be species a, and use Eqs. 24.4-5 and 24 to obtain for the cation and the anion Next we use the expression for g, in Eq. 24.4-5, as well as Eqs. 24.4-24 and 25, to get: Note that the ion-ion diffusivity does not appear, because there is no velocity difference be- tween the two ions when there is no current. The electrostatic potential 4 may be eliminated between these two equations by adding them together. The resulting flux expression may be put into the form of Fick's law by introducing the definition of the concentration-based diffusivity and, since as = aM+ax = and y2 = G, which is the mean ionic activity coefficient. The ion-water diffusivities may in turn be estimated from limiting equivalent conduc- tances in the form A,, = lim z,B, wF2 x,-o RT As a practical matter, diffusivities vary much less with concentration than do conductances, and salt diffusivities can be estimated with fair accuracy up to about IN concentrations from limiting conductances. A basic reason for this is that ion-ion diffusional interactions, which always occur when a current flows, become appreciable at even modest salt concentrations (see Problem 24C.3). Eq. 24.4-32 shows that the slower ion tends to dominate in determining the salt diffusiv- ity, and this fact is the justification for treating the protein as a large neutral molecule in Ex- ample 24.4-1. Soluble proteins are nearly always charged, but they and their attendant counter-ions behave like a neutral salt, and its diffusivity is dominated by the protein moiety, which in turn acts very much like a hydrodynamic particle. In a concentration gradient, the faster of the two ions tends to get ahead of the slower. However, this results in the formation of a potential gradient tending to speed the slower ion and slow the faster one. It can be shown (see Problem 24B.2) that this so-called junction poten- tial is described by However, these potentials cannot be measured directly, as the electrodes needed to complete 782 Chapter 24 Other Mechanisms for Mass Transport However, these potentials cannot be measured directly, as the electrodes needed to complete the electric circuit affect the measurement (see Problem 24C.3). One can obtain an approxi- mate value through the use of potassium chloride salt bridge^.^ This elementary example is only a very bare introduction to a complex and impor- tant subject. The interested reader is referred to the large literature on electr~chemistry.~ EXAMPLE 24.4-4 Departures from Local ElectroneutraZity: ~lectro-Osmosis6 It is already clear from the preceding discussion of diffusion potential that local departures from electroneutrality do exist in diffusing electrolytes, and they are not always negligible. To examine this situation, consider a long tube of circular cross section containing an electrolyte, at least one component of which is adsorbed on the tube wall. This adsorption results in a fixed surface charge and a region of net charge, the diffuse double layer, in the solution adjacent to the tube wall. This net charge will produce an electric field within the tube that varies with radial, but not axial, position. If a potential difference is applied across the ends of the tube, the result will be a fluid flow, known as electro-osmosis. Conversely, if a hydrodynamic pres- sure is used to produce a flow, it will result in a potential difference, known as a streaming po- tential, developing across the ends of the tube. These phenomena are representative of a class known as electrokinetic phenomena. Develop an expression for the electro-osmotic flow de- veloped in the absence of an axial pressure gradient. SOLUTION Our first problem is now to develop an expression for the electrostatic potential distribution, after which we can calculate the electro-osmotic flow. The starting point for the electrostatic potential calculation is the Poisson equation Here p, is the electrical charge density and E is the dielectric permittivity of the solution. For the problem at hand, Eq. 24.4-36 re- duces to Now, following Newman6 we assume that the concentration of charge follows a Boltzmann distribution and use a truncated Taylor expansion, known as the Debye-Hiickel approximation, so that we can obtain an explicit solution. Here the subscript w can be considered to indicate the cen- terline of the tube, because, as we shall see, the charge density drops off very rapidly with the distance from the tube wall. For the same reason we may neglect the wall curvature and as- sume that the net charge at the centerline is zero so that d2'$ - 4 F2 -1/2 where h = dy2 h2 R. A. Robinson and R. H. Stokes, Electrolyte Solutions, revised edition, Butterworth, London (19651, p. 571. This venerable reference contains a great detail of useful data. See, for example, J. S. Newman, Electrochemical Systems, 2nd edition, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. (1991). Example 24.4-4 is taken from p. 215. s24.4 Applications of the Generalized Maxwell-Stefan Equations 783 Here y = R - r is the distance measured into the fluid from the wall, and h is the Debye length, which tends to be very small. Thus for a 1-1 electrolyte where the units of Debye length h and the salt concentration cs are Angstroms and molarity, respectively. Thus for a 0.1 N solution, the Debye length is only about 10 A. As a result, de- partures from neutrality can usually be neglected in macroscopic systems. Similarly, concen- tration imbalances are very small for junction potentials, which are typically no more than tens of millivolts (see also Problem 24C.4). We now need boundary conditions to integrate Eq. 24.4-38, and the first is just the as- sumption of electroneutrality at large distances from the wall: Y B.C. 1: AS - + a, 4-0 (24.4-43) h The second is obtained from Gauss's law (see ~ewman', p. 75), assuming there is no potential gradient within the solid surface itself, B.C. 2: At y = 0, where q, is the surface charge per unit area. Integration of Eq. 24.4-40 then gives Newman6 gives a more rigorous development that allows for surface curvature, but for any tube of radius greater than tens of nanometers, this is really not necessary. We are now ready to put these results into the equation of motion, and we shall here as- sume steady laminar flow, so that in which the axial electric field strength is Neglecting the pressure gradient and using Eq. 24.4-36 to eliminate p,, we find Now, if curvature is again neglected, this equation may be integrated to give The quantity in the first set of parentheses may be considered to be an experimentally de- termined property of the system, and exp(-y/h) is negligible over the bulk of the tube cross section for essentially all tubes. Thus the velocity is uniform except very near the wall. Such electro-osmotic flows are being widely used in microscopic flow reactors and sepa- rators-for example, in diagnostic devices-and they offer the advantage of negligible con- vective dispersion. Note that the velocity is effectively independent of the tube radius. Thus electro-osmosis especially useful in tubes of small radii, where large pressure gradients would otherwise be required to produce the same flow velocity. 784 Chapter 24 Other Mechanisms for Mass Transport EXAMPLE 24.4-5 Additional Mass Transfer Driving Forces We have now covered all of the mass transfer mechanisms normally considered in a nonequi- librium thermodynamic framework, but there are other possibilities that have proven signifi- cant. Here we consider three: the force on a charged particle moving across a magnetic field, and the forces of electrical or magnetic induction. These contain nonlinear terms-that is, products of species velocities and force fields-and therefore they are, strictly speaking, out- side the scope of irreversible thermodynamics. However, it has been found permissible to add them to the body forces appearing in Eq. 24.4-1. Develop a specific form for the resulting equation, and show how it can be used to describe mass transfer processes affected by one or more of these additional forces. SOLUTION We begin by defining an extended driving force for mass transfer, d,,,, to include these addi- tional forces: Here B is the magnetic induction, E = VI$ the electric field, Ti' the electric susceptibility, and l7,\"\"\"he magnefic susceptibility. The origin of the terms containing [v, X B] and [E VEI in Eq. 24.4-50 is in the Lorentz relation where qo is the electric charge. This is shown explicitly in Eq. 24.4-51 for a charged particle moving through a magnetic field (see Problem 24B.1), but only indirectly for the electric in- duction [E . VE], which is based on the interaction of a nonuniform field with an electric dipole. To show the origin of the [E . VEI term in Eq. 24.4-50, consider, for example, the one- dimensional situation pictured in Fig. 24.4-3. An electric field will tend to align dipoles that are normally randomized by Brownian motion, and, if the field is nonuniform, there will be a net force on an aligned dipole of magnitude where qo is the magnitude of the charge at either end of the dipole and 1 is the distance be- tween the two centers of charge. In some cases-for example, the zwitterion form of amino acids-one can determine both q0 and I from molecular theory. However, for particles and most molecules, one finds only induced dipoles: a partial charge separation resulting from the presence of the field. Under the conditions of interest here, only a small fraction of intrinsic dipoles is aligned with the field, and both the fractional alignment of these and the strength of the induced dipoles are Unaligned dipoles (in absence of an electric field) W P .9 YI u .r( & E=Eo A W z = 0 Fig. 24.4-3. Origin of the dielectro- Position, z phoretic force given in Eq. 24.4-52. g24.5 Mass Transfer Across Selectively Permeable Membranes 785 normally assumed to be proportional to the field strength. All these factors are collected into what is usually an experimentally determined quantity, the electric susceptibility. The origin of the magnetophoresis term is analogous. We now turn to brief discussions of applications of these new separation mechanisms. The behavior of ions moving across a magnetic field is the basis of classic mass spectrom- etry, although time-of-flight mass spectrometers are also in widespread use. Both types of spectrometers are highly developed and find extensive applications for analyzing mixtures from simple inorganic gases to complex nonvolatile biological molecules such as proteins. In fact, where applicable, they provide the most accurate means available for determining pro- tein molecular weight, often within one dalton for a molecular weight typically of the order of tens of thousands. Both dielectro- and magnetophoresis have long been used on a large process scale for re- moving small particles suspended in fluids. Nonuniform fields are achieved in the case of di- electrophoresis by using a packing of small dielectric particles, such as glass beads, between electrodes (see, for example, Problem 24B.1). Because particles always move toward the stronger field, one can use alternating current, usually at some tens of kilovolts, and thus avoid electrode reactions. Current flows are extremely small and can normally be neglected. In magnetophoresis, a nonuniform field is achieved by placing ferromagnetic meshes be- tween poles of an electromagnet, which can of course work only with paramagnetic or ferro- magnetic materials. A classic example is the removal of color bodies consisting of magnetic iron oxides to whiten clay. New uses for dielectrophoresis have been developing very rapidly in the fields of biol- ~gy,~ advanced materials: including nanotechnology, and environmental monitoring? They include classification, quantitative analysis, and manipulation, including the formation of or- dered arrays. Many of these applications require major extensions of Eq. 24.4-50 to include quadrupo- lar and even octopolar forces.1° Moreover, there are strong interactions between electrical forces and hydrodynamics, and both device and particle shape can have profound effects.\" 524.5 MASS TRANSFER ACROSS SELECTIVELY PERMEABLE MEMBRANES Membranes may be viewed physically as thin sheets, usually separating two bulk phases and controlling mass transfer between them. In addition, the membrane is typically kept stationary against external pressure gradients and internal viscous drag by some me- chanical constraint, typically a wire mesh or equivalent structure. Membranes consist of C. Polk, IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, 28,6-14 (2000); J. Suehiro et al., 1. Physics D: Applied Physics, 32,2814-2320 (1999); J. P. H. Bert, R. Pethig, and M. S.

Mathematically they are defined by three constraints: 1. Negligible curvature where 6 is the membrane thickness, and R,,,, is the membrane surface radius of curvature. It follows that mass transport is unidirectional and perpendicular to the membrane surface. 2. Immobility of the matrix where v, is the velocity of the matrix, which serves as the coordinate reference. 3. Pseudosteady behavior where a is any contained species, including the matrix m. This really means that the diffusional response times within the membrane are short compared to those in the adjacent solutions. We now wish to show how these constraints can be used to specialize the Maxwell- Stefan equations and to produce compact but reliable descriptions of transport in membranes. We begin by recognizing that the matrix must be considered to be one of the diffus- ing species, and we choose to use the Maxwell-Stefan equations only for the mobile species. We may then use Eqs. 24.4-1 and 5 and write for a mixture of N mobile species: Note that cr has been chosen as the reference species in the equation for each a and that the force holding the membrane stationary-that is, the last term in Eq. 24.4-5-has resulted in the elimination of the mass-fraction term in the expression for pressure diffusion.' We next note that, from a thermodynamic point of view, the number of components is the number of independent mobile species in the solutions bathing the membrane, be- cause it is the external solution that determines the state of the membrane at equilibrium. We also recognize that, for most situations, the effective molecular weight of the matrix cannot be determined. We thus define the internal system as including only the mobile species and define mole fractions of these species to sum to unity. However, since the in- teraction of each species with the membrane is quite significant, we also define BLM by Equation 24.5-5 completes the specialization of the Maxwell-Stefan equations for mem- brane transport, but we still have to select a generally applicable set of boundary conditions. These conditions are obtained by requiring the total \"potential\" of each species to be continuous across the boundary E. M. Scattergood and E. N. Lightfoot, Trans.

The activity a, is to be calculated at the composition of the mem- brane phase but at the pressure of the external solution, and In practice, the solutes are normally considered incompressible and v, to be constant across the interface. Often conditions inside the membrane are very difficult, or even impossible, to de- termine, and Eq. 24.5-6 is primarily useful under these circumstances to obtain a qualita- tive understanding of membrane behavior. Partly for this reason complete descriptions of membrane transport are rare (see, however, Scattergood and Lightfoot'). Highly sim- plified, but often directly useful, introductions to membrane transport are available in a variety of One venerable approximation, found especially useful by biolo- gists, is that of Kedem and Katchalsky.\" However, rapid progress is being made in obtaining fundamental data, and much of this is reported in the Journal of Membrane Science. One important area is that of micro- porous membrane^.^ One can also expect advances in modeling behavior. It has long been known7 that the generalized Lorentz reciprocal theorem for creeping flows8 provides a sound basis for extending hydrodynamic diffusion theory of 517.4 to multicomponent diffusion in microporous membranes. Recently developed computational techniques9 should make the necessary computations tractable enough to provide real predictive power. These techniques can also be used to develop self-assembling str~ctures,'~ which offer new possibilities for highly selective membranes. This field offers an extremely wide variety of membrane types and of mass transfer processes taking place in them. One can distinguish between biological\" and synthetic12 membranes, but there are very wide ranges of composition and behavior within each of these categories. Among the synthetic group there are \"homogeneous\" membranes, in which the matrix acts as a true solvent for permeating species, and \"microporous\" mem- branes, in which the permeating species are confined to matrix-free regions, as well as mixtures of the two types. These factors are important from a materials standpoint, but the formalisms needed to describe their transport behavior are much the same for all. E. L.

Here we consider only a few examples to illustrate commonly encountered situations. EXAMPLE 24.5-1 Concentration Diffusion Between Preexisting Bulk Phases Consider \"solute\" A diffusing through a membrane placed between binary solutions of solute A in solvent B under the influence of concentration gradients alone. This is a commonly encoun- tered situation, including dialysis, blood oxygenation, and many gas-separation systems.I3 There are many variants, including facilitated difision (see Problem 24C.8). Hemodialysis is a special case, where pressure differences are used to drive water across the membrane, but concentration diffusion of solutes is of primary interest from the present standpoint. Assume for the moment that the flux of solvent, NB, is already known. Develop an analog to Fick's first law for this system. SOLUTION We are primarily concerned here with solute A, and the Maxwell-Stefan equation for it takes the form This may be rearranged to give This is reminiscent of Fick's law, with the first term on the right corresponding to the Fickian diffusive flux and the second to the convective term. However, the effective diffusivity now contains a membrane contribution, and the convective term is now weighted by a ratio of dif- fusivities. This situation corresponds to the situation pictured in Fig. 24.5-1. The arrow point- ing to the right represents the diffusion relative to the solvent, modified by the interaction with the matrix, while the arrow pointing to the left represents the \"drag\" of the membrane, which tends to reduce the transport relative to the convection occurring in the absence of the membrane matrix-namely, xA(NA + NB). Note that, in general, there are mass transfer boundary layers on both sides of the membrane. There are several limiting situations of interest. If the membrane interacts only very weakly with the solute, Bh >> BAB. Then Diffusion relative to solvent, and interaction with membrane (dialysis processes) Fig. 24.5-1.

However, it must be remembered that both molar concentration and diffusivity are those in the membrane phase. We next look at a limiting situation, where x*(NA + NB) << N* (24.5-1 1) and the distribution between membrane and solution is linear, so that = K~c~m (25.5-12) where the subscripts e and m refer to the external solution and membrane phases, respec- tively, and KD is the distribution coefficient for the two phases. We may then write NA = P(c/.eO - cAe& (24.5-13) where is known as the membrane permeability, and D~,eff = (a;, + J1 + The subscripts AeO and refer to the solute concentrations at the \"upstreamr' and \"down- stream\" sides of the membrane. EXAMPLE 24.5-2 Ultrafiltration and Now consider the filtration processes, in which it is desired to remove a solvent selectively relative to a solute by pressure-driven flow across a solute-rejecting membrane. Applications include ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis, the former dealing with macromolecular and the Reverse Osmosis latter with small solutes.14 Microfiltration and nanofiltration are formally similar, but the par- ticulate nature of the entities being removed presents additional complications we do not wish to consider here.I2 Develop a framework for describing solvent flow rate and filtrate composition as functions of driving pressure. SOLUTION Inevitably some solute moves through the membrane along with the solvent, as indicated in Fig. 24.5-1, and it will now be necessary to consider the Maxwell-Stefan equations for both species. However, membrane filtration is a complex process requiring a great deal of informa- tion to obtain a complete a priori description, and we therefore begin with an overview of characteristic behavior using Fig. 24.5-2 as a point of departure. Here both the flow through the membrane and the composition of the filtrate are shown schematically as functions of the Transmembrane pressure drop Fig. 24.5-2. Ultrafiltration: flow and solute rejection. - -- l4 R. J. Petersen, I. Membrane Sci., 83,81-150 (1993). 790 Chapter 24 Other Mechanisms for Mass Transport transmembrane pressure drop. First we note that the flow increases with pressure drop, slowly at first, but approaching a linear relation asymptotically, and the asymptote crosses the line of zero velocity at a finite pressure drop, The ratio of the filtrate solute concen- tration to the feed concentration drops with increasing pressure drop, from unity toward an asymptote,15 which is normally much lower than unity. Our main concern in this brief intro- duction is to explain this characteristic behavior in terms of key thermodynamic and trans- port behavior. This situation differs fundamentally from that just described, in that pressure diffusion now comes into play, and in that the downstream solution is produced by the transmem- brane mass transfer. Hence the downstream ratio of solute to solvent is the same as the ratio of the corresponding mass transfer rates. There is, therefore, no boundary layer on the down- stream side of the membrane, and it is an almost universal practice to use a composite struc- ture. Such composite membranes consist of a very thin selective layer on the upstream face, and a comparatively thick, highly porous, nonselective backing that provides mechanical strength. This backing can be ignored in the present example. We begin by focusing on the intramembrane behavior for which the Maxwell-Stefan equations, modified from Eq. 24.5-4, assume the forms Here the subscripts S and W refer to the partially rejected solute and solvent (usually water) respectively. The terms x,~, have been replaced by c,v,/c, to make the presence of the vol- ume fractions 4, = cx (24.5-18) explicit. In addition, the first term on the right has been rewritten as a reminder that the de- rivative represents the gradient of the partial molar free energy with composition, temperature, and pressure being held constant. We begin by examining flow behavior, and to do this we add Eqs. 24.5-16 and 17 to get a relation between species transport rates and intramembrane pressure gradient The subscript m on pressure is a reminder that we have so far calculated only the pressure drop inside the membrane. Here advantage has been taken of the Gibbs-Duhem equation and the fact that the volume fractions sum to unity. To obtain the directly measurable difference between upstream and downstream solu- tion pressures, we must go back to Eq. 24.5-6, which takes the form '%ctually there is a continuing, very slow drop of filtrate solute concentration even at very high pressure drops, presumably resulting from the compression of the membrane. However, we shall not attempt to deal with this small effect here. s24.5 Mass Transfer Across Selectively Permeable Membranes 791 Looking at the upstream side of the membrane, for example, Eq. 24.5-22 states that a finite pressure drop across the membrane interface is required to drive the solute against an in- crease in the thermodynamic activity. Then the measurable transmembrane pressure drop is where 6 is the membrane thickness, and where the subscripts 0 and 6 refer to the upstream and downstream sides of the membrane, respectively. The intramembrane osmotic pressures are seldom known, but they are substan- tially smaller than the corresponding solution values (see Problems 24C.7 and 8). At the pres- ent state of understanding, Eq. 24.5-24 explains why there is a finite intercept to the asymptotic flow behavior, and an elimination of the membrane contributions provides an upper limit to it. It also provides some insight into intramembrane behavior from experimen- tal observations, but not an a priori prediction of the intercept. Next we eliminate the pressure gradient from Eq. 24.5-16 with the aid of Eq. 24.5-23 This expression can be integrated to obtain the solute concentration profile (see, for example, Problems 24C.7 and 8). In general the concentration profile shows an increasingly negative slope in the flow direction, and this feature becomes more pronounced as the flow rate through the membrane increases-that is, as the transmembrane pressure drop becomes larger. At very low flow rates, Ns and Nw are relatively small and diffusion is relatively fast. There is only a small drop in solute concentration across the membrane, and the result is the poor rejection seen for low pressure drops in Fig. 24.5-2. This behavior is suggested by the zero-flow concentration profile in Fig. 24.5-1. At very high flow rates, on the other hand, concentration gradients are large and diffu- sion is weak, except very close to the downstream boundary of the membrane, where a very large negative concentration gradient develops. Near the upstream boundary, the two mass- flux terms are large compared to their difference, and one may neglect concentration gradi- ents in calculating the mass-flux ratio: The bases of solute exclusion now become clear: 1. Thermodynamic exclusion, defined by the ratio xs/x, 2. Frictional differentiation, defined by differences in the interaction terms with the - - membrane (Vs/Vw)(3kM/Bh,). Both effects are used in practice and are illustrated in the problems. Consider now membranes containing immobilized charges consisting of polyelectrolyte gels. Such gels contain repeated covalently bound ionic groups, as pictured in Fig. 24.5-3. The Charged Membranes membrane interior may then be viewed as a solution containing spatially bound fixed charges, and lbm~~ ~xclusion'~ mobile counter-ions, invading electrolyte, and water. For simplicity assume that the fixed l6 H. Strathmann, \"Electrodialysis,\" Section V in Membrane Handbook (W. W. S. Ho and K. K.

Membrane Molecular structure charges are anions, written as X-, and the counter-ions are cations, written as M'. The exter- nal solution is aqueous M+X-, and it provides the invading electrolyte M'X-. Show how the presence of fixed charges produces an exclusion of invading electrolyte. This system is dominated by the behavior at the membrane boundary, and we therefore return to Eq. 24.5-6, written for the water and for the salts S or MY. The expression for water is where the subscripts e and m refer to the external solution and the membrane, respectively. Since the intramembrane electrolyte concentration is always higher than the external, thus re- sulting in a lower internal chemical activity for water, the membrane interior is at a higher pressure than the external solution (see, for example, Problem 248.4). The corresponding equation for the salt S yields or It follows that - X~'eX~-e Y5e -- - = exp(% An) X~-mX~ In Y~wi and therefore that the concentration of salt in the membrane phase is less than that in the so- lution. This suppression of invading electrolyte by the presence of fixed charges is known as Donnan exclusion (see Problem 248.3). The preponderance of counter-ions, here M+, inside the membrane, tends to cause them to diffuse out to the external solution, whereas the co-ions, here X-, tend to diffuse into the membrane. The result is the development of an electrical potential difference between the membrane and external solution. This is normaIly estimated, by negIecting osmotic effects and assuming activity coefficients of unity, as Equations 24.5-27 to 30 also apply to the relations between solutions on opposite sides of a membrane containing a partiaIly excluded solute on one side, which now corresponds to the membrane phase of the above development. Equation 24.5-31 is often used for lack of knowl- edge of the neglected effects. 524.6 Mass Transport in Porous Media 793 Thus Eq. 24.5-31 is particularly widely used by biologists to explain the origin of the ubiquitous potentials observed across biological membranes.'' However, the means by which biological membranes can produce and control ion selectivity are extremely sophisticated and are only beginning to be understood.17 524.6 MASS TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA Porous media are important in many mass transfer applications, some of which, such as catalysis1 have already been touched on in this text (§18.7), and they exhibit a very wide variety of morph~logies.~,~ Adsorptive processes, such as chromatography, usually take place in granular beds and the absorbent particles themselves are often porous solids. Sec- ondary recovery of crude petroleum typically involves mass transfer in porous rock, and freeze drying, or lyophilization, of foods and pharmaceuticals4 depends on the transport of water vapor through a porous layer of dried solids. Related transport processes occur throughout the large field of particle technology,5 and, as already indicated in S24.5, some membranes may be considered as microporous structures. Microporous structures abound in living organisms and contribute importantly to both water and solute distribution3 Discussion of porous solids also brings us full circle, back to the discussions of mo- mentum transfer with which this text began. Many of the models used to describe mass transfer in porous media are hydrodynamic in origin, and sometimes the concepts of mass and momentum transfer become blurred. Predicting the transport of liquids and gases in porous media is a difficult and chal- lenging problem, and no completely satisfactory theory is available. Mass is transported in a porous medium by a variety of mechanisms: (i) by ordinary diffusion, described by the MaxwellStefan equations; (ii) by Knudsen diffusion; (iii) by viscous flow according to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation; (iv) by surface diffusion-that is, the creeping of ad- sorbed molecules along the surfaces of the pores; (v) by thermal transpiration, which is the thermal analog of viscous slip; and (vi) by thermal diffusion. In this discussion, we neglect the last three of these mechanisms. This problem has been attacked by many investigators: and summarized by othem7 We give here the principal results of their work.

We shall also restrict the discussion to two limiting situations within the pores of the solid matrix: (i) Free-molecule flow of gases, in which the molecular diameters are short and mean free paths are long relative to the characteristic dimensions of the pores. Under these conditions, there is no significant interaction between the intrapore species. (ii) Continuum flow of gases or liquids, in which both the diameters and the spacing of the intrapore molecules are short compared to the pore dimensions. Here the intrapore fluid can be described by the generalized hydrodynamic theory,%nd the generalized Maxwell-Stefan equations for multicomponent diffusion can be used. There are also phenomena for gas transport, known as the slip-flow phenomena, in which the mean free paths are comparable to the pore dimensions: but we shall not discuss these here. Free-Molecule Transport Transport of rarefied gases is an example of Knudsen flow, already presented in Prob- lem 2B.9. For a long capillary tube of radius a the Knudsen formula takes the form Here pA is the partial pressure of species A in any mixture. Note that Eq. 24.6-1 states that the transport of any individual species under these limiting conditions is unaffected by the presence of others. Thus the total molar flow rate WA in a tube is proportional to the cube of the tube radius and to the inverse square root of the molecular weight. This de- pendence on molecular weight is known as Graham's law. Equation 24.6-1 can be rewritten as which defines the \"Knudsen diffusivity\" DAK. However, this must be considered as a bi- nary diffusivity for species A relative to the porous medium that is not consistent with Fick's law, because the molar flux contains no convective term. As a result DAK is not a state property, containing as it does, the tube radius a. To allow for the tortuous nature of the channels in a porous medium and the limited cross-sectional area available for flow, the flux expression must be further modified by writing where Ds = (&/7)DAK and (NA) is the molar flux based on the total cross section of the porous medium. In this expression 8 is the fractional void space in the porous material, and r is a tortuosity fac- E. N. Lightfoot, J. B. Bassingthwaighte, and E. F. Grabowski, Ann. Biomed. Eng., 4,78-90 (1976).

Although models existla,'\"for estimating the magnitude of T, it must normally be de- termined experimentally.\" As an alternative to Eq. 24.6-4 for the effective Knudsen diffusivity, one may treat the aggregate as a collection of large immobile spheres (or \"giant gas molecules\"), and use the Chapman-Enskog kinetic theory.'' Problem 24B.6 shows that this approach yields predictions very similar to those of Eq. 24.6-4. There is remarkable model insensitivity. EXAMPLE 24.6-1 Knudsen Diffusion Two large well-stirred reservoirs, each of volume V, are joined by a short duct of cross- sectional area S and length L, filled with a porous solid as indicated in Figure 24.6-1. Initially reservoir 1 is filled with hydrogen at uniform pressure p, and reservoir 2 with nitrogen, also at p,. The entire system is maintained at a constant temperature. At time t = 0 a small valve in the duct is opened, and the two reservoirs are allowed to equilibrate with each other. Develop an expression for the total pressure in each reservoir as a function of time, assuming that the flow of each gas through the connecting duct follows Eq. 24.6-1, and that the ideal gas law holds throughout the system. SOLUTION We begin by assuming quasi-steady-state behavior in the duct so that, for either gas, the rate of transfer from reservoir 1 to reservoir 2 is given by where W,, is the molar rate of flow of species A (either nitrogen or hydrogen) and a is the ef- fective radius of the pores in the plug joining the two reservoirs. Now a macroscopic mass balance for reservoir 2 gives Now a mass balance over the whole system yields The initial conditions are that at time t = 0, These initial conditions complete the specification of the system behavior, and we see that the distributions of the two gases are independent of each other. For nitrogen we can define the dimensionless variables t,b = pN/po and 7 = (RTKN/V)t. Then we may write Eq. 24.6-7 for nitrogen in compartment 2 with the initial condition $hN2(0) = 1. The solution to this problem is then lo W. E. Stewart and M. F. L. Johnson, 7. Catalysis, 4,248-252 (1965). \" J. B.

The ratio NA/NB = -- of molar fluxes obtained here was first observed by Gra- ham13 in 1833 and rediscovered by ~oo~scha~en' in 1953. Though derived here for Knudsen flow, this relation is valid also for isobaric diffusion well outside the Knudsen region. It has been derived from kinetic theory by several investigators and verified experimentally in tubes and porous media6,7,'3,14 up to very large ratios of passage width to mean free path. Two sets of confirmatory data are shown in Table 24.6-1. In both sets of e~~eriments,'~.'~ an appa- ratus similar to that in Fig. 24.6-1 was used, and various tests gases were used against air. The flux ratios N,,,/N,,, were initial values, when each reservoir contained only air or the test gas. Continuum Transport To date, fluid mechanical modeling of intrapore transport has been limited to binary so- lutions in which molecules of the minor constituent (solute) are large compared to those of the solvent. Models for this situation are based on hydrodynamic diffusion theory ex- tended to porous structure^.^ Descriptions are obtained by solving the creeping flow equations of motion for spheres (representing the solute) through a continuum (repre- senting the solvent) in closed channels.15 Important effects include partial exclusion of solute at the channel entrance and selective interaction with the channel wall. Result to date are limited to single solutes, but the rapid development of computational tech- nique~'~ should permit extension to more complex systems. Hydrodynamic diffusion 'q. Graham, Phil.

Gas Grahama Mason and ~ronstadtl' \\%) calculations can be used for microporous membranes, but only if there are no significant intermolecular forces between the solutes and the pore walls. Modeling viscous flow in these systems has already been discussed in 56.4, and it is common practice to describe such a flow, for the low Reynolds numbers of most interest here, by the Blake-Kozeny expression (Eq. 6.4-9) [see however Rhodes5 (Chapter 5), Sahimi2 (Chapter 6), Stanitk2 (Chapter 3)]: Here v, is the superficial mass-average velocity. Note from the discussion of 519.2 that the velocity used here is the mass-average velocity of the fluid through the porous material. To obtain macroscopic descriptions we may use the generalized Maxwell-Stefan equations (Eq. 24.5-4), and we shall restrict ourselves here to concentration- and pressure-driven flow. Moreover, when the mobile species are small relative to pore di- mensions, the boundary conditions simplify to continuity of species concentration and pressure at the interface between the external and \"intrapore\" fluid. Simplify the Maxwell-Stefan equations for the diffusion of a binary dilute solution, of a large solute species A in a solvent B, through a macroporous medium M, a matrix with pores large Transport *om a compared to the diameters of both mobile species, but small enough that lateral concentration Binary External gradients within each pore may be neglected. Solution SOLUTION We begin by determining the pressure-flow relationship and note that we have two ways of doing this: the Blake-Kozeny equation (Eq. 24.6-14), and the diffusion-based result (Eq. 24.5- 20) of the previous section. For high velocities through the porous material and pores large relative to molecular di- mensions, it is the mass-average velocity that must be proportional to the pressure gradient, 798 Chapter 24 Other Mechanisms for Mass Transport and we may assume that the Blake-Kozeny equation governs the flow. We begin by rewriting Eq. 24.6-14) as and Eq. 24.5-20 as Equating the coefficients of v, and v, in these two equations then yields descriptions of Di, and BLM, respectively. If the pores are small relative to the molecular dimensions and the mass-average velocity is not large relative to the diffusional velocities v, - v, one is in a still poorly studied flow region, and one must resort either to experiment or to an appropriate molecular model.17 To determine the rate of solute transport, we turn to Eq. 24.5-25 noting that the diffusivities of that section already include the factor E/T. However, if the pore dimensions are very large with respect to the effective diameters of the solute and solvent molecules, the ratio BAB/BLM will be very small. We can thus obtain in which where the superscript ext refers to conditions in the external solution of the same composition as the pore fluid. Equation 24.6-17 may in turn be rewritten as which is Fick's first law modified for void fraction and tortuosity. It is widely used. Exactly as in unconfined fluids, one cannot determine net flow, or pressure drop, from diffusional considerations alone. One needs a flux ratio or equivalent. A specific example is supplied by freeze-drying, where water vapor must diffuse through a porous region of dried solid and where inert gases may be assumed stagnant. This region is also interesting in that conditions can vary from simple continuum diffusion, as here, through the slip-flow region, and on to the Knudsen region.4b It must be remembered that Eq. 24.6-19 and the equations leading up to it represent only the direct effect of molecular diffusion. The convective dispersion resulting from interparticle mixing and local departures from rectilinear flow must be added when using the volume- averaged convective equation (see 520.5, Butt12 g5.2.5, and ~evens~iel'~ 513.2).

In modeling a porous medium as a parallel network of channels one must allow both for the toruous nature (\"tortuosity\" 7) of real systems and also the restriction of the transport to the fraction s of the cross section that is available for flow.

Departures from electroneutrality. Following Newman, estimate the departures from elec- troneutrality in the stagnant region between the reservoirs of Problem 24B.2 as follows.

Then put the result into Poisson's equation Here E is the dielectric constant, and F/E may be taken to be 1.392 X 1016 volt-cm/g-equiv (see Newman4, pp. 74 and 256), which corresponds to a relative dielectric constant of 78.303.

Consider here the transport of a solute S across a homogeneous mem- brane from one external solution to another as a complex CS with a carrier C unable to leave the membrane phase.

To do this it may be necessary to use one form of the Gibbs-Duhem equation, Postface Of all the messages we have tried to convey in this long text, the most important is to recognize the key role of the equations of change, developed in Chapters 3,11, and 19. Writ- ten at the microscopic continuum level, they are the key link between the very complex motions of individual molecules and the observable behavior of most systems of engi- neering interest. They can be used to determine velocity, pressure, temperature, and concentration profile, as well as the fluxes of momentum, energy, and mass, even in complicated time-dependent systems. They are applicable to turbulent systems, and even when complete a priori solutions prove infeasible, simplify the efficient use of data through dimensional analysis. Integrated forms of the equations of change provide the macroscopic balances. No introductory text can, however, meet the needs of every reader. We have at- tempted, therefore, to provide a solid basis in the fundamentals needed to tackle presently unforeseen applications of transport phenomena in an intelligent way. We have also given extensive references to sources where additional information can be found. Some of these references contain specialized data or introduce powerful problem-solving tech- niques. Others show how transport analysis can be incorporated into equipment and process design. We have therefore concentrated on relatively simple examples that illustrate the characteristics of the equations of change and the kinds of questions they are capable of answering. This has required largely neglecting the very powerful numerical techniques available for solving difficult problems. Fortunately, there are now many monographs on numerical techniques and packaged programs of greater or lesser generality. Graphics programs are also available, which greatly simplify the presentation of data and simula- tions. It should also be recognized that great advances are being made in the molecular theory of transport phenomena, ranging from improved techniques for predicting the transport properties to the development of new materials. Molecular dynamics and Brown- ian dynamics simulation techniques are proving to be very powerful for understanding such varied systems as ultra-low density gases, thin films, small pores, interfaces, col- loids, and polymeric liquids. Simple models of turbulent transport have been included, but these are only a modest introduction to a large and important field. Highly sophisticated techniques have been developed for specialized areas, such as predicting the forces and torques on aircraft, the combustion processes in automobiles, and the performance of fluid mixers. It is hoped that the interested reader will not stop with our very limited introductory discussion. Conversely, we have greatly expanded our coverage of boundary-layer phenomena, because its importance and power are now being recognized in many applications. Once primarily the province of aerodynamicists, boundary-layer techniques are now widely used in many fields of heat and mass transfer, as well as in fluid mechanics. Applications abound in such varied fields as catalysis, separation processes, and biology. Of great and increasing importance is non-Newtonian behavior, encountered in the preparation and use of films, lubricants, adhesives, suspensions, and emulsions. Biologi- cal examples are exceedingly important, ranging from the operation of the joints to drag- reducing slimes on marine animals, and down to the very basic problem of digesting foodstuffs. No music and no oral communication would be possible without compressible pow, an area we have neglected because of space limitations. Compressible flow is also of critical 806 Postface importance in the design of airplanes, re-entry vehicles in our space program, and in pre- dicting meteorological phenomena. The awesome destructive power of tornadoes is a challenging example of the latter. Some problems involving transport phenomena in chemically reacting systems have been presented. For simplicity, we have taken the chemical kinetics expressions to be of rather idealized forms. For in combustion, flame propagation, and explosion phenomena more realistic descriptions of the kinetics will be needed. The same is true in biological systems, and the understanding of the functioning of the human body will re- quire much more detailed descriptions of the interactions among chemical kinetics, catalysis, diffusion, and turbulence. In basic terms, each of us is internally powered by the close equivalent of fuel cells, with current carried primarily by cations, in particular protons, rather than electrons. There are also complex electrical transport phenomena taking place in the now ubiquitous microelectronic devices such as computers and cellular phones. We have provided a very modest introduction to electrotransport, but again the reader is urged to go on to more specialized sources. No engineering project can be conceived, let alone completed, purely through use of the descriptive disciplines, such as transport phenomena and thermodynamics. Engi- neering, in the last analysis, depends heavily on heuristics to supplement incomplete knowledge. Transport phenomena can, however, prove immensely helpful by providing useful approximations, starting with order-of-magnitude estimates, and going on to suc- cessively more accurate approximations, such as those provided by boundary-layer the- ory. It is therefore important, perhaps in a second reading of this text, to seek shape- and model-insensitive descriptions by examining the numerical behavior of our model systems. Appendix A Vector and Tensor ~otation' Vector operations from a geometrical viewpoint Vector operations in terms of components Tensor operations in terms of components Vector and tensor differential operations Vector and tensor integral theorems Vector and tensor algebra in curvilinear coordinates Differential operations in curvilinear coordinates Integral operations in curvilinear coordinates Further comments on vector-tensor notation The physical quantities encountered in transport phenomena fall into three categories: scalars, such as temperature, pressure, volume, and time; vectors, such as velocity, mo- mentum, and force; and (second-order) tensors, such as the stress, momentum flux, and velocity gradient tensors. We distinguish among these quantities by the following notation: s = scalar (lightface Italic) v = vector (boldface Roman) T = second-order tensor (boldface Greek) In addition, boldface Greek symbols with one subscript (such as i3J are vectors. For vectors and tensors, several different kinds of multiplication are possible. Some of these require the use of special multiplication signs to be defined later: the single dot (m), the double dot (:), and the cross (X). We enclose these special multiplications, or sums thereof, in different kinds of parentheses to indicate the type of result produced: ( ) = scalar [ 1 = vector ( } = second-order tensor No special significance is attached to the kind of parentheses if the only operations en- closed are addition and subtraction, or a multiplication in which ., :, and x do not ap- pear. Hence (v w) and (.r:Vv) are scalars, [V x v] and [I v] are vectors, and {v . VT} and ' This appendix is very similar to Appendix A of R. B. Bird, R. C. Armstrong, and 0. Hassager, Dynamics of Polymeric Liquids, Vol. I, Fluid Mechanics, 2nd edition, Wiley-Interscience, New York (1987). There, in 98, a discussion of nonorthogonal coordinates is given. Also in Table A.7-4, there is a summary of the del operations for bipolar coordinates. 808 Appendix A Vector and Tensor Notation {a T + 7 . a} are second-order tensors. On the other hand, v - w may be written as (V - w), [V - w], or {V - w}, since no dot or cross operations appear. Similarly vw, (vw), [vwl, and {vw) are all equivalent. Actually, scalars can be regarded as zero-order tensors and vectors as first-order ten- sors. The multiplication signs may be interpreted thus: Multiplication Sign Order of Result None X in which C represents the sum of the orders of the quantities being multiplied. For exam- ple, ST is of the order 0 + 2 = 2, vw is of the order 1 + 1 = 2,6,6, is of the order 1 + 1 = 2,[vxwlisoftheorder1 + 1 - 1 = l,(a:.r)isoftheorder2+2 -4=O,and(o.~}isof the order 2 + 2 - 2 = 2. The basic operations that can be performed on scalar quantities need not be elabo- rated on here. However, the laws for the algebra of scalars may be used to illustrate three terms that arise in the subsequent discussion of vector operations: a. For the multiplication of two scalars, r and s, the order of multiplication is imma- terial so that the commutative law is valid: rs = sr. b. For the successive multiplication of three scalars, q, r, and s, the order in which the multiplications are performed is immaterial, so that the associative law is valid: (qr)s = q(rs). c. For the multiplication of a scalar s by the sum of scalars p, q, and r, it is immater- ial whether the addition or multiplication is performed first, so that the distribu- tive law is valid: s(p + q + r) = sp + sq + sr. These laws are not generally valid for the analogous vector and tensor operations de- scribed in the following paragraphs. A VECTOR OPERATIONS FROM A GEOMETRICAL VIEWPOINT In elementary physics courses, one is introduced to vectors from a geometrical stand- point. In this section we extend this approach to include the operations of vector multi- plication. In 9A.2 we give a parallel analytic treatment. Definition of a Vector and Its Magnitude A vector v is defined as a quantity of a given magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the vector is designated by Ivl or simply by the corresponding lightface symbol v. Two vectors v and w are equal when their magnitudes are equal and when they point in the same direction; they do not have to be collinear or have the same point of origin. If v and w have the same magnitude but point in opposite directions, then v = -w. Addition and Subtraction of Vectors The addition of two vectors can be accomplished by the familiar parallelogram construc- tion, as indicated by Fig. A.l-la. Vector addition obeys the following laws: A Vector Operations from a Geometrical Viewpoint 809 Commutative: Associative: Fig. A.1-1. (a) Addition of vectors; (b) subtraction of vectors. v Vector subtraction is performed by reversing the sign of one vector and adding; thus v - w = v + (-w). The geometrical construction for this is shown in Fig. A.1-lb. Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar When a vector is multiplied by a scalar, the magnitude of the vector is altered but its di- rection is not. The following laws are applicable Commutative: sv = vs (A.1-3) Associative: r(sv) = (rs)v (A. 1-4) Distributive (q + r + S)V = qv + rv + sv (A.1-5) Scalar Product (or Dot Product) of Two Vectors The scalar product of two vectors v and w is a scalar quantity defined by (v w) = vw cos +,, (A.1-6) in which +, is the angle between the vectors v and w. The scalar product is then the magnitude of w multiplied by the projection of v on w, or vice versa (Fig. A.1-2a). Note that the scalar product of a vector with itself is just the square of the magnitude of the vector The rules governing scalar products are as follows: Commutative: Not Associative: Distributive: The length of this vector equals w ,4, Area (v . w) (A.1-7) (A. 1-8) (A. 1-9) (A.1-10) Fig. A.1-2. Products of two vectors: (a) the scalar product; (b) the vec- tor product. 810 Appendix A Vector and Tensor Notation Vector Product (or Cross Product) of Two Vectors The vector product of two vectors v and w is a vector defined by [V X WI = IVW sin +,,In,, (A.1-11) in which n,, is a vector of unit length (a \"unit vector\") perpendicular to both v and w and pointing in the direction that a right-handed screw will move if turned from v to- ward w through the angle +,,. The vector product is illustrated in Fig. A.l-2b. The mag- nitude of the vector product is just the area of the parallelogram defined by the vectors v and w. It follows from the definition of the vector product that Note the following summary of laws governing the vector product operation: Not Commutative: [v X w] = -[w X v] Not Associative: [U X [V X w]] # [[u X V] X W] Distributive: [{u + v} X wl = [u X w] + [v X w] Multiple Products of Vectors Somewhat more complicated are multiple products formed by combinations of the mul- tiplication processes just described: The geometrical interpretations of the first three of these are straightforward. The magni- tude of (u . [v X w]) can easily be shown to represent the volume of a parallelepiped with edges defined by the vectors u, v, and w. EXERCISES I. What are the \"orders\" of the following quantities: (v - w), (v - u)w, (ab:cd), [v . pwu], [[a X f] x [b x gll? 2. Draw a sketch to illustrate the inequality in Eq. A.l-9. Are there any special cases for which it becomes an equality? 3. A mathematical plane surface of area S has an orientation given by a unit normal vector n, pointing downstream of the surface. A fluid of density p flows through this surface with a ve- locity v. Show that the mass rate of flow through the surface is w = p(n - v)S. 4. The angular velocity W of a rotating solid body is a vector whose magnitude is the rate of an- gular displacement (radians per second) and whose direction is that in which a right-handed screw would advance if turned in the same direction. The position vector r of a point is the vector from the origin of coordinates to the point. Show that the velocity of any point in a ro- tating solid body is v = [W X rl, relative to an origin located on the axis of rotation. 5. A constant force F acts on a body moving with a velocity v, which is not necessarily collinear with F. Show that the rate at which F does work on the body is W = (F . v). 5A.2 VECTOR OPERATIONS IN TERMS OF COMPONENTS In this section a parallel analytical treatment is given to each of the topics presented geo- metrically in sA.1. In the discussion here we restrict ourselves to rectangular coordinates and label the axes as 1, 2, 3 corresponding to the usual notation of x, y, z; only right- handed coordinates are used. sA.2 Vector Operations in Terms of Components 811 Many formulas can be expressed compactly in terms of the Kronecker delta Sii and the permutation symbol sljk These quantities are defined thus: 6, = +I, ifi = j ifiZj cijk = +I, if ijk = 123,231, or 312 (A.2-3) = -1 , if ijk = 321,132, or 213 (A.2-4) sijk = 0, if any two indices are alike (A.2-5) Note also that qjk. = (1/2)(i - j)(j - k)(k - i). Several relations involving these quantities are useful in proving some vector and tensor identities ? ? Note that a three-by-three determinant may be written in terms of the qjk The quantity s,jk thus selects the necessary terms that appear in the determinant and af- fixes the proper sign to each term. The Unit Vectors Let 6,, 62, 63 be the \"unit vectors\" (i.e., vectors of unit magnitude) in the direction of the 1,2,3 axes1 (Fig. A.2-1). We can use the definitions of the scalar and vector products to tabulate all possible products of each type Fig. A.2-1. The unit 2 vectors 6,; each vector is of unit magnitude and points in the ith 1 1 1 direction. ' In most elementary texts the unit vectors are called i, j, k. We prefer to use 6,, 6,, 6, because the components of these vectors are given by the Kronecker delta. That is, the component of 6, in the 1- direction is S,, or unity; the component of 6, in the 2-direction is SI2 or zero. 812 Appendix A Vector and Tensor Notation All of these relations may be summarized by the following two relations: (A.2-14) in which aii is the Kronecker delta, and eijk is the permutation symbol defined in the in- troduction to this section. These two relations enable us to develop analytic expressions for all the common dot and cross operations. In the remainder of this section and in the next section, in developing expressions for vector and tensor operations all we do is to break all vectors up into components and then apply Eqs. A.2-14 and 15. Expansion of a Vector in Terms of its Components Any vector v can be completely specified by giving the values of its projections v,, v,, v,, on the coordinate axes 1,2,3 (Fig. A.2-2). The vector can be constructed by adding vecto- rially the components multiplied by their corresponding unit vectors: Note that a vector associates a scalar with each coordinate dire~tion.~ The vi are called the \"components of the vector v\" and they are scalars, whereas the 6,vi are vectors, which when added together vectorially give v. The magnitude of a vector is given by [v[=v=dv~+v~+v$= fi (A.2-17) Two vectors v and w are equal if their components are equal: v, = w,, v2 = w,, and v3 = w3. Also v = -w, if vl = -wl, and so on. Addition and Subtraction of Vectors The sum or difference of vectors v and w may be written in terms of components as Geometrically, this corresponds to adding up the projections of v and w on each individ- ual axis and then constructing a vector with these new components. Three or more vec- tors may be added in exactly the same fashion. Fig. A.2-2. The components vi of the vector v are the pro- 1 jections of the vector on the coordinate axes 1,2, and 3. For a discussion of the relation of this definition of a vector to the definition in terms of the rules for transformation of coordinates, see W. Prager, Mechanics of Continua, Ginn, Boston (1961). 5A.2 Vector Operations in Terms of Components 813 Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar Multiplication of a vector by a scalar corresponds to multiplying each component of the vector by the scalar: Scalar Product (or Dot Product) of Two Vectors The scalar product of two vectors v and w is obtained by writing each vector in terms of components according to Eq. A.2-16 and then performing the scalar-product operations on the unit vectors, using Eq. A.2-14 Hence the scalar product of two vectors is obtained by summing the products of the cor- responding components of the two vectors. Note that (v . v) (sometimes written as v2 or as v2) is a scalar representing the square of the magnitude of v. Vector Product (or Cross Product) of Two Vectors The vector product of two vectors v and w may be worked out by using Eqs. A.2-16 and 15: Here we have made use of Eq. A.2-8. Note that the ith-component of [v X w] is given by xi 2, ~~~kv~w~; this result is often used in proving vector identities. Multiple Vector Products Expressions for the multiple products mentioned in sA.1 can be obtained by using the preceding analytical expressions for the scalar and vector products. For example, the product (u . [v X wl) may be written Then, from Eq. A.2-8, we obtain (U [V X wI) = The magnitude of (u . [v X wl) is the volume of a parellelepiped defined by the vectors u, v, w drawn from a common origin. Furthermore, the vanishing of the determinant is a necessary and sufficient condition that the vectors u, v, and w be coplanar. u1 u2 u3 ~1 v2 v3 w1 w2 w3 (A.2-23) 814 Appendix A Vector and Tensor Notation The Position Vector The usual symbol for the position vector-that is, the vector specifying the location of a point in spaceis r. The components of r are then x,, x,, and x3, so that This is an irregularity in the notation, since the components have a s mbol different from that for the vector. The magnitude of r is usually called r = 4 + xz +x$ and this r is the radial coordinate in spherical coordinates (see Fig. A.6-1). + The analytical expressions for dot and cross products may be used to prove vector identities; for example, verify the relation Proof of a Vector Identity [U x [v x w]] = V(U - W) - W(U - v) (A.2-25) SOLUTION The i-component of the expression on the left side can be expanded as We may now use Eq. A.2-7 to complete the proof which is just the i-component of the right side of Eq. A.2-25. In a similar way one may verify such identities as (U [v X w]) = (v [w X u]) (A.2-28) ([u X v] , [W X z]) = (U w)(v . z) - (u z)(v - w) (A.2-29) [[u X V] X [W X z]] = ([u X vl Z)W - ([u X v] w)z (A.2-30) EXERCISES 1.

Verify that ([v X w] [v X w]) + (v - w)' = v2w2 (the \"identity of Lagrange\"). sA.3 TENSOR OPERATIONS IN TERMS OF COMPONENTS In the last section we saw that expressions could be developed for all common dot and cross operations for vectors by knowing how to write a vector v as a sum zi ijivi, and by knowing how to manipulate the unit vectors tji. In this section we follow a parallel pro- cedure. We write a tensor T as a sum zi xj tiiZijrij, and give formulas for the manipulation of the unit dyads in this way, expressions are developed for the commonly occur- ring dot and cross operations for tensors. The Unit Dyads These results are easy to remember: one simply takes the dot (or cross) product of the nearest unit vectors on either side of the dot (or cross); in Eq. A.3-1 two such operations are performed. The unit vectors 6i were defined in the preceding discussion and then the scalar p~oducts (tii tij) and vector products [ai X Sj] were given. There is a third kind of product that can be formed with the unit vectors-namely, the dyadic products 6i6j (written without multi- plication symbols). According to the rules of notation given in the introduction to Ap- pendix A, the products are tensors of the second order. Since tii and tij are of unit magnitude, we will refer to the products tji6, as unit dyads. Whereas each unit vector in Fig. A.2-1 represents a single coordinate direction, the unit dyads in Fig. A.3-1 represent ordered pairs of coordinate directions. (In physical problems we often work with quantities that require the simultaneous specification of two directions. For example, the flux of x-momentum across a unit area of surface perpendicular to the y direction is a quantity of this type. Since this quantity is sometimes not the same as the flux of y-momentum perpendicular to the x direction, it is evident that specifying the two directions is not sufficient; we must also agree on the order in which the directions are given.) The dot and cross products of unit vectors were introduced by means of the geomet- rical definitions of these operations. The analogous operations for the unit dyads are in- troduced formally by relating them to the operations for unit vectors (6i61:6k61) = (6, ' 6k)(6i ' 61) = 6jksil (A.3-1) 816 Appendix A Vector and Tensor Notation Fig. A.3-1. The unit dyads jP2 )L2 )- &ti,. The solid arrows repre- sent the first unit vector in the dyadic product, and the hollow vectors the second. Note that 6,6, is not the 6161 6162 6163 same as €i26,. 1 1 1 3 3 3 Expansion of a Tensor in Terms of Its Components In Eq. A.2-16 we expanded a vector in terms of its components, each component being multiplied by the appropriate unit vector. Here we extend this idea and define' a (sec- ond-order) tensor as a quantity that associates a scalar with each ordered pair of coordinate di- rections in the following sense: The scalars rij are referred to as the \"components of the tensor 7.\" There are several special kinds of second-order tensors worth noting: 1. If rii = rj,, the tensor is said to be symmetric. 2. If rii = -T~~, the tensor is said to be antisymmetric. 3. If the components of a tensor are taken to be the components of T, but with the in- dices transposed, the resulting tensor is called the transpose of T and given the symbol I+: ' Tensors are often defined in terms of the transformation rules; the connections between such a definition and that given above is discussed by W. Prager, Mechanics of Continua, Ginn, Boston (1961). 5A.3 Tensor Operations in Terms of Components 817 4. If the components of the tensor are formed by ordered pairs of the components of two vectors v and w, the resulting tensor is called the dyadic product of v and w and given the symbol vw: Note that vw # wv, but that (vw)~ = wv. 5. If the components of the tensor are given by the Kronecker delta S,., the resulting tensor is called the unit tensor and given the symbol 6: The magnitude of a tensor is defined by 1 7 1 = 7 = v$(T:Tt) I Addition of Tensors and Dyadic Products Two tensors are added thus: a + T = 2 2 6i9u, + 2 x = 2 2 6,S,(u, + rij) (A.3-12) 1 i i i j That is, the sum of two tensors is that tensor whose components are the sums of the cor- responding components of the two tensors. The same is true for dyadic products. Multiplication of a Tensor by a Scalar Multiplication of a tensor by a scalar corresponds to multiplying each component of the tensor by the scalar: ST = s The same is true for dyadic products. The Scalar Product (or Double Dot Product) of Two Tensors Two tensors may be multiplied according to the double dot operation in which Eq. A.3-1 has been used. Similarly, we may show that 818 Appendix A Vector and Tensor Notation The Tensor Product (the Single Dot Product) of Two Tensors Two tensors may also be multiplied according to the single dot operation = z 2 C Sjk&%I17kl = 2 z rib 2 uijrjl tjkl i I (j ) (A.3-17) That is, the il-component of {u T} is Xi uijrj1. Similar operations may be performed with dyadic products. It is common practice to write {u . a} as u2, {u u21 as u3, and so on. The Vector Product (or Dot Product) of a Tensor with a Vector When a tensor is dotted into a vector, we get a vector That is, the ith component of [I . v] is 2, rVvi' Similarly, the ith component of [v TI is zj vj9. Clearly, [T . v] Z [v . TI unless T is symmetric. Recall that when a vector v is multiplied by a scalar s, the resultant vector sv points in the same direction as v but has a different length. However, when T is dotted into v, the resultant vector [T V] differs from v in both length and direction; that is, the tensor I \"deflects\" or \"twists\" the vector v to form a new vector pointing in a different direction. The Tensor Product (or Cross Product) of a Tensor with a Vector When a tensor is crossed with a vector, we get a tensor: Hence, the il-component of {T x v) is Xi 2, Similarly the lk-component of {v x T) is Zt xj qjpirjk Other Operations From the preceding results, it is not difficult to prove the following identities: [S . v] = [v -61 = v [uv ' w] = u(v ' w) [W ' uv] = (w ' u)v (uv:wz) = (uw:vz) = (u . z)(v . w) (7:uv) = ([T ' ul ' v) (uv:7) = (u ' [v ' TI) gA.4 Vector and Tensor Differential Operations 819 EXERCISES 1. The components of a symmetric tensor T are The components of a vector v are 3. If a is symmetrical and P is antisymmetrical, show that (a$) = 0. 4. Explain carefully the statement after Eq. A.3-17 that the il-component of {cr T) is 2, (JjjT,p 5. Consider a rigid structure composed of point particles joined by massless rods. The particles are numbered 1,2,3,. . . , N, and the particle masses are m, (v = 1,2, . . . , N). The locations of the particles with respect to the center of mass are R,. The entire structure rotates on an axis passing through the center of mass with an angular velocity W. Show that the angular mo- mentum with respect to the center of mass is Then show that the latter expression may be rewritten as where is the moment-of-inertia tensor. 6. The kinetic energy of rotation of the rigid structure in Exercise 5 is where R, = [W x R,] is the velocity of the vth particle. Show that 5A.4 VECTOR AND TENSOR DIFFERENTIAL OPERATIONS The vector differential operator V, known as \"nabla\" or 'Idel,\" is defined in rectangular coordinates as in which the 6, are the unit vectors and the xi are the variables associated with the 1,2,3 axes (i.e., the x,, x,, x, are the Cartesian coordinates normally referred to as x, y, z). The symbol V is a vector-operator-it has components like a vector but it cannot stand alone; 820 Appendix A Vector and Tensor Notation it must operate on a scalar, vector, or tensor function. In this section we summarize the various operations of V on scalars, vectors, and tensors. As in 5sA.2 and A.3, we decom- pose vectors and tensors into their components and then use Eqs. A.2-14 and 15, and Eqs. A.3-1 to 6. Keep in mind that in this section equations written out in component form are valid only for rectangular coordinates, for which the unit vectors are con- stants; curvilinear coordinates are discussed in 9SA.6 and 7. The Gradient of a Scalar Field If s is a scalar function of the variables x,, x,, x,, then the operation of V on s is The vector thus constructed from the derivatives of s is designated by Vs (or grad s) and is called the gradient of the scalar field s. The following properties of the gradient opera- tion should be noted. Not Commutative: Not Associative: Distributive: The Divergence of a Vector Field If the vector v is a function of the space variables x,, x,, x,, then a scalar product may be formed with the operator V; in obtaining the final form, we use Eq. A.2-14: This collection of derivatives of the components of the vector v is called the divergence of v (sometimes abbreviated div v). Some properties of the divergence operator should be noted Not Commutative: (V . v) # (v . V) Not Associative: (V . sv) # (Vs V) Distributive: (V . {v + w}) = (V v) + (V W) The Curl of a Vector Field A cross product may also be formed between the V operator and the vector v, which is a function of the three space variables. This cross product may be simplified by using Eq. A.2-15 and written in a variety of forms 9A.4 Vector and Tensor Differential Operations 821 The vector thus constructed is called the curl of v. Other notations for [V x v] are curl v and rot v, the latter being common in the German literature. The curl operation, like the divergence, is distributive but not commutative or associative. Note that the ith compo- nent of [V X vl is ZjZk .sijk(d/dxj)vk. The Gradient of a Vector Field In addition to the scalar product (V . v) and the vector product [V X v] one may also form the dyadic product Vv: This is called the gradient of the vector v and is sometimes written grad v. It is a second- order tensor whose ij-component1 is (d/dxi)vj. Its transpose is whose ij-component is (d/dxj)v,. Note that Vv # vV and (Vv)+ Z vV. The Divergence of a Tensor Field If the tensor 7 is a function of the space variables x,, x,, x,, then a vector product may be formed with operator V; in obtaining the final form we use Eq. A.3-3: This is called the divergence of the tensor T, and is sometimes written div 7. The kth com- ponent of [V . T] is Xi (d/dxi)rik). If T is the product svw, then The Laplacian of a Scalar Field If we take the divergence of a gradient of the scalar function s, we obtain The collection of differential operators operating on s in the last line is given the symbol V2; hence in rectangular coordinates This is called the Laplacian operator. (Some authors use the symbol A for the Laplacian operator, particularly in the older German literature; hence (V . Vs), (V V)s, V2s, and As Caution: Some authors define the ij-component of Vv to be (d/dx,)v,. 822 Appendix A Vector and Tensor Notation are all equivalent quantities.) The Laplacian operator has only the distributive property, as do the gradient, divergence, and curl. The Laplacian of a Vector Field If we take the divergence of the gradient of the vector function v, we obtain That is, the kth component of [V . Vvl is, in Cartesian coordinates, just V2vk. Alternative notations for [V . Vvl are (V . V)v and V2v. Other Differential Relations Numerous identities can be proved using the definitions just given: Vrs = rVs + sVr (V - SV) = (VS ' V) + s(V ' V) (V [v X w]) = (w . [V X v]) - (v ' [V X w]) [V x sv] = [Vs X vl + s[V X vl [V Vv] = V(V . v) - [V X [V X v]] [v ' Vv] = iV(v ' v) - [v X [V X v]] [V . vw] = [v ' Vw] + w(V ' v) (s6:Vv) = s(V . v) [V . s61 = Vs [V 'ST] = [VS '71 f s[V '71 V(v . W) = [(Vv) ' w] + [(Vw) ' vl Prove that for symmetric T: Proof of a Tensor Identity SOLUTION First we write out the right side in terms of components: The left side may be written as the second form resulting from the symmetry of T. Subtraction of Eq. A.4-31 from Eq. A.4-30 will give Eq. A.4-32. 5A.4 Vector and Tensor Differential Operations 823 Now that we have given all the vector and tensor operations, including the various V operations, we want to point out that the dot and double dot operations can be written down at once by using the following simple rule: a dot implies a summation on adjacent in- dices. We illustrate the rule with several examples. To interpret (v w), we note that v and w are vectors, whose components have one index. Since both symbols are adjacent to the dot, we make the indices for both of them the same and then sum on them: (v . w) = Ziv,wi. For double dot operations such as (T:VV), we proceed as follows. We note that T, being a tensor, has two subscripts, whereas V and v each have one. We therefore set the second subscript of T equal to the subscript on V and sum; then we set the first subscript of T equal to the subscript on v and sum. Hence we get (T:VV) = SiZj.rji(d/dxi)vj. Similarly, (v [V - 11) can be written down at once as ZiC,vi(d/dxi).r,, by performing the operation in the inner enclosure (the brackets) before the outer (the parentheses). To get the ith component of a vector quantity, we proceed in exactly the same way. To evaluate [T vIi we set the second index of the tensor T equal to the index on v and sum to get Zjrijvj. Similarly, the ith component of [V . pvvl is obtained as Ci(d/dxi)(pv,vi). Becoming skilled with this method can save a great deal of time in interpreting'the dot and double dot operations in Cartesian coordinates. EXERCISES 1. Perform all the operations in Eq. A.4-6 by writing out all the summations instead of using the notation. 2. A field v(x, y, z) is said to be ivvotational if [V X v] = 0. Which of the following fields are irrota- tional?

A vector v has components with ail = aji and x:=, ail = 0; the ap are constants. Evaluate (V v), [V x vl, Vv, (Vv)', and [V . vvl.

Write out in full in Cartesian coordinates d (a) -pv = -[V-pwl - Vp - [V-TI + pg dt (b) T = -p{Vv + (VV)~ - $(V . v)6] 5A.5 VECTOR AND TENSOR INTEGRAL THEOREMS For performing general proofs in continuum physics, several integral theorems are ex- tremely useful. The Gauss-Ostrogradskii Divergence Theorem If V is a closed region in space enclosed by a surface S, then in which n is the outwardly directed unit normal vector. This is known as the divergence theorem of Gauss and Ostrogradskii. Two closely allied theorems for scalars and tensors are The last relation is also valid for dyadic products vw. Note that, in all three equations, V in the volume integral is just replaced by n in the surface integral. The Stokes Curl Theorem If S is a surface bounded by the closed curve C, then in which t is a unit tangential vector in the direction of integration along C; n is the unit normal vector to S in the direction that a right-hand screw would move if its head were twisted in the direction of integration along C. There is a similar relation for tensors.' The Leibniz Formula for Differentiating a Volume integral2 Let V be a closed moving region in space enclosed by a surface S; let the velocity of any surface element be v,. Then, if s(x, y, z, t) is a scalar function of position and time, ' See P. M. Morse and H. Feshbach, Methods of Theoretical Physics, McGraw-Hill, New York (1953), p. 66. M. D. Greenberg, Foundations of Applied Mathematics, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. (1978), pp. 163-164. sA.6 Vector and Tensor Algebra in Curvilinear Coordinates 825 This is an extension of the Leibniz formula for differentiating a single integral (see Eq. C.3- 2); keep in mind that V = V(t) and S = St). Equation A.5-5 also applies to vectors and tensors. If the integral is over a volume, the surface of which is moving with the local fluid velocity (so that v, = v), then use of the equation of continuity leads to the additional useful result: in which p is the fluid density. Equation A.5-6 is sometimes called the Reynolds transport theorem. EXERCISES 1. Consider the vector field Evaluate both sides of Eq. A.5-1 over the region bounded by the planes xl = 0, x1 = 1; x2 = 0, x2 = 2; x3 = 0, X3 = 4. 2. Use the same vector field to evaluate both sides of Eq. A.5-4 for the face x, = 1 in Exercise 1. 3. Consider the time-dependent scalar function: Evaluate both sides of Eq. A.5-5 over the volume bounded by the planes: x = 0, x = t; y = 0, y = 2t; z = 0, z = 4t. The quantities x, y, z, t are dimensionless. 4. Use Eq. A.5-4 (with v replaced by T) to show that, when 7ki = zj ~ijk xj, where r is the position vector locating a point on C with respect to the origin. 5. Evaluate both sides of Eq. A.5-2 for the function s(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2. The volume V is the triangular prism lying between the two triangles whose vertices are (2,0, O), (2,1, O), (2,0,3), and(-2,0,0),(-2,1,0),(-2,0,3). 5A.6 VECTOR AND TENSOR ALGEBRA IN CURVILINEAR COORDINATES Thus far we have considered only Cartesian coordinates x, y, and z. Although formal de- rivations are usually made in Cartesian coordinates, for working problems it is often more natural to use curvilinear coordinates. The two most commonly occurring mrvilin- ear coordinate systems are the cylindrical and the spherical. In the following we discuss only these two systems, but the method can also be applied to all orthogonal coordinate systems-that is, those in which the three families of coordinate surfaces are mutually perpendicular. We are primarily interested in knowing how to write various differential operations, such as Vs, [V x v], and (T:VV) in curvilinear coordinates. It turns out that we can do this in a straightforward way if we know, for the coordinate system being used, two things: (a) the expression for V in curvilinear coordinates; and (b) the spatial derivatives of the unit vectors in curvilinear coordinates. Hence, we want to focus our attention on these two points. 826 Appendix A Vector and Tensor Notation - Fig. A.6-1. (a) Cylindrical coordinates' with 0 s 7 < w, 0 s 0 < 2~r, -a < Z < a. (b) Spherical coordinates with 0 5 r < m, 0 5 0 5 T, 0 5 4 < 27~. Note that T and $ in cylindrical coordinates are not the same as r and 0 in spherical coordinates. Note carefully how the position vector r and its length r are written in the three coordinate systems: Rectangular: r = 6,x + 6,y + 6,z; r = v\\/Jc2 + y2 + z2 Cylindrical: r = 6,F + 6,Z; r = V'FT~ Spherical: r = 67; r = r Cylindrical Coordinates In cylindrical coordinates, instead of designating the coordinates of a point by x, y, z, we locate the point by giving the values of r, 0, z. These coordinates1 are shown in Fig. A.6- la. They are related to the Cartesian coordinates by x = r cos 0 (A.6-1) r = +dx2 + y2 (A.6-4) y = r sin 0 (A.6-2) 0 = arctan (y/x) (A.6-5) z=z (A.6-3) z = z (A.6-6) To convert derivatives of scalars with respect to x, y, z into derivatives with respect to r, 0, z, the \"chain rule\" of partial differentiation2 is used. The derivative operators are read- ily found to be related thus: d sin 0 d d (COSO)-+ (0)dZ dr d d { & = (sin 0) + ('7) + io), ' Caution: We have chosen to use the familiar r, 0, z-notation for cylindrical coordinates rather than to switch to some less familiar symbols, even though there are two situations in which confusion can arise: (a) occasionally one has to use cylindrical and spherical coordinates in the same problem, and the symbols r and I3 have different meanings in the two systems; Cb) occasionally one deals with the position vector r in problems involving cylindrical coordinates, but then the magnitude of r is not the same as the coordinate r, but rather m. In such situations, as in Fig. Ah-1, we can use overbars for the cylindrical coordinates and write T, 8,~. For most discussions bars will not be needed. For example, for a scalar function ~(x, y, z) = +(r, 0, z): Note that we are careful to use different symbols ,y and I,//, since x is a different function of x, y, z than I,!I is of r, 13, and z! 5A.6 Vector and Tensor Algebra in Curvilinear Coordinates 827 Y Fig. A.6-2. Unit vectors in rectangular and cylindrical coordinates. The z-axis and the unit 6~ vector 6, have been omitted for simplicity. 6, / / / / / H P(x, y, Z) or P(Y, 0, Z) / / / / / / -/\\\" X With these relations, derivatives of any scalar functions (including, of course, compo- nents of vectors and tensors) with respect to x, y, and z can be expressed in terms of de- rivatives with respect to r, 0, and z. Having discussed the interrelationship of the coordinates and derivatives in the two coordinate systems, we now turn to the relation between the unit vectors. We begin by noting that the unit vectors ti,, 6,, 6, (or 6,, 6,, 6, as we have been calling them) are inde- pendent of position-that is, independent of x, y, z. In cylindrical coordinates the unit vectors 6, and 6, will depend on position, as we can see in Fig. A.6-2. The unit vector 6, is a vector of unit length in the direction of increasing r; the unit vector 6, is a vector of unit length in the direction of increasing 8. Clearly as the point P is moved around on the xy- plane, the directions of 6, and 6, change. Elementary trigonometrical arguments lead to the following relations: 6, = ( cos 0)S, + ( sin O)Sy + (OM, 6, = (- sin 0)6, + (cos 0)6, + (016, 6, = (016, + (016, + (116, These may be solved for 6,, S,, and 6, to give The utility of these two sets of relations will be made clear in the next section. Vectors and tensors can be decomposed into components with respect to cylindrical coordinates as was done for Cartesian coordinates in Eqs. A.2-16 and A.3-7 (i.e., v = 6,v, + 6,v, + 6,~~). Also, the multiplication rules for the unit vectors and unit dyads are the same as in Eqs. A.2-14 and 15 and A.3-1 to 6. Consequently the various dot and cross product operations (but ~ot the differential operations!) are performed as described in 55A.2 and 3. For example, + etc. 828 Appendix A Vector and Tensor Notation Spherical Coordinates We now tabulate for reference the same kind of information for spherical coordinates r, 0,4. These coordinates are shown in Figure A.6-lb. They are related to the Cartesian co- ordinates by x = r sin 8 cos 4 (A.6-19) r = +Ux2 + y2 + z2 (A.6-22) y = r sin 0 sin 4 (A.6-20) 0 = arctan(m/z) (A.6-23) z = r cos 8 (A.6-21) + = arctan(y/x) (A.6-24) For the spherical coordinates we have the following relations for the derivative operators: COS 8 cos 4 = (sin 0 cos 4) dr (A.6-25) sin 0 d d (c0s8)++ (i)z + (01% dr The relations between the unit vectors are 6, = (sin 0 cos +)ti, + (sin 0 sin +)ijy + ( cos 8% (A.6- 28) 6, = (COS 8 cos 4)6, + (cos 0 sin 4)6y + (- sin @6, (A.6-29) 6, = (- sin 4)6, + ( cos 4)GY + (OPz (A.6-30) and 6, = (sin 8 cos 4)6, + (cos 8 cos $)So + (- sin 4)6+ (A.6-31) Sy = (sin 8 sin +)fir + ( cos 0 sin 4)S, + ( cos (A.6-32) 6, = (cos 8)Fr + (- sin 0)60 + (ON+ (A.6-33) And, finally, some sample operations in spherical coordinates are That is, the relations (not involving V!) given in ssA.2 and 3 can be written directly in terms of spherical components. EXERCISES 1. Show that lozT j: 6, sin B do = o lozT j: s,s, sin 0 d~ d4 = ti where 6, is the unit vector in the r direction in spherical coordinates. 2. Verify that in spherical coordinates 6 = 63, + 6,6, + 6+6+. 5A.7 Differential Operations in Curvilinear Coordinates 829 5A.7 DIFFERENTIAL OPERATIONS IN CURVILINEAR COORDINATES We now turn to the use of the V-operator in curvilinear coordinates. As in the previous sec- tion, we work out in detail the results for cylindrical and spherical coordinates. Then we sum- marize the procedure for getting the V-operations for any orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. Cylindrical Coordinates From Eqs. A.6-10,11, and 12 we can obtain expressions for the spatial derivatives of the unit vectors 6,, 6,, and 6,: (A. 7-2) The reader would do well to interpret these derivatives geometrically by considering the way 6,, 6,, 6, change as the location of P is changed in Fig. A.6-2. We now use the definition of the V-operator in Eq. A.4-1, the expressions in Eqs. A.6- 13, 14, and 15, and the derivative operators in Eqs. A.6-7,8, and 9 to obtain the formula for V in cylindrical coordinates d sin 0 d = (6, cos 0 - S, sin 0) d + (6, sin 0 + 6, cos 0) When this is multiplied out, there is considerable simplification, and we get for cylindrical coordinates. This may be used for obtaining all differential operations in cylin- drical coordinates, provided that Eqs. A.7-1,2, and 3 are used to differentiate any unit vectors on which V operates. This point will be made clear in the subsequent illustrative example. Spherical Coordinates The spatial derivatives of 6, 6,, and 6, are obtained by differentiating Eqs. A.6-28/29, and 30: d d d - 6, = 6, sin 0 - 6, = 6+ cos 0 - 6+ = -6, sin 0 - S, cos 8 d9 d+ (A.7-8) 830 Appendix A Vector and Tensor Notation Use of Eqs. A.6-31,32, and 33 and Eqs. A.6-25,26, and 27 in Eq. A.4-1 gives the following expression for the V-operator: in spherical coordinates. This expression may be used for obtaining differential opera- tions in spherical coordinates, provided that Eqs. A.7-6,7, and 8 are used for differentiat- ing the unit vectors. General Orthogonal Coordinates Thus far we have discussed the two most-used curvilinear coordinate systems. We now present without proof the relations for any orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. Let the relation between Cartesian coordinates xi and the curvilinear coordinates q, be given by These can be solved for the q, to get the inverse relations q, = q,(xi). ~henl the unit vec- tors in rectangular coordinates and the 6, in curvilinear coordinates are related thus: in which the \"scale factors\" h, are given by The spatial derivatives of the unit vectors 6, can then be found to be d6, - 6p dhp 3 Gr dh, &p E -- ha a% y=1 hr dqr I I and the V-operator is I I The reader should verify that Eqs. A.7-14 and 15 can be used to get Eqs. A.7-1 to 3, A.7-5 and A.7-6 to 9. From Eqs. A.7-15 and 14 we can now get the following expressions for the simplest of the V-operations: P. Morse and H. Feshbach, Methods of Theoretical Physics, McGraw-Hill, New York (1953), p. 26 and p. 115. 5A.7 Differential Operations in Curvilinear Coordinates 831 EXAMPLE A.7-1 Differential Operations in Cylindrical Coordinates In the last expression, the unit vectors are those belonging to the curvilinear coordinate system. Additional operations may be found in Morse and Feshbach.' The scale factors introduced above also arise in the expressions for the volume and surface elements dV = h,h,h,dqldq2dq, and dSap = hohpdqadqp(a # P); here dSap is a surface element on a surface of constant y, where y Z a and y # p. The reader should verify that the volume elements and various surface elements in cylindrical and spherical coordi- nates can be found in this way. In Tables A.7-1,2, and 3 we summarize the differential operations most commonly en- countered in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates.* The curvilinear coordinate expressions given can be obtained by the method illustrated in the following two examples. Derive expressions for (V v) and Vv in cylindrical coordinates. SOLUTION (a) We begin by writing V in cylindrical coordinates and decomposing v into its components Expanding, we get We now use the relations given in Eqs. A.7-1,2, and 3 to evaluate the derivatives of the unit vectors. This gives Since (6, 6,) = 1, (6,. 6,) = 0, and so on, the latter simplifies to which is the same as Eq. A of Table A.7-2. The procedure is a forward. (A. 7-22) bit tedious, but is is straight- ' For other coordinate systems see the extensive compilation of P. Moon and D. E. Spencer, Field Theory Handbook, Springer, Berlin (1961). In addition, an orthogonal coordinate system is available in which one of the three sets of coordinate surfaces is made up of coaxial cones (but with noncoincident apexes); all of the V-operations have been tabulated by the originators of this coordinate system, J. F. Dijksman and E. P. W. Savenije, Rheol.

In doing volume integrals, the simplest situations are those in which the bounding surfaces are surfaces of the coordinate system. For cylindrical coordinates, a typical vol- ume integral of a function f(r, 0, z) would be of the form and for spherical coordinates a typical volume integral of a function g(r, 0, +) would be lo: 1,; g(r, 0, +)? dr sin 0 d0 d+ 840 Appendix A Vector and Tensor Notation Fig. A.8-1. Differential volume element r dr dB dz in cylindrical coordinates, Cylindfical surface and differential line ele- of radius r ments dr, r do, and dz. The differential surface ele- Differential ments are: (r d0)(dz) per- volume element pendicular to the r direction (dr)(rdO)(dz) (intermediate shading); (dz)(dr) perpendicular to the 8 direction (darkest shad- ing); and (dr)(r de) perpen- dicular to the z direction (lightest shading). Since the limits in these integrals (r,, r,, S,, S2, etc.) are constants, the order of the integra- tion is immaterial. In doing surface integrals, the simplest situations are those in which the integration is performed on one of the surfaces of the coordinate system. For cylindrical coordinates ihere are three possibilities: On the surface r = r,: On the surface 0 = 80: On the surface z = 2,: /I Spherical surface X with radius r Fig. A.8-2. Differential vol- ume element r2 sin 8 dr d0 d+ in spherical coordinates, and the differential line ele- ments dr, r do, and r sin 8 d+. The differential surface ele- ments are: (r d8)(r sin 8 d+) perpendicular to the r direc- tion (lightest shading); (r sin 8 d+)(dr) perpendicular to the 0 direction (darkest shad- ing); and (dr)(r do) perpen- dicular to the 4 direction (intermediate shading). 5A.9 Further Comments on Vector-Tensor Notation 841 Similarly, for spherical coordinates: On the surface C$ = &: Ir: g(r, 8, C$&r2 dr sin B do The reader should try making sketches to show exactly what areas are described by each of the above six surface integrals. If the area of integration in a surface integral is not one of the surfaces of the coordi- nate system, then a book on differential and integral calculus should be consulted. sA.9 FURTHER COMMENTS ON VECTOR-TENSOR NOTATION The boldface notation used in this book is called Gibbs notation.' Also widely used is an- other notation referred to as Cartesian tensor n~tation.~ As shown in Table A.9-1, a few examples suffice to compare the two systems. The two outer columns are just two differ- ent ways of abbreviating the operations described explicitly in the middle column in Cartesian coordinates. The rules for converting from one system to another are as follows. To convert from expanded notation to Cartesian tensor notation: 1. Omit all summation signs (the \"Einstein summation convention\") 2. Omit all unit vectors and unit dyads. 3. Replace d/dx, by di. Table A.9-1 Expanded notation in terms of Gibbs notation unit vectors and unit dyads Cartesian tensor notation ' J. W. Gibbs, Vector Analysis, Dover Reprint, New York (1960). ' W. Prager, Mechanics of Continua, Ginn, Boston (1961). 842 Appendix A Vector and Tensor Notation To convert from Cartesian tensor notation to expanded notation: 1. Supply summation signs for all repeated indices. 2. Supply unit vectors and unit dyads for all nonrepeated indices; in each term of a tensor equation the unit vectors must appear in the same order in the unit dyads. 3. Replace di by d/dxi. The Gibbs notation is compact, easy to read, and devoid of any reference to a particular coordinate system; however, one has to know the meaning of the dot and cross opera- tions and the use of boldface symbols. The Cartesian tensor notation indicates the nature of the operations explicitly in Cartesian coordinates, but errors in reading or writing sub- scripts can be most aggravating. People who know both systems equally well prefer the Gibbs notation for general discussions and for presenting results, but revert to Cartesian tensor notation for doing proofs of identities. Occasionally matrix notation is used to display the components of vectors and ten- sors with respect to designated coordinate systems. For example, when v, = jy, vy = 0, v, = 0, Vv can be written in two ways: The second \"=\" is not really an \"equals\" sign, but has to be interpreted as \"may be dis- played as.\" Note that this notation is somewhat dangerous since one has to infer the unit dyads that are to be multiplied by the matrix element-in this case, 6,6,, tixsy, and so on. If we had used cylindrical coordinates, Vv would be represented by the matrix y sin 8 cos 6 - y sin2 6 (A.9-2) 0 where the matrix elements are understood to be multiplied by 6,6, 6,6e, and so on, and then added together. Despite the hazard of misinterpretation and the loose use of \"=,\" the matrix nota- tion enjoys widespread use, the main reason being that the \"dot\" operations correspond to standard matrix multiplication rules. For example, Of course such matrix multiplications are meaningful only when the components are re- ferred to the same unit vectors.

Notes: \" In Eqs.

C.1-8 to C.1-13, it may be convenient or necessary to change the lower limits of the integrals to some value other than zero. 5C.2 EXPANSIONS OF FUNCTIONS IN TAYLOR SERIES In physical problems we often need to describe a function y(x) in the neighborhood of some point x = x,. Then we expand the function y(x) in a \"Taylor series about the point x = xo\": 854 Appendix C Mathematical Topics The first term gives the value of the function at x = x,. The first two terms give a straight- line fit of the curve at x = x,. The first three terms give a parabolic fit of the curve at x = x, and so on. The Taylor series is often used when only the first several terms are needed to describe the function adequately.

Taylor series can also be written for functions of two or more variables. 5C.3 DIFFERENTIATION OF INTEGRALS (THE LEIBNIZ FORMULA) Suppose we have a function f (x, t) that depends on a space variable x and the time t. Then we can form the integral P(t) I(t) = I f(x, t) dx (C.3-1) dt) which is a function of t [see Fig. C.3-l(a)]. If we want to differentiate this function with respect to t without evaluating the integral, we can use the Leibniz formula Figure C.3-l(b) shows the meanings of the operations performed here: the first term on the right side gives the change in the integral because the function itself is changing with a(t) a(t + At) P(t) P(t + At) Fig. C.3-1. (a) The shaded area represents I(t) = J f (x, t)dx at an df) instant t (Eq. C.3-1). (b) To get dI/dt, we form the difference I(t + At) - I(t), divide by At, and then let At + 0. The three shaded areas correspond to the three terms on the right side of Eq. C.3-2. sC.4 The Gamma Function 855 time; the second term accounts for the gain in area as the upper limit is moved to the right; and the third term shows the loss in area as the lower limit is moved to the right. This formula finds many uses in science and engineering. The three-dimensional analog is given in Eq. A.5-5. 5C.4 THE GAMMA FUNCTION The gamma function appears frequently as the result of integrations: Several formulas for gamma functions are important: T(n + 1) = nT(n) (used to define T(n) for negative n) T(n) = (n - l)!' (when n is an integer greater than 0) The gamma function is displayed in Fig. C.4-1. + 4 n Fig. C.4-1.

Comparison of circular and hyperbolic functions. 5C.5 THE HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS . The hyperbolic sine (sinh x), the hyperbolic cosine (cosh x), and the hyperbolic tangent (tanh x) arise frequently in science and engineering problems. They are related to the hy- perbola in very much the same way that the circular functions are related to the circle (see Fig. C.5-1). The circular functions (sin x and cos x) are periodic, oscillating functions, whereas their hyperbolic analogs are not (see Fig. C.5-2). The hyperbolic functions are related to the exponential function as follows: cosh x = :(e\" + e-\"); sinh x = $(ex - e-\"1 (C.5-1,2) The corresponding relations for the circular functions are: One can derive a variety of standard relations for the hyperbolic functions, such as cosh2 x - sinh2 x = 1 cosh(x * y) = cosh x cosh y 2 sinh x sinh y sinh(x ? y) = sinh x cosh y 2 cosh x sinh y Fig. C.5-2.

The Taylor series expansion for the error function about x = 0 is given in Eq. C.2-4. It is also worth noting that erf (-x) = -erf x, and that by applying the Leibniz formula to Eq. C.6-1. The closely related function erfc x = 1 - erf x is called the \"complementary error function.''

Then we gave the rigorous results from the Chapman-Enskog development for dilute monatomic gases. In this ap- pendix we give a brief description of the Chapman-Enskog theory, just enough to show what the theory involves and to show how it gives a sense of unity to the subject of transport phenomena in gases. The reader who wishes to pursue the subject further can consult the standard references.' Dl THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION^ The starting point for the kinetic theory of low-density, nonreacting mixtures of monatomic gases is the Boltzmann equation for the velocity distribution function f& r, t). The quantity f&, r, t) dk,dr is the probable number of molecules of species a, which at time t are located in the volume element dr at position r, and have velocities within the range dib. about i.,. The Boltzmann equation, which describes how fa evolves with time, is ' J. H. Ferziger and H. G. Kaper, Mathematical Theory of Transport Processes in Gases, North-Holland, Amsterdam (1972); S.

Boltzmann, Sitzungsberichte Keiserl. Akad. der Wissenschaften, 66 (2), 275-370 (1872); C. Cercignani, The Boltzmann Equation and Its Applications, Springer-Verlag, New York (1988). C. F. Curtiss, J. Chem. Phys., 97,1416-1423,7679-7686 (1992), found it necessary to modify the Boltzmann equation to account for the possibility of orbiting pairs of molecules; the modification, important only at very low temperatures, was found to give much better agreement with the limited low-temperature experimental data. 5D.3 Molecular Expressions for the Fluxes 859 in which d/dr is identical to the V-operator, and d/d& is a similar operator involving ve- locities rather than positions. The quantity g, is the external force per unit mass acting on a molecule of species a, and J, is a very complicated five-fold integral term accounting for the change in f, because of molecular collisions. The J, term involves the intermolecu- lar potential energy function (e.g., the Lennard-Jones potential) and the details of the col- lision trajectories. The Boltzmann equation may be thought of as a continuity equation in the six-dimensional position-velocity space, and J, serves as a source term. The veloc- ity distribution function is \"normalized\" to the number density of species a; that is, Sf,(&, r, t)dra = nab t). 5D.2 THE EQUATIONS OF CHANGE When the Boltzmann equation is multiplied by some molecular property rl/,(r,) and then integrated over all molecular velocities, the general equation of change is obtained: An integration by parts is performed to get this result, and use is made of the fact that fa is zero at infinite velocities. If $, is a quantity that is conserved during a collision (see §0.3), then the term containing J, can be shown to be zero.' Now let be successively the conserved quantities for monatomic molecules: the mass ma, the momentum ma&, and the energy $m,(i, . r,). When these are substituted for +, into Eq. D.2-1, and when a sum over all species a is performed for the second and third of these, we get the equations of change for mass of a, momentum, and energy as follows: In the last of these equations the internal energy per unit volume is defined to be Thus we see that the equations of continuity, motion, and energy are direct conse- quences of the conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy discussed in Chapter 0. Equations D.2-2 to 4 should be compared with Eqs. 19.1-7,3.2-9, and Eq. (B) and foot- note (b) of Table 19.2-4, which were derived by continuum arguments. 5D.3 THE MOLECULAR EXPRESSIONS FOR THE FLUXES At the same time the equations of change are obtained, the molecular expressions for the fluxes are generated as integrals over the distribution function: at equilibrium j,<r, t) = m,S(r, - v)fadr, -0 (D.3-I) at equilibrium dr, t) = m$(& - v)( ib. - v)f,dL - a at equilibrium q(r, t) = $m,J.(ib, - v)'(+, - v)f,dr, - 0 a 860 Appendix D The Kinetic Theory of Gases In these expressions the fluxes involve integrals over the products of mass, momentum, and energy with the \"diffusion velocity\" (i; - v) of species a. Note the similarity be- tween the structure of these molecular fluxes (or \"diffusive fluxes\") and that of the con- vective fluxes of mass p,v, momentum pw, and kinetic energy ipv2v appearing in the equations of change, where v is the local instantaneous mass average velocity of the gas mixture. Thus the molecular fluxes represent the diffusive movement of mass, momen- tum, and energy above and beyond that described by the convective fluxes. Note also that the molecular theory automatically generates the molecular work term - (V [m . v]) in the energy equation. 5D.4 THE SOLUTION TO THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION If the gas mixture were at rest, the velocity distribution function would be given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function (known from equilibrium statistical mechan- ics). Then we would find, as shown in 5D.3, that j, = 0, that .rr = pi3 = n~T6, and that q = 0. The derivation of p = KT is given in Problem 1C.3. On the other hand, when there are concentration, velocity, and temperature gradi- ents, the distribution function is given as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution multi- plied by a \"correction factor\": where 4, << 1. In this expression n,, v, and T are functions of position r and time t. Since the deviations from equilibrium result from the temperature, velocity, and concen- tration gradients, $,(r,, r, t) can be represented, near equilibrium, as a linear function of the various gradients, in which the vector A,, the tensor B,, and the vectors Cap, all functions of r,, r, and t, are given as the solutions of integrodifferential equations.' The quantities d, are \"general- ized diffusional driving forces\" that include concentration gradients, the pressure gradi- ent, and external force differences, defined as in which x,, w,, and p, are the mole fraction, mass fraction, and partial pressure, respec- tively. Equation D.4-3, valid only for a mixture of monatomic gases at low density, is generalized for other fluids in the discussion of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes in 524.1. 5D.5 THE FLUXES IN TERMS OF THE TRANSPORT PROPERTIES When Eqs. D.4-1 to 3 are substituted into Eqs. D.3-1 to 3, we get the expressions for the fluxes in terms of d,, Vv, and VT: 5D.7 Concluding Comments 861 In these equations the transport properties appear: the viscosity p, the thermal conduc- tivity k, the multicomponent thermal diffusion coefficients D:, and the multicomponent Fick diffusivities Dap (the Bop are the Maxwell-Stefan diffusivities, closely related to the Dm&. Thus the kinetic theory predicts the \"cross effects\": the transport of mass resulting from a temperature gradient (thermal diffusion) and the transport of energy resulting from a concentration gradient (the diffusion-thermo effect). The pressure term in Eq. D.5-2 comes from the first term in the expansion in Eq. D.4- 1 (that is, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution), and the viscosity term comes from the second term (that is, the +, term containing the gradients). The kinetic theory of monatomic gases at low density predicts that the dilatational viscosity will be zero. 5D.6 THE TRANSPORT PROPERTIES IN TERMS OF THE INTERMOLECULAR FORCES The transport properties in Eqs. D.5-1 to 3 are given by the kinetic theory as complicated multiple integrals involving the intermolecular forces that describe binary collisions in the gas mixture. Once an expression has been chosen for the intermolecular force law (such as the Lennard-Jones (6-12) potential of Eq. 1.4-lo), these integrals can be evalu- ated numerically. For a pure gas, the three transport properties-self-diffusivity, viscos- ity, and thermal conductivity-are then given by: The dimensionless \"collision integrals\" a, = flk .= 1.1% contain all the information about the intermolecular forces and the binary collision dynamics. They are given in Table E.2 as functions of KT/&. If we set the collision integrals equal to unity, we then get the transport properties for a gas composed of rigid spheres. Thus the transport properties, needed in the equations of change, have been obtained from kinetic theory in terms of the two parameters u an< E of the in_termolecular potential energy function. From these expressions we get Pr = C,p/k = $(c,/C,) = $(;) = and Sc = p/p9 = z(fl,/o,) = $, these values being quite good for pure monatomic gases. sD.7 CONCLUDING COMMENTS The above discussion emphasizes the close connections among mass, momentum, and energy transport, and it is seen how all three transport phenomena can be explained in terms of a molecular theory for low-density, monatomic gases. It is also important to see that the continuum equations of continuity, motion, and energy can all be derived from one starting point-the Boltzmann equation-and that the molecular expressions for the fluxes and transport properties are generated in the process. In addition, the discussion of the dependence of the fluxes on the driving forces is very closely related to the irre- versible thermodynamics approach in Chapter 24. This appendix has dealt only with low-density, monatomic gases. Similar discus- C. F. Curtiss, J. Chem. Phys., 24,225-241 (1956); C. Muckenfuss and C. F. Curtiss, J. Chem.

D.3-2 and 3, but also contributions associ- ated with forces between molecules; for polymers, one has the latter contribution, but also additional forces within the polymer chain. In all of these theories one can derive the equations of change from an equation for a distribution function and then get formal expressions for the transport properties.
