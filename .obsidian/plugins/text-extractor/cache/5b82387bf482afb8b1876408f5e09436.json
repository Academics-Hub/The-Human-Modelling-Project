Fibroblasts (active) vs Fibrocytes (inactive)Adipocytes • Fat storing cells • Found in Ct of many organs • Tissue with a large population of adipocytes is called adipose connective tissue • Functions; o Cytoplasmic storage of lipids as neutral fats o Production of heat o Cushions and insulates skin and other organs (mainly adipose Ct) Images: OlyVIA Cytoplasm Nucleus Macrophages (histiocytes) • Derived from monocytes • Monocyte derived cells comprise a family of cells called the mononuclear phagocyte system (e.g. Kupffer cells, microglial cells, langerhans, osteoclasts) • Large cells with eccentrically located oval or kidney-shaped nucleus • Wide spectrum of morphologic features depending on function and location • Functions; – Removes dead cells, tissue debris and other particulate matter through phagocytosis – Immune function (antigen presentation) – Secretion of enzymes that breakdown ECM and growth factors Macrophages (in different regions in the body) Loose CT Bone Liver Engulfed particles within macrophages stained with India ink dye Osteoclasts at the edge of bone Bone Hepatocytes Kupffer cells in the liver sinusoids between hepatocytes Plasma cells • Derived from B-lymphocytes • Large, ovoid cells with abundant rER in cytoplasm (stains basophilic), spherical and eccentrically placed nucleus • Function: – Antibody production Images: OlyVIA RER N NUC Mast cells • Large ovoid or irregularly shaped cells with basophilic secretory granules in cytoplasm and centrally placed nucleus • Promote “immediate hypersensitivity reactions” when an antigen binds to the surface of Fc receptors • Functions: – Release many bioactive substances (through exocytosis) during inflammation (e.g. histamines, heparin and cytokines) – Play a role in innate immunity and tissue repair Images: OlyVIA Leukocytes • White blood cells • Make-up a population of wondering cells in CT • Function/s; – Immune response – Inflammation Images: OlyVIA and www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/histology_mh/blood.html Lymphocyte Name the five types of leukocytes shown below… Connective Tissue Proper: ECM Connective tissue (CT) Extracellular matrix (ECM)composed of Fibers and ground substance Solid matrix e.g. Bone and cartilage Fluid matrix e.g. Blood Cells Fibroblasts, adipocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, mast cells, leukocytes Semi-solid matrix e.g. CT proper Connective tissue fibers • Elongated structures formed from proteins • Mainly secreted by fibroblasts • Three main fibers; Collagen (H & E stain) Reticular (silver impregnation method)  Elastic (elastin stain) Collagen fibers Reticular fibers Elastic fibers (Not easily seen with H & E, require special stain!) CT Fibers: Collagen fibers • Key component of Ct and basement membranes • Resistant to shearing and tearing forces • Collagen fibers are the most abundant structural components of Ct • Flexible and has high tensile strength • Mainly secreted by fibroblasts, but may also be secreted by other cell types • Types of collagens fibers;  Fibrillar collagens (Type I, II, III): subunits that aggregate to form large fibrils  Type I: consists of fibers and constitutes 90% of all collagens in the body (most abundant) [e.g. organ capsule, dermis, tendons]  Type II: occurs as fibrils but does not form fibers or bundles [e.g. cartilage].  Type III: occurs as a thin network [e.g. forms reticular fibers in organs]  Basement membrane –forming collagens:  Sheet-forming collagens (Type IV)are major structural proteins of external laminae and epithelial basal laminae.  Linking/anchoring collagens (Type VII): short collagens that link fibrillar collagens to one another and to other components of the ECM Linking or Anchoring collagenFibrillar collagen Sheet forming collagen CT Fibers: Reticular fibers • Forms an extensive network of extremely thin fibers composed of collagen fibrils. • Provides a supportive framework of parenchymal secretory cells in various tissues and organs. • Found in reticular lamina of basement membrane, surrounds adipocytes, smooth muscle, nerve fibers and small blood vessels. Image: OlyVIA List three differences between reticular fibers and collagen fibers. CT Fibers: Elastic fibers • Thinner than collagen fibers. • Arranged in a branching pattern and form sparse networks interspersed with collagen bundles. • Facilitates stretching or distention in organs. • In large vessels forms fenestrated sheets called elastic lamellae. Images: OlyVIA Wavy, elastic lamellae in a large artery (aorta). Stained with elastin stain Wavy, elastic lamellae in a medium artery Connective Tissue Proper: Classification Arrangement of collagen fibers in ECM Amount of collagen fibers present in ECM Connective tissue proper Dense Regular Irregular Loose Irregular What could be the relationship between the location of this type of CT and abundance of cells which mostly perform an immune function be? Loose irregular (areolar) CT • Lies beneath epithelium in a layer called lamina propria and fills spaces between muscle and nerve fibers. • Contains abundant cells, loosely arranged fibers and abundant ground substance. • Contains lots of blood vessels and nerves. • Function: flexible and not resistant to stress Images: OlyVIA E Lamina propria Dense irregular CT • Found in the dermis of skin, organ capsules and submucosa layer of digestive tract. • Contains fewer cells, more collagen fibers (randomly interwoven) and little ground substance. • Function: provides resistance to stretching and distension from all directions. Images: OlyVIA NB: white spaces represent where ground substance is found Given the abundance of collagen fibers in this type of CT, which cell type do you expect to be abundant? Dense regular CT • Found in tendons, ligaments and aponeuroses. • Fibers and cells densely packed and arranged in an orderly manner (parallel) to provide maximum strength. • Contains very little ground substance • Function: provides resistance to prolonged stresses exerted in the same direction. • Poorly vascularised. Images: OlyVIA NB: white spaces represent where ground substance is found Relate the structure of this type of Ct to its location. Images: OlyVIA Loose irregular CT Dense irregular CT Dense regular CT Ground substance • Viscous, clear substance consisting of a hydrated mixture of proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and multiadhesive glycoproteins. • Occupies the spaces between cells and fibers. • Function: medium for exchange of nutrients and metabolic wastes between cells and the blood. Images: OlyVIA NB: Ground substance is extracted during tissue fixation and dehydration. Therefore, the arrows pointing to the white background represent spaces where ground substance was found. The white spaces will give you an indication of the amount of ground substance present in a particular area.
