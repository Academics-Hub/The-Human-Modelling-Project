Cutaneous Innervation • Cutaneous branches of the obturator nerve • Innervate the medial part of the back of thigh in the upper part. • Medial branches of the anterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh • Innervate the medial part of the back of thigh in the lower part. • Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh • sends twigs to the posterior aspect of thigh in the upper part. Muscles of the Posterior Thigh • They are called the hamstring muscles • The hamstring muscles are: • Biceps femoris (long head) • Semitendinosus. • Semimembranosus. • They share similar features as follows • Origin- ischial tuberosity. • Insertion- either the tibia or fibula • Innervation: Sciatic nerve (L4-S3). • Action: flexors of the knee and extensors of the hip joint Biceps femoris • This muscle has two heads—long head and short head. • Origin • Long head: • lower medial part of the upper quadrilateral area of the ischial tuberosity. • Short head: • lower part of the lateral lip of the linea aspera and upper two-third of the lateral supracondylar line. • Insertion • By a conjoint tendon to the head of fibula in front of the styloid process. • Before insertion the tendon is either folded around or split by the fibular collateral ligament. • Innervation • Long head- tibial part of the sciatic nerve. • Short head- common peroneal part of the sciatic nerve.

Actions of the Hamstrings • Acting from above the hamstrings flex the knee joint • Acting from below they extend the hip joint. • On the semi-flexed knee, • the biceps femoris is a lateral rotator of the leg • while semimembranosus and semitendinosus are medial rotators of the leg. Blood Supply to the Posterior Thigh • Profunda femoris artery and its perforating branches • These pierce the adductor magnus and give off large branches to the hamstrings and the overlying fat and skin. • Inferior gluteal artery • Supply of the upper part of the hamstrings. • Popliteal artery • Supply the lower part • These arteries form a series of anastomoses along the back of the thigh. • The highest is the cruciate anastomosis. Clinical Significance of Hamstrings • Muscle Strain • Occurs due to excessive stretch or tearing of the muscle fibres. • They are often seen athletes involved in running or kicking sports. • It can be accompanied with a haematoma which is usually contained by the overlying fascia lata. • Treatment of any muscle strain should utilise the RICE protocol – rest, ice, compression and elevation. Clinical Significance of Hamstrings • Avulsion Fracture of the Ischial Tuberosity • In an avulsion fracture of the ischial tuberosity, the hamstring tendons ‘tear off’ a piece of the ischial tuberosity. • Such an injury usually occurs in sports that require rapid contraction and relaxation of the muscles – such as sprinting, football and hurdling. Popliteal Fossa • The popliteal fossa is a diamond-shaped hollow on the back of the knee joint. • It becomes prominent when the knee is flexed. • It provides a passage for main vessels and nerves from the thigh to the leg. • It corresponds to the cubital fossa of the forearm.

The popliteal Lymph Nodes • They are about six lymph nodes in the popliteal fossa. • Found within the fatty connective tissue of the popliteal fossa. • They receive superficial lymph vessels from the lateral side of the foot and leg; • these accompany the small saphenous vein into the popliteal fossa. • They also receive lymph from • The knee joint • The deep lymph vessels accompanying the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. Clinical Significance: Swelling in the Popliteal Fossa • Swelling in the popliteal is mainly caused by the following • Baker’s Cyst (popliteal cyst) • Inflammation and swelling of the semimembranosus bursa – a fluid filled sac found in the knee joint. • It usually arises in conjunction with osteoarthritis of the knee. • Whilst it usually self-resolves, the cyst can rupture and produce symptoms similar to deep vein thrombosis. • Popliteal Aneurysm • The popliteal fascia is tough and non-extensible, • so an aneurysm of the popliteal artery can lead to compression of the tibial. • The major features of tibial nerve compression are: • Weakened or absent plantar flexion • Paraesthesia of the foot and posterolateral leg https://standardofcare.com/bakerss-cyst-popliteal-cyst/ https://www.gujarathospital.in/vascular-surgery/popliteal-aneurysm.html Common Peroneal Nerve Injury • The common peroneal nerve is extremely vulnerable to injury as it winds around the neck of the fibula. • At this site, it is exposed to direct trauma or is involved in fractures of the upper part of the fibula. • Injury to the common peroneal nerve causes footdrop. Posterior Leg • The posterior of the leg is also called calf. • It corresponds to the front of the forearm. • It is bulkiest of the three compartments of the leg because it contains • large powerful antigravity muscles (e.g., gastrocnemius and soleus), which raise the heel during walking. • It is continuous superiorly with the popliteal fossa and inferiorly with the sole of the foot.
