Her blood pressure was 166/68 mm Hg. She had marked tremor and her ankle, knee, biceps and triceps reflexes were considerably increased. She also had eyes that appeared to protrude excessively similar to that shown in the following photograph of adifferent patient. Patient 2, 54 year old was brought by her husband to see the attending health professional. He complained that over the last few years his wife's mental ability had slowed down. The patient's main complaint was that she was unable to tolerate cold weather and that she was always tired and lethargic. On examination she appeared as shown in the photograph on the left side (compare this with the picture of her after therapy), she talked very slowly, she sounded hoarse and she was slow to respond to questions, often requiring the question being asked a second time before she answered. Her heart rate was 48 beats/minute, her blood pressure 122/86 mm Hg, her ankle, knee, biceps and triceps reflexes were all markedly decreased, and her ankles appeared as indicated in the photograph below (but the changes were not as marked in the patient)","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
