Cortisol effects connective tissue, muscle, bone Eg. Hypothalamus post.pituitary ADH What is an endocrine system • One of body’s communication systems • Controls & directs adaptive physiological & metabolic responses. • Nervous & Endocrine systems are integrated Basic introduction to endocrine physiology Definition of HORMONE: Substance secreted into BLOOD by specialized cells (ENDOCRINE GLAND) in response to specific stimulus (neural or blood borne). Amount of HORMONE released is generally SMALL but depends on the strength of the stimulus. Function of HORMONES: Communication: • To maintain internal homeostasis despite changes in external environment eg. Plasma glucose concentrations after a meal • To maintain internal homoeostasis despite changes in function of body eg. exercise or sleep • Reproduction HORMONES: • Bind to receptors to produce effects • Receptors are specific for a hormone • Location of receptors determines where hormone will produce its effects (ie. which tissues are affected) eg. ACTH receptors in adrenal cortex; Cortisol receptors in most tissues Endocrine glands Thyroid Gland Thymus Pancreas (Islets of Langerhans) Hypothalamus Pituitary Gland (Hypophysis) Parathyroid Glands Adrenal Glands Ovaries (females) Testes (males) Gonads Mechanism of hormones Gland Target tissue Input / disturbance Hormone released Response •Regulates growth & replication •Regulates synthesis & degradation of nucleic acids & proteins •Regulates enzyme activity Differences in HOW effect is produced • LOCATION of Receptor • TYPE of Hormone Classification of hormones • Protein & polypeptide hormones • Pituitary glands • Pancreas etc. • Steroid hormones • Sex hormones • Adrenal cortex • Hormones derived from tyrosine • Thyroid hormones • Adrenal medulla Classification of hormones • Water soluble (hydrophilic) • Stored in vesicles • Circulate free in blood • Soluble in plasma – no carrier proteins • Exposed to circulating enzymes • Short half-life (secs to mins) • ‘Cannot be taken orally’ • Bind to cell membrane receptors Target cell membrane Polypeptide / Protein Classification of hormones • Lipid soluble (hydrophobic) • No vesicle storage • Synthesized from cholesterol • Circulate bound to carrier proteins in blood (inactive) • Long half-life (hours to days) • Can be administered orally • Bind to plasma membrane, cytosolic or nuclear receptors Steroid Target cell nucleus Classification of hormones • Thyroid hormones • Lipid soluble (hydrophobic) • Circulate bound thyroid binding globulin • Long half-life (hours to days) • Can be administered orally • Bind to nucleus receptors Tyrosine derivatives Thyroid Hormones / catecholamines Target cell nucleus • Catecholamines / dopamine • Hydrophilic • No binding proteins • Bind to plasma membrane Mechanism of action Target cell membrane Polypeptide / Protein Activates specific Enzyme G GTP ATP AC cAMP Activates Protein Kinase Cell’s response 2nd messenger cAMP DAG +IP3 Ca2+ Intracellular enzymes: AC Tyrosine kinase Protein kinase C Phospholipase C phosphorylation Mechanism of action Steroid Target cell nucleus DNA RNA polymerase mRNA precursor Mature mRNA transcription excision & splicing Synthesis/Activation of specific Protein/Enzyme translation activation Synthesis Polypeptide or Protein Hormone Mitochondrion Lysozyme (degradation) SER / Golgi apparatus Secretory granules exocytosis DNA RNA polymerase RNA translation transcription Nucleus synthesis & packaging RER storage Peptide Hormone Blood protein Synthesis Steroid Hormone Cholesterol Desmolase Pregnenolone Specific enzymes present in cell determine which Steroid Hormone is produced (hydroxylation) Carrier protein Nucleus Golgi apparatus Steroid Hormone (rate-limiting step) Blood Mitochondrion Lysozyme (degradation)Cholesterol Sensitivity of hormone receptors Receptor Up Regulation Receptor Down Regulation Low H concentration→ Receptors Time High H concentration→ Receptors Control of hormone release Gland Target tissue Input / disturbance Hormone released Product Brain Hypothalamus Anterior Pituitary TRH TSH T3 & T4 Thyroid gland Blood  T3 & T4 concentration Secretory rhythmsWATER SOLUBLE PEPTIDES Growth H Insulin Parathyroid H Prolactin POLYPEPTIDES ACTH ADH Glucagon Oxytocin MSH Hypothalamic H’s (somatostatin, TRH, GnRH, CRH,GRH, PRH, PIF) GLYCOPROTEINS FSH LH TSH LIPID SOLUBLE STEROIDS Oestrogens Glucocorticoids (cortisol) Mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) Progestins (progesterone) Testosterone TYROSINE DERIVATIVES Thyroxine (T4) Triiodothyronine (T3) ACTH= adrenocorticotropic H ADH = antidiuretic H MSH = melanocyte stimulating H TRH = thyrotropin releasing H GnRH = gonadotropin releasing H CRH = corticotropic releasing H GRH = growth H releasing H PRH = prolactin releasing H PIF = prolactin inhibiting factor FSH = follicle stimulating H LH = luteinizing H TSH = thyroid stimulating H Endocrine Disorders • Hypofunction: • Loss of gland (eg.
