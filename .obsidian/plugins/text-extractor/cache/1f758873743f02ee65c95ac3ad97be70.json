Glucose uptake satu- ration explains glucose kinetics proﬁles measured by different tests. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 311: E346 –E357, 2016. First pub- lished May 31, 2016; doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00045.2016.—It is known that for a given insulin level glucose clearance depends on glucose concentration. However, a quantitative representation of the concom- itant effects of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia on glucose clear- ance, necessary to describe heterogeneous tests such as euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps and oral tests, is lacking. Data from ﬁve studies (123 subjects) using a glucose tracer and including all the above tests in normal and diabetic subjects were collected. A math- ematical model was developed in which glucose utilization was represented as a Michaelis-Menten function of glucose with constant Km and insulin-controlled Vmax, consistently with the basic notions of glucose transport. Individual values for the model parameters were estimated using a population approach. Tracer data were accurately ﬁtted in all tests. The estimated Km was 3.88 (2.83–5.32) mmol/l [median (interquartile range)]. Median model-derived glucose clear- ance at 600 pmol/l insulin was reduced from 246 to 158 ml·min \u0002 1·m \u0002 2 when glucose was raised from 5 to 10 mmol/l. The model reproduced the characteristic lack of increase in glucose clear- ance when moderate hyperinsulinemia was accompanied by hyper- glycemia. In all tests, insulin sensitivity was inversely correlated with BMI, as expected (R2 \u0003 0.234, P \u0003 0.0001). In conclusion, glucose clearance in euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps and oral tests can be described with a unifying model, consistent with the notions of glucose transport and able to reproduce the suppression of glucose clearance due to hyperglycemia observed in previous studies. The model may be important for the design of reliable glucose homeosta- sis simulators. uptake saturation; glucose metabolism; insulin sensitivity; glucose tracers; mathematical models THE ACTION OF INSULIN on in vivo glucose kinetics has been subject of extensive studies in the 1970s and 1980s, particu- larly with the introduction of the glucose clamp technique and glucose tracers. These studies have demonstrated that, at steady state, glucose utilization is a sigmoidal function of insulin concentration. Furthermore, for a given insulin level, glucose utilization does not increase in proportion to glucose concen- tration: at higher concentrations, utilization is lower than that predicted by a proportional relationship. This implies that at any given insulin concentration glucose clearance, which is the ratio between glucose utilization and concentration, is a de- creasing function of glucose concentration. While the glucose clamp conditions have been widely investigated, in dynamic conditions such as oral glucose loading or mixed meal inges- tion the impact of the dependency of glucose clearance on glucose concentration is not known. Elucidating this aspect is important for understanding glucose homeostasis. Neverthe- less, most of the mathematical models of glucose homeostasis have ignored this phenomenon; in the few models accounting for it [e.g., the model by Dalla Man et al. (11)], its mathemat- ical description has been postulated but not experimentally validated on appropriate data. This limits a full understanding of the control of glucose tolerance and the development of reliable models capable of predicting the outcome of therapeu- tic interventions. Exploring the dependency of glucose clearance on glucose concentration is made difﬁcult by the need of complex exper- imental procedures (44). To overcome this limitation, we sought to exploit the results of several studies testing various and complementary aspects of glucose kinetics and to employ population modeling to interpret all data within a unique framework. The model was based on established notions concern- ing glucose kinetics and utilization and in particular accounted for saturation of glucose uptake due to the kinetics characteristics of insulin-dependent glucose transport into the cells. Our results indicate that a single model of the relationship between glucose utilization and glucose and insulin concentrations can explain all our experimental observations consistently. We show for the ﬁrst time that the same physiological mechanisms may underlie different tests such as the clamp, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the mixed-meal test (MTT), and we provide a mathematical model capable of describing these phenomena accurately. MATERIALS AND METHODS The data used in this analysis were obtained from ﬁve different studies of glucose kinetics and insulin action: a three-step hypergly- cemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (HGclamp, n \u0003 8) (41); a two-step isoglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (ISOclamp, n \u0003 8) (34); a paired OGTT and euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp in the same vol- unteers (OGTT/clamp, n \u0003 8); a MTT (n \u0003 91) (16); and a paired MMT and hyperglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp in the same subjects (MTT/clamp, n \u0003 8) (25). Glucose and insulin ranges in the tests were wide (3.3–24.7 mmol/l and 12-10,584 pmol/l, respectively). In all tests, a glucose tracer was used. The subjects’ characteristics are reported in Table 1 for each study and for the whole population. Figure 1 shows the mean (\u0004SE) proﬁles for plasma glucose and insulin concentration during each test. Protocol Address for reprint requests and other correspondence: R.

Glucose kinetics was represented through a circulatory model (27, 28, 32). In the model, a heart-lung block is interconnected with a periphery block lumping all the re- maining tissues (Fig. 2). Glucose uptake was considered negligible in the heart-lung block and was modeled as a function of insulin and glucose concentration in the periphery block. A detailed description of the circulatory model is provided in APPENDIX B. Model of glucose uptake. The transport-mediated rate of glucose uptake in the peripheral tissues, \u0002(t), was represented as a Michaelis- Menten function of glucose concentration at the site of transport, X(t): Fig. 1. Mean (\u0004SE as error bars or gray areas) measured plasma glucose and insulin concentrations and model-predicted glucose clearance in the 5 studies, as shown in the ﬁgure labels (see MATERIALS AND METHODS for abbreviations). Data were partially published previously (41, 34, 16, 25); see APPENDIX A for details. The data of the 2 studies with paired tests (OGTT/clamp and MTT/clamp) are shown in separate panels for the oral test and the clamp, as indicated by the underlined text in the ﬁgure label.

This function yields a gradual saturation of glucose utilization as glucose levels increase, as expected for glucose transport. KmG was considered to be constant, while Vmax(t) was assumed to be a function of insulin concentration at the site of action, Z(t), according to a Hill equation: Vmax(t) \u0003 Vmax,0 \u0004 EmaxZ(t)\u0005 Kml\u0005 \u0004 Z(t)\u0005 (2) where Vmax,0 is the maximal glucose uptake at zero insulin at the site of action, and Emax, KmI, and \u0005 are the Hill function parameters. Glucose and insulin concentrations at the site of action were described as delayed plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, respectively. Each delayed concentration was computed through a transit compartment model with two compartments (equations in APPENDIX B), i.e., through the series of two monoexponential delays with the same half-lives (t1/2,G and t1/2,I, respectively). Glucose clearance, cl(t), was deﬁned as the ratio between glucose uptake, \u0002(t), and glucose concentration at the site of action, X(t): cl(t) \u0003 Vmax(t) KmG \u0004 X(t) .(3) Distributions of individual parameters. For each model parameter, the individual value was assumed to derive from a probability distri- bution over the population, as required by the population approach adopted for parameters estimation. The distributions were assumed to be lognormal for the parameters KmG, Emax, KmI, \u0005, and t1/2,I and for the glucose volume of distribution V. Logit distributions in the interval from zero to one were assumed for the individual parameters of the circulatory model that are constrained in this range. A unique value of Vmax,0 was assumed in the whole population (see below); t1/2,G was empirically ﬁxed to 0.7 min, as the model was almost insensitive to moderate changes of its value. In order to reach convergence during parameter estimation, the values for the parameters of the circulatory model estimated in the subjects from the MTT/clamp study had to be constrained to the medians of the probability distributions. Finally, in the OGTT/clamp and MTT/clamp studies, the individual parameter values were assumed to be the same in the two tests. Parameters estimation and model development. The whole model, comprehensive of the description of the probability distributions for the individual parameters, was implemented using the Monolix soft- ware, version 4.3.2 (26). Parameters were estimated by ﬁtting the model to glucose tracer concentrations from all tests and subjects. Measured glucose and insulin concentrations were linearly interpo- lated and used as inputs of the model. The adopted population (or mixed-effect) approach ﬁrst identiﬁes the medians (called “typical values”) and variances of the parameter distributions according to the maximum likelihood approach. Thereafter, the identiﬁed distributions are used as priors to determine maximum a posteriori estimates of the individual parameter values. Different variants of the model were tested with the objective of reducing the likelihood of the data, i.e., simultaneously improving the data ﬁt and minimizing the variances of the parameter distributions and the number of model parameters. In particular, the investigation focused on different parameterizations of the model equations, on different descriptions of insulin action (Eq. 2), and on the correlations between the parameter distributions. Moreover, we found that the variability of Vmax,0 collapsed to zero, and thus a unique value for all the subjects was used. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity estimates. The partici- pants were divided into three glucose tolerance classes according to the ADA 1997 criteria: type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, subjects with either impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose (i.e., impaired glucose regulation, IGR), and subjects with none of the previous impairments (i.e., normal glucose regulation, NGR). The last category was used for subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and for those in whom 2-h glucose was not available but fasting glucose was normal. Insulin sensitivity was computed as the glucose clearance at a steady-state glucose concentration of 5 mmol/l and two insulin concentrations representing the typical concentration of a euglycemic clamp (600 pmol/l) and the mean basal insulin in the NGR subjects of this analysis (71 pmol/l). These two insulin sensitivity indexes were derived in each subject from the individual parameter estimates and denoted as ISclamp and ISb, respectively. Assessment of the role of body mass index and study. The individ- ual body mass index (BMI) and the study were investigated as possible statistically signiﬁcant covariates/factors explaining the vari- ability of insulin sensitivity and of the individual values of the model parameters. N-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for this purpose, after logarithmic transformation of the involved variables, and after adjusting for the glucose tolerance status, and for age and sex when signiﬁcant. Impact of uptake saturation on glucose levels. A prototypical glucose homeostasis model was implemented for assessing the impact on glucose tolerance of using a saturable function for glucose uptake (Eq. 1) compared with a linear one. The model included the glucose kinetics model presented here, a \u0006-cell model (31), and a model for insulin kinetics (42). A detailed description of the homeostasis model is provided in APPENDIX C. The model was used to simulate two different conditions: an OGTT in a nondiabetic subject and a constant exogenous insulin infusion (310 pmol·min \u0002 1·m \u0002 2) in a T2D patient. The simulation was performed using both a saturable and a linear function for glucose uptake, and the two outcomes were compared. RESULTS Goodness of ﬁt and model parameters. Table 2 shows the estimated typical values and inter-individual variability for the parameters of the model of glucose uptake (Eqs. 1 and 2), the half-lives of glucose and insulin concentrations at the site of action, and the glucose volume of distribution.

The relative standard errors on the typical parameter estimates, evaluated by stochastic approximation, were less than 10% and those on the variability estimates were less than 30%. The ability of the model to predict tracer concentrations in each test is shown in Fig. 3. On average, the model-predicted curves matched the experimental data closely with no system- atic bias. Similarly, the model residuals, i.e., the difference between the measured and the predicted tracer concentration, were distributed around zero (not shown). Mean residuals were signiﬁcantly different from zero only at very few time points, occurring mostly during the MTT/clamp study. When all the measurements and tests together were considered, the mean residual was less than 0.0001 mmol/l and its standard deviation was 0.014 mmol/l; the latter implies, relatively to the mean data, a coefﬁcient of variation of 8%, which is of the same magnitude as the expected error on the tracer concentration measurement. This means that the model error could be mostly explained by the experimental error. Glucose clearance. The time course of glucose clearance as predicted by the model (Fig. 1, bottom plot in each panel) illustrates how higher glucose concentrations can reduce the stimulating effect of hyperinsulinemia on glucose clearance; such effect was particularly evident during the ﬁrst step of the HGclamp, where clearance failed to increase despite the rise in insulin, and at the beginning of the oral tests, where the increase in clearance was delayed compared with insulin con- centration or clearance even decreased. The suppression of glucose clearance due to uptake satura- tion with increasing glucose levels (Eq. 1) is depicted in Fig. 4: the steady-state relationship between glucose clearance and glucose concentration, as predicted by the model at an insulin concentration of 600 pmol/l, is shown for each subject in the different studies. When glucose concentration is raised from 5 to 10 mmol/l, glucose clearance is predicted to be reduced from 246 (185–348) ml·min \u00021·m \u00022 to 158 (118 –218) ml·min \u00021·m \u00022 [median (interquartile range) from the individual curves]; the decrement averages 89 (66 –130) ml·min \u00021·m \u00022. The effect of insulin on the model parameter Vmax (Eq. 2), representing maximal glucose uptake (Eq. 1), is depicted in Fig. 5: the individual model-derived curves show the variety of predicted sigmoidal effects and indicate that the HGclamp and ISOclamp are the two studies providing most of the data to identify the saturation of the insulin effect on glucose clear- ance, due to the higher insulin levels. In the other studies, Vmax is extrapolated according to the population distribution of this parameter. Role of BMI and study. The investigation of the effects of BMI and study on the model parameters showed that KmG and KmI were positively correlated with BMI (P \u0007 1e-7 and P \u0003 0.0047, respectively; adjusted R2 \u0003 0.218 and 0.148, respec- tively), and Emax was inversely correlated with BMI (P \u0003 0.0006, adjusted R2 \u0003 0.241; see Table D1 in APPENDIX D).

(P \u0003 0.024), although the BMI-adjusted differences between studies were modest (see Table D2 in APPENDIX D). The model-derived estimates of a classical insulin sensitivity index from the euglycemic clamp, ISclamp, and of standardized basal clearance, ISb, were inversely correlated with BMI (P \u0003 0.0001 and P \u0007 1e-7, respectively; adjusted R 2 \u0003 0.234 and 0.219, respectively; see Table D1 in APPENDIX D). The study did not affect ISclamp or ISb signiﬁcantly. Impact of uptake saturation on glucose levels. The simula- tion of an OGTT in a nondiabetic subject, using a saturable or a linear function for glucose uptake, predicted a maximum plasma glucose concentration of 9.38 vs. 8.63 mmol/l, respec- tively, and a mean plasma glucose concentration over the ﬁrst 180 min of 7.73 vs. 7.06 mmol/l, respectively (Fig. 6A). A 310 pmol·min\u00021·m\u00022 insulin infusion in a T2D patient with a fasting baseline plasma glucose of 10.0 mmol/l was predicted to result in a steady-state plasma glucose concentration of 6.33 mmol/l vs. 7.37 mmol/l, respectively (Fig. 6B). DISCUSSION The main result is that, despite a remarkable variety of experimental conditions, a unique mathematical model of glu- cose kinetics and insulin action was able to describe accurately and consistently the data from all subjects and tests. Moreover, the distributions of the individual parameter estimates were substantially homogeneous in the different studies; the differ- ences in KmG and Emax, although statistically signiﬁcant, were small and did not undermine the consistency of the model. Two speciﬁc features of the analysis are noteworthy. First, the model described both the intravenous and oral glucose tests with the same parameter distributions. Furthermore, when both oral and intravenous tests were performed in the same subject, Fig. 4.

These results imply that the mechanisms underlying glucose uptake after oral and intravenous glucose administration can be described by the same model, a ﬁnding never reported before. Second, the data set included tests (the hyperglycemic hy- perinsulinemic clamp and the oral stimulations) in which, in the presence of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia failed to increase glucose clearance as would be expected if glucose clearance were unaffected by the glucose levels. This phenom- enon, conﬁrmed by a previous independent analysis using a traditional tracer analysis approach (29), is well accounted for by the model of glucose utilization. We observed a less accurate ﬁt in the clamp data of the MTT/clamp study, as the predicted tracer concentration was oscillating around the measured values while the overall steady-state value was correctly captured. This oscillating deviation is unlikely to have originated from an inadequate model formulation. The lack of insulin sampling in the ﬁrst 30 min may have limited the accuracy of the model prediction. It is also possible that transient variations during the clamp occurred for phenomena not related to the mechanisms we are describing (e.g., neurally mediated effects). Our model, like all models in this area, necessarily involves simpliﬁcations. We used a circulatory model for glucose ki- netics as a more physically oriented approach compared with compartmental models (27, 30). However, we did not attempt to describe the heterogeneity of organs lumped in the periphery block; therefore, the glucose utilization model does not make any explicit distinction between the various glucose-utilizing tissues (e.g., insulin-dependent and insulin-independent utili- zation). Nevertheless, our description is compatible with the coexistence of insulin-dependent and -independent utilization, as it assumes only that the two processes are saturable pro- cesses with similar Michaelis-Menten constants. Alternative assumptions could not be tested due to the lack of infrabasal insulin values, but our assumption can be justiﬁed by the similar afﬁnities for glucose of GLUT4 and GLUT1, the main transporters involved in insulin-dependent and insulin-inde- pendent utilization, respectively (see below). Despite the simpliﬁed description of glucose kinetics, the agreement with the previous studies is remarkable. The exis- tence of saturation phenomena for glucose uptake in muscle cells was hypothesized a few decades ago (12) and clearly demonstrated in the whole body and in the forearm (44). The range of insulin and glucose concentrations levels covered in our studies is comparable with the conditions explored in previous studies; still, our analysis shows that a constant (i.e., not dependent on insulin) Michaelis-Menten parameter (KmG in our mathematical model) is sufﬁcient to describe the data. This concept, implying the same relative reduction in glucose clear- ance with hyperglycemia at all insulin levels, was anticipated by Fink et al. (19) and can be explained by the fact that under hyperinsulinemic conditions increased glucose entry into mus- cle is mainly due to the greater number of functioning GLUTs at the cell membrane (8). This corresponds to a constant KmG and a Vmax dependent on insulin concentration, as in our model. Other analyses have proposed different representations of this process (4, 12, 44). However, our model assumes for glucose utilization a saturable function of glucose and insulin concen- trations at the site of action (i.e., delayed with respect to plasma concentrations), whereas the cited studies were based on the measured plasma concentrations. Moreover, the experimental procedures and the methods used to derive glucose uptake are different. Finally, the strength of our analysis is the use of individual estimates for KmG, whereas previous studies com- puted a single Km value for each insulin level by regressing mean or pooled glucose utilization against glucose levels. Although the model does not have the ambition to strictly identify the Michaelis-Menten representation of glucose utili- zation with glucose transport, the interquartile range of the estimated individual values for KmG, 2.83–5.32 mmol/l, is consistent with estimates of the afﬁnity of the glucose trans- porters for glucose. Among this transporter family, GLUT4 is the main insulin-sensitive member, with highest expression in different tissues, including brown and white adipose tissue and Fig. 6.

GLUT1 is the most ubiqui- tously distributed GLUT isoform; it is involved in basal glu- cose uptake by most cells and cooperates with GLUT4 in insulin-sensitive tissues (45). The reported values for GLUT4’s and GLUT1’s Km are rather variable, ranging between 2 and 5 mmol/l (8) and 5 and 6 mmol/l (23, 43) for GLUT4 and between 2 and 5 mmol/l (8) and 3 and7 mmol/l (45) for GLUT1. The similarity between our KmG estimates and the Km values reported for glucose transporters suggests that saturable glucose transport is the mechanism underlying the observed dependence of whole body glucose clearance on glucose con- centration. In this respect, our study is more consistent with the in vitro data than the in vivo data by Yki-Järvinen et al. (44). Maximal glucose uptake at a given insulin concentration, Vmax, was assumed to depend on the insulin concentration at the site of action through a sigmoidal function with maximum value Emax. The shape of this function and the individual estimated values for its parameters correspond to those re- ported in previous studies on the effect of insulin on glucose uptake (2, 7, 19, 24, 37, 40). In particular, our glucose uptake model could accurately reproduce the individual data provided by Kolterman et al. (24) for both obese and nonobese subjects with glucose tolerance ranging from NGT to T2D (see Fig. D1 in APPENDIX D). Using the distributions estimated from our experiments as ﬁxed prior probability distributions for the individual parameters values, all the individual estimates of Emax, KmI, and \u0005 obtained from Kolterman et al. data were in the range of those estimated from our data. As further validation, we investigated the relationship be- tween BMI and insulin sensitivity, as assessed by the model- predicted glucose clearance at 5 mmol/l glucose and 600 pmol/l insulin, a typical parameter of the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp. The expected negative correlation was reproduced, in accord with previous analyses on insulin sensitivity (17), and was homogeneous across all studies. Interestingly, the same relationship was also detected between BMI and the model-predicted glucose clearance at 5 mmol/l glucose and 71 pmol/l insulin, which is an estimate of insulin sensitivity under standardized basal conditions. The effect of BMI on the model parameters was also investigated. BMI was found to be positively correlated with KmI, the afﬁnity of glucose uptake to insulin concentration, as expected (1, 6, 7, 14, 24, 34), and with KmG, the afﬁnity of glucose uptake to glucose concentration. Baron et al. (3) did not detect signiﬁcant differences in the insulin Km values of obese and lean subjects. However, comparison between the two studies is difﬁcult because in our analysis most of the subjects (79%) had BMI above the obesity threshold used by Baron et al. (27 kg/m2). Finally, in agreement with other work (1, 3, 6, 14, 24), we found an inverse correlation between BMI and Emax, the saturation level of glucose uptake produced by maximal insulin concentration. The speciﬁc role of the glucose tolerance status was unclear in this study. In conditions standardized for glucose, insulin, and BMI, insulin sensitivity (ISclamp) tended to be lower in diabetic patients than in normal subjects in the MTT/clamp study, but signiﬁcance could not be achieved due to the small number of subjects. In the MTT study, a signiﬁcant difference was not detected, possibly because of the mild diabetic status. While several studies have shown lower insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients (e.g., Ref. 3), this defect was not always detected, particularly in well-controlled, uncomplicated diabe- tes (35), as in our case. In contrast to a rather homogeneous distribution of BMI across the study groups, glucose tolerance was unbalanced, and this heterogeneity could have prevented the detection of differences. A similar unbalance concerned sex, for which we did not ﬁnd the insulin sensitivity difference previously reported (21). On the other hand, the lack of dependence of insulin sensitivity on age (9, 10, 18, 33, 36) was observed also in this analysis. Our study shows for the ﬁrst time that saturation of glucose uptake may have a sizeable impact on glucose tolerance. In a simulation of a typical OGTT, compared with a model in which hyperglycemia does not suppress glucose clearance, our model predicts signiﬁcantly higher glucose values (\b0.7 mmol/l) despite compensatory insulin hypersecretion. An even greater impact was observed in the simulation of the effect of an exogenous insulin infusion in a diabetic patient: steady-state glycemia was 1.0 mmol/l lower than when no glucose uptake saturation was assumed. Although we do not provide an experimental proof of validity of these model predictions, the simulations emphasize the potential importance of the de- scribed phenomenon and suggest that it should be taken into account, for example when modeling glucose homeostasis or comparing conditions in which glucose levels differ. The proposed model may have future applications in areas such as the development of more accurate insulin sensitivity indexes from tests other than the glucose clamp and for the study of insulin sensitivity in circumstances in which the glucose clamp would not be feasible or appropriate. Furthermore, the model may be an essential component of more accurate glucose homeostasis sim- ulators, as exempliﬁed by our prototype. In summary, our analysis shows that glucose kinetics in euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps and oral tests can be described by a single mechanism, consistent with the notions of glucose transport. Our mathematical model of glucose uptake reproduces speciﬁc and relevant features observed with concomitant hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, in particu- lar the glucose-induced reduction of glucose clearance. Finally, this model could allow better understanding of glucose metab- olism and improved glucose homeostasis simulators. APPENDIX A. EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOLS AND ANALYTIC PROCEDURES Three-Step Hyperglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp (HGclamp) The experimental procedures have been in part described previ- ously (41). This analysis includes 8 of the 13 subjects participating in the original study (nondiabetic subjects with complete tracer data). Experimental protocol. After an overnight fast, a primed (23.6 \u0004 2.4 \tmol/kg) constant (0.22 \u0004 0.02 \tmol·min \u0002 1·kg \u0002 1) infusion of [6,6- 2H2]glucose was started and was continued for a 120-min basal period. Subsequently (from time t \u0003 0), three consecutive 30-min square-wave steps of hyperglycemia were produced (on average 2.9, 5.8, and 10.6 mmol/l above baseline). Plasma glucose concentrations were maintained at the desired plateau by means of a variable 20% glucose infusion according to the glucose clamp technique (13). Each glucose infusion period was preceded by a priming dose to reach the target glucose level faster. The glucose infusate was enriched with [6,6- 2H2]glucose to minimize changes in plasma [6,6- 2H2]glucose enrich- ment. At t \u0003 90, an intravenous bolus of5gof arginine followed, after 15–50 min, by a constant (24 pmol·min \u00021·kg \u00021) insulin infusion was given to raise glucose utilization to nearly maximal levels.

Two basal insulin samples and subsequent frequent blood samples were taken during the basal period for the determination of plasma glucose and [6,6- 2H2]glucose concentration. Thereafter, blood sam- ples were collected every 2 min for the ﬁrst 10 min and every 5 min for another 20 min of each step of the clamp. After the arginine bolus, blood was sampled every 2 min for 10 min. During insulin infusion, blood was sampled every 10 min. Analytic procedures. Plasma glucose was measured using the glu- cose oxidase method (Glucose Analyzer; Beckman Instruments, Ful- lerton, CA). Insulin was assayed in plasma by radioimmunoassay (Human Insulin-Speciﬁc RIA kit; Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Enrichment of [6,6- 2H2]glucose was measured by gas chromatogra- phy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (20). Brieﬂy, after deproteinization, plasma samples were reacted with acetic anhydride and pyridine to form the pentaacetate derivative and measured by GC-MS (model 5972; Agilent, Fullerton, CA) using electron impact ionization and selective ion monitoring at mass-to-charge ratio 202/200. Two-Step Isoglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp (ISOclamp) The experimental procedures have been described in detail previ- ously (34). Experimental protocol. Study participants were admitted to the unit in the morning after an overnight fast. The study protocol consisted of three periods: basal (from \u0002145 to 0 min), low-insulin infusion (at a rate of 120 pmol·min \u0002 1·m \u0002 2, from 0 to 100 min), and high-insulin infusion (1,200 pmol·min \u0002 1·m \u0002 2, from 100 to 200 min). Each insulin infusion was primed with a bolus designed as fourfold the constant infusion rate for the ﬁrst 4 min. At t \u0003\u0002145 min, a primed (25.6 \u0004 3.5 \tmol/kg) constant (0.19 \u0004 0.06 \tmol·min \u0002 1·kg \u0002 1) infusion of [6,6- 2H2]glucose was started and was continued for the entire basal period. During insulin infusion, plasma glucose concentration was measured every 10 min and maintained at basal values by means of a variable 20% glucose infusion accord- ing to the isoglycemic clamp technique (13). To minimize the changes in plasma [6,6-2H2]glucose enrichment, 11 mmol of tracer was added to 500 ml of the 20% glucose solution, while the constant [6,6-2H2]glucose infusion was turned off in a stepwise fashion (by 25% every 10 min). Blood sampling for the assay of plasma glucose, insulin, and [6,6- 2H2]glucose enrichment was more frequent (every 2–5 min) during the ﬁrst 50 min of each of the three study periods and was spaced at 10- to 15-min intervals thereafter. During the basal period, four to ﬁve blood samples were taken for plasma insulin determina- tion, and more frequent samples were taken for the assay of plasma glucose and [6,6- 2H2]glucose enrichment. Analytic procedures. Plasma glucose was measured using the glu- cose oxidase method (Glucose Analyzer, Beckman Instruments, Ful- lerton, CA). Insulin was assayed in plasma by RIA (Human Insulin- speciﬁc RIA kit from Linco Research). Plasma [6,6- 2H2]glucose enrichment was measured in arterialized blood samples after depro- teinization with barium hydroxide (0.3 N) and zinc sulfate (0.3 N). Enrichment of [6,6- 2H2]glucose was measured by GC-MS (20). Brieﬂy, after deproteinization, plasma samples were reacted with acetic anhydride and pyridine to form the pentaacetate derivative and measured by GC-MS (model 5972, Agilent) using electron-impact ionization and selective ion monitoring at mass-to-charge ratio 202/ 200. Paired Oral Glucose Tolerance Test and Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp (OGTT/clamp) This study was part of an ancillary protocol of the RISC study (22), and its experimental procedures have been described in detail previ- ously (15). Experimental protocol. CLAMP. In the morning after an overnight fast, a primed [22.2 \u0004 0.5 \tmol per kilogram of estimated lean body mass (LBM)] constant (0.19 \u0004 0.05 \tmol·min \u00021·kgLBM\u00021) infusion of [6,6- 2H2]glucose was started. After a 2-h equilibration period, a primed, continuous infusion of insulin at a rate of 240 pmol·min \u0002 1·m \u0002 2 was given simultaneously with a variable 20% dextrose infusion adjusted every 5 min to maintain plasma glucose levels within 0.8 mmol/l (\u000415%) of the target glucose level (4.5–5.5 mmol/l). The glucose infusate was enriched with [6,6- 2H2]glucose to minimize changes in plasma [6,6- 2H2]glucose enrichment. Plasma samples for the measurement of glucose, [6,6- 2H2]glucose, and insu- lin were taken during the basal period (\u000220 to 0 min) and at the end of the clamp (80 to 120 min). Glucose was additionally measured every \b5 min during the clamp. OGTT. In the morning after an overnight fast, a primed (36.8 \u0004 9.6 \tmol/kgLBM) constant (0.34 \u0004 0.04 \tmol·min \u0002 1·kgLBM \u0002 1) infusion of [6,6- 2H2]glucose was started. After a 2-h equilibration period, a 75-g OGTT was given. Plasma samples for the measurement of glucose and [6,6- 2H2]glucose were taken frequently during the 2-h equilibration period. Three basal insulin samples were also taken. During the OGTT period (0 –150 min), plasma samples were taken at 5- to 30-min intervals for measurement of glucose, insulin, and the glucose tracer. Analytic procedures. Plasma glucose was measured using the glu- cose oxidase technique (Glucose Analyzer;Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). OGTT plasma insulin was measured in duplicate by RIA using a kit for human insulin with negligible cross-reactivity with proinsulin and its split products (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Clamp plasma insulin was measured in the central laboratory of the RISC study by a two-sited, time-resolved ﬂuoroimmunoassay (Au- toDELFIA Insulin kit; Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) using monoclonal antibodies. As this insulin assay provided values lower than the assay used in the OGTT, a calibration curve against the Linco RIA kit was constructed, and the DELFIA values were converted to the Linco scale. The calibration curve was based on paired measurements of the same pool of 50 plasma samples spanning a wide insulin concentra- tion range (50-1,000 pmol/l). The two measurements were strongly linearly related (R \u0003 0.99). Enrichment of [6,6- 2H2]glucose was measured by GC-MS (20). Brieﬂy, after deproteinization, plasma samples were reacted with acetic anhydride and pyridine to form the pentaacetate derivative and measured by GC-MS (model 5972, Agilent) using electron impact ionization and selective ion monitoring at mass-to-charge ratio 202/ 200. Mixed-Meal Test (MTT) The experimental procedures have been described in detail previ- ously (16). This analysis includes the baseline data of all diabetic patients of the original study plus 25 nondiabetic subjects studied with the same protocol. Experimental protocol. The study consisted of a 5-h meal tolerance test following a 3-h basal period combined with a glucose tracer. A primed (\b28 \tmol/kg FPG/5, where FPG is fasting plasma glucose in mmol/l) constant (\b0.28 \tmol·min\u0002 1·kg\u0002 1) infusion of [6,6-2H2]glucose was administered starting at t \u0003\u0002180 min during the whole test. At time 0, subjects ingested (in \u000710 min) a meal consisting of 1 egg, 50 g parmesan cheese, 50 g white bread, and 75 g glucose in water (total calorie content 710 kcal: 58% carbohydrate, 24% fat, 18% protein). Four blood samples were taken before the beginning of the meal to measure plasma glucose, tracer, and insulin concentrations in the fasting state. Afterward, blood samples were collected every 15 min during the ﬁrst hour and every 30 min until the end of the test. Analytic procedures. Tracer enrichment of [6,6- 2H2]glucose was measured by GC-MS (Finnigan Trace GC/DSQ, Thermo Electron) using electron impact ionization and selective ion monitoring at mass-to-charge ratios 202/200 (20). Plasma glucose concentrations were measured by a chemical enzymatic method on a Synchron E353GLUCOSE KINETICS DURING DIFFERENT TESTS AJP-Endocrinol Metab • doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00045.2016 • www.ajpendo.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/ajpendo (197.091.191.096) on November 11, 2023. Clinical System CX4 (Beckman Instruments). Plasma insulin was assayed by chemiluminescence (COBAS e411 Instrument, Roche). Paired MMT and Hyperglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp (MTT/ clamp) The experimental procedures have been described in detail previ- ously (25). This analysis includes all subjects for whom both a MMT and hyperglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp were available. Experimental protocol. MMT. Each subject was served breakfast (231 kcal, 7:00 AM) and lunch (208 kcal, 11:00 AM). At 3:00 PM, a primed (\b20 \tmol/kg in normoglycemic subjects and 20 \tmol/kg FPG/5 in diabetic subjects, where FPG is fasting plasma glucose in mmol/l) constant (\b0.20 \tmol kg\u0002 1 min\u0002 1) infusion of [6,6- 2H2]glucose was started. At 5:00 PM (t \u0003 0), the test meal (400 ml liquid meal, 652 kcal; carbohydrate:protein:fat: 83.6 g/23.2 g/ 24.0 g) was ingested. After dinner, the [6,6- 2H2]glucose infusion rate was stepwise adjusted according to a protocol developed in pilot experiments (n \u0003 5) aimed at minimizing variations of the tracer-to- tracee ratio of endogenous glucose. Plasma glucose, tracer, and insulin concentrations in the fasting state were measured ﬁve, three, and one times, respectively. Afterward, glucose and tracer concentration were measured ap- proximately 10 times in the ﬁrst 2 h and 10 times in the last 6 h; insulin concentration was measured at t \u0003 30 and 60 min and then every hour. CLAMP. Subsequently, T2D patients were admitted the evening before the clamp study, and plasma glucose concentrations were normalized overnight using intravenous insulin infusion. Nondiabetic volunteers were admitted at 6:00 AM the day of the study. At 6:30 AM (t \u0003\u0002150 min), a primed (\b20 \tmol/kg) constant (\b0.20 \tmol·kg \u0002 1·min \u0002 1) infusion of [6,6- 2H2]glucose was started. At 9:00 AM (0 min), a hyperglycemic hyperinsulinemic pancreatic clamp test was initiated by somatostatin infusion (at a rate of 0.1 \tg·kg \u0002 1·min \u0002 1, from \u00025 to 300 min); and insulin infusion (at a rate of 480 pmol/min per m2 of body surface area (BSA) from 0 to 8 min; at a rate of 240 pmol/min per m2 of BSA from 8 to 300 min). Plasma glucose was raised and maintained at \b10 mmol/l (\b180 mg/dl) by primed variable 20% dextrose infusion enriched with [6,6- 2H2]glucose. Plasma samples for the measurement of [6,6- 2H2]glucose were taken four times every 5 min before the start of the clamp, at t \u0003 30 and 60 min, and every 15 min afterward. Glucose was additionally measured every 5 min during the clamp. Insulin samples were taken at t \u0003\u0002180, \u000215, 0, 30, and 60 min, and every hour afterward. Analytic procedures. Plasma glucose was measured using the glu- cose oxidase method (Glucose Analyzer II, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Plasma immunoreactive insulin was measured by commercially available RIAs (38, 39). Enrichment of [6,6- 2H2]glucose was measured by GC-MS (5). Brieﬂy, after deprotein- ization, plasma samples were derivatized as glucose pentaacetate and analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph using elec- tron impact ionization and selective ion monitoring at mass-to-charge ratio 187/189. APPENDIX B. THE CIRCULATORY MODEL OF GLUCOSE KINETICS The circulatory model includes two interconnected blocks: a heart- lung (HL) block and a periphery (PER) block, which lumps together all the remaining tissues. Each block is regarded as a single inlet- single outlet organ and can be described mathematically by an impulse response (27). The organ impulse response is deﬁned as the tracer efﬂux observed at the outlet after a bolus injection of a unit dose into the inlet (with assumption of no tracer recirculation). After bolus injection into a peripheral vein, the tracer disappearance curve is the result of the combination of the impulse responses of the two inter- connected blocks. Cardiac output (F) was assumed to remain constant during each test and was assumed to be 3,200 ml/min per m 2 of BSA (34) multiplied by the ratio of whole blood to plasma glucose concentration (BP \u0003 0.84) to obtain the actual glucose mass ﬂux from the measurement of tracer in plasma. The impulse response of the HL block was assumed to be known and not affected by insulin or glucose. It was represented by a two-exponential function starting from zero and returning to zero after rising to an early peak. The parameters of the HL impulse response were set to match experimentally derived curves, as detailed in McGuinness and Mari (32). In particular, HL glucose distribution volume (VHL) was assumed to be 700 ml/m 2, glucose fractional extraction was assumed to be zero, and the exponent \u0006HL of the rising exponential term was ﬁxed to 15 min \u0002 1. The impulse response of the periphery block was represented by a four-exponential function, Table D1.

Fig. C1. Prototypical glucose homeostasis model used to simulate glucose and insulin concentrations with or without saturation of glucose uptake. In the OGTT simulation, the glucose rate of appearance is the input of the glucose kinetics submodel, implemented as described in this article. The output of this submodel, plasma glucose concentration, drives the \u0006-cell submodel and affects insulin action on glucose uptake. The \u0006-cell submodel predicts insulin secretion, which is the input of the submodel describing insulin kinetics. The insulin kinetics submodel provides plasma insulin concentration, which is the second input required by the insulin action module. In the simulation of exogenous insulin infusion, the glucose rate of appearance (glucose produc- tion) is constant, and the rate of insulin infusion is a further input of the insulin kinetics module.

This impulse response can be conveniently represented as a convolution of a three-exponential function and a single-exponential function, \u0006e \u0002 \u0006t, representing the fastest rising exponential term in which \u0006 \u0003 10 min\u0002 1 is ﬁxed (32).

In the three-expo- nential function in square brackets, it is assumed that the sum of the parameters wi is 1. With this assumption, its integral from zero to inﬁnity is 1, and wi represent the relative contribution of the expo- nential terms of exponents \bi to the total integral. It follows that the integral from zero to inﬁnity of rPER(t) is 1-E(t); i.e., E(t) is the glucose fractional extraction of the periphery block (32).

In the previous equations, cl(t) is the glucose clearance computed by the glucose clearance model described in MATERIALS AND METHODS (Eq. 3); G* and Gv* are the arterial and mixed venous glucose tracer concentrations, respectively (mmol/l), \u0002i(t) is the tracer infusion (\tmol·min \u0002 1·m \u0002 2), and \u0002b is the tracer bolus (\tmol/m 2) applied at the beginning of the test.

ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTS OF GLUCOSE UPTAKE SATURATION ON GLUCOSE LEVELS A simpliﬁed prototype of a glucose homeostasis model was devel- oped assembling the complete glucose kinetics model of this study, a model of insulin kinetics (42), and a model of insulin secretion (31) (Fig. C1). In the original model of insulin secretion (31), potentiation is a time-dependent function that cannot be predicted from glucose. In the simulations described below, we thus used a simpliﬁed represen- tation with no potentiation effects (i.e., potentiation equal to one). To evaluate the effects of glucose uptake saturation, two simula- tions were performed, one with the original glucose uptake model (Eq. 1, and the connected Eq. 3 for glucose clearance) and one in which glucose uptake was linearized; i.e., glucose clearance was made glucose independent by ﬁxing the glucose term at the denominator of the Michaelis-Menten equation to the basal value: \u0002\u0004t\u0005 \u0003 Vmax(t)X(t) KmG \u0004 G(0) , cl\u0004t\u0005 \u0003 Vmax(t) KmG \u0004 G(0) , In these simulations, the model was used to predict glucose con- centration in place of tracer concentration, assuming a known rate of glucose appearance (see below). The initial conditions for the model variables xHL and xPER (see APPENDIX B) were set to empirical values and the simulation started much earlier than time 0, to ensure a steady-state condition at time 0. Two experimental conditions were simulated: an OGTT in a nondiabetic subject and an exogenous insulin infusion in a diabetic subject in fasting conditions. The parameter values for the glucose kinetics model were set to the estimated typical values (Table 2). The insulin kinetics parameters were taken from Tura et al. (42). The \u0006-cell model parameters were chosen as the mean values reported by Mari et al. (31) for control and T2D subjects, in the simulation of the OGTT and the insulin infusion, respectively: \u0006-cell glucose sensi- tivity \u0003 148 and 53 pmol·m \u0002 2 mM \u0002 1, respectively; rate sensitivity \u0003 908 and 220 pmol·m \u0002 2 mM \u0002 1, respectively; secretion at 5 mmol/l glucose for the OGTT simulation \u0003 136 pmol·min \u0002 1·m \u0002 2; secretion at 10 mmol/l glucose for the insulin infusion simulation \u0003 279 pmol·min \u0002 1·m \u0002 2. Glucose concentration was ﬁxed to 5 mmol/l before the OGTT and to 10 mmol/l before the insulin infusion. In the OGTT simulation, the glucose rate of appearance was computed before the test as the value producing the imposed basal glucose concentration, and afterward as the mean in the volunteers from the OGTT/clamp study (Fig. 6A). In the glucose infusion simulation, the glucose production was set to the constant value producing the imposed basal glucose concentration. APPENDIX D. SUPPLEMENTARY ANALYSES Tables D1 and D2 extend the ﬁndings presented in RESULTS, providing insight on the role of BMI and study on the model parameters, on the insulin sensitivity index from the euglycemic clamp, ISclamp, and on the standardized basal clearance, ISb. Figure D1 shows the ﬁt of the individual glucose uptake curves from the study by Kolterman et al. (24) for obese and nonobese subjects with glucose tolerance ranging from NGT to T2D, obtained with our model as described in the DISCUSSION.
