engineering is the fact that it is a very broad field that encompasses a variety of different engineering disciplines and life sciences. There are many recent edited works and advanced textbooks that provide specialized treatments and sum- maries of current research in various areas of biomedical engineering and transport phenomena. These works tend to be written more for the biomedical researcher and the advanced student than for the beginning student. There is therefore a need for an entry-level book that introduces some of the basic concepts. This book is designed to meet this goal. This work brings together funda- mental engineering and life science principles to provide a focused coverage of key momentum and mass transport concepts in biomedical engineering with applications to the design of medi- cal devices. In accomplishing this task within a finite volume, the coverage was limited to those areas that emphasize chemical and physical transport processes with applications toward the development of artificial organs, bioartificial organs, controlled drug delivery systems, and tissue engineering. With this focus, the book first provides a basic review of units and dimensions, some tips for solv- ing engineering problems, and a discussion on material balances. This is then followed by a review of thermodynamic concepts with an emphasis on the properties of solutions. Following this, the remaining chapters focus on such topics as body fluids, osmosis and membrane filtration, the physi- cal and flow properties of blood, solute transport, oxygen transport, and pharmacokinetic analysis. This is followed by the application of these principles to extracorporeal devices and the relatively new areas of tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and bioartificial organs. Throughout the book, considerable emphasis is placed on developing a quantitative understanding of the underly- ing physical, chemical, and biological phenomena. Therefore, mathematical models are developed using the conceptually simple “shell balance” or compartmental approaches. Numerous examples are presented based on these mathematical models, and they are compared in many cases with actual experimental data from the research literature. The student is encouraged to rework these examples using the mathematical software package of their choice. Working through the examples and the end-of-chapter problems using mathematical software packages will develop skill and expertise in engineering problem solving while at the same time making the mathematics less formidable. These mathematical software packages also provide the student with the oppor- tunity to explore various aspects of the solution on their own or apply these techniques as starting points for the solution to their own problems. In this way, the student should be able to gain confi- dence in the development of mathematical models for relatively simple systems and then be able to apply these concepts to a wide variety of problems of even greater complexity. xviii Preface It is hoped that this book is timely and useful to engineers and researchers in the biomedical com- munity, as well as to students in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, biotechnology, bioengineering, medicine, and the life sciences.

You may have come across some of this material in other courses such as in chemistry, physics, and perhaps ther- modynamics. Reviewing these concepts once again is still very important since these concepts form the basis of our approach to analyzing and solving biomedical engineering problems. 1.1 Review of units and dimensions 1.1.1 Units Careful attention must be given to units and dimensions when solving engineering problems; other- wise, serious errors can occur in your calculations. Units are how we describe the size or amount of a dimension. For example, a second is a common unit that is used for the dimension of time. In this book, we use primarily the International System of Units, which is also known by its abbreviation SI, for Système international d'unités. Other systems of units are also used, such as the English and American engineering systems and the centimeter- gram-second (cgs) system. We will come across some of these non-SI units as well in our study. The units of these other systems may be related to the SI units by appropriate conversion factors. Table 1.1 provides a convenient summary of common conversion factors that relate these other units to the SI system. It is important to remember that in engineering calculations you must always attach units to the numbers that arise in your calculations, unless they are already unitless. Furthermore, within a cal- culation, it is important to use a consistent system of units, and in this book we recommend that you work with the SI system. In the event that a number has a non-SI unit, you will first need to convert those units into SI units using the conversion factors found in Table 1.1. Also, remember to treat the units associated with a number as algebraic symbols. Then, as long as the units are the same, you can perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the like units, thereby combining and, in some cases, even cancelling them out. 1.1.2 Fundamental dimensions The measurement of the physical properties we are interested in are derived from the fundamental dimensions of length, mass, time, temperature, and mole. Table 1.2 summarizes the basic SI units for these fundamental dimensions. The SI unit for length is the meter (m) and that for time is the second (sec). 2 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Table 1.1 Conversion Factors Dimension Conversion Factors Length 1 m = 100 cm 1 m = 3.28084 ft 1 m = 39.37 in.

The mass is a property of matter and is the same no matter where the object is located. For example, the mass of an object is the same on Earth, on Neptune, or if it is just floating along some- where in space. In SI units we measure the mass of an object in kilograms (kg). Remember that the mass of an object is different than the weight of an object. Weight is the force exerted by gravity on the object. Since weight is a force, we can use Newton’s second law (F = ma) to relate weight (F) and mass (m). In the United States, with its American engineering system of units, a very confusing situation can occur when working with mass and force (weight). The following discussion should be sufficient for you to see the advantages of working in the SI system of units. However, the American engineering system of units is still widely used, and it is important that you understand the following in order to handle these units properly in the event they arise in your calculations. What is commonly referred to as a pound is really a pound force (weight) in the American engineer- ing system of units. The pound force is abbreviated as lbf, where the subscript f must be present to indicate that this is a pound force. Mass is also expressed as pounds, but in reality what is meant is the pound mass (lbm) and, once again, the subscript m must be present to indicate that this is a pound mass. Using Newton’s second law, we can develop the following relationship between the pound force and the pound mass: ForcelbMasslbAcceleration of gravityft/gfm c( ) = () ´() ´ -sec 2 1 (1.1) The gc term in Equation 1.1 is a conversion factor needed to make the units in Equation 1.1 work out properly, i.e., to convert the lbm to lbf. Note that unlike the acceleration due to gravity, the value of gc does not depend on location and is a constant. In the American engineering system of units, the value of force (pound force or lbf) and mass (pound mass or lbm) are defined in such a way so as to be the same at sea level at 45° latitude. The acceleration of gravity (g) in the American system of units at sea level and 45° latitude is 32.174 ft sec−2. The value of gc in Equation 1.1 is therefore 32.174 ft lbm sec−2 lbf−1. It is important to recognize though that the acceleration of gravity depends on location. A pound force and a pound mass have the same value only at sea level, where the acceleration of gravity is 32.174 ft sec−2 or whenever the ratio of the local acceleration of gravity to gc is equal to one. For calculations done on the surface of the Earth, it is usually just assumed that a pound mass (lbm) equals a pound force (lbf), since the acceleration of gravity really does not vary Table 1.2 SI Units for the Fundamental Dimensions Fundamental Dimension Unit Abbreviation Length Meter m Mass Kilogram kg Time Second sec or s Temperature Kelvin K Mole Mole mol 4 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering that much. So, if an object with a mass of 10 lbm is on Earth, then for practical purposes its weight is 10 lbf. However, if this object is taken to the moon, where the acceleration of gravity is 5.309 ft sec−2, the mass is still 10 lbm; however by Equation 1.1, its weight is quite a bit lower, as shown in the following calculation: 10 5 309 32 174 165 2 2 lb ft lb ft lb lbm f m f´´ =. sec sec . . Example 1.1 Calculate the weight in newtons and in lbf of an average person on the Earth. Solution On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity (g) is 9.8 m sec−2. The average mass of a human is 75 kg, so on Earth, the weight of the average human is 75 kg × 9.8 m sec−2 = 735 kg m sec−2. Next, we will see that 1 newton (N) is a special SI unit defined as 1 kg m sec−2, so our average human also has a weight of 735 N. From Table 1.1 we find that 1 newton = 0.22481 lbf giving a weight of 735 N × 0.22481 lbf N−1 = 165.2 lbf. 1.1.2.2 Temperature Temperature is defined as an absolute temperature instead of a relative tem- perature like the commonly used Fahrenheit and Celsius scales. The Fahrenheit scale is based on water freezing at 32°F and boiling at 212°F, whereas the Celsius scale sets these at 0°C and 100°C, respectively. The following equations may be used to relate a Celsius temperature to a Fahrenheit temperature and vice versa: t Ft Cort Ct F°° °°=+ =-()18 32 5 9 32. (1.2) Our SI unit for the measurement of absolute temperature is Kelvin (K). The absolute temperature scale sets the absolute zero point, or 0 Kelvin (0 K), as the lowest possible temperature at which matter can exist. The temperature unit of the absolute Kelvin temperature scale is the same as that of the Celsius scale, so 1 K = 1°C. The following equation may be used to relate the Celsius tempera- ture (t) scale to the absolute Kelvin temperature (T) scale. In Celsius units, the absolute zero point is therefore −273.15°C: t CTK°= - 273 15. (1.3) The absolute temperature can also be defined by the same unit of temperature measurement as the Fahrenheit scale. This is referred to as the absolute Rankine (R) temperature scale and 1 R = 1°F. Note that 0 K is the same as 0 R since the absolute Kelvin and the absolute Rankine temperature scales are based on the same reference point of absolute zero. Equation 1.4 can be used to relate the Fahrenheit temperature scale (t) to the absolute Rankine temperature (T) scale. In Fahrenheit units, the absolute zero point is −459.67°F: t FTR°= - 459 67. (1.4) 5 Introduction Using Equations 1.2 through 1.4, one can also show that the relationship between the Rankine and Kelvin temperatures is given by TR TK= 18. (1.5) 1.1.2.3 Mole The mole is used to describe the amount of a substance that contains the same number of atoms or molecules as there are atoms in 0.012 kilograms (or 12 g) of carbon-12, i.e., 6.023 × 1023 atoms, which is also called Avogadro’s number. This is also called the gram mole, which can be written as gmole, mole, or just mol. In the American engineering system, the pound mole (lb mole or lb mol) is used and is defined as 6.023 × 1023 × 454 atoms. Therefore, 1 pound mole is equal to 454 gram moles. The molecular weight is defined as the mass per mole of a given substance. For example, the molecu- lar weight of glucose is 0.180 kg mole−1, whereas the molecular weight of water is 0.018 kg mole−1. A mole of glucose or a mole of water both contain the Avogadro’s number of molecules. Even though one mole of glucose and water contains the same number of molecules, the masses of each are quite different because the molecules of glucose are much larger than those of water. That is, one mole of glucose has a mass of 0.180 kg and one mole of water has a mass of 0.018 kg. 1.1.3 Derived dimensional quantities From these fundamental dimensions, we can derive the units for a variety of other dimensional quantities of interest. Some of these quantities will occur so often that it is useful to list them as shown in Table 1.3. In  addition, some of these quantities, like force and energy, have their own special SI units, whereas others, like mass density, are based on the fundamental dimensions listed in Table 1.2. Many times, we will use special symbols to denote a quantity. For example, the Greek symbol ρ (rho) is used to denote the mass density and μ (mu) is often used for the viscosity of a substance. The viscosity, discussed in Chapter 4, is a physical property of a fluid and is a measure of its resistance to flow. A listing of the symbols used in this book to denote a variety of quantities is given in the Notation section that follows the Table of Contents.

For example, 1/1000th of a meter is known as a millimeter, where the prefix “milli-” means to multiply the base unit of meter by the factor of 10−3. The prefix “kilo-” means to multiply the base unit by 1000. So, a kilo- gram is the same as 1000 grams. Table 1.4 summarizes a variety of prefixes that are commonly used to scale a base unit. 1.1.3.1 Pressure Pressure is defined as a force per unit area. Pressure is also expressed in either a relative or an absolute scale, and its unit of measure in the SI system is the Pascal (Pa), which is equal to a newton of force per square meter or N m−2. How the pressure is measured will affect whether or not it is a relative or an absolute pressure. Absolute pressure is based on reference to a perfect vacuum. A perfect vacuum on the absolute pressure scale defines the zero point or 0 Pa. The zero point for a relative pressure scale is usually the pressure of the air or atmosphere where the measurement is taken. This local pressure is called either the atmospheric pressure or the barometric pressure and is measured by a barometer, which is a device for measuring atmospheric pressure. It is important to remember that the pressure of the surrounding air or atmosphere is not a constant but depends on location, elevation, and other factors related to the weather. That is why it is always important to log in your record book the atmospheric pressure in the laboratory when doing experi- ments that involve pressure measurements. Most pressure measurement devices, or pressure gauges, measure the pressure relative to the surrounding atmospheric pressure or barometric pressure. These so-called gauge pressures are also relative pressures. A good example of a gauge pressure is the device used to measure the inflation pressure of your tires. If the tire pressure gauge has a reading of 250 kPa, then that means that the pressure in the tire is 250 kPa higher than the surrounding atmospheric pressure. A gauge pressure of 0 Pa means that the pressure is the same as the local atmospheric pressure, or you have a flat tire! A negative gauge pressure (i.e., suction or partial vacuum) means that the pressure is that amount below the atmospheric pressure. If the pressure measurement device measures the pressure relative to a perfect vacuum, then that pressure reading is referred to as Table 1.4 Common Prefixes for SI Units Prefix Multiplication Factor Symbol Femto 10−15 f Pico 10−12 p Nano 10−9 n Micro 10−6 μ Milli 10−3 m Centi 10−2 c Deci 10−1 d Deka 10 da Hecto 102 h Kilo 103 k Mega 106 M Giga 109 G Tera 1012 T 7 Introduction an absolute pressure reading. The relationship between relative or gauge pressure and absolute pressure is given by the following equation: Gauge pressure Atmospheric pressure Absolute pressure( )+ () = ()) (1.6) The standard atmosphere is equivalent to the absolute pressure exerted at the bottom of a column of mercury that is 760 mm in height at a temperature of 0°C. This value is nearly the same as the atmospheric pressure that one may find on a typical day at sea level. The standard atmosphere in a variety of units is summarized in Table 1.5. Using Equation 1.6, and the pressure conversion factors shown in Table 1.5, we can say that your tire pressure is 250 kPa gauge or 351.325 kPa absolute. 1.1.3.2 Volume Volume refers to the amount of space that an object occupies and depends on the mass of the object. The mass density is the mass of an object divided by the volume of space that it occupies. Specific volume is the volume of an object divided by its mass. Specific volume is, therefore, just the inverse of the mass density. For solids and liquids, the volume of an object of a given mass is not strongly dependent on the temperature or the pressure. For solids and liquids, the volume is then the mass multiplied by the specific volume or the mass divided by the density of the object. For gases, the volume of a gas is also strongly dependent on both the temperature and the pressure. For gases, we need to use an equation of state to properly relate the volume of the gas to the temperature, pressure, and moles (mass divided by molecular weight). 1.1.3.3 Equations of state An equation of state is a mathematical relationship that relates the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas, liquid, or solid. For our purposes, the ideal gas law is an equation of state that will work just fine for the types of problems involving gases that we will consider here. Recall that an ideal gas has mass; however, the gas molecules themselves have no volume and these molecules do not interact with one another. The ideal gas law works well for gases like hydrogen and oxygen and air at pressures around atmospheric. Recall that the ideal gas law is given by the following relationship: PV nRT= (1.7) In this equation P denotes the absolute pressure V is the volume T is the absolute temperature n is the number of moles R is called the universal gas constant, and a suitable value must be used to make the units in Equation 1.7 work out properly Table 1.6 summarizes commonly used values of the gas constant in a variety of different units.

Hg) 101,325 pascals (Pa) 8 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 1.2 Dimensional equation A dimensional equation is an equation that contains both numbers and their associated units. The dimensional equation usually arises from the use of a specific formula that is being used to solve a problem or when a particular number has nonstandard units associated with it. In the latter case, a series of conversion factors are used to put the number in some other system of units, e.g., the SI system of units. To arrive at the final answer, which is usually a number with its associated units, the dimensional equation is solved by performing the arithmetical operations on the numbers and, as discussed earlier, algebraic operations on the various units. Example 1.2 illustrates the use of the dimensional equation to convert a quantity in nonstandard units to SI units. Example 1.3 illustrates the use of the dimensional equation to determine the volume of a gas at a given temperature and pressure. When solving engineering problems, make sure to use the dimensional equation approach illustrated in these examples. In this way, you can easily handle the conversion of the units associated with the quantities involved in your calcula- tion and arrive at the correct answer. Remember to refer to Tables 1.1 and 1.3 through 1.6, where appropriate. Example 1.2 A particular quantity was reported to have a value of 1.5 cm3 hr−1 m−2 mmHg−1. Recall that mmHg is a measurement of pressure, where 760 mm of mercury (Hg) is equal to a pressure of 1  atmosphere (1 atm). Convert this dimensional quantity to SI units of meter squared (m2) second (sec) per kilogram (kg−1), i.e., m2 sec kg−1.

This is also called a material balance. In its simplest terms, conservation of mass is the statement of the fact that the sum of the masses of all substances that enter the system must equal the sum of the masses of all the substances that leave the system. However, there can be changes in the individual masses or amounts of various chemical enti- ties because of chemical reactions that may also be occurring within the system. Remember that mass is always conserved and moles are not necessarily conserved if chemical reactions occur in the sys- tem. The only exception to conservation of mass is for nuclear reactions where energy is converted to mass and vice versa. Nuclear reactions are not included in the systems that we will be considering. 1.3.1 Law of conservation The following equation provides a generalized statement of the law of conservation for our system, which we will find extremely useful for the solution of a variety of problems: AccumulationInOut GenerationConsumption=- +- (1.8) This equation may be used to account for changes in quantities such as mass, moles, energy, momen- tum, and even money. The Accumulation term accounts for the change with time of the quantity of interest within the system volume. The accumulation term in this equation is a time derivative of the quantity of inter- est and defines what is called an unsteady problem. The accumulation term can be either positive or negative. If the accumulation term is zero, then the quantity of interest within the volume of the system is not changing with time, and we refer to this situation as a steady-state problem. The In term accounts for the entry of the quantity of interest into the system by all routes. For exam- ple, as carried in by the flow of fluid that is also called convection, or by the mechanism of diffusion. 10 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The Out term is similar to the In term but accounts for the loss of the quantity of interest from the system. The Generation term accounts for the production of the quantity of interest within the system volume, whereas the Consumption term represents the loss of the quantity of interest within the sys- tem. The generation and consumption of the quantity of interest occurs through chemical reactions and the metabolic processes that occur within cells. The following nonengineering example illustrates a practical application of Equation 1.8, which is calculating the periodic payment on a loan. Remember this example since you can use the results to calculate payments for such items as automobiles, your house, and your credit card balance. Example 1.4 You just graduated from college as a bioengineer and have accepted your first job with a medi- cal device company. You decide to buy yourself a nice sports car and in order to buy it you will need to borrow from the bank a total of $65,000. The bank is offering you a 5 year loan at an annual interest rate of 6% compounded continuously.* What is your monthly payment? What is the total amount that you will pay back to the bank? How much interest will you pay? Solution We will let A represent the amount of money at any time that you owe the bank and R will rep- resent the annual payment that you make to the bank on the loan. The interest rate is represented by i. The amount of interest that the bank charges you for the loan is equal to the interest rate multiplied by the amount at any time that you owe them. Using Equation 1.8, we can then write the following equation that expresses how the amount you owe the bank changes with time: dA dt iA R=- Note that the amount you owe the bank Accumulates or, in this case, since this is a loan, Deaccumulates, according to the term dA/dt. The amount you owe is also Generated or increased by the interest term represented by iA, and the amount you owe is decreased (Out) by the amount of your annual payment represented by R. Since R will be greater than iA, then dA/dt will be <0, and the amount that you owe the bank will decrease with time. This is a first order differential equation and represents what is also called an initial value problem. In order to solve this equa- tion, we need to specify an initial condition (IC), which is the amount you owe the bank at time equal to zero, which is when you take out the loan. The initial condition can be written as IC tA A$:,== =065 0000 There are several methods that can be used to solve the above differential equation to include integrating factors and Laplace transforms. Table 4.4 summarizes the Laplace transforms for a variety of functions, and one of the end-of-chapter problems asks you to resolve this example using Laplace transforms. However, an easy way to solve the differential equation (since R is * Note that most loans are compounded on some basis where interest is calculated, e.g., yearly, quarterly, monthly, or even daily, in the limit being continuous compounding. For practical purposes, the basis of the compounding is not a significant factor in estimating a loan payment. 11 Introduction a constant) is to let A be the sum of the homogeneous solution (i.e., when R = 0) represented by Ah and a constant C1 yet to be determined. So, we let A = Ah + C1. We then substitute this equation into the differential equation above, and we obtain dA dt iA andiCR h h=- =-1 We immediately see that C1 = R/i and the homogeneous differential equation can be readily integrated to give Ah = C2eit, where C2 is another constant that we evaluate from the initial condition. Our solution for the amount that we owe the bank at any time is then given by At Ce R i it() =+2 Now we use the initial condition that at t = 0, A = A0 and we find that the constant C2 = A0 − (R/i). Our result for the amount that you owe the bank at any time after the loan inception is then given by At Ae R i e it it() =+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ -()0 1 Now, what we want to find is the annual payment needed to pay off the loan after T years. Then, since A(T) = 0, we can solve the above equation for R and obtain the following equation for the annual loan payment: R iA e iT= - - 0 1 We can now insert the numbers to calculate the loan payment amount: R yr $ e $ yr $ mo yr yrs = ´ - == -´ 006 65 000 1 15 047 35 1 1 253 95 1 006 5 . , ,. ,. . nnth So, we see that the monthly payment for the sports car is about $1254 per month. The total amount paid to the bank over the 5-year period of the loan is $15,047.35 yr−1 × 5 yrs = $75,236.77, and the total amount of interest paid to the bank for the loan is $75,236.77 − $65,000 = $10,236.77. 1.3.2 Chemical reactions In the case of chemical reactions or cellular metabolism occurring within the system, you must also take into account, in your mass balances, the reaction stoichiometry as given by your balanced chemical equations for those substances that are involved in the chemical reactions. In addition, it is important to remember that for biological reactions, there can be an increase in the number of cells and your balanced chemical reaction must also consider the formation of biomass from the substances that take part in the reaction, as shown in the following example. 12 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Example 1.5 Consider the anaerobic fermentation of glucose to ethanol by yeast. Glucose (C6H12O6) is converted into yeast, ethanol (C2H5OH), the by-product glycerol (C3H8O3), carbon dioxide, and water. An empirical chemical formula for yeast can be taken as CH1.74N0.2O0.45 (Shuler and Kargi, 2002). Assuming ammonia (NH3) is the nitrogen source, we can write the following empirical chemical equation to describe the fermentation: C6H12O6 + a NH3 → b CH1.74N0.2O0.45 (yeast) + c C2H5OH + d C3H8O3 + e CO2 + f H2O Suppose, we found that 0.12 moles of glycerol was formed for each mole of ethanol produced and 0.08 moles of water were formed for each mole of glycerol. Determine the stoichiometric coefficients, which are the letters a, b, c, d, e, and f in front of the chemical formulas in the above equation. Remember that the stoichiometric coefficients need to be determined so that the total number of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms are the same on each side of the equation. Solution Balancing the above equation by inspection is not an easy thing to do. Hence, we use the more formal approach as outlined below where we write a balance for each element, i.e., carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen: Carbon balance: 6 = b + 2c + 3d + e Hydrogen balance: 12 + 3a = 1.74b + 6c + 8d + 2f Oxygen balance: 6 = 0.45b + c + 3d + 2e + f Nitrogen balance: a = 0.2b Other constraints: d = 0.12 c and f = 0.08 d These relationships for each element can then be arranged into matrix form as follows. We see that the solution for a, b, c, d, e, and f involves the solution of six algebraic equations for these six unknowns: 01 23 10 31 74 68 02 00 45 13 21 10 20 00 0 00 0121 00 00 00 08 01 - - - - é ë ê ê . . . . . êê ê ê ê ê ê ù û ú ú ú ú ú ú ú ú é ë ê ê ê ê ê ê ê ê ù û ú ú ú ú ú ú ú ú = é ë ê ê ê ê ê a b c d e f 6 12 6 0 0 0 êê ê ê ù û ú ú ú ú ú ú ú ú Solution of this matrix gives a = 0.048, b = 0.239, c = 1.68, d = 0.202, e = 1.796, and f = 0.016. The balanced chemical equation for the anaerobic fermentation of glucose by yeast can then be written as shown here: C HO NH CH NO yeast CH OH 6126 31 74 02 045 25 0 048 0 239 1680 +® () ++ .. .. .. . 2202 1 796 0 01638 32 2CH OCOH O++.. 13 Introduction 1.3.3 The extent of a chemical reaction It is also convenient when analyzing chemical reactions to express the differential change in the moles of each species i, i.e., dni, in terms of the differential extent of reaction j, i.e., dεj. The extent of reaction j (εj) will have units of moles and for a constant volume system (V) can also be expressed in units of concentration. We also let νij represent the stoichiometric coefficient of species i in reaction j. If νij > 0, then the species is a product, and if νij < 0, then it is a reactant. With these definitions, the following equation relates the differential change in the moles of species i as a result of its participation in each of the M reactions being considered. If species i does not partici- pate in reaction j, then for that reaction νij = 0: dndi j M ij j= =å 1 ne (1.9) This equation can then be integrated from the initial state where εj = 0 and the initial moles of species i is nnii= 0, to the final state of ni and εj: nnii j M ij j=+ =å 0 1 ne (1.10) Equation 1.10 then provides the moles of each species after the reaction has been completed (ni), in terms of the extent of each reaction (εj). The total moles of all species (n) can be found by summing Equation 1.10 over i as shown by the next equation: nn i N i i N j M ij j=+ == =ååå 1 0 11 ne (1.11) In Equations 1.9 through 1.11, the ni’s represent the moles of species i in a given reaction volume of interest. If the reaction occurs in a flow-through system, then these ni’s would be the molar flow rate of each species i. Note that the concentrations of the respective species and the total concentration can be obtained by dividing Equations 1.10 and 1.11 by the solution volume (V), provided the solution volume remains constant throughout the course of the reaction. Also, the mole fraction of species i in the solution is given by xi = ni/n. The conversion of a key component in a reaction is denoted by X and is defined as follows in terms of moles (the ni’s) or the concentrations, if the volume is constant: X n n C C i i i i =- =-11 00 (1.12) The actual conversion for a given reaction requires knowledge of the chemical kinetics or the rate law for a reaction and also depends on the reactor design equation. We will explore this in Section 9.6 14 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering for the special case of enzyme reactions. In some cases, we can make the assumption that the reac- tion is at equilibrium, and this is discussed in Section 2.6.3.15 for the special case of equilibrium reactions in dilute aqueous solutions. An excellent resource for chemical reaction engineering is the book by Fogler (2005). Example 1.6 The continuous anaerobic fermentation of glucose was carried out at steady state in a well- mixed bioreactor. The feed stream to the bioreactor contained no yeast cells (sterile feed), ethanol, or glycerol. The feed flow rate to the bioreactor was 100 L h−1 and the concentra- tion of glucose in this stream was equal to 100 g L−1. Determine the amounts in g h−1 of the glucose, yeast cells, water produced, ethanol, glycerol, and carbon dioxide leaving the bioreactor for 97% conversion of glucose within the bioreactor. Also, determine the mini- mum amount of ammonia that is needed in g h−1. Use the balanced chemical equation for anaerobic fermentation of glucose by yeast that was obtained in Example 1.5. The volume of the liquid phase within the bioreactor is 2000 L. Solution Since we only have one reaction, Equations 1.10 and 1.11 simplify to nn andn nii i i N i i N i=+ =+ ==åå 0 1 0 1 ne en where ε is the extent of the anaerobic fermentation reaction. In these equations the subscript i denotes the species, so let 1 = glucose, 2 = yeast, 3 = ethanol, 4 = glycerol, 5 = carbon dioxide, 6 = water, and 7 = ammonia. The molar rate at which glucose enters the reactor, n1 0, is equal to the feed flow rate times the glucose concentration in this feed divided by the glucose molecular weight, i.e. n L hr g L mole g moles hr 1 0 100 100 1 180 55 56=´ ´= . From the definition of conversion, we can show using Equations 1.10 and 1.12 that the extent of this reaction is then related to the glucose conversion as follows: e= =´ =nX moles hr moles hr 1 0 55 56 0975389.. . We can then use this extent of reaction, along with the stoichiometric coefficient for each com- ponent in the anaerobic fermentation reaction, to calculate the moles of each species leaving the reactor as follows: Glucose n moles hr moles hr moles hr g mole g hr 1 55 56 53 89 167 180 300 6=- =´ =.. .. 15 Introduction Yeast n moles hr moles hr moles hr g mole 02 0 239 53 89 12 88 23 74 305=+ ´= ´=.. .. ..8 g hr Ethanol n moles hr moles hr moles hr g mole g 3 01 68 53 89 90 54 46 4164 6=+ ´= ´=.. .. hhr Glycerol n moles hr moles hr moles hr g mole 04 0 202 53 89 10 89 92 1001 5=+ ´= ´=.. .. gg hr Carbon dioxide n moles hr moles hr moles hr g mole 5 01 796 53 89 97 79 44 4258 6=+ ´= ´=.. .. gg hr Water (produced) n moles hr moles hr moles hr g mole g h 006 0 016 53 89 86 18 15 52=+ ´= ´=.. .. rr The minimum amount of ammonia that is needed according to the fermentation reaction is n moles hr moles hr moles hr g mole g 07 0 0 048 53 89 259174397=+ ´= ´=.. .. hhr 1.3.4 Material balances In applying the law of mass conservation to your system, you can write a material balance using Equation 1.8 for each component. If you have N components, then this will provide a total of N equations. You can also write a total material balance that gives an additional equation for a total of N + 1 equations. However, these N + 1 equations are not independent since we can also obtain the total material balance equation by just summing the N component material balances. Remember that you need as many equations as you have unknowns in order to completely describe your system. If  you have more unknowns than equations relating these unknowns, then you have that many degrees of freedom, i.e. Degrees of freedom Number of unknowns Number of equations= – (1.13) and you must specify the values of some of these unknowns. In solving engineering problems or designing equipment and devices, it is quite common to have more unknowns than equations that relate these unknowns. These degrees of freedom are also referred to as design variables and are quantities that you specify as part of the design of the system. The following two examples illustrate the application of material balance principles. 16 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Example 1.7 Drug B has a solubility of 2.5 g B 100−1 g−1 water at 80°C and at 4°C the solubility of B is only 0.36 g B 100−1 g−1 of water. If a saturated drug solution at 80°C has 1000 g of drug in it, determine how much water (W) is also present with the drug. The solution is then cooled to 4°C and the drug precipitate is separated from the saturated drug solution. How much of the drug will be precipitated (P) from the initial solution? Solution Figure 1.1 illustrates the problem. As a basis for the calculation, we start with the fact that there is 1000 g of drug (D) in the initial solution. Since the drug has a solubility of 2.5 g 100−1 g−1 of water at 80°C, we can calculate the amount of water (W) present in this saturated solution as follows: W gwater gB gB gwater=´ = 100 25 1 000 40 000 . ,, So, the initial saturated solution consists of 1,000 g of drug B and 40,000 g of water. This solution is then cooled to 4°C and the decrease in drug solubility results in the precipitation of B out of the solution. Here, we see that the 40,000 g of water is conserved within the cooled solution; however the mass of drug B in the supernatant solution (X) at 4°C and in the precipi- tate (P) are unknown. Let F denote the mass of the initial solution, i.e., F = W + D = 40,000 g + 1,000 g = 41,000 g. Also, let S represent the total mass of the saturated supernatant solution after cooling to 4°C, and P is the mass of drug B in the solid precipitate. A total mass balance on this process says that F SP g=+ = 41 000, D g of drug B in a saturated solution with W g of water Cooling process to 4°C T= 80°C Separator X g of drug B in a saturated solution with W g of water T=4°C P g of drug B as a solid precipitate CSat = 2.5 g B per 100 g water B CSat = 0.36 g B per 100 g water B Figure 1.1 A drug precipitation process. 17 Introduction Therefore, the total mass balance says that F = 41,000 g = S + P. Here, we still have two unknowns, S and P, so we need another equation in order to solve for S and P. A component material balance on drug B can also be written to find the mass of the drug precipitate, i.e., P: DX PC WPB sat=+ =+ The term on the left side is the amount of drug B in the original solution (D), the first term in the center portion provides the amount of drug B that can exist in the saturated supernatant solution at 4°C, and P is the mass of the drug precipitate. X can also be written as the product of the solubility of B at 4°C and the amount of water (W) with the result that we can now solve for the amount of the precipitate: 1 000 036 100 40 000 856 , . ,gB gB gwater gwater P Pg of drug Binthe pr =´ + = eecipitate With P now known, the overall material balance can be used to find the mass of the cooled supernatant solution: S FP gg g=-= -=41 000 856 40 144,, The percentage recovery in the precipitate of drug B from the initial saturated solution at 80°C by cooling to a saturated solution at 4°C is given by % Drug Brecovery Mass in precipitate Mass in original solution == 856 ggdrugB drug B1000 100 85 6´= .% Example 1.8 A continuous membrane separation process is being used to separate components A and B into a product stream that is mostly A and a waste stream that is primarily B. A and B enter the process together at a total flow rate (F) of 100 kg hr−1. The composition of this feed stream is 40% A and 60% B by mass. The product stream (P) being removed from the process has a composition of 90% A and 10% B, whereas the waste stream (W) leaving the process has a composition of 2% A and 98% B. Calculate the mass flow rates of the product (P) and waste streams (W). Solution Figure 1.2 illustrates the problem. First we can write an overall material balance that says, F = 100 kg hr−1 = P + W. With two unknowns P and W, there is a need for another equation. So, we can write a component material balance on A that says, 0.40 × 100 kg hr−1 = 0.90 × P + 0.02 × W. Since W = 100 kg hr−1 – P from the overall material balance, the component material balance can be rewritten in terms of just P, or 40 kg hr−1 = 0.90 P + 2 kg hr−1 – 0.02 P. Solving for the product flow rate, we obtain P = 43.18 kg hr−1. From the overall material balance, we then find that W = 100 kg hr−1 – 43.182 kg hr−1 = 56.82 kg hr−1. 18 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 1.4 Tips for solving engineering problems In this section, we outline a basic strategy that can be used to solve the type of engineering problems considered in this book and those you are likely to encounter as a biomedical engineer. This basic strategy is useful since it eliminates approaching the solution of each new problem or system as if it is a unique situation. The numerous examples throughout the book as well as the problems at the end of each chapter will provide you with the opportunity to apply the strategy outlined here and, at the same time, develop your skills in using the engineering analysis techniques discussed in this book. One of the unique and challenging aspects of engineering is that the number of problems that you may come across during the course of your career is limitless. However, it is important to understand that the underlying engineering principles and the solution strategy are always the same. The engineering problems we will consider derive from some type of process. A process is defined as any combination of physical operations and chemical reactions that act on or change the sub- stances involved in the process. A process also occurs within what is also more generally called the system. Everything else that is affected by the system or interacts with the system is known as the surroundings. The engineering analysis of all problems can therefore be considered within the context of the system and its surroundings. There are several important steps that you should follow before attempting to make any engineering calculations on a system and its surroundings. For ease of reference, these steps are also summarized in Table 1.7. One of the first things that you should do when solving a particular problem is to draw a sketch that defines your system. Drawing a sketch of the system for a given problem will allow you to identify and focus your attention on the key features of the problem. The sketch does not have to be elaborate; you can use boxes to represent the system and lines with arrows can be used to indicate the flow of streams that enter and leave the system. The solutions for Examples 1.7 and 1.8 both have sketches, as shown in Figures 1.1 and 1.2. If you know them or can easily calculate them, make sure you also write down the flow rates of the flowing streams and the amount or concentration of each substance in each of the flowing streams. On your sketch, you will also write down the available data that you already have concerning the problem. Examples of additional data that may be important in solving your problem include tem- peratures, pressures, experimental data, physical properties, and even conversion factors. Next, you should obtain any additional information or data needed to solve the problem. You should also write down any chemical reactions that need to be considered and make sure that these are also balanced. F= 100 kg h−1 40% A, 60% B Membrane separator P=? 90% A, 10% B W= ? 2% A, 98% B Figure 1.2 A continuous membrane separation process. 19 Introduction Obtaining the answer to the problem illustrated by your sketch of the system will require the use of specific engineering principles and formulas that govern the physical and chemical operations that occur within your process. Formulating the solution and solving engineering problems is a skill that one needs to develop and refine in order to be successful in engineering. That is the goal of this book, to provide you with the mathematical techniques and skills for solving a variety of biomedical engineering problems that involve chemical reactions and such transport processes as fluid flow and mass transfer. Building on the skills learned in this book, you will then be able to design biomedical equipment and devices. 1.5 Useful numerical methods The solution of many biomedical engineering problems will require the use of a numerical method. In other words, an analytical solution is very difficult to obtain or a simple hand calculation is not possible. In some cases, you may also want to illustrate your solution on a graph. In these situations you will need to write a computer program. In this section you will find eight examples that show how to solve many common problems that you may encounter. In each example, a numerical solu- tion is shown using MATLAB®, a commercial engineering software package that is commonly used by engineers and scientists. You can use these example solutions as a template that can be easily modified to solve the particular problem you are working on. Additional details on how to program in MATLAB can be found in Hahn and Valentine (2013). Example 1.9: Comparing a model equation to a set of experimental data Table 1.8 summarizes the data obtained from a viscometer* for the shear stress (τ, Pa) of ketchup as a function of the shear rate (\u0000g, sec−1). These data were obtained from an online technical report presented by TA Instruments.† The Casson equation is a model that can be used to describe the shear stress and shear rate relationship for complex fluids like ketchup. * See Chapter 4 for more information on viscosity and the flow of fluids. † http://www.tainstruments.co.jp/application/pdf/Rheology_Library/Solutions/RS013.PDF.

The Casson equation says that a plot of the square root of the shear stress versus the square root of the shear rate should give a straight line, i.e., compare the above equation with y = b + mx, where the y intercept (b) of the graph is the square root of the yield stress, i.e., ty , and the slope (m) is s. From the data given in Table 1.8, we can estimate the value of τy as 58 Pa, and the value of s can be approximated from the rise over the run of the data starting at the y intercept of 58 Pa: sPa y= - - = - = () tt g 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 0 170 58 500 0 243 // / // / / .sec With these values of τy and s, make a graph using MATLAB that compares the Casson equa- tion, using these values of τy and s, to the data given in Table 1.8. Note that in the graph the data must be shown by symbols and the prediction by the Casson equation as a solid line. Solution The MATLAB program for solving this problem is shown below. Figure 1.3 shows a com- parison between the data given in Table 1.8 and the prediction of the Casson equation for the estimated values of τy and s. We see that the Casson equation with these values of τy and s provides an excellent representation of these data. %Comparing an equation to a set of experimental data clear clc clf %enter the data as vectors gamma and tau, these data represent the %shear rate and shear stress gamma=[0,25,50,100,150,200,300,400,500]; tau=[58,80,87,105,115,120,138,155,170]; %now apply any transformation to these data, for example here we Table 1.8 Shear Stress versus Shear Rate for Ketchup Shear Rate (sec−1) Shear Stress (Pa) 0 58 25 80 50 87 100 105 150 115 200 120 300 138 400 155 500 170 21 Introduction %take the square root of each quantity x=sqrt(gamma); y=sqrt(tau); %now plot the transformed data set x and y with xlower and xupper %defining the x range and ylower and yupper defining the y range xlower=0; xupper=sqrt(500); ylower=0; yupper=sqrt(200); plot(x,y,'*b'); axis([xlower,xupper,ylower,yupper]); xlabel('Square Root of Shear Rate'), ylabel('Square Root of Shear Stress'); title('Comparing an Equation to a Set of Experimental Data'); hold on; %now enter the equation and its parameters that you want to compare %to the experimental data s=0.243; tauy=58; %now define a vector of 200 points along the abscissa for the equation %to calculate the predicted ordinate values from xline=linspace(min(x),max(x),200); %now calculate the predicted ordinate values for each value of xline %using in this case the Casson equation yline=sqrt(tauy)+s*xline; %now plot yline versus xline on the same graph with the data to obtain %a comparison between the experimental data and the model equation plot(xline,yline,'r-') 0 5 10 15 20 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Square root of shear rateSquare root of shear stress Figure 1.3 Comparison of the Casson equation to the shear stress and shear rate data for ketchup. 22 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Example 1.10: Linear regression of experimental data Using the data found in Table 1.8, find the parameters τy and s in the Casson equation that provides the best fit to these data. Solution The Casson equation says that if we replot the experimental data as the square root of the shear stress versus the square root of the shear rate, the result should be linear. According to the Casson equation, see Equation A in the previous example, these transformed data will have an intercept equal to the square root of the yield stress, i.e., ty , and a slope equal to s. Our goal is then to find the values of τy and s that minimize the error between these transformed experimental val- ues and the values predicted by the Casson equation. The criterion that is often used to determine the best fit is the sum of the square of the error (SSE) between the experimental ordinate values and those predicted by the model equation. The SSE using the Casson equation is defined by SSE n N experimental nCassonn=-() =å 1 12 12 2 tt, / , / where N is the total number of data points. The MATLAB program for performing the linear regression is shown below. Figure 1.4 shows a comparison between the data given in Table 1.8 and the prediction of the Casson equation. The values for τy and s are found to be, respectively, 59.3 Pa and 0.238 (Pa sec)1/2.

Using this as the value for τy, we can rearrange the Casson equation as tt g 12 12 12// /-=y s\u0000 Now we see that a plot of tt 12 12//- y versus \u0000g12/ would be linear with a slope equal to s and an intercept of zero. We can perform a linear regression of the data shown in Table 1.8 using the above form of the Casson equation and obtain the slope, s, of the resulting regression line using τy = 58 Pa. However, in performing this linear regression, we need to use a linear regres- sion method that constrains the y intercept to zero. Solution The MATLAB program for performing the linear regression with the constraint of a zero intercept is shown below. Figure 1.5 shows a comparison between the data given in Table 1.8 and the prediction using the above equation. We find that the regression line has a slope, i.e., s, equal to 0.243 (Pa sec)1/2.

Figure 1.6 shows a comparison between the data given in Table 1.8 and the prediction assuming the ketchup behaves like a Casson fluid.

In addition, the solution to many first order differential equations can be obtained by performing an integration if the terms containing the depen- dent and independent variables are separable. So a method for numerically integrating a function can be very useful. Consider Example 1.4 where the following differential equation described how the amount of money owed to the bank (A) changes with time (t) for a given annual payment (R) and interest rate (i): dA dt iA R=- This equation can be rearranged and integrated to find the time it would take to pay off (tpayoff) the loan (A0) for given values of i and R: 00 0t payoff Apayoffdt t dA iA Ròò == - - Using the values for A0, i, and R from Example 1.4, calculate the time to pay off the loan by performing the above integration numerically.

For example, consider the classic damped harmonic oscillation described by the following second order differential equation: dx dt b dx dt ax 2 2 220++ = The above equation can be rewritten as two first order differential equations by letting z = dx/dt and dz/dt = d2x/dt2. Substituting these into the above equation, we then obtain two first order differential equations: dx dt z dz dt bz ax = =- +()2 2 Now solve these two equations for x(t) from t = 0 to t = 10 with a =1 and b =.25. Two initial conditions are also needed, so let x∣t = 0 = 1 and(dx/dt)∣t = 0 = z = 0. Solution The MATLAB program for solving this problem is shown below.* In this MATLAB solution, you will need to write a function file to define the right-hand sides of the first order * Note that this solution can also be easily generalized to the solution of multiple first order ordinary differential equations. 31 Introduction differential equations.

For example, given a function like α(x) = β, we want to find the value of x that satisfies this equation. A root finder does this for us by finding the zero of a function, i.e., f(x), defined as f(x) = α(x) − β. The root finder finds the value of x that makes f(x) = 0. In Example 1.4, we showed that the following equation gives the annual payment for given interest rate, i, initial loan amount A0, and loan period T: R iA e iT= - - 0 1 Suppose we wanted to find, for a loan amount of A0 = $65,000 and a loan period of 5 years, the annual interest rate that gives an annual payment of $18,000. The above equation cannot be solved explicitly for i, so we would need to use a root finder method in order to solve this problem. Solution The following MATLAB program shows how to solve this type of problem. In this case the annual interest rate is found to be i = 0.1381.

In one such device, i.e., the hollow fiber hemodialyzer, blood flows from an artery through the insides of a bundle of cellulose acetate fibers. Dialyzing fluid, which consists of water and various dissolved salts, flows on the outside of the fibers. Water and wastes—principally urea, creati- nine, uric acid, and phosphate ions—pass through the fiber walls into the dialyzing fluid, and 34 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering the purified blood is returned to a vein. At some time during the dialysis of a patient in kidney failure, the arterial and venous blood conditions are as follows: Arterial Blood—In Venous Blood—Out Flow rate (mL min−1) 200 195 Urea concentration (mg mL−1) 1.90 1.75 a.

If the total blood volume is 5.0 L and the average rate of urea removal is that calculated in part (a), how long must the patient be dialyzed? (Neglect the loss in total blood volume due to the removal of water in the dialyzer.) 35 Chapter 2 A review of thermodynamic concepts Thermodynamics (power from heat) as a science began its development during the nineteenth century and was first used to understand the operation of work-producing devices such as steam engines. In broadest terms, thermodynamics is concerned with the relationships between different types of energy. Here, we are mainly interested in a specialized area of thermodynamics related to solutions. But before we can understand solution thermodynamics, we first must review some basic concepts of thermodynamics that will then lead us to the relationships we need for understanding the thermodynamics of solutions. Our goal here is to understand the mathematical basis of the field and apply the most useful results to our study of biomedical engineering transport phenomena. 2.1 The first law of thermodynamics There are three general laws of thermodynamics, and these will be stated here in the forms that do not consider the effects of nuclear reactions. The first law is a statement of energy conservation and must be applied to both the system and the surroundings. In order to describe how the system and surroundings may exchange energy, we first need to define the type of system that is being considered. The most basic type of system is called an isolated system. In an isolated system, there is no exchange of mass or energy between the system and its surroundings. Therefore, for an isolated system, its energy and mass is constant. We define a closed system as a system that can exchange energy with its surroundings but not mass. Hence, the mass of a closed system does not change. The open system is defined as one that can exchange both mass and energy with its surroundings. We will discuss open systems in greater detail during our discussion of solution thermodynamics. 2.1.1 Closed systems Energy exchange between a closed system and its surroundings is in the form of heat (Q) and work (W). Careful attention must be given to the signs of Q and W. The sign convention that is used is that Q and W are positive for transfer of energy from the surroundings to the system. Hence, if heat is added to the system, or work is done on the system, then Q and W are positive. The total energy of a closed system consists of a summation of its internal energy (U) and external energies known as the potential energy (EP) and kinetic energy (EK). The potential energy depends on the position of the system in a gravitational field, and the kinetic energy is a result of sys- tem motion. The internal energy of the system is energy possessed by the molecules that make up the chemical substances within the system. These molecular energies include the kinetic energy of translation, rotation, vibration, and intermolecular forces. 36 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering With respect to the system, we are usually not really interested in the absolute values of these ener- gies but only in their changes. Hence, we can state that the change in the total energy of the system is equal to ΔU + ΔEP + ΔEK, where the Greek symbol delta (Δ) signifies the final state minus the initial state. For a closed system, the change in the total energy of the system (ΔU + ΔEP + ΔEK) must be equal to the energy transferred as heat and work with the surroundings. Equation 2.1 is therefore a statement of the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system: D DDUE EQ WPK++ =+ (2.1) If there are no changes in the kinetic and potential energies of the system, then we simply have that for a closed system DUQ W=+ (2.2) Most of the time, ΔEP and ΔEK are much smaller than ΔU, Q, and W, and we can just use Equation 2.2. The exceptions are those cases where large changes in system position or velocity are expected or desired. For an isolated system, we have ΔU = 0 since both Q and W are zero. 2.1.2 Steady flow processes We can also apply the first law of thermodynamics to the steady flow process shown in Figure 2.1. We now consider the energy changes that occur within a unit mass of material that enters at plane 1 and leaves the process at plane 2. We take our system to be this unit mass of material. The total energy of this unit mass of fluid can change as a result of changes in its internal energy, potential energy, and kinetic energy. Equation 2.1 still applies to this situation as well; however, the kinetic energy term represents the change in kinetic energy of the unit mass of flowing fluid, and the potential energy term represents the change in potential energy of the unit mass of flowing fluid due to changes in its elevation within its gravitational field. Also, it is important to remember that the work term W also includes the work done on or by the unit mass of fluid as it flows through the process. This work that is done on or by the unit mass of fluid is called the shaft work (WS).

Therefore, in Equation 2.1, W represents the shaft work as well as the work done on or by the unit mass of fluid as it enters and exits the process. Recall that work is defined as the displacement of an external force, i.e., W Fdxexternal x x =-ò 1 2 . Here, the force would be the pressure at the entrance of the process (P1) multiplied by the cross-sectional area (A1) normal to the flow of the unit mass of fluid. The displacement of our unit mass of fluid would equal the specific volume of our fluid (V1) divided by the cross-sectional area (A1). So, the work performed by the surroundings to push our unit mass of fluid into the process at the entrance is given by W PA V A PV11 1 1 1 11=´ = (2.3) Note that W1 is positive since work is done by the surroundings on the unit mass of fluid. At the exit of the process, the work is done by the system on the surroundings and W2 is given by the following expression: W PV22 2=- (2.4) For our system taken as a unit mass of fluid, we can now rewrite Equation 2.1 and obtain the follow- ing equation between planes 1 and 2 as shown in Figure 2.1: D DDUE EQ WP VP VPK S++ =+ +-11 22 (2.5) This equation can also be rearranged and written as D UPVE EQ WPK S+()++ =+DD (2.6) The combination of the internal energy (U) and the quantity PV is defined as the enthalpy (H), and we can write Equation 2.6 as D DDHE EQ WPK S++ =+ (2.7) In many cases, as mentioned earlier, the changes in the potential and kinetic energy of the fluid are negligible in comparison to the other terms, so Equation 2.7 simplifies to DHQ WS=+ (2.8) Equations 2.7 and 2.8 are expressions of the first law of thermodynamics for steady flow processes, as shown in Figure 2.1. Recall that for a closed nonflow system, the first law is given by Equations 2.1 and 2.2. As written, Equations 2.2 and 2.8 apply for finite changes in the energy quantities ΔU and ΔH. We will find it useful later to work with differential changes of these energy quantities, and Equations 2.2 and 2.8 may then be written in their differential form as dUdQdWand dH dQ dWS=+ =+ (2.9) 38 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 2.2 The second law of thermodynamics The second law of thermodynamics states that there is a property of matter called the entropy (S) and that for any process, the sum of the entropy changes of the system and the surroundings (i.e., ΔSTotal) is always greater than or equal to zero. Therefore, entropy is not conserved like energy. No process is feasible if the total change in entropy is less than zero. This statement of the second law of ther- modynamics is given by the following equation: D DDSS STotalSystemSurroundings=+ ³ 0 (2.10) For an isolated system, there is no exchange of mass or energy between the system and the surround- ings, so ΔSSurroundings = 0 and ΔSSystem (isolated) ≥ 0. At the molecular level, entropy is a measure of disorder. The more disorder, the higher the entropy. It is important to recognize that a system can become more organized (ΔSSystem < 0); however, there must be an even greater increase in the disorder of the surroundings such that in an overall sense, Equation 2.10 is satisfied. The third law of thermodynamics sets a lower limit on the entropy. The third law states that at a temperature of absolute zero, the entropy for a perfectly ordered crystal of a given substance is zero. 2.2.1 Reversible processes Processes for which ΔSTotal > 0 are known as irreversible processes, whereas processes for which ΔSTotal = 0 are known as reversible processes. A reversible process is one that can be reversed by an infinitesimal change in the variable that controls the process; in other words, the system is only infinitesimally removed from its equilibrium state. In thermodynamics, an equilibrium state is defined as one in which there is no tendency for change on a macroscopic scale. For example, for a mechanically reversible process, imagine a frictionless piston that confines a gas within a cylinder closed at one end. At equilibrium, the pressure of the gas within the cylinder exactly balances the weight of the piston and the pressure of the surroundings. A  reversible expansion of this gas requires that the pressure within the cylinder be increased an infinitesimal amount. Similarly, a reversible compression requires that the pressure of the surround- ings be increased by an infinitesimal amount. The driving force for the reversible expansion or compression of the gas within the cylinder is the infinitesimal difference in pressure between the confined gas and the surroundings. Similarly, thermal equilibrium requires that an object and its surroundings be at the same tempera- ture. Reversible heat transfer occurs when the object and its surroundings differ in temperature by an infinitesimal amount, the driving force being the infinitesimal difference in temperature between the object and its surroundings. A reversible process is an idealization since no real process is reversible. However, it is a useful concept since it does allow us to set limits on a real process and perform useful calculations. For example, for a mechanically reversible process like the piston and cylinder example discussed ear- lier, the work term in Equations 2.1 and 2.2 can be evaluated as follows. Recall that work is defined as the displacement of an external force, i.e., W Fdxexternal x x =-ò 1 2 . Then, for the reversible work, we 39 A review of thermodynamic concepts can replace the external force by the product of the gas pressure, P, and the cross-sectional area of the cylinder, A, which gives the force generated by the gas pressure within the cylinder. Since the external and internal forces are only infinitesimally different, then Fexternal = PA. The differential displacement of the piston (i.e., dx) by the expanding or contracting gas within the cylinder would be equivalent to the differential change in volume of the gas divided by the cross-sectional area of cylinder, i.e., dx = dV/A. Therefore, Equation 2.11 results for the mechanically reversible work of the gas contained within our piston cylinder system: W PdVReversible V V =-ò 1 2 (2.11) or in differential form, we can say that dWReversible = −P dV. Provided we know how the pressure P varies with the change in the volume, we can evaluate the integral in Equation 2.11 and obtain the reversible work, WReversible. Example 2.1 Consider the reversible expansion or compression of 1 mole of an ideal gas at constant tem- perature (isothermal) from an initial volume, V1, to a final volume, V2. Find an expression for the heat and work effects of this reversible isothermal process. Solution For an isothermal process involving an ideal gas, there is no change in the internal energy since the temperature is constant, so ΔU = 0, and from Equation 2.2 for a reversible process, we have that Q = −WReversible. For an ideal gas, we can also use the ideal gas law with P = RT/V and substitute this into Equation 2.11. On integration, we obtain the following equations for the heat and reversible work per mole of gas: QW RT V dV RT V V RT P P Reversible V V =- == æ è ç ö ø ÷ = æ è ç ö ø ÷ò 1 2 2 1 1 2 ln ln 2.3 Properties Through the previous discussion of the three laws of thermodynamics, we have introduced three new properties of matter. These are the internal energy (U), enthalpy (H), and entropy (S). Along with the pressure (P), volume (V), and temperature (T), these are all known as properties or state variables. State variables only depend on the state of the system and not on how one arrived at that state. Q and W (or WS) are not properties since, according to Equations 2.2 and 2.8, one can envision different processes or paths involving the transfer of Q and W (or WS), all giving the same change in the internal energy (ΔU), the enthalpy (ΔH), or the entropy (ΔS). Therefore, Q and W (or WS) are path-dependent quantities and depend on how the process is actually carried out. For example, for a mechanically reversible process, Equation 2.11 allows calculation of the work, provided one knows how P changes with V. 40 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering For a pure substance, only two of these properties (i.e., T, P, V, U, and S) need to be specified in order to define completely the thermodynamic state of the substance. Our equation of state also provides an additional relationship between P, V, and T. Usually, we fix the state of a pure com- ponent by specifying the temperature and the pressure. So, from the equation of state, we can calculate the volume. Other properties, such as internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy, are also known since they too will depend only on the temperature and pressure, as shown in the following discussion. 2.3.1 Heat capacity Calculating the changes in the internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy is facilitated by the definition of heat capacities. The heat capacity relates the change in temperature of an object to the amount of heat that was added to it. However, heat (Q) is not a property but is dependent on how the process of heat transfer was carried out. So, it is convenient to define heat capacity in such a manner that it too is a property. Therefore, we have two types of heat capacity, one defined at constant volume (CV) and the other defined at constant pressure (CP), as given by the following equations: C U T Heat capacity at constant volumeV V º ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ (2.12) C H T Heat capacity at constant pressureP P º ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ (2.13) Since CV and CP only depend on properties, they are also properties of a substance and their values for specific substances may be found or estimated as described in such reference books as Poling et al. (2001). For monoatomic gases, CP is approximately (5/2)R, and for diatomic gases like nitro- gen, oxygen, and air, CP is approximately (7/2)R. We will also show in Example 2.2 that for an ideal gas, CP = CV + R. Now, for a constant volume process, or for any process where the final volume is the same as the initial volume, Equation 2.12, when integrated, tells us that the change in internal energy is given by DUC dT T T V= ò 1 2 (2.14) If the process occurs reversibly and at constant volume, i.e., the volume never changes, then from Equation 2.11, WReversible = 0, and Q = ΔU. So, for a constant volume process, the heat transferred is equal to the change in the internal energy. In a similar manner, for the constant pressure process, or a process in which the initial and final pres- sures are the same, Equation 2.13 can be integrated to obtain the change in enthalpy: DHC dT T T P= ò 1 2 (2.15) 41 A review of thermodynamic concepts If the process occurs reversibly and at constant pressure, i.e., the pressure never changes, then from Equations 2.2 and 2.11, we have that WReversible = −P ΔV and that ΔU = Q − P ΔV or Q = ΔH. Hence, for a constant pressure process, the heat transferred is equal to the change in the enthalpy. 2.3.2 Calculating the change in entropy The entropy change of a closed system during a reversible process has been shown to be given by the following equation: DS dQ T Reversible= ò (2.16) In differential form, we can write this as dQReversible = T dS. 2.3.2.1 Entropy change of an ideal gas We can use Equation 2.16 to calculate the entropy change for a substance. First, we consider an ideal gas and assume that we have 1 mole of gas and write the first law of thermodynamics for a reversible process as dU = dQReversible – P dV = T dS – P dV. Next, we use the definition of enthalpy (H = U + PV) and write this in differential form, i.e., dH = dU + P dV + V dP. Next, we replace dU with T dS – P dV in this equation for dH to obtain the following expression for dS: dS dH T V T dP=- (2.17) For 1 mole of an ideal gas, we know that dH = CP dT, and from the ideal gas law, V/T = R/P, so Equation 2.17 becomes dSC dT T R dP P P=- (2.18) This equation can then be integrated from an initial state (T1, P1) to a final state (T2, P2) as given by DSC dT T R P P T T P=- æ è ç ö ø ÷ò 1 2 2 1 ln (2.19) Note, all that is needed to calculate the entropy change of an ideal gas is the heat capacity CP. Also, at constant P, DSC dT/TP T T = ()ò 1 2 . For a constant volume process, we can use the fact that from the ideal gas law dP/P = R dT/PV = dT/T and from Example 2.2, we have that for an ideal gas, CP = CV + R, so when these two relationships are used in Equation 2.18 and the result is integrated, we obtain DSC dT/TV T T = ()ò 1 2 for the constant volume process. It is important to note that although we started the derivation of Equations 2.18 and 2.19 assuming a reversible process, the resulting equations only contain properties and are therefore independent 42 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering of how the process was actually carried out between the initial state of (T1, P1) and the final state of (T2, P2). Therefore, Equations 2.18 and 2.19 can be used to calculate the entropy change of an ideal gas regardless of whether or not the process is reversible. Example 2.2 Calculate the final temperature and the work produced for the reversible adiabatic expansion of 10 mol of an ideal gas from 10 atm and 500 K to a final pressure of 1 atm. Assume that CV = (5/2)R and that the heat capacity ratio γ = CP/CV is also a constant and equal to 1.4. Solution Since the process is reversible, we can state that ΔSTotal = ΔSSystem + ΔSSurroundings = 0. An adia- batic process means that there is no heat transfer (i.e., Q = 0) between the system (i.e., the gas) and its surroundings. Therefore, ΔSSurroundings = 0 and we then have that ΔSSystem = 0. A process for which ΔSSystem = 0 is also called an isentropic process. Next, we can use Equation 2.19 and set that equal to zero and obtain C T T R P P P ln ln 2 1 2 1 æ è ç ö ø ÷ = æ è ç ö ø ÷ Next, we solve this equation for the final temperature T2, which is given by T T P P P P RCP 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 = æ è ç ö ø ÷ = æ è ç ö ø ÷ -()//gg Note that we have used the fact that since H = U + PV, then for an ideal gas, H = U + RT and dH = dU + R dT. Since dH = CP dT and dU = CV dT, we have for an ideal gas that CP = CV + R. The heat capacity ratio is defined by γ = CP/CV. We can now use the previous equation to cal- culate the final temperature of the gas following the reversible expansion: TK atm atm K2 14 11 4 500 1 10 258 98= æ è ç ö ø ÷ = -()./ . . Next, we can calculate the amount of work that is done by the 10 mol of gas. For a closed sys- tem, we have from the first law of thermodynamics that n ΔU = Q + W, where n is the number of moles of gas. Since the process is adiabatic, then Q = 0 and W = n ΔU = n CV (T2 − T1). Now CV = (5/2)R, and using the value of R = 8.314 J mol−1 K−1 from Table 1.6 gives a value of CV = 20.78 J mol−1 K−1. So the work effect of this expansion can now be calculated as W molJ molK K JkJ =´ ´-() =- =- --10 20 78 258 98 500 50 084 50 084 11.. ,. In this example, the system is doing work on the surroundings, so the sign is negative. The change in the internal energy is also the same as the work in this case, so the energy used to perform work by the system is at the expense of the internal energy of the gas. That is why the final temperature of the gas is much lower than the initial temperature of the gas. 43 A review of thermodynamic concepts 2.3.3 The Gibbs and Helmholtz free energy In addition to the internal energy (U), entropy (S), and enthalpy (H = U + PV), there are two addi- tional properties that can be derived from the primary properties of P, V, T, U, and S. These are the Gibbs free energy (G) and the Helmholtz free energy (A). 2.3.3.1 Gibbs free energy The Gibbs free energy (G) is also a property and is defined in terms of the enthalpy, temperature, and entropy as G = H − TS or G = U + PV − TS. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) at constant temperature can be calculated from the change in the enthalpy and entropy as ΔG = ΔH − T ΔS. The Gibbs free energy can be shown to equal the maximum amount of use- ful work that can be obtained from a reversible process at constant T and P. This can be shown as follows. We have at constant temperature and pressure that ΔG = ΔH − T ΔS = ΔU + P ΔV − T ΔS. But for a reversible process at constant temperature, we also know that ΔU = QReversible + WReversible = T ΔS + WReversible. Therefore, ΔG = WReversible + P ΔV. At constant pressure, −P ΔV represents the work (WPV) as a result of any volume changes that occur in the system. So, we define the useful work over and above any PV work as WUseful = WReversible − WPV = ΔG. The Gibbs free energy is also useful for determining whether or not a given process will occur at constant temperature and pressure. For example, from the second law of thermodynamics, we know that for an isolated system, ΔS = (QReversible/T) ≥ 0. From the first law of thermodynamics, we know that for a reversible process at constant pressure, QReversible = ΔU + P ΔV = ΔH. Therefore, we have that ΔS ≥ ΔH/T or ΔH − T ΔS ≤ 0. But ΔH − T ΔS is the same as ΔG at constant temperature, so ΔG ≤ 0. We thus obtain the following criterion for determining the feasibility of a given process at constant temperature and pressure: Spontaneous processG Equilibrium G Nospontaneous proces D D < = 0 0 , , ssGD> 0. (2.20) 2.3.3.2 Helmholtz free energy The Helmholtz free energy (A) is defined in terms of the internal energy, temperature, and entropy as A = U − TS. The Helmholtz free energy is useful for determin- ing whether or not a given process will occur at constant temperature and volume. The criterion for feasibility of a process at constant temperature and volume is Spontaneous processA Equilibrium A Nospontaneous process D D D < = 0 0 AA > 0 (2.21) 2.4 The fundamental property relations With this background on the first and second laws of thermodynamics, we can now develop what are known as the fundamental property relations for 1 mole of a single fluid phase of constant composition. From Equation 2.9 in differential form, we have that dU = dQ + dW. 44 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering For a reversible process (cf. Equations 2.11 and 2.16), we also have that dQReversible = T dS and dWReversible = −P dV. Hence dUT dS PdV=- (2.22) As we discussed before, even though this equation was derived for the special case of a reversible process, since it only contains properties of the system, it is valid for all processes, reversible or not. Now, since H = U + PV, we can differentiate this to obtain dH = dU + P dV + V dP. We can then substitute for dU from Equation 2.22 to obtain dH = T dS − P dV + P dV + V dP. So, we obtain that dH = T dS + V dP. Next, we have that G = H − TS, so then dG = dH − T dS − S dT. Using the relationship we just obtained for dH, we then get that dG = T dS + V dP − T dS − S dT and obtain the result that dG = −S dT + V dP. Finally, since A = U − TS, we then have dA = dU − T dS − S dT. Using Equation 2.22, we get dA = T dS − P dV − T dS − S dT and we obtain that dA = −P dV − S dT. So, for 1 mole of a single fluid phase of constant composition, we can state our fundamental property relationships as follows: dUT dS PdV=- (2.23) dHT dS VdP=+ (2.24) dGS dT VdP=- + (2.25) dAP dV SdT=- - (2.26) These equations also provide functional relationships for U, H, G, and A. Therefore, we have that U = U(S, V), H = H(S, P), G = G(T, P), and A = A(V, T). 2.4.1 Exact differentials The fundamental property relations shown earlier are also exact differentials. Recall from calculus that the total differential of a function F(x, y) is given by dF F x dx F y dy MdxN dy y x = ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ =+ (2.27) with M = (∂F/∂x)y and N = (∂F/∂y)x. We can also differentiate M and N with respect to y and x and obtain ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¶ ¶¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¶ ¶¶ M y F yx and N x F xy x y 22 (2.28) Because the order of the differentiation with respect to x and y in the above equations is not impor- tant, we obtain ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ M y N x x y , (2.29) 45 A review of thermodynamic concepts which is the criterion for exactness of the total differential given by Equation 2.27. We can now use Equation 2.29 on our fundamental property relations given in Equations 2.23 through 2.26 to obtain a set of relationships between our properties. These relationships are known as the Maxwell equa- tions and several of these, derived from Equations 2.23 through 2.26, are ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ =- ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ T V P S T P V S V T SV SP P ==- ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ S P P T S V T VT (2.30) The Maxwell equations and the fundamental property relations are useful for deriving thermody- namic relationships between the various properties. The following example illustrates this. Example 2.3 Obtain expressions for the T and P dependence of the enthalpy and the entropy, i.e., H(T, P) and S(T, P). Solution The approach is to use the fundamental property relations and the Maxwell equations to obtain final expressions that only depend on P, V, T and the heat capacity, CP. P, V, and T in these final expressions can then be related by an equation of state, the simplest being the ideal gas law for which PV = RT, or experimental PVT data. With this as our strategy, we first take the total differential of H and S and obtain dH H T dT H P dP anddS S T dT S PPT P = ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö øø ÷T dP Now, since (∂H/∂T)P = CP, from Equation 2.24 we can also get that ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = H T T S T and S TT H T C TPP PP P1 From Equation 2.24, we can also write that (∂H/∂P)T = T(∂S/∂P)T + V. Using the third Maxwell equation in Equation 2.30, replace (∂S/∂P)T with − (∂V/∂T)P and we then have that (∂H/∂P)T = V − T(∂V/∂T)P. Our expressions for dH and dS can then be written as follows: dHC dT VT V T dP anddSC dT T V T dPP P P P =+ - ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú =- ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ 46 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering These equations can be integrated to obtain the change in the enthalpy and entropy between two states, (T1, P1) and (T2, P2): D DHC dT VT V T dP andS C dT T T T P P P P T T P P =+ - ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú =-òò ò 1 2 1 2 1 2 11 2P P V T dPò ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ These equations provide the temperature and pressure dependence for the enthalpy and entropy for 1 mole of a single phase fluid of constant composition. The heat capacity and experimen- tal PVT data, or an equation of state, is needed to solve these equations. For the special case of an ideal gas, we can use the fact that PV = RT and that for an ideal gas (∂V/∂T)P = R/P. On substituting this expression into the previous equations, we obtain the following results for an ideal gas: D DHC dT andS C dT T R P P T T P T T P== - æ è ç ö ø ÷òò 1 2 1 2 2 1 ln Note that we obtain the result that, for an ideal gas, the enthalpy and, for that matter, the inter- nal energy only depend on temperature. However, the entropy of an ideal gas depends on both the temperature and the pressure. Also, note that this result for ΔS for the special case of the ideal gas is the same result we obtained earlier as Equation 2.19. 2.5 Single phase open systems Now, suppose that we have a single phase open system containing N chemical substances. For an open system, there can be an exchange of matter between the system and the surroundings. Therefore, the composition or the number of moles of each substance present in the system can change. Let n represent the total moles of these N chemical substances that are present. So, for a total of n moles and any property M, we can state that nM = nM (T, P, n1, n2, n3,…, nN) and ni rep- resent the moles of each substance that is present in the system. This tells us that the property M depends on the temperature, the pressure, and the number of moles of each species present in the solution. The total differential of nM is then given by d nM nM T dT nM P dP nM n Pn Tn i i () = ¶ () ¶ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú + ¶ () ¶ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú + ¶ () ¶å ,, éé ë ê ê ù û ú úTP n i j dn ,, (2.31) In the last term of Equation 2.31, the summation is over all substances that are present, and the partial derivative within the bracketed term in the summation is taken with respect to substance i, at temperature, pressure, and the number of moles of all other substances held constant. 47 A review of thermodynamic concepts 2.5.1 Partial molar properties In solution thermodynamics, the partial derivative of a property (M) with respect to the number of moles of a given substance (ni) is called a partial molar property Mi( ) and, in general, is defined by the following equation: M nM n i i TP n j = ¶ () ¶ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú ,, (2.32) Of particular interest in subsequent discussions is the partial molar Gibbs free energy (Gi), which is also known as the chemical potential (μi) of component i in the mixture. The chemical potential is therefore defined as mii i TP n G nG n j == ¶ () ¶ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú ,, (2.33) We can use Equation 2.32 and rewrite Equation 2.31 as follows: d nM nM T dT nM P dP Mdn Pn Tn i ii() = ¶ () ¶ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú + ¶ () ¶ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú +å ,, (2.34) Next, we can define the mole fraction of substance i* as xi = ni/n, so ni = xin and ∑ixi = 1. We also have that dni = xi dn + n dxi and d(nM) = n dM + M dn. Using these relations, and recognizing that n in the first two bracketed terms of Equation 2.34 is constant, Equation 2.34 can be rearranged into the following form: dM M T dT M P dP Mdxn Mx Px Tx i ii i i- ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ - ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ - é ë ê ê ù û ú ú +-åå ,, MMdni é ë ê ê ù û ú ú = 0 (2.35) Since n and dn are arbitrary, the only way that Equation 2.35 can be satisfied is for both bracketed terms to equal zero. Hence, we obtain the following two equations: dM M T dT M P dP Mdx Px Tx i ii= ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ +å ,, , (2.36) M xM or nM nM i ii i ii==åå (2.37) * Note that most of the time x is used to denote liquid phase mole fractions and y is used for vapor or gas phase mole fractions. 48 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Now Equation 2.36 is nothing more than Equation 2.34 written on a mole fraction basis. Equation 2.37, however, shows how the mixture property M depends on the composition of the solution. Note that the mixture property is a mole fraction or mole-weighted average of the component partial molar property Mi. The partial molar property for component i represents the property value for that component as it exists in the solution, which can be quite different from the pure component value of that property, Mi. From Equation 2.37, we can also write that dMx dM Mdxii ii ii=å å+ . Using this relationship along with Equation 2.36 results in ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ -=å M T dT M P dP xdM Px Tx i ii ,, 0 (2.38) Equation 2.38 places another restriction on the property changes for a single phase solution. This equation is known as the Gibbs-Duhem equation and can be used to test the thermodynamic consis- tency of experimental mixture property data, since this equation must be satisfied. For the special case of constant temperature and pressure, we have that i iixdMå = 0 (2.39) 2.5.1.1 Binary systems To illustrate the application of the previous equations, let us apply them to a binary solution at constant temperature and pressure. For a binary solution, we can write from Equation 2.37 that M xM xM anddMx dM Mdxx dM Mdx=+ =+ ++11 22 11 11 22 22 (2.40) The Gibbs-Duhem equation for a binary system can be written as follows: xdMx dM11 22 0+= (2.41) Since x1 + x2 = 1 and dx1 = −dx2, we can combine Equations 2.40 and 2.41 and obtain dMM dx Mdxor dM dx MM=- =-11 21 1 12 (2.42) Now we can solve for M1 and M2 from Equation 2.40 and substitute these results into Equation 2.42 to obtain the following expressions for M1 and M2: M Mx dM dx andM Mx dM dx 11 1 21 1 1=+ -() =- (2.43) The above equations are very important since they allow for the calculation at constant tempera- ture and pressure of the partial molar properties M1 and M2 from the composition dependence of the mixture property M.

Note that dM/dx x 1 11( ) ® and dM/dx x 1 12( ) ® are the respective tangents of the M curve as x2 → 0 and x1 → 0. 2.5.1.2 Property changes of mixing The difference between the mixture property value (M) and the mole fraction (yi) weighted sum of the pure component property values (∑iyiMi) evaluated at the same T and P is known as the property change of mixing (ΔMmix) and is given by the following equation: DMy My MM yM mix i ii i ii i ii=-= -åå å (2.44) 2.5.1.3 Ideal gas The previous relationships are valid for describing the solution behavior of real solutions whether they are solids, liquids, or gases. Now let us see what these relationships tell us for the special case of an ideal gas. Recall that the ideal gas model assumes that the molecules have negligible volume and that the molecules do not interact with one another. In other words, each species in the ideal gas acts as if no other species are present and all of the gas molecules can move independently within the whole volume (VT) of the container. Consider an ideal gas consisting of a total of n moles and N components at a given temperature T and in a total volume VT. We know from the ideal gas law that P = nRT/VT. For the same value of the temperature, each of the ni moles of component i considered separately will also occupy the same total volume VT. Therefore, each component i exerts a contribution to the total pressure P called the 0x1 1 M M2 M1 M2 ∞ M1 ∞ Figure 2.2 Partial molar properties in a binary system at constant T and P. 50 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering partial pressure (Pi), which is given by Pi = niRT/VT. The ratio of Pi to P is given by Pi/P = ni/n = yi, which defines the gas phase mole fraction of component i in the mixture, i.e., yi. Hence, we obtain the fact that the partial pressure of component i in an ideal gas mixture is given by the following relationship: Py Pwith y n n P P ii i ii== = (2.45) Since the ∑iyi = 1, then ∑iPi = P, or the sum of the partial pressures of all components equals the total pressure. In addition, we can deduce that for an ideal gas, the partial molar volume for component i is VVRT/Pi ideal gas i ideal gas== . Since Vn VTi i i ideal gas=å , then we have that Vn Vn RT/P nRT/PTi i i ideal gas ii=å =å () = , and we see that this definition of the ideal gas partial molar volume satisfies the ideal gas law for the mixture. Therefore, for an ideal gas, the partial molar volume is the same for all components and is equal to RT/P. With the exception of the volume, for any other property, the partial molar value of the property for component i in an ideal gas mixture at T and P is the same as the corresponding pure component molar property at the mixture temperature and at a pressure that is equal to that component’s partial pressure in the mixture, i.e., M T, PM T, Pi ideal gas i ideal gas i() = () (2.46) In Example 2.3, we showed that for an ideal gas the enthalpy and the internal energy do not depend on the pressure. Furthermore, since there are no molecular interactions in an ideal gas, the enthalpy or internal energy of component i in the mixture for a given T and P is the same as its pure component value at T and Pi. Therefore, for an ideal gas, we can state that H T, PH TP andU T, PU TPi i ideal gas ii i ideal gas i() = () () = (),, , where Hi ideal gas and Ui ideal gas represent the pure component ideal gas values of the enthalpy and internal energy at the mixture T and at compo- nent i’s partial pressure, Pi. Hence from Equation 2.37, for an ideal gas mixture we have that H yH andU yU ideal gas i i i ideal gasideal gas i i i ideal gas==åå (2.47) and this can be generalized using Equation 2.46 for any ideal gas property M as M T, Py MT P ideal gas i i i ideal gas i() = ()å , (2.48) We also saw in Example 2.3 that the entropy of an ideal gas depends on the pressure and the tem- perature. Consider pure component i at T and Pi. We can ask what is the entropy change for compo- nent i when it is placed in an ideal gas mixture at T and P? Since the T is constant and the pressure changes from Pi to P, we can use the result for the entropy change of an ideal gas that was obtained in Example 2.3, i.e., DSS T, PS T, PR P P i ideal gas i ideal gas i ideal gas i i = () - () =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ln ==- æ è ç ö ø ÷ =R P yP Ry i iln ln (2.49) 51 A review of thermodynamic concepts and after rearranging we obtain the result that S T, PS T, PR yi ideal gas i i ideal gas i() = ()- ln (2.50) Using Equation 2.48, we then obtain the following expression for the entropy of an ideal gas mixture: S yS T, PR yy ideal gas i i i ideal gas i ii= ()-åå ln (2.51) Example 2.4 Determine an expression for the enthalpy, internal energy, and entropy change that occurs when N pure components at T and P are mixed to form 1 mole of a solution at the same T and P. Assume that the pure components and the resulting mixture are ideal gases. Solution Equation 2.44 defines the property change of mixing as DMM yM mix i ii=-å Comparing the above equation with Equation 2.47 shows that the enthalpy and internal energy change of mixing is zero for the formation of an ideal gas mixture from its pure components. However, using Equation 2.51, the entropy change of mixing for this case is given by DSS yS T, PR yy mix ideal gas i i i ideal gas i ii=- () =-åå ln The −R∑iyi ln yi term is always positive, indicating that the process of mixing results in an increase in the entropy of the system. Since the enthalpy of mixing is also zero, there is no change in the entropy of the surroundings, so the total entropy change is also positive. Therefore, mixing these pure ideal gas components is an irreversible process. 2.5.1.4 Gibbs free energy of an ideal gas mixture With the entropy of an ideal gas mixture given by Equation 2.51, we can now calculate the Gibbs free energy of an ideal gas mixture, i.e., Gideal gas = Hideal gas − T Sideal gas. Using the above-mentioned relationships that were derived for Hideal gas and Sideal gas, we can obtain the following expression for the Gibbs free energy of an ideal gas mixture: Gy HT yS Ry y ideal gas i i i ideal gas i i i ideal gas i ii=- - æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷åå å ln (2.52) which can also be written as follows, since GH TSi ideal gas i ideal gas i ideal gas=- : Gy GRTy y ideal gas i i i ideal gas i ii=+åå ln (2.53) 52 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Comparing Equation 2.53 with Equations 2.46 and 2.48, we see that the partial molar Gibbs free energy, or the chemical potential, of component i in an ideal gas mixture is then given by mi ideal gas i ideal gas i ideal gas iGG RT y== + ln (2.54) We also know from our fundamental property relations (see Equation 2.25) for pure component i at constant T that dGV dP RT/P dP RTdPi ideal gas i ideal gas== () = ()ln . This result can be integrated from an arbitrary pressure P0 to the pressure P to give the following result for the pure component Gibbs free energy of an ideal gas: GG RT PRTP GRT P P i ideal gas i ideal gas i ideal gas=-()+= + 0 0 0,,ln ln ln 00 0 0 =+mi ideal gas RT P P , ln (2.55) where Gori ideal gas i ideal gas00,,m depends only on the temperature and is the Gibbs free energy or chemical potential per mole of pure component i at a pressure equal to P0. Combining the previous result with Equation 2.54 provides the following alternative expression for the chemical potential of component i in an ideal gas mixture at T and P relative to a reference pressure P0: mmi ideal gas i ideal gas iRT yP P =+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ 0 0 , ln (2.56) 2.5.2 Pure component fugacity For a pure component (i.e., yi = 1) in the ideal gas state, Equation 2.56 tells us that the pure component Gibbs free energy of an ideal gas is given by the following expression: GRTP RT Pi ideal gas i ideal gas=-()+m0 0 , ln ln . This result can be generalized to the real gas by defining a new property called the pure component fugacity (fi) to replace the pressure P. The fugacity may be thought of as a “corrected” pressure that provides the value of the pure component Gibbs free energy of a real gas at pressure P. Therefore, the following expression defines the pure component fugacity for a real gas: GRTP RT fi i ideal gas i=-()+m0 0 , ln ln (2.57) Now, if we subtract Equation 2.55 from Equation 2.57, we obtain the following result: GG RT f P RTi i ideal gas i i-= =ln lnf (2.58) The pure component fugacity coefficient, ϕi, is defined as the ratio of the pure component fugacity, fi, to the pressure, P. Therefore, ϕi = fi/P. Clearly, we see that for an ideal gas, the pure component fugacity, fi, is equal to the pressure, or f Pi ideal gas = and fi ideal gas = 1. The difference in the Gibbs free energy in Equation 2.58, i.e., GGi i ideal gas- , defines what is also called a residual property or in this case the residual Gibbs free energy, GG Gi R i i ideal gas=- , where 53 A review of thermodynamic concepts both Gand Gi i ideal gas are evaluated at the same T and P. This leads to the following general definition of a residual property as the difference between the actual value of a property and its value in the ideal gas state: M MM Rideal gas=- (2.59) Equation 2.59 applies to any of our properties, i.e., U, H, S, G, A, V. 2.5.2.1 Calculating the pure component fugacity As shown in the following development, the pure component fugacity (fi) can be calculated from experimental PVT data or an appropriate equa- tion of state. First, it is convenient to define the compressibility factor (Z), which describes the deviation of a real gas from the ideal gas state. The compressibility factor is a dimensionless quan- tity and is defined by Z PV RT = (2.60) Note that for an ideal gas, Z = 1. A variety of equation of states have been developed for calculating the compressibility factor for real gases and liquids at high pressures (Poling et al., 2001). To determine the pure component fugacity (fi), we expand this differential, i.e., d(G/RT), and we obtain d G RT RTdG GRdT RT RT dG G RT dT æ è ç ö ø ÷ = - () =- 2 2 1 , (2.61) and then substituting for dG from Equation 2.25 and recognizing that G = H − TS, we have that d G RT V RT dP H RT dT æ è ç ö ø ÷ =- 2 (2.62) From this equation, we can also write the following additional relationships at constant pressure and constant temperature: H RT T G/RT T and V RT G/RT P PT =- ¶ () ¶ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú = ¶ () ¶ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú (2.63) The above relationships are also valid for the residual properties GR, HR, and VR as well by simply adding a superscript to the property. Now the residual volume, VR, is defined as V − Videal gas. So, we can write the residual volume as follows, using the definition from Equation 2.60 for the compressibility factor: V RT P Z R =-()1 (2.64) 54 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Using the previous relationships, we can now obtain the following expressions for the residual prop- erties. First, we can take the second expression in Equation 2.63 at constant temperature and write it for the residual property. Then, we integrate at constant temperature from zero pressure (GR is equal to zero since this is an ideal gas state) to any pressure P: G RT V RT dP Z dP P constant T R P R P == -() ()òò 00 1 (2.65) To obtain the residual enthalpy, we can use the first expression in Equation 2.63. Next, we evaluate [∂(GR/RT)/∂T]P using Equation 2.65 and then we obtain H RT T Z T dP P constant T R P P =- ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ ()ò 0 (2.66) Since TSR = HR − GR, we can also write that SR/R = (HR/RT) − (GR/RT) and we can use these relation- ships for HR and GR to obtain S R T Z T dP P Z dP P constant T R P P P =- ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ --() ()òò 00 1 (2.67) Equations 2.65 through 2.67 are very important relationships since they allow us to calculate the real property value M from the residual property value MR and the ideal gas property value Mideal gas. Provided we have experimental PVT data, or an appropriate equation of state, we can use these equations to calculate the values of the Gibbs free energy, the enthalpy, and the entropy for real gases and even liquids at high pressures. In addition, we can also use Equation 2.65 to now calculate the fugacity of a pure component at any T and P. Comparing Equation 2.65 with Equation 2.58, we see that Equation 2.65 is also equal to the natural logarithm of the fugacity coefficient (ϕi) or fi/P, i.e., ln lnfi i P f P Z dP P = æ è ç ö ø ÷ =-()ò 0 1 (2.68) Therefore, Equation 2.68 allows us to determine the fugacity of a pure component at any T and P from knowledge of its PVT behavior. Example 2.5 Obtain an expression for the fugacity coefficient using the pressure explicit form of the virial equation of state truncated after the second coefficient. If the second virial coefficient B( ) of a particular gas is −0.01 atm−1, calculate the compressibility factor and the fugacity of this gas at a temperature of 500 K and a pressure of 10 atm. 55 A review of thermodynamic concepts Solution The simplest equation of state for a real gas is the virial equation of state given by the follow- ing volume and pressure explicit forms: Z B V C V D V ZBPCPDP =+ ++ + =+ ++ + 1 1 23 23 \u0000 \u0000 where B, C, D and BC D,, are known as the second, third, and fourth virial coefficients, respectively, and are only a function of temperature. If we truncate the above series after the second coefficient, then we have for the pressure explicit form that ZBPorZ BP=+ -=11 . Using Equation 2.68, we then obtain ln fi P BdPBP==ò 0 Hence, the value of Z = 1 − 0.01 atm−1 × 10 atm = 0.90, and the fugacity coefficient and fugac- ity is calculated as ln .. ., f ff i i i ii atmatm andsince f P then f =- ´= - == = -001100 10 0 905 0 1 .. .905 10 905´=atmatm and we see that the fugacity of this gas at these conditions is 9.05 atm compared to 10 atm if the gas were an ideal gas. 2.5.3 Fugacity of a component in a mixture For a component in a mixture of real gases or a liquid solution, we can generalize Equation 2.57 for an ideal gas mixture to provide the fugacity of component i as it exists in the real mixture: mmi i ideal gas iRT PRTf=-()+ 0 0 , ln ln \u0000 (2.69) where ˆfi is defined as the fugacity of component i as it exists in the mixture. We can also solve Equation 2.57 for the value of mi ideal gas RT P 0 0 , ln-( ) in terms of the pure component values of Gi and fi to obtain miii i i GG RT f f == + æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ ln \u0000 (2.70) Equation 2.70 shows the relationship between the chemical potential of component i as it exists in the mixture in terms of its pure component Gibbs free energy and fugacity (Gi and fi) and its mixture fugacity (ˆfi). 56 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Now, if we subtract Equation 2.56 from Equation 2.69 for the same T and P, we obtain mm fi i ideal gas i R i i iGRT f yP RT-= = æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ =ln ln \u0000 \u0000 (2.71) where f\u0000 \u0000 i iif/yP= is defined as the component fugacity coefficient. For component i in an ideal gas, f\u0000 i = 1 since mmi i ideal gas= , and we have f fy Pi i ideal gas i\u0000 \u0000== (2.72) We can calculate the values of f\u0000 i provided we have mixture PVT data or an equation of state that describes the mixture (Poling et al., 2001). To see how this is done, we can rewrite Equation 2.65 for n moles of our mixture as follows: nG RT nZ n dP P constant T R P =-() ()ò 0 (2.73) Then, from Equation 2.71, we have that ln ,, f¶ ¶\u0000 i i RR i TP n G/RT /RTnG/ n j == () ()é ë ù û 1 , which allows us to perform this operation on Equation 2.73, giving the following result: ln , ,, f\u0000 i P i TP n P i nZ n n dP P Z dP P j = ¶-() ¶ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú =-()òò 00 1 (2.74) with the partial molar compressibility factor ZnZ/ nand n/ nii TP n i j = ()éë ùû =¶¶ ¶¶ ,, 1. Provided we have mixture PVT data or a mixture equation of state, we can use Equation 2.74 to calculate the compo- nent fugacity coefficient (Poling et al., 2001). 2.5.4 The ideal solution The ideal solution model includes ideal gas mixtures as well as liquids and solids. The ideal solution model is useful for describing mixtures of substances whose molecules do not differ much in their size and chemical nature. For example, a liquid solution of ethanol and propanol would be expected to form an ideal solution, whereas a solution of ethanol and water would be expected to form a nonideal or real solution. The ideal solution model therefore serves as a useful basis of comparison to real solution behavior. Recall that for an ideal gas, the chemical potential of component i was given by Equation 2.54. For an ideal solution, we generalize this result by replacing the Gibbs free energy of component i in the ideal gas state, Gi ideal gas , with Gi, the pure component Gibbs free energy at the same T, P, and physical state (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas) as the mixture. Therefore, an ideal solution is defined by Equation 2.75 for the partial molar Gibbs free energy or chemical potential of component i: mi ideal solution i ideal solution iiGG RT x== + ln , (2.75) 57 A review of thermodynamic concepts where xi is defined as the mole fraction of component i in the mixture. We can also write Equation 2.70 for an ideal solution as mi ideal solution i i ideal solution iGRTf /f=+ ()ln \u0000 , and combining this result with Equation 2.75, we obtain the important result that f xf .i ideal solution ii \u0000 = (2.76) Equation 2.76 is also known as the Lewis-Randall rule and says that the fugacity of a component in an ideal solution is proportional to its mole fraction. Furthermore, the proportionality constant is the pure component fugacity evaluated at the same T and P as the solution being considered. Since f\u0000 \u0000 i iif/xP= , we then see, using Equation 2.76, that for an ideal solution, ˆffi ideal solution iif/P== . Example 2.6 Show using Equation 2.75, which gives the partial molar Gibbs free energy of component i in an ideal solution, that the enthalpy of mixing, the internal energy of mixing, and the volume of mixing are equal to zero for an ideal solution. Solution Based on Equation 2.31 we can write the mixture Gibbs free energy as d nG nG T dT nG P dP nG n Pn Tn i i () = ¶ () ¶ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú + ¶ () ¶ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú + ¶ () ¶å ,, éé ë ê ê ù û ú úTP n i j dn ,, For a closed system containing n moles, we can also write from Equation 2.25 that d(nG) = −(nS)dT + (nV)dP. Comparing this result to the first two terms of the previous equation for constant n, we see that the first two partial derivatives can be replaced by −(nS) and (nV), respectively. In addition, we know that ¶¶ mnG /n Gi TP n ii j()éë ùû == ,, , the chemical potential of component i. Therefore, the previous equation may be written as d nG nS dT nV dP dn i ii() =-() + () +åm We can now use the criterion of exactness (Equation 2.29) on this equation and obtain the following relationships: ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ =- ¶ () ¶ æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ =- ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ mmi Pn i PT n i i TT nS n Sand P j , ,, ,nn i PT n i nV n V j = ¶ () ¶ æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ = ,, Using the above-mentioned relationships, along with Equation 2.75, we then have for an ideal solution: ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ =- = ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ mi ideal solution Pn i ideal solution i PT S G T , ++ Rxiln 58 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ == ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ mi ideal solution Tn i ideal solution i TP V G P , Next, we can use our fundamental property relations for component i (Equation 2.25) to show that (∂Gi/∂T)P = − Si and (∂Gi/∂P)T = Vi. Hence, we obtain the following equations for the par- tial molar entropy and partial molar volume for an ideal solution: SS Rx andV Vi ideal solution ii i ideal solution i=- =ln By Equation 2.44, we easily can see that the volume change of mixing for an ideal solution is zero and that Videal solution = ∑ixiVi. For the enthalpy change of mixing, we can use the fact that H GTSi ideal solution i ideal solution i ideal solution=+ and using the above-mentioned relationships we obtain that H GTSHi ideal solution ii i=+ = . Therefore, the enthalpy change of mixing for an ideal solution is also zero and Hideal solution = ∑ixiHi. In a similar fashion, we can use the fact that UH PV HPVUi ideal solution i ideal solution i ideal solution ii i=- =- = with the result that the internal energy change of mixing is also zero. 2.6 Phase equilibrium With this background on solution thermodynamics, we can now address the criterion for equilib- rium between two phases (I and II) contained within a closed system. Equilibrium between the two phases also implies that the two phases are at the same temperature. Also, the two phases must have the same pressure, unless they are separated by a semipermeable rigid barrier or membrane. We will consider the situation where the pressures may be different later in this chapter when we discuss osmotic equilibrium. Each phase is also an open system and is free to exchange mass with the other phase. Since we are considering the closed system containing the two phases to be at constant T and P, we can use the result from Example 2.6 that d(nG) = − (nS)dT + (nV)dP + ∑iμi dni and write this equation for phase I and phase II as d nG nS dT nV dP dn d nG nS dT nV d II I i i I i I II II II () =-() + () + () =-() + () åm PPdn i i II i II+åm (2.77) For the closed system containing phases I and II, we can also write that d nG nS dT nV dP dnGd nG nS nS dT III III () =-() + () = () + () =- () + ()é ëê ù ûú + nnV nV dP dn dn III i i I i I i II i II i () + ()é ëê ù ûú ++å åmm (2.78) Since (nS)I + (nS)II = (nS) and (nV)I + (nV)II = (nV), Equation 2.78, at constant T and P, simplifies to i i I i I i i II i IIdn dnåå+=mm 0 (2.79) 59 A review of thermodynamic concepts where dnand dni I i II represent the differential changes in the moles of component i as a result of mass transfer between phases I and II. Clearly, the law of mass conservation requires that dndni I i II=- . With this result, Equation 2.79 may then be written as i i I i II i Idnå -() =mm 0 (2.80) The values of dnand dni I i II are arbitrary, so the only way Equation 2.80 can be satisfied is for each term in parentheses (i.e., mmi I i II- ) to be equal to zero. So, our criterion for phase equilibrium in a two-phase system can be expressed by mmi I i II= , (2.81) which simply states that the chemical potential for each component i is the same in phase I and phase II at the given T and P. This result can be easily generalized to provide the criterion for phase equilibrium in π phases at the same T and P as mm mp i I i II i== =\u0000 (2.82) If we only have a pure component in each phase, Equations 2.81 or 2.82 still apply, and since in this case miiiGG== , then for a pure component, phase equilibrium requires that GG G purecomponenti I i II i== = ()\u0000 p (2.83) Using Equation 2.82, along with miii iiGG RT f/f== + ()ln \u0000 from Equation 2.70, we can write an alternative expression for the criterion for phase equilibrium in multicomponent systems in terms of the component mixture fugacities as f ffi I i II i\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000== = p (2.84) 2.6.1 Pure component phase equilibrium Figure 2.3 shows a pressure-volume or PV curve for a pure component. Shown in the figure are several dashed lines of constant temperature or isotherms. The area within the dome-shaped region defines conditions, where two phases, e.g., vapor and liquid, are at equilibrium for a given T and P. At the top of the dome is the critical point (C), where the liquid and vapor phases become identical and thus have the same physical properties. The isotherm that passes through the critical point is known as the critical isotherm, TC. The critical temperature, pressure, and volume (TC, PC, and VC) are also pure component physical properties and play an important role in the estimation of a variety of physical properties (Poling et al., 2001). Below this critical isotherm, we see that the other isotherms (i.e., subcritical isotherms) have three separate segments. Within the dome, we see that the isotherm is horizontal and represents the con- stant temperature and pressure phase change between the saturated liquid and saturated vapor states. The leftmost point on this horizontal segment denotes the saturated liquid and the rightmost point on the horizontal segment denotes the saturated vapor. Saturated means that for the pure component, 60 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering the vapor and liquid phases are at equilibrium at T = TSat and P = PSat, where PSat is called the satura- tion pressure or the vapor pressure of the pure component. PSat for a pure component only depends on the saturation temperature, i.e., PSat = PSat(TSat). The normal boiling point (TBP) of a pure compo- nent occurs when the value of PSat is the same as the atmospheric pressure or PSat = 1 atmosphere = PSat(TSat) = PSat(TBP). Points along the curve ABC define saturated liquids, and the points along the curve CDE define saturated vapor. Points along the horizontal isotherm within the dome represent saturated mixtures of liquid and vapor. The actual molar volume of the vapor/liquid mixture will depend on the relative amounts of each phase present, i.e., V = (1 − x) VLsat + xVVsat, where x is the vapor fraction of the vapor/liquid mixture. The region to the left of the curve ABC denotes the liquid state, and the isotherms here rise very quickly because liquid volume changes are very small as the pressure is increased and, for the most part, liquids at modest pressures are therefore considered to be incompressible. The region to the right of curve CDE denotes the vapor state provided T < TC and P < PC and a gas for T > TC and P < PC. The conditions where T > TC and P > PC is known as the supercritical fluid region. Now let us consider the vapor (V) and liquid (L) equilibrium of a pure component i at T and P = PSat(T). From Equation 2.83, we can write that GV = GL, and it follows that dGV = dGL. Next, we can use Equation 2.25 and express the previous result as dGS dT VdPS dT VdPdG VV VSat LL SatL=- += -+ = (2.85) This equation may be rearranged as follows: dP dT SS VV S V SatV L VL LV LV= - - = D D (2.86) P V C TC PC VC T < TC VL Sat VV Sat PSat A B D E Vapor Gas Vapor Liquid Supercritical fluid Liquid/vapor Figure 2.3 PV diagram for a pure component. 61 A review of thermodynamic concepts Now ΔSLV and ΔVLV represent the changes in the entropy and volume of the pure component when it is transferred from the liquid phase to the vapor phase at the equilibrium temperature (T) and pres- sure (PSat). If we integrate Equation 2.24 for the change in phase from liquid to vapor at constant T and P, we obtain ΔHLV = TΔSLV or ΔSLV = ΔHLV/T. ΔHLV is also known as the heat of vaporiza- tion (ΔHVap) and represents the difference in enthalpy between the saturated vapor and the saturated liquid. These results can be substituted into Equation 2.86 to give dP dT H TV SatVap LV= D D (2.87) This equation is also known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and is an equilibrium relationship between the saturated liquid and the saturated vapor. For a given change in the temperature (dT), Equation 2.87 provides the change in the pressure (dPSat) required to maintain equilibrium between the saturated liquid and its saturated vapor. For solid-liquid or solid-vapor equilibrium, one may substitute the enthalpy of melting or the enthalpy of sublimation for the enthalpy of vaporization in Equation 2.87. For liquid-vapor and solid-vapor phase changes at saturation pressures near atmospheric, one can neglect the molar volume of the solid or liquid phase in comparison to the volume of the vapor and assume that the vapor phase behaves as an ideal gas, i.e., ΔVLV = VV = RT/PSat. Equation 2.87 may then be written as dP d T L R Satln 1 =- (2.88) where L now represents either ΔHLV (heat of vaporization) or ΔHSV (heat of sublimation). Equation 2.88 provides a relationship between the saturation pressure and the temperature in terms of the enthalpy change associated with the phase change. Over narrow ranges of temperature, L is pretty much constant, and Equation 2.88 can be integrated from an arbitrary temperature (T0) to provide an approximate relationship between the saturation pressure and the temperature: ln lnPP L RT L RT A B T SatSat=+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ - æ è ç ö ø ÷ =-0 0 1 (2.89) where A and B represent constants that can be fitted to pure component vapor pressure data. Equation 2.89 shows that over a narrow range of temperatures, there is a linear relationship between the natu- ral logarithm of the saturation pressure and the inverse of the temperature. Additional empirical equations for determining the saturation or vapor pressure of a given component as a function of temperature can be found in Poling et al. (2001). Since we have a pure component i, Equation 2.84 can be written in terms of the pure component fugacities as f ffi L i V i Sat== (2.90) where fi Sat denotes the fugacity of either the saturated liquid or the saturated vapor. 62 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Since f Pi Sat i Sat i Sat=f , we then have that f ff Pi L i V i Sat i Sat i Sat== =f (2.91) where fi Sat would be given by Equation 2.68 with P = PSat using an appropriate set of PVT data or an equation of state to perform the integration. Therefore f ff PZ dP P i L i V i Sat i Sat Pi Sat == =-() æ è ç ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ ÷ò exp 0 1 (2.92) 2.6.1.1 Fugacity of a pure component as a compressed liquid For a given temperature T, if the pressure P is greater than the value of PSat(T) for a pure component, then the liquid is considered to be subcooled or a compressed liquid and is not in equilibrium with its vapor. Calculation of the fugacity of a pure component i as a compressed liquid starts with our fundamental property relation (Equation 2.25), i.e., dGi = −Si dT + Vi dP. For constant temperature, we can write this as dGi = Vi dP and integrate this equation from Pi Sat to P as GG VdPii Sat P P i i Sat -= ò (2.93) Using Equation 2.57, we can rewrite Equation 2.93 as GG RT f f VdPii Sat i i Sat P P i i Sat -= = ò ln (2.94) As mentioned earlier, liquid molar volumes do not depend that strongly on P, so Equation 2.94 can be written as follows, after setting the subcooled molar liquid volume (Vi) equal to the saturated liquid volume Vi Sat( ) at the same T: f f VP P RT P VP P ii Sat i Sat i Sat i Sat i Sat i Sat i = -()æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ = - expexpf SSat RT ()æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ (2.95) Comparing Equation 2.95 with Equation 2.91, we see that the exponential term is a correction of the saturated fugacity to account for the fact that the pressure of the subcooled liquid is greater than its saturation pressure for a given T. The exponential term is also known as the Poynting factor. 2.6.2 Excess properties Recall that we previously defined a residual property as the difference between the real property value and its corresponding value as an ideal gas (MR = M − Mideal gas). We showed in Section 2.5.2.1 that the residual properties can be determined from PVT data or an equation of state. We also 63 A review of thermodynamic concepts found that the definition of the residual properties provided a convenient method for calculating the pure component fugacity coefficient and the fugacity coefficient of a component in a mixture, i.e., Equations 2.68 and 2.74. Accordingly, residual properties and fugacity coefficients are usually used for describing the behavior of real gases, since the residual properties and the fugacity coefficients express the deviation of the real gas from ideal gas behavior. For liquids, it is usually easier to compare real liquid solution behavior to an ideal solution. An excess property (ME) is then defined as the difference between the property value in a real solution and the value it would have in an ideal solution at the same T, P, and composition. Therefore, we have that M MM Eideal solution=- (2.96) In terms of partial molar properties, Equation 2.96 becomes M MMi E ii ideal solution=- (2.97) For phase equilibrium calculations, we are primarily interested in the Gibbs free energy, so the par- tial molar excess Gibbs free energy is given by the following equation: GG Gi E ii ideal solution=- (2.98) Using Equations 2.70 and 2.75 for Gand Gi i ideal solution, we obtain using Equation 2.98 GG GRT f xf RTi E i i ideal solution i ii i=- ==ln ln \u0000 g (2.99) The term f /x fi ii \u0000 is dimensionless and is also known as the activity coefficient, γi. In terms of the activity coefficient, we can then express the fugacity of component i as it exists in the solution as f xfi ii i \u0000 =g . Note that for an ideal solution, the γi equals unity and f xfi ideal solution ii \u0000 = . We can then write the partial molar excess Gibbs free energy in terms of the activity coefficient as G nG n RTi E E i TP n i j = ¶ () ¶ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú = ,, ln g (2.100) Using Equation 2.37 and the Gibbs-Duhem relationship (Equation 2.39) at constant T and P, we also have that GRTx E i ii= å ln g (2.101) i iixdå =ln g 0 (2.102) 64 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Activity coefficients for a component in a mixture are obtained from experimental data, and the results are correlated with a model of how the excess Gibbs free energy depends on the composition of all the components within the mixture, i.e., GE/RT = f(x1, x2, … , xN) at constant T, since for the most part, we can ignore the effect of pressure on the activity coefficients. Equation 2.102 serves as a thermodynamic consistency check of experimentally determined activ- ity coefficients or empirical equations that are used to calculate activity coefficients. For a binary system at constant T and P, Equation 2.102 can also be written as follows: x x x x TP TP 1 1 1 2 2 1 0 ¶¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ln ln ,, gg (2.103) For a binary system, we can also write Equation 2.101 as G RT xx E =+11 22ln lngg (2.104) Equation 2.104 can then be differentiated with respect to x1 at constant T and P to give dG /RT dx x x x x dx dx E() = ¶¶ ++ ¶¶ + 1 1 1 1 12 2 1 2 2 1 ln ln ln ln g g g g (2.105) Since dx2/dx1 = −1 and using the Gibbs-Duhem from Equation 2.103, we then have that dG /RT dx E() = æ è ç ö ø ÷ 1 1 2 ln g g (2.106) This equation can then be integrated over x1, as shown in the following equation: 0 1 1 1 10 0 1 1 2 1 11òò () =- = æ è ç ö ø ÷ == dG /RT dx dx G RT G RT dx E E x E x ln g g (2.107) Now the excess Gibbs free energy at x1 = 0 and x1 = 1 by definition is zero; hence we obtain the fol- lowing as a condition on the activity coefficients: 0 1 1 2 1 0ò æ è ç ö ø ÷ =ln g g dx (2.108) Equation 2.108 is also called the area test of activity coefficients. It provides a convenient method for testing the thermodynamic consistency of activity coefficient data. One can simply plot the val- ues of ln(γ1/γ2) versus x1, and if the area under the resulting curve is equal to zero, then the test for thermodynamic consistency is satisfied. A variety of models of varying complexity for describing the excess Gibbs free energy of liquid solutions have been developed (Poling et al., 2001). Most of the modern activity coefficient models 65 A review of thermodynamic concepts easily handle multicomponent solutions. In addition, the so-called UNIFAC model allows the activ- ity coefficients to be predicted from the molecular structure of the species that are in the solution. The following example illustrates the calculation of an expression for the activity coefficients for a binary system from a model of the excess Gibbs free energy. Example 2.7 The simplest model to describe the excess Gibbs free energy of a binary liquid solution is given by the following power series: G xx RT AA xx Ax x E 12 01 12 21 2 2 =+ -()+-() +\u0000 Retaining only the lead constant A0, find expressions for γ1 and γ2. Solution We therefore have that GE/RT = A0x1x2 = A0(n1/n)(n2/n) where n1 and n2 are the moles of com- ponents 1 and 2, respectively, and n = n1 + n2. Multiplying both sides of this expression by n and using Equation 2.100, we have that ln ,, g1 1 12 02 012 12 2 2 = ¶ () ¶ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú = +() - +() nG /RT n nn An An n nn E TP n ==- =-() =-() = A n n A nn n Ax xx Ax xA x 0 2 0 12 2 02 12 02 10 2 21 So, we find that the activity coefficient for component 1 based on this model for GE is given by ln g10 2 2= Ax . In a similar manner, we can show that the activity coefficient for component 2 is given by ln g20 1 2= Ax . Expressions for the activity coefficients based on more complex models of GE for both binary and multicomponent systems may be found in Poling et al. (2001). Example 2.8 From the previous example, determine the expressions for the activity coefficients of compo- nents 1 and 2 at infinite dilution. Solution At infinite dilution for component 1, we have that x1 = 0 and x2 =1. Therefore, from the results in Example 2.7, we have that ln g10 ¥ = A and ln γ2 = 0 or γ2 = 1. At infinite dilution for component 2, we have that x1 = 1 and x2 = 0. Hence, ln γ1 = 0 or γ1 = 1 and ln g20 ¥ = A . In this example, for either component, the natural logarithm of the activity coefficient at infinite dilution is equal to A0. Example 2.9 Show that the activity coefficient expressions found in Example 2.7 satisfy the Gibbs-Duhem relationship, i.e., Equation 2.103. 66 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Solution For a binary system, Equation 2.103 states that x x x x TP TP 1 1 1 2 2 1 0 ¶¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ln ln ,, gg Substituting in the fact that ln g10 2 2= Ax and ln g20 1 2= Ax , we then have that 2 11 21 0 0 0 01 10 11Ax xA xx or -() -()+-() = = which shows that the expression used in Example 2.7 for the excess Gibbs free energy satisfies the Gibbs-Duhem consistency test. 2.6.3 Applications of equilibrium thermodynamics With the development of the above thermodynamic equilibrium relationships, we can now address specific topics in solution thermodynamics, such as the solubility of a solid in a liquid solvent, freez- ing point depression, solid-gas equilibrium, gas solubility, osmotic pressure, the distribution of a solute between two liquid phases, vapor-liquid equilibrium, flammability limits, the thermodynam- ics of surfaces, equilibrium dialysis, and chemical equilibrium in an ideal solution. The following discussion will form the foundation for our understanding in later chapters of solute transport in biological systems. Solute transport occurs across the interface between phases, and at the interface, we assume that the solute is in phase equilibrium. 2.6.3.1 Solubility of a solid in a liquid solvent We will consider a binary system where the sol- vent is denoted by subscript 1 and the solute by subscript 2. We assume that the solvent has neg- ligible solubility in the solid; hence, the solid solute will exist as a pure phase. We can then use Equation 2.84 and the definition of the activity coefficient given by Equation 2.99 to express the solute phase equilibrium between the solid and liquid phases: f xf SL 22 22=g , (2.109) where f S 2 refers to the fugacity of the pure solid solute x2 represents the equilibrium solubility of the solid in the solvent phase expressed as a mole fraction f L 2 represents the fugacity of pure liquid solute at the equilibrium temperature and pressure of the solution Since this temperature must be less than the melting temperature of the solid solute, it follows that the solute in the solution exists as a subcooled liquid. Since the solute does not ordinarily exist as a liquid at these conditions, we will have to estimate the value of f L 2 as shown in the discussion below. 67 A review of thermodynamic concepts With these assumptions, we can rearrange Equation 2.109 to solve for the solubility (x2) as follows: x ff S L2 2 22 = g (2.110) Equation 2.110 shows that the solute solubility in the solvent is directly proportional to the ratio of the pure component fugacities of the solid and its subcooled liquid and inversely proportional to the value of the activity coefficient of the solid in the solvent solution. To determine an expression for the solid solubility, we first must calculate the ratio of these fugaci- ties for the pure solute. This can be accomplished by recognizing the fact that the triple point (Ttp) for a pure substance (see Figure 2.4) defines that unique equilibrium temperature and pressure where all three phases (solid, liquid, and vapor) coexist in equilibrium. In addition, as shown in Figure 2.4, the melting temperature (Tm) of a pure substance does not depend strongly on the pres- sure and is therefore very close to the triple point temperature. Now, from Equation 2.57, we can write that at constant temperature dG = RT d ln f. Combining this result with Equation 2.62, we have that d G RT df H RT dT V RT dP æ è ç ö ø ÷ == -+ln 2 (2.111) This equation may then be written for the solid and subcooled liquid phases, with the difference between the solid and subcooled liquid fugacities then given by d f f HH RT dT VV RT dP S L LS LS ln 2 2 2= - - - (2.112) T P TC PC Triple point Critical point Solid Vapor Liquid Sublimation curve Melting curve Vaporization curve Ttp Tm Supercritical fluid Figure 2.4 PT diagram for a pure component. 68 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The term (HL − HS) is the enthalpy of fusion and is dependent on the temperature. Using the enthalpy of fusion at the triple point temperature (Ttp) as a reference, we can write that HL − HS at some other temperature T is given by H HH CdTH CdT LS L tp T T PL S tp T T PS tp tp -= + æ è ç çç ö ø ÷ ÷÷ -+ æ è ç çç ö ø ÷ ÷÷òò (2.113) which can also be written as follows assuming that the heat capacities do not vary much with the temperature between Ttp and T: H HH CT T LS tp Ptp-= +-()DD (2.114) where ΔHtp is the enthalpy of fusion of the solid at the triple point temperature ΔCP represents the difference in the heat capacities, ΔCP = CPL − CPS We can now substitute Equation 2.114 into Equation 2.112 and integrate between (Ttp, Ptp) and the conditions of interest (i.e., T, P). In performing this integration, we also make use of the fact that, for the most part, the difference in the specific volumes (ΔV = VL − VS) is independent of the pressure. In addition, we recognize that at the triple point f f LS 22= ln ln f f H RT T C R T T T T V RT P S L tp tp P tp tp2 2 11 1=- æ è ç ö ø ÷ -- + æ è ç ö ø ÷ -- D DD PPtp() (2.115) We can now substitute Equation 2.115 into Equation 2.110 and obtain the following general equa- tion for the solubility of a solid in a liquid solvent at T and P: x H RT T C R T T T T V RT P tp tp P tp tp 2 2 11 1 1=- æ è ç ö ø ÷ -- + æ è ç ö ø ÷ -- g D D expln D PPtp() é ë ê ê ù û ú ú (2.116) We can now make some reasonable approximations that simplify the use of Equation 2.116. In most cases, the pressure correction in the last term of Equation 2.116 is negligible. In addition, the heat capacity difference also provides only a minor contribution and can be ignored. In addition, as mentioned earlier, the triple point temperature (Ttp) is close to the melting point temperature (Tm) (cf. Figure 2.4) of the solid at atmospheric pressure, and we can then replace the enthalpy of fusion at Ttp with the enthalpy of fusion at the normal melting temperature, i.e., ΔHm. For a variety of organic molecules, the ratio of the enthalpy of fusion (ΔHm, calories per gram mole) to the normal atmospheric melting point (Tm, K) is approximately in the range from 9 to 11. With these simplifica- tions, Equation 2.116 may be written as x H RT T m m 2 2 11 1 =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú g D exp (2.117) 69 A review of thermodynamic concepts If the solid solute and the solvent are chemically similar, then we would expect them to form an ideal solution. For an ideal solution, we can set γ2 in Equation 2.117 equal to unity. For an ideal solution with γ2 = 1, the solubility of the solid solute can be predicted from only the enthalpy of fusion and the melting temperature. Note that the ideal solubility (i.e., γ2 = 1) is based only on the pure com- ponent properties of the solute and is the same regardless of the solvent. For nonideal solutions, we must use an appropriate solution model for the activity coefficient (γ2) (Poling et al., 2001) in order to calculate the solubility. In the limit of negligible solubility in the solvent, we may use the infinite dilution activity coefficient g2 ¥( ). In the case of nonpolar solutes and solvents, it is worth mentioning at this point that the Scatchard- Hildebrand equation allows estimation of the solute activity coefficient from the pure component properties of the solute and the solvent. Using the Scatchard-Hildebrand equation, the solute activity coefficient is given by ln ,g dd F 2 21 2 2 1 2 = -()V RT L (2.118) where VL 2 represents the molar volume of the solute as a subcooled liquid that, in practice, is usually taken to be the same as the molar volume of the solute as a liquid at the melting temperature, the δ’s are the solubility parameters for the solute and the solvent, and Φ1 is the volume fraction of the solvent defined by the following equation: F1 11 11 22 = + xV xV xV L LL (2.119) The square of the solubility parameter di 2( ) is defined as the ratio of the change in the internal energy for complete vaporization to the molar liquid volume. The internal energy change of vaporization is the same as the enthalpy of vaporization minus RT assuming an ideal gas. The solubility parameter for component i is then given by the following equation: d D i i Vap i L HRT V = -æ è ç ö ø ÷ 12/ (2.120) One usually ignores the temperature dependence of DHi Vap and Vi L and simply uses the values at the normal melting point for the solute and at 25°C for the solvent. For a solid solute, the heat of vapor- ization would also be equal to the difference between the heat of sublimation and the heat of fusion, i.e., ΔHVap = ΔHSub − ΔHm. If an expression for the vapor pressure of the solid is known, e.g., from an equation like Equation 2.89, then the heat of sublimation can be calculated using the Clausius- Clapeyron equation, i.e., Equation 2.88. The more chemically similar the solute and solvent are, the closer the values of their respective solubility parameters, and from Equation 2.118, we see that the resulting solution then approaches ideality. Hence, comparing the solubility parameters provides a quick method for determining chemical similarity and the degree of nonideality between the solute and the solvent. 70 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Example 2.10 A drug has a molecular weight of 230 and a melting temperature of 155°C. Estimate the solu- bility of this drug in benzene and in n-hexane at 25°C, assuming they form an ideal solution. Also, determine the solubility based on the Scatchard-Hildebrand equation. The following data are also provided: Heat of fusion of the drug 4300 cal mol−1 Density of the drug 1.04 g cm−3 Vapor pressure of the solid drug lnP mmHg 27.3 8926 TK Sat () =- () Molar volume of benzene 89.4 cm3 mol−1 Solubility parameter for benzene 9.2 (cal cm−3)1/2 Molar volume of n-hexane 131.6 cm3 mol−1 Solubility parameter for n-hexane 7.3 (cal cm−3)1/2 Solution To calculate the ideal solubility of the drug, we use Equation 2.117 with γ2 = 1: x cal gmol cal gmol K 2 1 11 4300 1 987 1 273 15 155 1 298 15 = + - æ è ç - --exp .. . öö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú = -K 1 0 110. This is the same value whether the solvent is benzene or n-hexane. To calculate the solubility based on the Scatchard-Hildebrand equation, we need to estimate the solubility parameter for the drug. First, the heat of sublimation can be found as follows from the vapor pressure of the solid drug using Equation 2.88: DHR dP d/T cal gmol KK cal mo Sub Sat =- () =´ = --ln .. 1 1 987 8926 17736 9 11 ll-1 Then the solubility parameter for the drug is found from Equation 2.120 assuming that the molar volume of the drug as a liquid and as a solid is similar: d2 11 1117736 9 4300 1 987 298 15 1 = -- ´ -- --.. .cal mol cal mol cal molK K /1104 230 762 31 1 12 1 12 . . / / () ´ æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ = ()-- - cm gg mol cal mol Next, we can combine Equations 2.117 through 2.119 to give x H RT T V RT xV x m m LL 2 21 2 2 21 2 11 1 1 = - æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú -() -() -( exp exp D dd )) + é ë ê ê ù û ú ú ì í ï îï ü ý ï þïVx V LL 12 2 2 (A) The equation is an implicit algebraic equation in the solubility x2. Numerical techniques need to be used to solve for the value of x2. One approach that can be used is direct iteration. 71 A review of thermodynamic concepts In this technique one assumes a value for x2, substitutes this value on the right-hand side of Equation A, and calculates a new value of x2 called ˆx2. One then lets xx22= ˆ , and this new value of x2 is then substituted into the right-hand side of the previous equation, and the pro- cess is repeated until there is no longer any significant difference in the values of xand x22ˆ and convergence is then obtained. Although direct iteration is simple to implement, there is no guarantee for convergence to the solution. In addition, numerous iterations are sometimes required. The second approach is based on Newton’s method. Newton’s method has more reli- able convergence and requires fewer iterations. To implement Newton’s method, we first form the following difference equation from Equation A: f xx H RT T V RT xV m m L 22 21 2 2 21 11 1 () =- - æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú -() -() exp exp D dd LL LLxV xV1 21 22 2 -() + é ë ê ê ù û ú ú ì í ï îï ü ý ï þï The goal is to find the value of x2 that makes f(x2) = 0. This is accomplished through the fol- lowing iterative equation that provides an update for the value of x2 based on the evaluation of f(x2) and df(x2)/dx2 at the previous value of x2: ˆxx fx df x/dx 22 2 22 =- () () One then assumes xx22= ˆ , and the process is repeated until convergence. In terms of choosing an initial starting value of x2 for either approach, we could use the ideal solubility or simply assume that x2 = 0. After substituting in the values of the known quantities into the earlier equation for f(x2) and performing the iterative calculations, it is found that the solubility based on the Scatchard-Hildebrand model for the solute activity coefficient is x2 = 0.054 when the solvent is benzene and x2 = 0.107 when the solvent is n-hexane. The drug and n-hexane solu- bility parameters are nearly identical, and the solubility of the drug is nearly the same as that found assuming an ideal solution. On the other hand, for benzene as the solvent, the drug solubility is considerably lower than the value based on an ideal solution. 2.6.3.2 Depression of the freezing point of a solvent by a solute Consider a small amount of a solute dissolved in a solvent. As the temperature of this solution is decreased, a temperature (Tf) is reached where the pure solvent just starts to separate out of the solution as a solid phase. The freez- ing temperature of this mixture is Tf. This temperature is lower than the freezing point of the pure solvent (Tm). We are usually interested in determining the freezing point depression, which is then defined as ΔT = Tm − Tf. This problem is very similar to the one we just addressed concerning the solubility of a solute in a solvent. However, now the focus is on the solvent, which is component 1. To solve this problem, we assume that equilibrium exists between the first amount of solvent that freezes and the rest of the solution. We also assume that the solvent that freezes exists as pure solvent, and we assume that the minute amount of solid solvent formed has no effect on the composition of the solution. We can then write an equilibrium equation like Equation 2.109, but now for the solvent f xf SL 11 11=g (2.121) 72 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering which can be rearranged to give ln lng11 1 1 x f f S L= (2.122) Following a similar development we used for the solute (see Equation 2.112) in the previous section, we can write that d f f HH RT dT VV RT dP S L LS LS ln 1 1 2= - - - (2.123) and we also have that H HH CT T LS m Pf m-= +-()DD (2.124) where for the solvent, we use the normal melting temperature of the pure solvent as the reference temperature, and Tf is the mixture freezing temperature. We also assumed that the heat capacities do not vary much as the temperature changes from Tm to Tf. We can now substitute Equation 2.124 into Equation 2.123 and integrate between (Tm, Pm) and the conditions of interest, i.e., (Tf, Pf). In performing this integration, we also make use of the fact that, for the most part, the difference in the specific volumes (ΔV = VL − VS) is independent of the pressure. In addition, we recognize that at the melting point of the pure solvent, f f LS 11= ln ln f f H RT T C R T T T T V RT P S L m mf Pm f m f f 1 1 11 1=- æ è ç ö ø ÷ -- + æ è ç ö ø ÷ -- DD D PPm() (2.125) Combining Equation 2.125 with Equation 2.122, we obtain ln lng DD 11 11 1x H RT T C R T T T T V RT PP m mf Pm f m f fm=- æ è ç ö ø ÷ -- + æ è ç ö ø ÷ -- D (() (2.126) Once again, we can ignore the effect of the pressure term, and since Tf ≈ Tm, we obtain ln g DD 11 2 11 x H RT T H RT TT m mf m m mf=- æ è ç ö ø ÷ =- -() (2.127) The freezing point depression is then given by DTT T RT H xmf m m=- =- 2 11 D gln (2.128) Note that if the freezing depression is measured, then Equation 2.128 provides a convenient means for determining the activity coefficient of the solvent for a solution of given composition. For ideal solutions, we have that γ1 = 1. For solutions that are very dilute in the solute, γ1 ≈ 1 and ln x1 = ln(1 − x2) ≈ −x2. So, for dilute solutions we can write that DTT T RT H xmf m m=- = 2 2 D (2.129) where x2 is the mole fraction of the solute in the mixture. 73 A review of thermodynamic concepts Example 2.11 Estimate the freezing point depression of a benzene solution containing the drug considered in Example 2.10. Assume that the drug concentration is 0.04 g cm−3. The normal melting point for benzene is 278.7 K. Solution We expect the mole fraction of the drug at this concentration to be very small. We can there- fore assume that the density of the liquid solution is the same as that of pure benzene, which is 0.885 g cm−3. As a basis for the calculation of the mole fraction, assume that we have 1 cm3 of the liquid mixture. Then, for the drug mole fraction in benzene, we can write that x g cm cm solution molofdrug g g cm molofdrug 2 3 3 3 004 1 1 230 0041 = ´´ ´ . . 2230 0 885 0041 78 1 3 3 g g cm molbenzene g cm solution+ - ´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ ´ .. and we get that x2 = 0.0158.

KK 2.6.3.3 Equilibrium between a solid and a gas phase Now, we consider a pure solid phase that is in equilibrium with a surrounding gas phase. Here, the question that can be addressed is, for a given T and P, what is the equilibrium composition of the gas phase? We let component 1 represent the gas and component 2 is the material that makes up the pure solid phase. We also assume that the gas has negligible solubility in the solid phase, so the solid phase is pure. Equilibrium requires that the solid phase fugacity of component 2 equals the fugacity of component 2 in the gas phase. We use Equation 2.71 to describe the fugacity of component 2 in the gas phase and obtain the following statement for equilibrium between the pure solid phase and the gas: f yP S 22 2= ˆf (2.130) The mole fraction of component 2 in the gas phase is then given by y f P S 2 2 2 = ˆf (2.131) If the pressure is significantly above atmospheric, then a mixture equation of state is needed to calculate the fugacity coefficient of component 2 in the gas phase, as described by Equation 2.74 (Poling et al., 2001). However, for most applications in biomedical engineering, the pressure will be near atmospheric and we can treat the gas phase as an ideal gas for which ˆf2 1= . The fugacity of the pure solid is given by Equation 2.95, recognizing that we are now considering a subcooled or compressed solid rather than that of a liquid for which we derived Equation 2.95: f f VP P RT P V SSat SSat Sat SatSat SSa 22 22 22 2 = -()æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ =expexp ,, f ttSatPP RT -()æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ 2 (2.132) 74 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering PSat 2 is the sublimation pressure (or vapor pressure) wherein the solid will vaporize directly to a vapor without first forming a liquid. Since the sublimation pressure is generally very small at ambient temperatures, the saturated fugacity coefficient f2 Sat( ) is equal to one. If the pressure is low and on the order of PSat 2 , then the exponential term is also equal to unity. Therefore, for this case, we get that the pure component solid phase fugacity of component 2 is simply equal to its sublimation or vapor pressure. Hence, we can write that y P P Sat 2 2= (2.133) Example 2.12 Estimate the gas phase equilibrium mole fraction of the drug considered in Example 2.10 at a temperature of 35°C. The pressure of the gas is 1 atm. Solution Since the pressure is 1 atm, we assume that the gas phase is ideal and set f2 1 Sat = . We then calculate the fugacity of the drug as a solid using Equation 2.132: f P VP P RT SSat SSat Sat 22 2 = -()æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ exp , We also assume that the molar volume of the solid at the saturation T and P is the same as the molar volume of the solid at ambient conditions.

As expected, because of the low pressure, we see in the previous calculation that the expo- nential correction to the solid fugacity is negligible and that the fugacity of the solid is nearly the same as its vapor pressure. Using Equation 2.133, we then find that the gas phase mole fraction of the drug is y2 = 0.191 mmHg/760 mmHg = 0.00025. 2.6.3.4 Solubility of a gas in a liquid We now consider the calculation of the equilibrium solubil- ity of a sparingly soluble gas (taken as component 2) in a liquid, i.e., x2 → 0. Our phase equilibrium relationship, i.e., Equation 2.84, requires for the solute gas that ˆˆf f LG 22= (2.134) 75 A review of thermodynamic concepts The definition of the activity coefficient in Equation 2.99, where g22 22= ˆf/xf LL, provides an approach for calculating the fugacity of component 2 within the liquid phase: ˆ ,f xf LL 22 22=g (2.135) where f L 2 is the pure component liquid fugacity at the mixture T and P and is given by Equation 2.95. Recall from Equation 2.71 that we also defined the component mixture fugacity coefficient as ˆˆf22 2= f/yP G , which also says that the fugacity of component 2 within a vapor or gas mixture is given by ˆˆf yP G 22 2=f (2.136) By Equation 2.84, Equations 2.135 and 2.136 are equal, so y Px f L 22 22 2 ˆfg= (2.137) We then assume that the solvent has a negligible vapor pressure; hence, y2 = 1 and ˆff22= . The gas solubility in the solvent expressed as a mole fraction is then given by x P f f f L G L2 2 22 2 22 == f gg (2.138) Usually, the temperature of interest will be much higher than the critical temperature of the soluble gas being considered, so we have that T > TC2. For example, the critical temperature and other physi- cal properties for several common gases are summarized in Table 2.1. Although Equation 2.138 provides a convenient means of calculating the gas solubility, it is encum- bered by the fact that the soluble gas does not really exist as a liquid since T > TC2. If by chance the soluble gas is below its critical temperature, then this problem of the gas existing as a hypothetical liquid is not an issue. One approach to solving this problem involves using Equation 2.138 with the Scatchard-Hildebrand equation for the activity coefficient of the solute. When Equation 2.118 is substituted into Equation 2.138 for γ2, we obtain x f f V RT G L L 2 2 2 21 2 2 1 2 =- -()é ë ê ê ù û ú ú exp dd F (2.139) Table 2.1 Physical Properties of Some Common Gases Gas Critical Properties TC, K and PC, MPa Liquid Volume VL, cm3 mol−1 Solubility Parameter δ, (cal cm−3)1/2 Oxygen 154.6, 5.046 33.0 4.0 Nitrogen 126.2, 3.394 32.4 2.58 Carbon dioxide 304.2, 7.376 55 6.0 76 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Prausnitz and Shair (1961) used Equation 2.139 to correlate known solubility data for a number of gases in a variety of solvents and obtained the three parameters in Equation 2.139, which describe the soluble gas as a hypothetical liquid, i.e., the pure liquid fugacity f L 2( ), the liquid volume VL 2( ), and the gas solubility parameter (δ2). Table 2.1 summarizes for several gases the values of VL 2( ) and (δ2) that were found, and Equation 2.140 provides the fugacity of the soluble gas as a hypothetical pure liquid at a pressure of 1.013 bar: ln . . .ln f PT/T T T L CC C 2 22 2 781 806 294 æ è ç ö ø ÷ =- - æ è ç ö ø ÷ (2.140) If the pressure is greater than 1.013 bar, then the liquid phase fugacity f L 2( ) calculated from Equation 2.140 needs to be corrected for the effect of the pressure, as shown in Equation 2.95, after changing the reference pressure from PSat to atmospheric pressure of 1.013 bar: f Pf bar VP bar RT LL L 22 2 1 013 1 013 () = () -()é ë ê ê ù û ú ú .exp .

Solution Since the pressure is atmospheric, we can neglect the pressure correction to the liquid fugacity. From Equation 2.140, we then calculate the fugacity of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the liquid state at 25°C.

From Equation 2.139, we can then 77 A review of thermodynamic concepts calculate the mole fraction of carbon dioxide and oxygen in toluene. Note that we have set Φ1 = 1 since we expect the solubility of these gases in toluene to be very small.

The reported solubility of carbon dioxide in toluene at 25°C and at a partial pressure of 1 atm is 0.010 and that for oxygen in toluene is 0.0009. Calculating the % error, we see that the error for prediction of the carbon dioxide and oxygen solubility using the Scatchard-Hildebrand model is 11% for both gases. The use of Equation 2.139 for predicting the solubility of a gas in a liquid is limited by the assump- tions made in the development of the Scatchard-Hildebrand model for estimating activity coef- ficients. Generally, the prediction will be better for nonpolar gases and liquids. Also, the accuracy will rapidly diminish as the absolute magnitude of the difference between the solubility parameter of the gas and the solvent increases. For example, consider the solubility of oxygen in ethanol (δethanol = 12.8 (cal cm−3)1/2). The difference in the solubility parameters of oxygen and ethanol is quite large, and we would therefore expect greater error in the prediction of the solubility. We can use the results from Example 2.13 and calculate the predicted oxygen solubility in ethanol as 4.91 × 10−5, whereas the reported value is about 6 × 10−4. So, in this case, we have underestimated the solubility of oxygen by over a factor of 10. Because of these limitations on predicting gas solubility, a more empirical approach is often used. At a given temperature and pressure, it has been found that, for the most part, the gas phase fugacity is directly proportional to the gas solubility expressed as a mole fraction (x2), i.e., ˆˆf yP Hx G 22 22==f . The proportionality constant H is called Henry’s constant. If the gas phase is ideal, then ˆf2 1= , and y2P is also just the partial pressure of the solute gas, i.e., P2 or pX, where X is the name of the solute gas. For example, the partial pressure of oxygen can be written as either Poxygen or as pO2. So, we can write that P2 = pX = Hx2. It is important to remember though that Henry’s constant for a specific gas will depend on the solvent, the temperature, and to some extent the pressure. In some cases, Henry’s constant is based on the solute concentration of the solute in the solvent. This is common, e.g., in describing the solubility of oxygen in blood where we write that the pO2 = HCoxygen. The partial pressure of oxygen in the gas phase is represented by pO2, and Coxygen is the molar concentration of dissolved oxygen in the blood. The value of Henry’s constant (H) for describing the solubility of oxygen in blood is 0.74 mmHg μM−1. The thermodynamic basis for Henry’s constant can be obtained from Equation 2.135, where we have the following expression for the liquid phase fugacity: ˆf xf LL 22 22=g . The product of g22andf L as 78 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering x2 → 0 is Henry’s constant. Substituting H for the product of g22andf L results in Henry’s law for describing gas solubility, i.e., ˆf xf Hx LL 22 22 2==g (2.142) For sparingly soluble gases, where x2 → 0, the activity coefficient approaches, in the limit of infinite dilution, a value that becomes independent of the solute mole fraction, i.e., gg22® ¥. Hence, from Equation 2.142, we would expect Henry’s constant to be nearly independent of the solute mole frac- tion. Since H is also related to the pure component liquid fugacity, we would also expect H to be somewhat dependent on the temperature and only weakly dependent on the pressure. Example 2.14 Calculate the concentration of oxygen dissolved in blood for a gas phase partial pressure of oxygen equal to 95 mmHg. Solution Using Henry’s law and the value of H given earlier for oxygen and blood, we can write that C pO H mmHg mmHgM Moxygen == = - 2 1 95 074 128 4 . . m m 2.6.3.5 Osmotic pressure Consider the situation illustrated in Figure 2.5 where a rigid semiperme- able membrane separates region A from region B. Region B contains only pure solvent, whereas region A contains the solvent and a solute. The membrane that separates region A from region B is only permeable to the solvent; hence, the solute is completely retained in region A. Solvent will diffuse from region B into region A in an attempt to satisfy the requirement that at equilibrium (see Equations 2.82 and 2.84), the chemical potential or fugacity of the solvent on each side of the membrane must be equal. This movement of solvent from region B to region A is called osmosis and Semipermeable membrane AB Water Water and nondiffusable solute h Patm Patm Figure 2.5 Concept of osmotic pressure. 79 A review of thermodynamic concepts will tend to increase the level of region A until the increase in hydrostatic pressure stops the flow of solvent from region B and equilibrium is attained. The pressure difference across the membrane between regions A and B at this point of equilibrium is the osmotic pressure of region A relative to that of the pure solvent in region B. The osmotic pres- sure is represented by Π and is equal to (PA − PB), which is also equal to ρgh for the situation shown in Figure 2.5. A quantitative understanding of osmosis is needed for a variety of calculations and concepts involv- ing solutions and mass transport across semipermeable membranes. We can easily derive an expres- sion for the osmotic pressure of a solution by starting with the fundamental requirement that at equilibrium, the temperature and fugacity of the solvent in regions A and B must be equal: ˆf T, Pf T, Psolvent A Asolvent B B() = () (2.143) Note that at equilibrium, the temperatures of regions A and B will be the same; however, the pres- sures on either side of the membrane surface will not be the same. Equation 2.143 can be rewritten as follows using an activity coefficient model (see Equation 2.99) to describe the fugacity of the solvent in region A: gsolvent A solvent A solvent A Asolvent B Bxf T, Pf T, P() = () (2.144) The pure component solvent fugacity in region A at T and PA can be related to that in region B at T and PB through the use of Equation 2.95 after changing the reference pressure from PSat to PB. Hence, we can write that f T, Pf T, P VP P RT solvent A Asolvent B B solvent L AB () = () -()æ è çç ö ø exp ÷÷÷ (2.145) Substituting Equation 2.145 into Equation 2.144 results in Equation 2.146 for the osmotic pressure (PA − PB). This osmotic pressure difference is given the symbol Π and represents the osmotic pres- sure of the solution in region A relative to that of the pure solvent in region B: P =-() = - ()PP RT V xAB solvent L solvent A solvent Aln g (2.146) Note that measurement of the osmotic pressure of a solution also provides a convenient method through the use of Equation 2.146 to determine the activity coefficient of the solvent. For nonideal solutions, a variety of theoretical and empirical models exist for estimating the activity coefficient in Equation 2.146 (Poling et al., 2001; also see Problems 2.28 and 2.29 at the end of this chapter). Equation 2.146 can be simplified for the special case where the solvent and solute form an ideal solution. In this case, gsolvent A = 1, and since xsolvent A is close to unity, we can rewrite Equation 2.146 as P == RT V xRTC solvent L solute A solute (2.147) 80 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering where xsolute A represents the mole fraction of the solute in region A. Since the solute mole fraction is generally quite small, we can approximate this as xV Csolute A solvent L solute= , where Csolute is the molar concentration of the solute and Vsolvent L is the molar volume of the solvent. This ideal dilute solution osmotic pressure, described by Equation 2.147, is known as van’t Hoff’s law. If the solution contains N ideal solutes, then the total osmotic pressure of the solution is the summation of the osmotic pres- sure generated by each nondissociating solute according to Equation 2.147: P = =åRT Csolute i N i 1 (2.148) Osmotic pressure is not determined on the basis of the mass of the solute in the solution, but rather, on the number of particles that are formed by a given solute. Each nondiffusing or retained particle in the solution contributes the same amount to the osmotic pressure regardless of the size of the particle. Thus, if we take 1/1000th of an Avogadro’s number of glucose molecules, or 1/1000th of an Avogadro’s number of albumin molecules, and form a 1 L solution of each with water, we have a 1 mM (1 mmol L−1) solution of each solute. According to Equation 2.147, the ideal osmotic pressure of these two solutions is the same. However, the mass of glucose added to the solution is 180 mg, whereas the mass of albumin added to the solution is nearly 70 g, demonstrating that it is not the mass of solute in the solution that is important in determining the osmotic pressure. Example 2.15 Consider the situation shown in Figure 2.5 where on side A of the membrane, we have a solution that has a water mole fraction of 0.99. On side B of the membrane, we have pure water. If the temperature is 25°C, estimate the pressure drop needed across the membrane, i.e., (PA − PB), to stop the osmosis of water from region B. What will happen if this pressure difference was increased above this value? Solution Assuming the solution in region A is an ideal solution, we can use Equation 2.147 to calculate the osmotic pressure of region A relative to the pure water of region B, i.e., P =-() = ´´ ´ ´ - PP Pa m molK atm Pa K m mol AB 8 314 1 101 325 298 18 10 00 3 6 3 . , .11136= .atm To stop the flow of water from region B to region A by osmosis, the pressure drop across the membrane, i.e., (PA − PB), must equal the osmotic pressure of the solution in region A. If the pressure drop across the membrane, i.e., (PA − PB), is greater than the osmotic pressure of region A, then water will move from region A into region B and this process is called reverse osmosis. Since small pressures are easy to measure, the osmotic pressure is also useful for determining the molecular weight of macromolecules such as proteins. For example, letting msolute represent the mass 81 A review of thermodynamic concepts concentration (e.g., in grams per liter) of the solute in the solution, then from Equation 2.147 we can write the molecular weight of the solute (MWsolute) in terms of the osmotic pressure of the solution as MW RT m solute solute= P (2.149) Example 2.16 The osmotic pressure of a solution containing a macromolecule is equivalent to the pressure exerted by 8 cm of water. The mass concentration of the protein in the solution is 15 g L−1. Estimate the molecular weight of this macromolecule.

For example, through the process of liquid extraction, a drug produced by fermentation can be extracted from the aqueous fermentation broth into a suitable solvent and then be purified. Factors to consider in the selection of the solvent include its toxicity, cost, degree of miscibility with the fermentation broth, and selectivity for the solute. Consider the resulting batch-type equilibrium where N1 moles of solute 1 are mixed with N2 moles of solvent 2, and N3 moles of solvent 3. The two solvents are partially miscible and form two liquid phases. The equilibrium distribution of these three components between the two resulting liquid phases (I and II) can be written for component i as follows using Equations 2.84 and 2.99: ggi I i I i I i II i II i IIxf T, Px fT,P() = () (2.150) Now the pure component fugacities of component i are the same in phases I and II, since component i exists in the same state at the same temperature and pressure in each of the two phases. Therefore, Equation 2.150 becomes ggi I i I i II i IIxx= (2.151) The ratio of the mole fractions of component i in the two phases is called the distribution coefficient (Ki) and is defined as follows after rearranging Equation 2.151: K x x i i I i II i II i I== g g (2.152) 82 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering It is important to remember that in liquid-liquid equilibrium problems, the solvents that form the two partially miscible liquid phases form highly nonideal solutions. Therefore, the activity coef- ficients of each component in each phase tend to be strong functions of the composition and need to be determined by multicomponent activity coefficient models that have the capability to describe liquid-liquid equilibrium problems as discussed in Poling et al. (2001). In this type of problem, it is desired to determine the values of the mole fractions of the three compo- nents in the two liquid phases and the amounts of each phase, i.e., NI and NII. For the three compo- nents and two phases, we therefore have eight unknowns, i.e., the six mole fractions and NI and NII. So, we need a total of eight relationships between these variables in order to obtain a solution. The equilibrium relationships (Equation 2.152) provide us with three equations and we can also write a mole balance for each component as N xN xNii II i II II=+ (2.153) providing us with an additional three equations. In addition, we can use the fact that the mole fractions in each phase must sum to unity, i.e., å= =å==ii I ii IIxand x1 3 1 311. Solution of these eight equations provides the desired solution. However, it should be pointed out that this is a somewhat challenging problem to solve because of the strong nonlinear dependence of the activity coefficients on the composition of each phase. The problem can be simplified by assuming that the two solvents are immiscible. Usually, solvents are selected to minimize their mutual solubility, so in a practical sense, this is a pretty good assump- tion. As given by Equation 2.152, the distribution coefficient for the solute taken as component 1 will depend on the composition of each of the two phases. In many biological applications, the solute concentration is so low that the activity coefficients approach their infinite dilution values and the distribution coefficient is a constant. Also, since the solute is present in such a small amount, the values of N2 and N3 for solvents 2 and 3 are assumed to be constant and equal to NI and NII, respec- tively. With these assumptions, a mole balance on the solute can then be written as N xN xN III 11 21 3=+ (2.154) and with xKx III 11= from Equation 2.152, we can solve for the mole fraction of the solute in phase II as follows: x N KN N II 1 1 23 = + (2.155) Example 2.17 The octanol-water partition coefficient (KO/W) is frequently used to describe lipophilicity and to estimate the distribution of a drug between the aqueous and lipid regions of the body. KO/W is the same as the distribution coefficient described earlier with component 2 and phase I being the octanol phase and component 3 and phase II being the aqueous phase. Suppose we have 0.01 mol (N1) of drug dissolved in 100 mol of water (N3). The mole fraction of the drug in the aqueous phase is therefore equal to 0.01 × 100−1 = 10−4. We then add to this phase 100 mol 83 A review of thermodynamic concepts (N2) of octanol. Estimate the mole fractions of the drug in the two phases once equilibrium has been attained. Also, determine the percent extraction of the drug from the aqueous phase. The octanol-water partition coefficient for the drug in this example is 89.

Also, the solvent and water are immiscible, and we assume that the amount of solute is small, so there is no appreciable change in either LI or LII. Our mole balance on the solute can then be written as L xL xL x II in II I out III out II=+ (2.156) Extractor Solvent LI LI xI out Aqueous stream L II xII LII xII in out Figure 2.6 A single stage liquid-liquid extractor. 84 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The streams exiting the extractor are at equilibrium, so from Equation 2.152, we can write that xKxout I out II= . Using this relationship in Equation 2.156, we can solve for xout II as x xE out II in II = + 1 1 (2.157) where E is defined as the extraction factor, i.e., E = LIK/LII. The percent extraction of the solute from the aqueous phase II is given by %Extraction x x out II in II=- æ è ç ö ø ÷ ´1 100 (2.158) Example 2.18 Suppose a drug is in an aqueous stream flowing at 100 mol min−1 at a drug mole fraction of 0.01. The aqueous stream is then contacted within a single stage extractor with a solvent that is flowing at 200 mol min−1. The solvent has a distribution coefficient of 6 for this particular drug. What is the equilibrium mole fraction of the drug in the streams exiting the extractor? What is the percent extraction of the drug from the aqueous stream entering the extractor? Solution First, we find that the extraction factor is 12. Then, from Equation 2.157, the mole fraction of the drug in the aqueous stream that leaves the extractor is xout II =´ + =´ -001 1 112 76910 4.. The mole fraction of the drug in the exiting solvent stream by Equation 2.152 is xout I =´ ´= ´ --67 69 10 46210 43.. and the percent extraction of the solute from Equation 2.158 works out to be 92.3%. 2.6.3.8 Multistage solute extraction A percent extraction in Example 2.18 of 92.3% results in the potential for loss of valuable product. Therefore, extraction is frequently carried out in a countercurrent multistage extractor. Figure 2.7 illustrates this for N equilibrium stages of extraction. Since we again assume the phases are immiscible and the solute concentration is low, then LI and LII are constant within the extractor. In addition, the distribution coefficient K is also assumed to be constant. A solute mole balance around the dashed box enclosing stages 1–n of the extractor provides Equation 2.159 for the mole fraction of the solute entering stage n in phase II: x L L x Lx Lx L n II I II n I II II II II+ =+ - 1 10 (2.159) 85 A review of thermodynamic concepts The streams exiting stage n will be in equilibrium, so from Equation 2.152, we can write that xKxn I n II= , where K is the distribution coefficient. Substituting this result into Equation 2.159 results in xExx E K xn II n II II I + =+ - æ è ç ö ø ÷11 0 (2.160) We can now use Equation 2.160 in a stepwise manner to calculate successive values of xn II +1 starting with stage 1. Note that in the following, we have also made use of the fact that we can replace xI 0 in Equation 2.160 with Kxe II, where xe II is the solute concentration in phase II that would be in equilib- rium with the solute concentration that enters in phase I. So for stage 1, we have that nx Ex xExE xEx II II II e II II e II== +- =+() -1121 11: (2.161) For stage 2, we can eliminate xII 2 by using Equation 2.161, which then gives nx Ex xExx EE xE E II II II e II II e II== +- =+ +()-+()2132 11 22: and for stage 3, we obtain the following result after using the previous equation to eliminate xII 3 : nx xE EE xE EE II II e II== ++ +()-+ +()3141 23 23: 1 2 n N n+ 1 LII xII LI xI 0 LII xII LI xI N LII xII LI xI n N+1 n+1 1 Figure 2.7 N stage liquid-liquid extractor. 86 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering This equation can then be generalized for the nth stage with the following result: xx EE Ex EE En II II n e II n + =+ ++ +()-+ ++()11 221 \u0000\u0000 (2.162) Using Equation 2.162, we can then write for stage N that xx EE Ex EE EN II II N e II N + =+ ++ +()-+ ++()11 221 \u0000\u0000 (2.163) The summations in Equation 2.163 are geometric progressions wherein the ratio of each successive term to the previous term is a constant, in this case E. The first series is then given by (1 − EN + 1)/ (1 − E), and the second series is given by E(1 − EN)/(1 − E). Using these relationships for the series, Equation 2.163 can then be written as xx EE xE E E N II II N e II N + + = -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ - - - æ è ç ö ø ÷11 11 1 1 1 (2.164) In Equation 2.164, e.g., phase II represents the aqueous phase, and we would know the incoming mole fraction of the solute, i.e., xN II +1. Recall that xx /Ke II I= 0 and we would also know the amount of solute in the solvent feed stream, i.e., xI 0. Therefore, for a given number of equilibrium stages (N), Equation 2.164 can be solved to provide the amount of solute present in phase II as it exits the extractor, i.e., xII 1 . If there is no solute in the entering solvent phase, then xI 0 0= and we have that x x E E II N II N 1 1 1 1 1+ += -- (2.165) The percent extraction of the solute from phase II is then given by %Extraction x x II N II=- æ è ç ö ø ÷ ´ + 1 100 1 1 (2.166) Equation 2.164 can also be rearranged and solved to give the number of equilibrium stages (N) for specified solute mole fractions: N xx xx E N II N II II e II = - - æ è ç ö ø ÷ +ln ln 1 1 (2.167) with xx /K andx x/KN II N I e II I== 0 . The number of actual stages will be greater than that calculated from Equation 2.167 since equilibrium is seldom achieved in each stage of the extractor. To find the actual number of stages, we can use the overall efficiency (η) of an equilibrium stage defined as follows: h = N Nactual (2.168) Equilibrium stage efficiencies can be obtained from manufacturer’s information on their extractor or from experimental data. 87 A review of thermodynamic concepts Example 2.19 Rework the previous example and determine the number of equilibrium and actual stages needed to achieve a 99.99% extraction of the drug from the aqueous phase. Assume that the efficiency of an equilibrium stage is 60%. Let phase II represent the aqueous phase and phase I the solvent. No solute is present in the solvent stream that enters the extractor. Solution From Equation 2.166, we can calculate the mole fraction of the solute in the aqueous phase that exits the extractor: x extraction x II N II 11 61 100 10 9999 0011 10=- æ è ç ö ø ÷ =-() =´+ -% ..

So we need 4 equilibrium stages or 4/0.6 ≈ 7 actual stages. 2.6.3.9 Vapor-liquid equilibrium Vapor-liquid equilibrium plays an important role in understand- ing and designing separation processes that involve distillation, gas absorption, and the removal of solutes from liquids by contact with another gas stream, also known as stripping. These separation processes are widely used in the chemical process industry, and the design of these processes falls within the realm of chemical engineering. Here, we will illustrate vapor-liquid equilibrium calcula- tions by determining the bubble point (boiling point) and dew point (condensation) temperatures of mixtures. We will also use these concepts to develop an understanding of the flammability or explosive limits of combustible materials. Consider now the equilibrium distribution of N components at a given T and P between a vapor and a liquid. Our phase equilibrium relationship, i.e., Equation 2.84, requires for component i that ˆˆf fi L i V= (2.169) For nonideal liquid solutions, an activity coefficient model is once again required to describe the behavior of the components of the liquid phase. For a nonideal liquid solution, we can then use the activity coefficient defined by Equation 2.99, where g ii L ii Lf/xf= ˆ , to calculate the fugacity of compo- nent i within the liquid phase: ˆ ,f xfi L ii i L=g (2.170) 88 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering where fi L is the pure component liquid fugacity at the mixture T and P and is given by Equation 2.95. In addition, at pressures considerably greater than atmospheric pressure, the vapor phase will deviate from that of an ideal gas, and a mixture equation of state is also needed to calculate the mixture fugacity coefficient of each species in the vapor phase as given by Equation 2.74 (Poling et al., 2001). Recall from Equation 2.71 that the component mixture fugacity coefficient is defined as ˆˆfii V if/yP= , which also says that the fugacity of component i within a nonideal vapor mixture is given by ˆˆf yPi V ii=f (2.171) By Equation 2.84, Equations 2.170 and 2.171 are equal, so we can write Equation 2.172, which expresses the equilibrium condition for each component i in the vapor-liquid mixture: y Px fii ii i Lˆfg= (2.172) If the total pressure (P) and the component vapor pressures are on the order of atmospheric pres- sure, then we can usually treat the vapor phase as an ideal gas and set ˆfi = 1 and fi Sat = 1. Then, from Equation 2.95, we also have for these conditions that the f Pi L i Sat» . Therefore, we can write Equation 2.172 as follows: y Px PPii ii Sat i==g (2.173) with Pi equal to the partial pressure of component i. Once again, we also have the constraint on the mole fractions that ∑ixi = ∑iyi = 1. For an ideal liquid solution, we also have γi = 1, and then we have that y Px PPii i Sat i== (2.174) Equation 2.174 is also known as Raoult’s law, which shows that the partial pressure of a component (Pi = yiP) in an ideal liquid solution is equal to the product of its mole fraction and its vapor pressure. Now, consider a liquid solution consisting of N components and mole fraction xi for each compo- nent i. For a given pressure P, we can ask at what temperature would this liquid solution just start to boil, i.e., it first forms a vapor bubble? This temperature is known as the bubble point temperature and can be calculated as follows. When the liquid mixture is at its bubble point temperature, it is also referred to as a saturated liquid solution. Below the bubble point temperature, the liquid is a subcooled liquid. First, we solve Equation 2.172 for the equilibrium mole fraction of component i in the vapor bubble that is formed when the solution reaches the bubble point temperature: y xf P i ii i L i = gfˆ (2.175) 89 A review of thermodynamic concepts Since ∑iyi = 1, we then have Equation 2.176, which can be solved to find the bubble point temperature: i ii i L i xf På = g fˆ (2.176) It is important to recognize that Equation 2.176 depends on temperature through the terms that include the component liquid phase fugacities and the vapor phase fugacity coefficient. The activity coefficient may also have a temperature dependence. We then solve the nonlinear algebraic equation given by Equation 2.176 for the temperature that makes the left-hand side of Equation 2.176 equal to the pressure. This temperature is then known as the bubble point temperature or the boiling tempera- ture of the liquid mixture. The composition of the first vapor bubble that is formed is then given by Equation 2.175. If the liquid continues to boil, then the composition of the liquid and vapor phases will change as the more volatile components escape from the liquid to the vapor phase. This is the essence of distillation. The design of distillation processes falls within the study of staged processes and will not be considered here. If the pressure is low, we can once again replace the liquid phase fugacity of each component with its vapor pressure and set the component mixture fugacity coefficient to one. If the liquid also forms an ideal solution, then the activity coefficients can also be set to unity. In this latter case, which is Raoult’s law (Equation 2.174), we have for the bubble point temperature the requirement that i ii SatxP TPå () = (2.177) The only temperature dependence remaining in Equation 2.177 is in the component vapor pressures. Equation 2.177 can then be solved for the bubble point temperature. A similar analysis leads to the calculation of the dew point or condensation temperature of a vapor mixture of composition yi for component i. When the vapor mixture is at its dew point temperature, it is also referred to as a saturated vapor. Above the dew point temperature, the vapor is referred to as superheated. First, we solve Equation 2.172 for the equilibrium mole fraction of component i in the first drop of liquid that is formed when the vapor is cooled to its dew point temperature: x yP f i ii ii L= ˆf g (2.178) Since ∑ixi = 1, we then get Equation 2.179, which can be solved to find the dew point temperature: i ii ii L y fPå = ˆf g 1 (2.179) where once again ˆ ,,fgii i Landf will depend on the temperature. The temperature that satisfies Equation 2.179 is then the dew point temperature of the vapor mixture. The composition of the liquid drop that is just formed is given by Equation 2.178. 90 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering If the pressure is low, we can once again replace the liquid phase fugacity of each component with its vapor pressure and set the component mixture fugacity coefficient to one. If the liquid also forms an ideal solution, then the activity coefficients can also be set to unity. In this latter case, which is Raoult’s law, we have that i i i Sat y PT På () = 1 (2.180) The temperature dependence is only in the component vapor pressures, and Equation 2.180 can then be solved for the dew point temperature. Example 2.20 Estimate the normal (i.e., P = 1 atmosphere) bubble point or boiling temperature of a liquid solvent solution consisting of 25 mol% benzene (C6H6, MW = 78.11, TB = 353.3 K), 45 mol% toluene (C7H8, MW = 92.14, TB = 383.8 K), and 30 mol% ethylbenzene (C8H10, MW = 106.17, TB = 409.3 K), where the chemical formula, molecular weight, and normal boiling point are given in parenthesis after each of the components. What is the composition of the vapor bub- ble that is formed at the bubble point temperature? The vapor pressures of these components are given by the Antoine vapor pressure equation (Reid et al., 1977) with the vapor pressure in mmHg and the temperature in Kelvin. ln . . . ln .

T P T ethylbenzene Sat - =- - Solution Since these molecules are all chemically similar, we will assume that they form an ideal solu- tion. Equation 2.177 may therefore be used to calculate the bubble point temperature. The approach for solving this problem is as follows: 1. Assume a value of the bubble point temperature, T. 2. Calculate the vapor pressures for each component at T. 3. Calculate the å=ii i SatxP Pˆ . 4. If ˆPP= , which in this problem is 1 atm, then T is the bubble point temperature. 5. If ˆPP> , then the assumed T is too high; decrease T and go back to step 2. 6. If ˆPP< , then the assumed T is too low; increase T and go back to step 2. After following the above-mentioned procedure, we obtain the following results: Bubble point temperature = 377.81 K ybenzene = 0.503 ytoluene = 0.379 yethylbenzene = 0.118 91 A review of thermodynamic concepts Note the change in the distribution of the components between the liquid and the vapor bubble that is formed. Benzene, being the most volatile component, has a near twofold increase in its mole fraction, whereas ethylbenzene, being considerably less volatile than benzene, has its mole fraction in the vapor decreased by nearly a factor of three as compared to its composition in the liquid phase. Example 2.21 Repeat the above calculation, but this time, find the dew point temperature and the composi- tion of the first drop of liquid that is formed. Solution Equation 2.180 may be used to calculate the dew point temperature. The approach for solving this problem is as follows: 1. Assume a value of the dew point temperature, T. 2. Calculate the vapor pressures for each component at T. 3. Calculate the å=ii i Saty/P/P1 ˆ . 4. If ˆPP= , which in this problem is 1 atm, then T is the dew point temperature. 5. If ˆPP> , then the assumed T is too high; decrease T and go back to step 2. 6. If ˆPP< , then the assumed T is too low; increase T and go back to step 2. After following the above procedure, we obtain the following results: Dew point temperature = 389.6 K ybenzene = 0.092 ytoluene = 0.382 yethylbenzene = 0.526 Note that the dew point temperature is greater than the bubble point temperature. This makes sense since if we first consider that we have a subcooled liquid of the given composition, then as we heat this liquid mixture, we will reach the bubble point temperature that we found in Example 2.20. Then, as we continue to add heat at constant pressure, we will vaporize more and more of the components in the liquid phase until, when we reach the dew point tempera- ture, we have vaporized all of the components and we have a saturated vapor of the same composition as the original liquid mixture. As we continue heating, the temperature rises above the dew point temperature, and we have a superheated vapor. 2.6.3.10 Flammability limits Most manufacturing processes employ a variety of flammable sub- stances. It is important that these materials be handled and processed in a safe manner in order to avoid fires and explosions that can have devastating consequences. The ignition, combustion, or explosion of flammable substances in air only occurs within a narrow range of composition called the flammability limits. Below a certain concentration of the flammable substance in air, the mixture is too “lean” to burn, while above a certain concentration, the mixture is too “rich” to burn. The flammable or explosive range lies within these limits. This is important in the design and operation of combustion engines, furnaces, and incinerators. It is also important from a safety viewpoint to prevent fires and explosions in manufacturing and other processes that involve the use or storage of flammable compounds. 92 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering A fire or explosion requires three elements: the fuel, a source of oxygen, and an ignition source. This is referred to as the fire triangle. The fuel can be the flammable substances in your manufacturing process. Oxygen is in the air and air certainly exists outside of your manufacturing equipment and may also be within your manufacturing process. Also, you can count on Mother Nature to provide the ignition source, although other likely ignition sources in a manufacturing facility can include hot surfaces and flames, sparks, unstable chemicals, and static electricity. Flammability limits for a large number of organic chemicals are available in the literature. These flammability limits are provided as the lower and upper flammability (or explosion) limits. The upper (UFL) and lower flammability limit (LFL) is stated as the volume percent (which is the same as the mole percent) of the flammable chemical in air. If the flammable compound’s volume percent or mole percent in air at a given T and P lies within the LFL to UFL range, then that mixture is ignitable or explosive. If the volume percent or mole percent of the flammable chemical in air is less than the LFL, or greater than the UFL, then that mixture is not ignitable or explosive. Table 2.2 summarizes from a variety of sources the LFL and UFL for some common chemicals in air. Note that different sources may give slightly different numbers than those reported in Table 2.2. For a flammable substance, it is important to remember that it is not the liquid that actually burns but the vapors that are produced from that liquid. In many cases involving the processing or storage of flammable chemicals, we can assume that the vapor and liquid phases are in equilibrium. We can then use our vapor liquid equilibrium calculations, as discussed earlier, to determine the equilibrium composition of the vapor phase. This vapor phase composition can then be compared to the flam- mability limits to determine whether or not there may be an issue regarding a fire or explosion. This type of calculation is illustrated in the next example. Table 2.2 Flammability Limits of Some Common Substances in Air at Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Lower Flammability Limit, vol.% or mol% Upper Flammability Limit, vol.% or mol% Acetylene 2.5 100 Acetic acid 5.4 16.0 Acetone 2.6 13.0 Ammonia 15 28.0 Benzene 1.4 8.0 Ethanol 3.3 19.0 n-Butane 1.8 8.4 Methanol 6.7 36.0 Diethyl ether 1.9 36.0 Propane 2.1 9.5 Octane 1.0 6.5 Gasoline 1.3 7.6 Toluene 1.3 7.0 Hydrogen 4.0 75.0 93 A review of thermodynamic concepts Example 2.22 Consider the storage at ambient conditions (25°C and 1 atm) of a solvent such as benzene in a large storage tank in a manufacturing facility. Determine whether or not the vapor phase composition in this tank lies within the flammability limits for benzene. Solution In a closed and partially full storage tank, the vapor phase may be assumed to be in equilib- rium with the liquid benzene, provided there have been no recent transfers of benzene into or out of the storage tank. At 25°C, the vapor pressure of benzene is 94.5 mmHg, using the vapor pressure equation previously used in Example 2.20. From Raoult’s law Py PP xPbenzenebenzene benzene Vap benzene benzene Vap== = and the partial pressure of benzene in the vapor phase is 94.5 mmHg. Since the total pressure in the vapor space is 1 atm, this means that the partial pressure of air in the vapor space of the tank is 760 − 94.5 mmHg = 655.5 mmHg. From Raoult’s law, we can then calculate the mole fraction of benzene in the vapor space as y P P mmHg mmHg benzene benzene Vap == = 94 5 760 0 1243 . . Therefore, the mole percent or volume percent of benzene in the vapor space is 12.4%. Comparing this value to the LFL and UFL values for benzene in Table 2.2 indicates that the vapor space in the benzene storage tank at ambient conditions is not flammable or explo- sive assuming that the liquid and vapor phases are in equilibrium. However, nonequilibrium events, such as the removal of benzene from the tank will result in the addition of fresh air that will temporarily decrease the concentration of benzene in the vapor space from the above value until equilibrium is reestablished. It is possible during these transfer periods for the benzene concentration to fall within the flammability limits. In addition, for outside storage tanks, seasonal variations of temperature should also be considered. For example, at 40°F or 4.4°C, the vapor pressure of benzene decreases to 33.5 mmHg, giving at equilibrium a vapor phase benzene concentration of 4.4 mol% or 4.4 vol.%. Now, even at equilibrium, the vapor phase lies well within the flammability range. If an ignition source is present, then there is the possibility that this vapor mixture will be ignited and cause a fire or explosion. Example 2.22 illustrates that the storage of flammable substances can result in vapor mixtures that lie within the flammability range. In large storage tanks under these conditions, nitrogen gas is frequently supplied as a replacement rather than simply using ambient air. The use of nitrogen gas therefore eliminates the formation of flammable mixtures within a storage tank. For smaller tanks and portable containers for which this is not possible, it is important to make sure that these tanks and containers are properly grounded to eliminate static discharges that can serve as an ignition source. In addition, all vent openings into the tank or container can be fitted with flame arrestors to prevent the propagation of a fire from outside of the tank to inside the tank. Commercial flame arres- tors are relatively simple and inexpensive devices made of screens or mesh-like materials with small openings on the order of a millimeter or so. The design and construction of flame arrestors is based 94 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering on the fact that flame propagation can be suppressed and eliminated if the flame has to pass through a large number of narrow openings. There exists a critical opening size below which the flame is quenched, and this is called the quenching distance. Quenching distances for a variety of flammable substances may be found in the combustion literature. 2.6.3.11 Thermodynamics of surfaces So far, we have discussed the thermodynamic properties of solutions containing solids, liquids, and gases. However, when two phases are in contact, a surface is formed at the interface. The surface that is formed may have properties that are quite different than the bulk phases. Understanding the thermodynamics of surfaces is important in many biomedi- cal applications that involve the wetting of surfaces, as well as for understanding such processes as capillary flow and wicking. Consider the differential increase in surface area (dAS) of a fluid of arbitrary shape. The Gibbs free energy change for this differential increase in the surface area may be written as follows: dGSdT VdPdAS=- ++ g (2.181) where the additional term γ dAS represents the increase in the Gibbs free energy due to the change in the surface area dAS. The surface energy is denoted by γ and is defined at constant T and P by g= ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ G AS TP, (2.182) For a pure component, γ is the same as the surface tension. The surface energy acts as a restoring force that resists the addition of new surface area. At constant T and P, the work (dW) required to change the surface area an amount dAS is given by dW = γ dAS. Typical units for the surface tension are dynes per centimeter and millinewton (mN) per meter. The surface tension of pure water in air at 25°C is about 72 mN m−1. In order to develop some useful relationships, let us first consider a soap bubble. A soap bubble con- sists of a very thin spherical film of liquid. The film is relatively thick on a molecular level, so the innermost portion of the film acts like the bulk liquid. This film has two surfaces that are exposed to the outside atmosphere and the air trapped within the soap bubble. According to Equation 2.181, at constant T and P, the soap bubble can decrease its free energy by decreasing its surface area. Hence, the bubble will decrease in size, placing more of the liquid film molecules in the innermost portion of the film. However, as the bubble shrinks in size, the internal pressure (PB) will increase until a point is reached where the soap bubble can shrink no further. At this point, the net force due to the pressure difference across the bubble film balances the forces in the surface of the bubble trying to shrink the bubble. An equilibrium state then occurs, and we can write that g dA PP AdrSB AS=-() (2.183) The left-hand side of the Equation 2.183 represents the work effect needed to expand or contract the bubble by an amount equal to dAS. The right-hand side represents the net force acting on the surface AS, and this force multiplied by the displacement of the interface, dr, is the work needed 95 A review of thermodynamic concepts to change the area of the bubble by an amount, dAS. At equilibrium, Equation 2.183 must be satisfied for any fluctuation in dAS. Recall that for a sphere of radius r, the surface area is 4πr2. For a soap bubble, there are two inter- faces that have a change in area, the inside and outside surfaces of the liquid film, so dAS in this case is equal to d(2 × 4πr2) = 16πr dr. For a droplet or a gas bubble, where we have either a drop of liquid suspended in a gas, or a gas bubble suspended in a liquid, there is only one interface and dAS = d(4πr2) = 8πr dr. Substituting in for dAS and AS in Equation 2.183, we get Equations 2.184 and 2.185 for the pressure difference PB − PA: 2 4 interfaces PP r BA-= g (2.184) 1 2 interface PP r BA-= g (2.185) Equations 2.184 and 2.185 are known as the Laplace-Young equation and shows that the excess pressure (PB − PA) is inversely proportional to the radius of the bubble or the droplet. The radius r in the above equations is always considered to have its center of curvature in the phase in which PB is measured. Hence, for a gas bubble in a liquid, PB is the pressure within the bubble, which is then greater than the pressure (PA) in the liquid phase that surrounds the bubble. Example 2.23 Consider a droplet of water, 1 μm in diameter, that is suspended in air at 1 atm and 25°C. What is the pressure of the water inside the droplet? Solution The center of curvature for the droplet of water lies within the droplet. Therefore, PB repre- sents the pressure within the droplet. Using Equation 2.185 for the droplet, we have Patm Nm m Pa atm Patm B B -= ´´ ´ == = -- -1 27210 05 10 288 000 284 384 31 6. ,. . Now, consider a liquid droplet suspended in its own vapor. The liquid and vapor phases are therefore in equilibrium. The Gibbs free energy for the droplet phase may be written as follows, assuming we have only a single component i: dGSdT VdPdAdnS i P i=- ++ + ()gm (2.186) The chemical potential in this case is defined as m¶ ¶i P i TP An G/ n Sj () = () ,, , . Superscript P on the chemi- cal potential denotes the fact that the transfer of dni moles does not change the surface area of the droplet, since in the above definition of the chemical potential, AS is constant. The only way that this can occur is if mi P() refers to the chemical potential of component i as a planar surface. 96 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering For a spherical droplet, the surface area of the droplet will depend on how much material is in the droplet. With vi the molar volume of liquid i, we can then write that dVv dn dr rdrii== æ è ç ö ø ÷ = 4 3 4 32pp (2.187) Similarly, we can write for the surface area of the droplet that dAd rrdr dV r v r dnS i i= () == =48 222pp (2.188) Using Equation 2.188, we can then rewrite Equation 2.186 as dGSdT VdP v r dni P i i=- ++ + æ è ç ö ø ÷ ()m g2 (2.189) The parenthetical term represents the chemical potential of component i as a droplet and takes into account the free energy change associated with changes in the droplet surface area. Since the droplet is at equilibrium with its vapor at constant T and P, then we must have that mm m g i V i L i P iv r == + () 2 (2.190) From Equation 2.56, we can write that mmi Lideal gas ii VAP i Pideal gas i iCT RT Pand CT RT P= ()+ () = ()+ ()ln ln PP VAP()() (2.191) where the yiP, or the partial pressure for a pure component, would be the same as the vapor pres- sure by Raoult’s law. Ci(T) is just a temperature-dependent constant that includes the reference state terms. Substituting the relationships in Equation 2.191 into Equation 2.190 provides the following result: ln P P v rRT iVAP i P VAP i () æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ = 2 g (2.192) This equation is also known as the Kelvin equation and shows that the vapor pressure of a small droplet of liquid of radius r is higher than the corresponding value as a planar layer of liquid. If the surface is concave toward the vapor side, e.g., a gas or vapor bubble in a liquid phase, then use a minus sign on the right-hand side of Equation 2.192. Equation 2.192 shows that a swarm of liquid droplets of uniform radius at equilibrium with its vapor is unstable in terms of its radius. For example, if one droplet has a slight increase in its radius, then by Equation 2.192, the vapor pressure of the droplet will decrease and there will be a corresponding transfer of mass from the vapor state to the liquid state, thereby increasing the size of the droplet and so on. On the other hand, if a droplet has a slight decrease in radius, then its vapor pressure will increase, and there will be transfer of mass from the liquid state to the vapor state, thereby decreas- ing the size of the droplet and so on. This means that in a mixture of droplets of different sizes, the larger droplets will grow at the expense of the smaller droplets, and this is the phenomenon that leads to the formation of clouds and rain. 97 A review of thermodynamic concepts Example 2.24 Consider a droplet of water, 1 μm in diameter, that is suspended in air at 1 atm and 25°C. What is the vapor pressure of the water droplet? At 25°C, the vapor pressure of planar water is 3.166 kPa, and the molar volume of liquid water is 18.05 cm3 mol−1.

An important example is determining by this method what fraction of a drug is bound to the proteins found in blood. Another important example of this, which we will study later in Chapter 7, is the binding of oxygen with the protein hemoglobin that is found in the red blood cell. The equilibrium binding of oxygen with hemoglobin will depend on the partial pressure of oxygen (Poxygen = yoxygen P) in the gas phase. In order to understand the oxygenation of tissue and to design blood oxygenators used in heart surgery, we need to know for a given partial pressure of oxygen how much oxygen is actually bound to the hemoglobin. The simplest approach to performing equilibrium dialysis experiments is to form a membrane bag. The membrane bag can be formed by taking a membrane tube and tying off both ends. Usually, an aqueous solution containing the macromolecule of interest is placed within the membrane bag, and then the membrane bag is immersed into a well-stirred solution containing the ligand. Stirring the solution facilitates the transport of the ligand and shortens the time to reach equilibrium. These experiments can also be performed within specially designed dialysis cells that consist of two well-stirred chambers separated by the dialysis membrane. Initially, one of these chambers holds a solution containing only the ligand, and the other chamber contains a solution of the macromolecule. Equilibrium dialysis experiments employ semipermeable membranes. The membrane has small pores that are large enough to allow the free passage of the ligand and the solvent while retaining the macromolecules. The ligand then diffuses across the dialysis membrane into the solution containing the macromolecule. The ligand will then bind with the macromolecule, and this process continues until the system reaches a state of equilibrium. At equilibrium, we can use Equation 2.84 to express the equilibrium of the ligand molecules (L) inside and outside the membrane bag: ˆˆf fL inside L outside= (2.193) Using Equation 2.99, we can express the ligand fugacity in the solution inside and outside the mem- brane as ggL inside L inside LL outside L outside Lxf xf= (2.194) 98 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering In this case, unlike for osmosis discussed earlier, the temperature and pressure inside and outside the membrane bag are the same, so the pure component ligand fugacity (fL) is the same in both regions. Also, the usual assumption is that the ligand forms an ideal solution; therefore, the ligand activity coefficients are equal to unity. Furthermore, assuming the ligand concentration is small, the ligand mole fractions may be approximated as xV Cand xV CL inside solvent L L inside L outside solvent L L outside== . With these substitutions into Equation 2.194, the net result is that at equilibrium, C CL inside L outside= . The binding of the ligand to the macromolecule acts to concentrate the ligand inside the bag, even though at equilibrium, the concentrations of the ligand inside and outside the membrane bag are the same. The goal of these equilibrium dialysis experiments is to develop an expression that describes, for a given concentration of ligand, the amount of ligand that is bound to the macromolecule. This requires in general that we know the equilibrium constant that describes the binding of the ligand to the macromolecule as well as the number of ligand binding sites per macromolecule. The simplest case is when the macromolecule has only a single site that can bind to the ligand. In this case, the binding of the ligand molecule (L) with the macromolecule (M) can be described by the following chemical equation: L ML M K +« × (2.195) where L ⋅ M is the ligand-macromolecule complex. Recall that the chemical equilibrium constant is defined in terms of the concentration of the ligand (CL), the free or unbound macromolecule concentration (CM), and the concentration of the ligand- macromolecule complex (CL·M) and is given by K C CC LM LM = × (2.196) In order to calculate the value of K and the fraction of the macromolecules that are bound to the ligand, the above-mentioned concentrations need to be related to the measured ligand, macromol- ecule, and ligand-macromolecule complex concentrations. The total concentration of the macro- molecule, i.e., CM total, is known at the start of the experiment and this value is conserved over time within the membrane bag. At any time during the experiment, CM total is given by the sum of the free macromolecule concentration and that bound to the ligand by C CCM total ML M=+ × (2.197) In a similar manner, the total amount of ligand inside the bag is the sum of the free ligand and that bound with the macromolecule as C CCL total L inside LM=+ × (2.198) where CL inside is the concentration of unbound ligand inside the membrane bag, which at equilibrium, is the same as that outside the membrane bag, i.e., C CCLL inside L outside== . In terms of the previous defi- nitions, it can be shown that the equilibrium constant (K) is then given by the following equation: K C CC C LM LM total LM = -() × × (2.199) 99 A review of thermodynamic concepts To facilitate the use of Equation 2.199, it is convenient to define the fraction of the macromolecules (f) that are bound to the ligand. This is given by f C CC LM LM M º + × × (2.200) Combining Equations 2.199 and 2.200, the following equations are obtained for the relationship between f and K: K f fC andf KC KCL L L = -() = +11 (2.201) These equations then provide the relationship between the ligand concentration, the equilibrium constant, and the fraction of the macromolecules that are bound to the ligand at equilibrium. The previous expressions can also be rearranged into a convenient form for data analysis as shown by the following equation: f C Kf KKf L =-() =-1 (2.202) Equation 2.202 is known as the Scatchard equation and shows that for a given ligand concentration (CL), if one determines the fraction of macromolecules that are bound to the ligand (f), then a plot of f/CL versus f should be linear with a slope equal to −K and an intercept equal to K. The use of Equation 2.202 is illustrated in the following example for the binding of oxygen to myo- globin. Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding protein found in muscles that store oxygen molecules and release the oxygen when the oxygen partial pressure becomes low, e.g., during strenuous exercise. Myoglobin has only one site available for the binding of oxygen. The absorption spectra of myoglo- bin bound to oxygen is different than that for free myoglobin and this can be used to determine, at a given partial pressure of oxygen, the fraction of myoglobin that is bound to oxygen. Example 2.25 The following data express the fractional binding of oxygen to myoglobin as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen. From these data, determine the value of the equilibrium constant for the binding of oxygen to myoglobin. Also, determine the P50, which is the partial pressure of oxygen where the fractional binding of the myoglobin molecules is 50%.

In terms of the P50, it is easy to show using the previous equation that K/H = 1/P50. Our regression equation in terms of P50 then becomes f pO P f P andf pO PpO25050 2 50 2 1 =- = + Performing a linear regression on the data given in the table, according to the previous equa- tion on the left, we find that the P50 based on the average of the values obtained from the slope and the intercept is equal to 1.53 mmHg. We see in Figure 2.8 that the previous equation on the right for f with the value of P50 found from the regression of the data provides an excellent fit to these data on oxygen binding to myoglobin. In many cases, a macromolecule may have several binding sites for the ligand. In the general case, there are N sites available and it is also assumed that these sites are independent and have the same affinity for the ligand. This means that the binding of a ligand at a particular site has no effect on the binding of ligand at the other sites on the macromolecule. Each of these sites are therefore 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 Partial pressure of oxygen, mmHgMyoglobin fraction bound to oxygen Figure 2.8 Binding of oxygen to myoglobin. 101 A review of thermodynamic concepts independent, and they will have the same ligand equilibrium constant K. The binding of ligand to the ith site on the macromolecule is given by the following equilibrium equation: L ML Mi K i+« × (2.203) We can then let ϕi be defined as the fraction of site i on the macromolecules that are bound to the ligand. This is given by fi LMi Mi LMi C CC = + × × (2.204) The equilibrium constant for the binding of the ligand to site i is given by K C CC LMi LMi = × (2.205) Equations 2.204 and 2.205 can then be combined to give the following equation for the fraction of site i that is bound to the ligand: fi L L KC KC = +1 (2.206) This equation can then be summed over all N sites on the macromolecule, recognizing that f i N i=å =1 f , where f is given by Equation 2.200 and defines the moles of ligand bound per mole of macromol- ecule, which is also the same as the average number of ligand molecules that are bound to a macro- molecule. The result is that f is given by Equation 2.207 for the case of a macromolecule containing N identical and independent ligand binding sites: f NKC KC L L = +1 (2.207) For ease of data analysis, this equation can be rearranged as h == -() =- f C KN fKNKf L (2.208) This is the Scatchard equation for N binding sites on a macromolecule, which are all identical and independent. Equation 2.208 shows that for a given ligand concentration (CL), if one determines the moles of ligand that are bound to a mole of macromolecule (f), then a plot of η = f/CL versus f should be linear with a slope equal to −K and a y intercept equal to NK, or an x intercept of N. If the plot of the data based on Equation 2.208 is not linear, then this is an indication that the binding sites for the ligand are not identical or not independent. For example, an important case where the Scatchard equation does not apply is the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin. Although hemoglobin has four oxygen binding sites, these sites are not independent and exhibit what is known as coopera- tive binding.* As we will discuss in Chapter 7, the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin enhances the * See Section 7.2. 102 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering binding of additional oxygen molecules. In Chapter 7, we will develop an equation that can be used to describe cooperative binding. The use of Equation 2.208 is illustrated in the following example for the binding of Mg-ATP (a complex of Mg and ATP) to the enzyme tetrahydrofolate synthetase. Example 2.26 The data shown in the following table express the binding of Mg-ATP complex to the enzyme tetrahydrofolate synthetase in terms of f and f/CMg-ATP. The enzyme consists of four identical subunits. From these data, determine the value of the equilibrium constant (K) for the bind- ing of Mg-ATP complex to this enzyme and show that the number of binding sites (N) on the enzyme is consistent with there being one Mg-ATP binding site on each subunit of the enzyme. f, Fraction of Mg-ATP Bound to Enzyme f/CMg ‐ ATP 0.8 45,500 1.0 49,000 1.1 40,000 1.7 32,000 1.75 37,000 2.0 24,000 2.05 29,000 2.8 19,000 3.1 15,500 3.2 12,000 3.45 10,000 3.55 12,500 3.7 9,500 3.9 8,000 Source: Tinoco, I. et al., Physical Chemistry: Principles and Applications in Biological Sciences, 4th ed., Prentice-Hall, Inc., New York, 2001. Solution Performing a linear regression on the data given in the table according to Equation 2.208, we find that the value of K based on the slope is equal to 1.29 × 104 M−1. The number of binding sites N on the enzyme for the Mg-ATP complex is 4.33, which is consistent with the enzyme being comprised of four identical subunits. We also see in Figure 2.9 that regression of the data according to Equation 2.208 provides an excellent fit to these data on the binding of Mg-ATP to the enzyme. 2.6.3.13 The Gibbs-Donnan effect Now, consider a macromolecule in an aqueous solution with a concentration of CM. The macromolecule is separated by a semipermeable membrane from 103 A review of thermodynamic concepts another aqueous solution containing a strong electrolyte,* such as NaCl. Only the ions formed from the strong electrolyte are free to cross the semipermeable membrane. These ions, in this case Na+ and Cl−, will freely cross the semipermeable membrane and interact in a complex way with the macromolecule. The result will be that, depending on the solution pH, these ions along with the H+ will bind with the macromolecule with the result that the macromolecule will carry a net charge, ZM. The net charge of the macromolecule will create, at equilibrium, an uneven distribution of these small ions between the region that contains the macromolecule and the region on the other side of the semipermeable membrane that does not have the macromolecule. This difference in the con- centrations of these ions will then create an osmotic pressure difference across the semipermeable membrane because the “solvent” on the macromolecule side of the semipermeable membrane is not the same as the “solvent” on the opposite side of the semipermeable membrane. This means that when finding the osmotic pressure of the macromolecule in an electrolyte solution, we will need to correct for what is known as the Gibbs-Donnan effect. Here, we will find an expression that allows for the calculation of this correction to the osmotic pressure of a macromolecule in a solution with a 1:1 electrolyte like NaCl. The solution that is opposite or outside the solution containing the macromolecule must remain electrically neutral. If CNaCl outside is the total concentration of NaCl in the outside solution, then electrical neutrality of this solution requires that C CCNaCl outside Na outside Cl outside==+- (2.209) * A strong electrolyte is a substance that completely dissociates into charged ions when placed in water. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.54 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 ×10 4 Moles of Mg-ATP bound to a mole of enzymef/Mg-ATP concentration, 1/M Figure 2.9 Binding of Mg-ATP to tetrahydrofolate synthetase. 104 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The semipermeable membrane allows the transport of NaCl, so when equilibrium occurs between the inside macromolecule-containing solution and the outside solution that is free of macromol- ecule, we can use Equation 2.82 and write this equilibrium for NaCl as mmNaCl inside NaCl outside= (2.210) Since NaCl is a strong electrolyte, Equation 2.210 can also be rewritten using Equation 2.70 in terms of Na+ and Cl−, where use is made of the fact that mm mNaCl Na Cl +=+ - ; therefore GG RT f f RT f Na inside Cl inside Na inside Na +- + + +( )+ æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ +ln ln \u0000\u0000 CCl inside Cl Na outside Cl outside Na f GG RT f - - +- + æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ =+()+ ln \u0000 ooutside Na Cl outside Clf RT f f+ - - æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ + æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ ln \u0000 (2.211) In this equation, the pure component value of the Gibbs free energy and the fugacity for each pure species are the same on the inside and the outside solutions, since these are both at the same tem- perature and pressure. We can also make use of the fact from Equation 2.99 that f xfi ii i \u0000 =g . Hence, Equation 2.211 becomes ln ln lnxx x Na inside Na inside Cl inside Cl inside Na ou ++ -- +()+ () =gg ttside Na outside Cl outside Cl outsidexgg+- -()+ ()ln (2.212) If it is also assumed that ggi inside i outside» and xV Cand xV Ci inside solvent L i inside i outside solvent L i outside== , then Equation 2.212 can be shown to simplify to the following result: C CC CC Na inside Cl inside Na outside Cl outside NaCl outside +- +-== () 22 (2.213) This equation can then be solved for the Cl− concentration in the inside solution containing the macromolecule as C C C Cl inside NaCl outside Na inside - + = () 2 (2.214) If the macromolecule is positively charged, then the electroneutrality of the inside solution will require that the following equation be satisfied: C ZC C Cl inside MM Na inside -+=+ (2.215) whereas if the macromolecule is negatively charged, then C ZC C Cl inside MM Na inside -+=- + (2.216) 105 A review of thermodynamic concepts When ZM > 0, Equations 2.214 and 2.215 can then be combined to obtain the following expression for the equilibrium concentration of Na+ in the solution containing the macromolecule: C ZC ZC C Na inside MM MM NaCl outside + = -+ () + () 2 2 4 2 (2.217) Of particular interest is the ratio of the ion concentrations for the inside and outside solutions. By letting r C/CC /C Na inside Na outside Na inside NaCl outside==++ + , Equation 2.217 may be rewritten in terms of r: r ZC C ZC C MM NaCl outside MM NaCl outside= - + æ è ç ö ø ÷ + 22 1 2 (2.218) The ratio of the Cl− concentrations inside and outside can also be shown to be related to r where C /C /r Cl inside Cl outside -- = 1 . Equation 2.218 shows that for a macromolecule with no charge, the value of r = 1, and the Na+ and Cl− ion concentrations inside and outside at equilibrium are the same as expected. However, for a macromolecule with a very large positive charge, Equation 2.218 shows that for this case, r → 0, which means that the Na+ are excluded from the inside solution due to the excessive positive charge carried by the macromolecule. This also means that the Cl− concentration in the inside solution is much larger than that on the outside, and this occurs in order to offset the positive charge of the mac- romolecule and makes the inside solution electrically neutral. In general, for a positively charged macromolecule within the inside solution, r < 1 and C Cand CC Na inside Na outside Cl inside Cl outside ++ --<> . This unequal distribution of the Na+ and Cl− at equilibrium is due to the presence of the charged macromolecule, and this is called the Gibbs-Donnan effect. This unequal distribution of these ions also means that the osmotic pressure of the “solvent” on the inside and the outside solutions are not the same. A similar analysis for a negatively charged macromolecule leads to the following expression for the value of r: r ZC C ZC C MM NaCl outside MM NaCl outside=+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + 22 1 2 (2.219) where ZM < 0. Also, the ratio of the Cl− concentrations inside and outside is given by C /C /r. Cl inside Cl outside -- = 1 Once again, if the macromolecule contains no charge, then from Equation 2.219, r = 1, and the Na+ and Cl− ion concentrations inside and outside at equilibrium are the same as expected. However, for a macromolecule with a very large negative charge, Equation 2.219 shows for this case that r ≫ 1, which means that the Na+ are concentrated in the inside solution due to the excessive negative charge carried by the macromolecule, and this occurs in order to offset the negative charge of the macromolecule and make the inside solution electrically neutral. This also means that the Cl− con- centration in the inside solution is much smaller than that on the outside. In general, for a negatively charged macromolecule within the inside solution, r > 1 and C Cand CC Na inside Na outside Cl inside Cl outside ++ -->< . 106 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Using the previous relationships, we can now calculate the osmotic pressure of the macromolecule contained in the inside solution in the presence of a 1:1 electrolyte like NaCl. The following analysis assumes ideal solution behavior of both the inside and outside solutions at equilibrium. Assuming the macromolecule carries a positive charge, ZM, we can write the osmotic pressure of the macro- molecule solution as P =+ +()-++- +RTCRTC RTCRTC RTCM inside Na inside Cl inside Na outside CCl outside -() (2.220) The first parenthetical term on right-hand side of this equation is the ideal osmotic pressure (see Equation 2.147) due to the macromolecule and the Na+ and Cl− ions that are present in the inside solution. The second parenthetical term in Equation 2.220 is the osmotic pressure of the outside solution due to the Na+ and Cl− ions. Note that if there is no electrolyte present, then the previ- ous equation simplifies to P = RTCM inside, as expected. From Equation 2.220, we see then that this quantity, RT CC CC Na inside Cl inside Na outside Cl outside +- +-+()-+()é ë ù û, is the correction to the osmotic pressure of the macromolecule as a result of the Gibbs-Donnan effect. Using Equation 2.215 to replace CCl inside - and replacing CNa inside + with CNaCl outside using the definition of r, and then substituting for r using Equation 2.118, the previous equation after some algebra becomes P =+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + () é ë ê ê ù û ú ú -RTCRT ZC CCM inside MM NaCl outside2 2 2 2 2 12/ NNaCl outside ì í ï îï ü ý ï þï (2.221) The same result is obtained for a negatively charged macromolecule. Equation 2.221 gives the osmotic pressure of a macromolecule in a 1:1 electrolyte solution like NaCl. The first term on the right-hand side of this equation is the ideal osmotic pressure of the macromolecule based on van’t Hoff’s equation, i.e., Equation 2.147. The second term on the right- hand side of Equation 2.221 is the correction to this osmotic pressure as a result of the Gibbs- Donnan effect. At high concentrations of the salt, i.e., CNaCl outside, or values of the macromolecule charge, ZM, approaching zero, the term representing the Gibbs-Donnan effect in Equation 2.221 becomes negligible. This means that the “solvent” on each side of the semipermeable membrane is the same. Example 2.27 Vilker et al. (1981) measured the osmotic pressure of solutions of the protein bovine serum albumin in solutions containing NaCl. Their experiments were conducted in an osmometer at a temperature of 25°C. In one experiment, the solution pH was 7.4 and the NaCl concentra- tion, i.e., CNaCl outside, was equal to 0.15 M. For an albumin concentration of 84 grams per liter, the osmotic pressure was found to be 48 mmHg. How does this measured value of the osmotic pressure compare to the value predicted by Equation 2.221? At a pH of 7.4, they also showed that the net charge on an albumin molecule is −20.5. The molecular weight of the bovine serum albumin is 69,000 g mol−1. 107 A review of thermodynamic concepts Solution With ZM = −20.5, CM = 84 g L−1 × 1 mol (69,000 g)−1 = 0.0012 M, and C MNaCl outside = 015. , then from Equation 2.221, it is found that P =´ ´+ -- - -- 0 0821 298 0 0012 0 0821 11 1 11 .. .

However, this predicted value of the ideal osmotic pressure for albumin at these conditions is about 14% less than the measured value, and this is because at this albumin concentration, the albumin solution behavior is nonideal. Problem 2.50 in the chapter problems shows how to handle the nonideal behavior of albumin at these concentrations. Example 2.28 In Example 2.27, the concentration of the macromolecule is 0.0012 M. The macromolecule also carries a net negative charge of −20.5 at the given solution pH. The NaCl concentration in the solution is 0.15 M. Calculate the ratio of the concentration of the Na+ in the solution containing the macromolecule (inside) to that in the solution outside. Also find the ratio of the concentration of the Cl− inside to that outside. Solution With ZM = −20.5, CM = 0.0012 M, and C MNaCl outside = 015. , then from Equation 2.219, it is found that r M M M M = ´ ´ + ´ ´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ += 20 50 0012 20 15 20 50 0012 20 15 11 0854 2 .. . .. . . Therefore, the ratio of the Na+ concentration inside with the macromolecule to that outside is 1.0854, and the ratio of Cl− inside to that outside is 1/r = 0.9214. Although the solutions on the inside and the outside are electrically neutral, there is, as shown in Example 2.28, an unequal distribution of the ions, which is caused by the charged macromolecules in the inside solution. For example, in Example 2.28, the Na+ are concentrated inside to counter the negative charges on the macromolecules. The Cl− are repulsed by the negative charges on the mac- romolecules and are concentrated in the solution that is outside. This means that there is a concen- tration gradient of Na+ that would tend to cause these ions to diffuse from the inside solution to the outside solution. Similarly, a concentration gradient of Cl− is also formed, which would tend to cause 108 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering these ions to diffuse from outside the bag to the inside. To counter these concentration gradients, at equilibrium, there exists an attractive electrical force caused by the negative charges of the macro- molecules that counters the loss of these Na+ from the inside solution due to the presence of their concentration gradient. These same negative charges on the macromolecule oppose the diffusion of the Cl− from the solution outside to the inside solution containing the macromolecule. This trans- membrane electrical potential is known as the Donnan potential and is described in the next section. 2.6.3.14 Donnan potential We can obtain an equation that relates the equilibrium membrane potential (V), i.e., the difference in electrical potential between the inside (Vinside) and the outside (Voutside) solutions, to the equilibrium concentrations of the ions on either side of the semipermeable membrane. The presence of an electrical field across the membrane will produce a force on the ions as a result of their charge. Hence, the ions will move and their motion causes a current to flow. Recall that voltage (V) times current (I) is equal to the power and power is the rate of doing work. Electrical work is therefore done on the ion and is given by W VItelectrical =- (2.222) If we are only infinitesimally removed from equilibrium, then Welectrical becomes Wreversible electrical and from our earlier discussion in Section 2.3.3.1, the reversible electrical work (maximum work at constant T and P) is equal to the change in the Gibbs free energy. Also, the product of the current and the time in Equation 2.222 is equal to the total charge that is transferred. Faraday’s constant (F) is defined as the charge carried by a gram mole of ions of unit positive valency and is equal to 9.649 × 104 coulombs mol−1, or 2.306 × 104 cal V−1 mol−1. We can now rewrite Equation 2.222 for a gram mole of ions as W GzFVreversible electrical electrical== -D (2.223) where z is the charge on the ion being considered. For example, for a sodium ion (Na+) z = +1, for a calcium ion (Ca2+)z = 2, and for a chloride ion (Cl−)z = −1. In addition to the movement of these ions by the electrical field, there is also movement of the ions as a result of the concentration gradient. The change in the Gibbs free energy due to the transport of a solute from the inside macromolecule-containing solution to the outside solution is given by -= -= -DGG Gtransportinside outside inside outsidemm (2.224) Recall from Equation 2.75 that for an ideal solution, we can write that mminside ideal solution inside inside outside ideal sGRTC and=+ ¢ ln oolution outside outsideGRTC=+ ¢ ln (2.225) where we have replaced the mole fraction with the concentration and the G′s are pure component constants. Also, since the state of the ion is the same in the two regions, then GGinside outside ¢¢= , and we can write that DGRT C C transport outside inside = ln (2.226) 109 A review of thermodynamic concepts The total change in the Gibbs free energy for the movement of the ion by transport and the electri- cal field is given by the sum of Equations 2.223 and 2.226. At equilibrium, this total change in the Gibbs free energy is zero: DGRT C C zFVtotal outside inside =- =ln 0 (2.227) Solving for V, we obtain Equation 2.228, which is known as the Nernst equation. This equation can be used to calculate the equilibrium membrane potential for a particular ion in equilibrium with a charged macromolecule: V RT zF C C RT zF C C outside inside inside outside == -ln ln (2.228) In this equation R represents the gas constant (e.g., 1.987 cal mol−1 K−1) T is the temperature in K z is the charge on the ion F is Faraday’s constant (2.3 × 104 cal V−1 mol−1) At 25°C for a univalent ion, ∣RT/zF∣ is equal to 25.68 mV, whereas at 37°C, the value is 26.71 mV. Example 2.29 With the results from Example 2.28, calculate the transmembrane electrical potential based on the Na+ concentration and the Cl− concentrations within the inside and outside solutions.

Recall that a strong electrolyte in water completely dissociates into its constituent ions. Oftentimes, in biologi- cal systems, our aqueous solutions will also contain weak electrolytes such as weak acids or weak bases. Weak acids and bases only partially dissociate. An important example of a weak acid is acetic acid (CH3COOH or HOAc), and an example of a weak base is aqueous ammonia or ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH). Weak acids and weak bases, because of their partial dissociation, will affect the concentration of H+ and, as a result, the pH of the solution. 110 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering In addition, water can also partially dissociate into H+ and OH−. At 25°C, the dissociation equilib- rium constant for water (KW) is given by KC CMW HOH==+- -10 14 2 (2.229) Since water must remain electrically neutral, this means that C C HOH + = - , and using Equation 2.229, this means that (CH+ )2 = 10−14 M2, which says that for pure water at 25°C, the C C HOH + = - = 10−7 M. The pH of an aqueous solution is defined in terms of the H+ concentration (M) and is given by pHCHº- +log10 (2.230) For pure water at 25°C, we showed that CH+ = 10−7 M; hence from Equation 2.230 for pure water, the pH = 7, which is referred to as neutral since this value of the pH just expresses the normal con- centration of H+ due to the equilibrium dissociation of water. As the pH decreases below 7, e.g., by adding an acid to water, the concentration of H+ increases from the neutral value where the pH = 7 (CH+ = 10−7 M), and if the pH increases above 7, e.g., by adding a base to water, the concentration of H+ decreases. If a weak electrolyte such as acetic acid is added to pure water, then additional hydrogen ions will be added to the solution due to the partial dissociation of the weak acid, i.e., HOAc ↔ H+ + OAc−, where OAc− denotes the acetate anion. The release of the H+ from the acetic acid in solution will lower the pH of the solution at equilibrium. In solving a chemical equilibrium problem such as this, involving the addition of acetic acid to water, the goal is usually to determine the concentrations of all the species that are present in the solution at equilibrium. For example, for the case of adding acetic acid (HOAc) to water, this means finding the concentrations at equilibrium of HOAc, OAc−, H+, OH−, and HOH. This requires that we have the same number of independent equations as there are unknowns. The equations used to find these unknowns are of three general types and include those of chemical equilibrium for each dissociation reaction, conservation of mass on the N species involved in the M reactions, and conservation of electrical charge. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kj) are specific for each reaction (j) and depend on the temperature and can be affected by the presence of other species. For most reactions of interest, these values are tabulated in chemistry handbooks or may be found by Internet searches. Since the equilibrium dissociation constant for weak electrolytes can span many orders of magnitude, oftentimes the equilibrium constant for a particular reaction j is given as the base 10 logarithm of the equilibrium constant. Hence, the dissociation of a weak electrolyte by reaction j is given as pKj, where pKj is defined in terms of Kj by Equation 2.231. Note that the pKj is not the same as the dissociation equilibrium constant: pKKjjº- log10 (2.231) Note that pKW for water is −log10 (10−14) and is equal to 14, whereas for a weak acid like acetic acid, the pKHOAc is equal to 4.745. Recall that in Section 1.3.3 we defined for reaction j the differential change in the moles of each species i, i.e., dni, in terms of the differential extent of reaction j, i.e., dεj. The extent of reaction j (dεj) has units of moles. We also let νij represent the stoichiometric coefficient of species i in reaction j. 111 A review of thermodynamic concepts With these definitions and Equations 1.9 through 1.11, we can calculate the concentrations of all the species at chemical equilibrium. The solution of these equations for the concentrations of the species will involve a lot of algebra as well as clever approximations that simplify the process of finding a solution. The following two examples illustrate the approach for solving chemical equi- librium problems. Example 2.30 Determine the equilibrium concentrations of all species in a 0.05 M solution of acetic acid. Also find the pH of the solution. Solution There are two dissociation reactions that must be considered: one is for acetic acid and the other is for water. These are shown below along with their corresponding equations for chemi- cal equilibrium. The equilibrium constants are from Tinoco et al. (2001): HOAc H OAc andK CC C MHOAc H OAc HOAc «+ == ´ +- -+- 18 10 5. (1) HOH HOHand KC CMW HOH«+ == +- - +- 10 14 2 (2) It is convenient to first take as a basis 1 L of solution and let nHOAc 0 represent the initial moles of HOAc added to make the 1 L solution. Hence, in this example, to make a 0.05 M solution, nmolHOAc 0 005= . . In terms of the extent of each of the previous reactions, we can make use of Equations 1.10 and 1.11 and write the following equations that express conservation of mass for each of the species that are present in the solution: nnHOAc HOAc=- 0 1e (3) nOAc- =e1 (4) nH+ =+ee12 (5) nOH- =e2 (6) nnHOH HOH=- 0 2e (7) Note that in writing these equations, there is no OAc−, OH−, and H+ present initially in the solution since we start with undissociated water and acetic acid. If we now divide these equa- tions by the 1 L volume of solution taken as our basis, we can then express ni in terms of concentration Ci, where the extents now have units of moles per liter or molar concentration: C CHOAc HOAc=- 0 1e (8) COAc- =e1 (9) 112 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering CH+ =+ee12 (10) COH- =e2 (11) C CHOH HOH=- 0 2e (12) Addition of Equations 8 and 9 expresses the fact that at equilibrium, C CCHOAc HOAc OAc 0 =+ -. We can also insert the previous equations into the equilibrium relationships given by Equations 1 and 2 to give two equations in terms of the two unknown extents ε1 and ε2: ee e e 12 1 1 5 005 18 10 +() - =´ - . . (13) ee e12 2 1410+( )( ) = - (14) Since we are dealing with the dissociation of an acid in water, we expect that at equilibrium, the C C HOH + ≫ - . This means from Equation 11 that CH+ ≫ e2, and from Equation 10, this is the same as saying that ε1 ≫ ε2. As a result of these assumptions, Equation 13 can be simpli- fied to give e e ee 1 2 1 5 1 25 1 7 005 18 10 18 10 90 10 0 . .. . - =´ +´ -´ = -- -or (15) The quadratic form on the right-hand side of Equation 15 can then be solved for ε1 = 9.4 × 10−4 M. Note that the other root is invalid since it is negative. Equation 14 can then be solved for ε2 = 1.064 × 10−11 M. Note that ε1 ≫ ε2 as we assumed earlier. With the extents of the reactions known, we can now use Equations 8 through 12 to calculate the concentrations of the species at equilibrium, as shown below. Note that the concentration of pure water, i.e., CHOH 0 , is equal to 1000 g L−1 × 1 mol 18−1 g−1 = 55.56 M and for practical purposes is constant: C CMHOAc HOAc=- =- ´= -0 1 40059 4100 0491e .. . (16) C M OAc- == ´ -e1 494 10. (17) C M H+ =+ =´ -ee12 494 10. (18) C M OH- == ´ -e2 111 064 10. (19) C CMHOH HOH=- = 0 2 55 6e . (20) The pH of the solution at equilibrium is −log10(9.4 × 10−4) = 3.03. Also, electroneutrality requires that C CC H OAc OH + =+-- and we see from the above solution that this requirement is also satisfied. 113 A review of thermodynamic concepts In biological systems, it is also very important to control the pH at some particular value, and buf- fers are substances that are employed to make the solution pH less sensitive to changes in the pH or the concentration of H+ ions. These buffers usually consist of a weak acid or a weak base and their corresponding salt. For example, in a solution made from a particular acid, the addition of the salt of this acid will buffer the solution by consuming excess H+, thereby keeping the pH of the solution relatively constant. This is illustrated in the following example. Example 2.31 Determine the amount of sodium acetate (NaOAc) needed to form a buffer solution of pH = 4.5 in a 1 L solution containing 0.05 M acetic acid. Solution In Example 2.30, it was shown that the pH of a 0.05 M solution of acetic acid is 3.03. NaOAc acts as a strong electrolyte dissociating into Na+ and OAc−. The acetate anions will tend to consume the H+, and the problem is to find how much NaOAc is needed to raise the pH to 4.5. Now we have three dissociation reactions: NaOAc Na OAc completely dissociates K NaOAc®+ =¥ +- , (1) HOAc H OAc andK CC C MHOAc H OAc HOAc «+ == ´ +- -+- 18 10 5. (2) HOH HOHand KC CMW HOH«+ == +- - +- 10 14 2 (3) As in the previous example, we can express the concentrations of each species in terms of the extent of each of the above reactions as shown by the following equations: C CNaOAc NaOAc=- 0 1e (4) CNa+ =e1 (5) C CHOAc HOAc=- 0 2e (6) COAc- =+ee12 (7) CH+ =+ee23 (8) COH- =e3 (9) C CHOH HOH=- 0 3e (10) Since NaOAc is a strong electrolyte, and completely dissociates, then from Equation 4, CNaOAc = 0 and e1 0= CNaOAc. Also by Equations 5 and 7, we have that C Cand C Na NaOAc OAc +-== =+ =ee e1 0 12 CNaOAc 0 2+e . Adding Equations 6 and 7, we also get that C CC CHOAc OAc HOAc HOAc+= += +- 0 1 0e C CCNaOAc AS 00 0=+ . Here we generalize the result by denoting C andCAS 00 as the initial concen- trations of the acid and the salt in the solution that is formed. 114 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering A charge balance can also be written by summing Equations 5 and 8 for the cations and Equations 7 and 9 for the anions, and these must be equal, giving the following result: C CC C Na H OAc OH ++ --+= + (11) To form a buffer solution, the amount of NaOAc or salt that must be added is usually signifi- cant. Therefore, we expect that C C NA H++ ≫ and C C OAc OH --≫ . This means that ε1 ≫ ε2 + ε3 as well as ε1 ≫ ε3. From the charge balance given by Equation 11 C CC Na OAc NaOAc+-== = 0 1e (12) In addition, as shown in Example 2.30, the dissociation of the weak acid, in this case acetic acid by Equation 6, is very small; hence, C CHOAc HOAc» 0 . Therefore, the equilibrium constant for the HOAc can be written as follows: K CC C CC C CC C HOAc H OAc HOAc H NaOAc HOAc H S A =» = +- ++ 0 0 0 0 (13) This equation can then be solved for CH+ as follows: C K C C H HOAc A S + = 0 0 (14) loglog log10 10 0 0CK C C H HOAc A S + =+ (15) The previous equations can then be rewritten in terms of the pH and the pK of the acid (A) as shown below. This equation is known as the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pHpK C C A S A =+ log10 0 0 (16) This equation is a general result that can be used to prepare buffer solutions. Since C CSA 00» , we usually select a weak acid with a pKA close to the desired pH. Recall that the subscript S refers to the salt of the weak acid A and pKA is for the weak acid. For this example, we have that pKA = 4.745 and C MA 0 005= . . Also, the final solution pH is to be 4.5. The Henderson- Hasselbalch equation can then be solved for the concentration of the salt, i.e., NaOAc in this example, as shown below: 4 54 745 005 0 028410 0 0.. log . .=+ = C M whichgives CM S S If the solution formed has a volume equal to 1 L, this means that 0.0284 mol of NaOAc is needed. The molecular weight of NaOAc is 82 g mol−1, so the amount of NaOAc needed is 0.0284 mol × 82 g mol−1 = 2.33 g. In obtaining this solution, we have assumed that the solu- tions are ideal. In actual practice, the pH of the solution may need some minor tweaking to account for nonideal solution behavior. 115 A review of thermodynamic concepts Problems 2.1 Assuming that air is an ideal gas, calculate the change in entropy and enthalpy when 100 mol of air at 25°C and 1 atm is heated and compressed to 300°C and 10 atm. Use the following equation for CP: C R AB TC T P =+ ×+ × -2 where A = 3.355, B = 0.575 × 10−3, and C = −0.016 × 105, with T in K. 2.2 Calculate the reversible work required to compress adiabatically (i.e., Q = 0) 60 mol of carbon dioxide initially at 25°C and 1 atm to 350°C and 10 atm. Assume that CP = 37.1 J K−1 mol−1. Assume that carbon dioxide is an ideal gas. 2.3 A toy rocket consists of a Styrofoam rocket snuggly fitted into a long tube of volume equal to 0.5 L. The pressure in the tube is increased to a final pressure of 3 atm and a temperature of 30°C at which time the rocket takes off. If the rocket weighs 50 g, estimate the maximum initial velocity of the rocket and the maximum expected height of the rocket. Assume air is an ideal gas and has a CV = (5/2)R. Explain why the rocket would not be expected to achieve this elevation. 2.4 Air at 400 kPa and 400 K passes through a turbine. The turbine is well insulated. The air leaves the turbine at 125 kPa. Find the maximum amount of work that can be obtained from the tur- bine and the exit temperature of the air leaving the turbine. Assume air is an ideal gas with a CP = (7/2)R. 2.5 Consider the slow adiabatic expansion of a closed volume of gas for which CP = (7/2)R. If the initial gas temperature is 825 K and the ratio of the final pressure to the initial pressure is 1/3, what is the change in enthalpy of the gas, the change in internal energy, the heat transferred Q, and the work W? Assume a basis of 1 mol of gas. 2.6 Air at 125 kPa and 350 K passes through a compressor. The compressor is well insulated. The air leaves the compressor at 600 kPa and 650 K. Find the work required to do this compres- sion. Is this change of state of the air possible? Assume air is an ideal gas with a CP = (7/2)R. 2.7 Consider the slow adiabatic compression of a closed volume of gas for which CP = 3.5 R. If the initial gas temperature is 320 K and the ratio of the final pressure to the initial pressure is 4, what is the change in enthalpy of the gas, the change in internal energy, the heat transferred Q, and the work W? Assume a basis of 1 mol of gas. 2.8 One mole of an ideal gas, initially at 30°C and 1 atm, undergoes the following reversible changes. It is first compressed isothermally to a point such that when it is heated at constant volume to 150°C, its final pressure is 12 atm. Calculate Q, W, ΔE, and ΔH for the process. Take CP = 3.5 R and CV = 2.5 R. 2.9 A rigid vessel of 75 L volume contains an ideal gas at 400 K and 1 atm. If heat in the amount of 15,000 J is transferred to the gas, determine the entropy change of the gas. Assume CV = 2.5 R and CP = 3.5 R. 2.10 An osmotic pump (see Figure 8.7) is a device used to deliver a drug at a constant rate within the body. An excess of NaCl is used to form a continuously saturated solution that is contained within a compartment called the osmotic engine, which is located between a semipermeable membrane that is exposed to the interstitial fluid and a piston, which acts on a reservoir con- taining the drug. In operation, water from the surrounding tissue is brought into the osmotic 116 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering engine by osmosis. The resulting expansion of the osmotic engine drives the piston that forces drug from the drug reservoir out of the osmotic pump at a constant rate. The drug delivery rate (R) can be shown to be proportional to the osmotic pressure of the fluid within the osmotic engine and the concentration (C) of the drug in the reservoir. The delivery rate of the drug is therefore given by Rk C=p At 37°C, the saturation concentration of NaCl in water is equal to 5.4 M. For a particular osmotic pump, it was found that the drug release rate (R) was 125 μg day−1. The drug concen- tration (C) was 370 mg mL−1. What is the value of the proportionality constant (k, in mL day−1 atm−1) for this osmotic pump? 2.11 The Navy is considering an osmotic device in their submarines in order to desalinate water when the submarine is submerged. When the submarine is below a critical depth, the osmotic device converts seawater into pure water that would be available for use on the submarine. The density of seawater is 1024 kg m−3 and the composition of the seawater is equivalent to a 0.5 M NaCl solution. What is the critical depth in meters below which this proposed desalina- tion process will work? 2.12 One mole of an ideal gas initially at 25°C and 1 atm is heated and allowed to expand against an external pressure of 1 atm until the final temperature is 400°C. For this gas, CV = 20.8 J mol−1 K−1. a. Calculate the work done by the gas during the expansion. b.

At this temperature, calculate the total pressure and the composition of the vapor, which is in equilibrium with the liquid containing a mole fraction of A of 0.25. 2.14 When 0.013 mol of urea is dissolved in 1000 g of water, the freezing point of water decreases by 0.024 K. How does this measured freezing point depression compare to that based on the ideal solution theory? 2.15 Gas in a cylinder expands slowly by pushing on a frictionless piston. The following data shows what happens to the gas in the cylinder. How much work (W) is done by the gas? Assuming CV = 2.5 R, what is the change in the internal energy (ΔE) of the gas? How much heat was transferred during the process (Q)?

Most of the modern cubic equations of state derive from that first developed by van der Waals in 1873. The van der Waals equation of state is given by P a V Vb RT+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ -() = 2 where a is called the attraction parameter b is referred to as the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume Note that with a and b equal to zero, this equation simplifies to the ideal gas law. These con- stants are found by either fitting the above equation to actual PVT data, or as we shall see next, we can use the critical point to define them in terms of the component critical properties. a. Show that the previous equation can also be written in the following cubic forms in terms of volume or the compressibility factor: Vb RT P V a P V ab P 32 0-+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ +- = ZZ Z bP RT aP RT abP RT 32 2 2 310-+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + () - () = For isotherms (T) below the critical isotherm and P = PSat(T) (also refer to Figure 2.3), the solution to either of the previous equations will produce three roots for either V or Z. The smallest of these roots will correspond to the saturated liquid value, i.e., point B in Figure 2.3, and the largest of these roots will correspond to the saturated vapor value, i.e., point D in Figure 2.3. The middle root has no physical meaning. At the critical point, point C in Figure 2.3, these three roots become equal, i.e., VVV RT /PZL Sat V Sat CC CC== = , where the subscript C denotes the critical values of PVT and Z. Hence, at the critical point, we have that (V − VC)3 = 0 or when this is expanded, we have that VV VV VVCC C 32 2333 0-+ -= . b. Comparing the like powers of the expanded volume equation at the critical point to those in the volume explicit form of the van der Waals equation, show that the van der Waals parameters are given by the following equations in terms of the critical properties: a RT P b RT P R PV T Z C C C C CC C C== == 27 64 8 83 0 375 22 . Although the value for the gas constant R is found to depend on the component-critical properties, the usual practice is to use the universal value of the gas constant (shown in Table 1.5) in PVT calculations. In this way, the van der Waals equation of state becomes the ideal gas law at low pressures. c. For water at 250°C, the vapor pressure is 3977.6 kPa and the specific volumes of the satu- rated vapor and liquid are 50.04 and 1.251 cm3 g−1.

What is the molecular weight of the protein? 2.20 Consider the situation where a semipermeable membrane separates a bulk fluid (region A) with an osmotic pressure of 1750 mmHg from another enclosed fluid (region B) with an osmotic pressure of 10,000 mmHg. The hydrodynamic gauge pressure of region A is 760 mmHg. The solvent in both regions A and B is water. Assuming the container and membrane enclosing region B is rigid, what is the equilibrium hydrodynamic gauge pressure in region B, i.e., the situation wherein there is no net flow of water across the membrane? 2.21 When 0.5 mol of sucrose is dissolved in 1000 g of water, the osmotic pressure at 20°C is found to be 12.75 atm. Calculate the activity coefficient of water. 2.22 It is desired to extract from water a drug with a mole fraction of 0.02. A single equilibrium stage extractor is to be used. The flow rate of the aqueous stream to the extractor is 50 mol min−1, and the flow rate of the solvent to the extractor is 150 mol min−1. If 90% of the drug is to be removed from the aqueous stream, what should the distribution coefficient of the solvent for this drug be? 2.23 Using the results for the distribution coefficient from Problem 2.22, what would the percent extraction of the drug be if four equilibrium extraction stages were used? 2.24 The activity coefficients of ethanol (1) and water (2) can be described by the van Laar equa- tion, where ln g112 21 2 12 1212 2 = + æ è ç ö ø ÷A Ax Ax Ax ln g221 12 1 12 1212 2 = + æ è ç ö ø ÷A Ax Ax Ax The infinite dilution activity coefficient g1 ¥( ) of ethanol in water is 4.66 and that for water in ethanol g2 ¥( ) is 2.64. At 25°C, the vapor pressure of water is 3.166 kPa and the vapor pres- sure of ethanol is 7.82 kPa. Assuming a liquid phase contains 50 wt% ethanol, estimate the composition of the vapor phase that is in equilibrium with the liquid phase. Would this vapor phase composition be explosive? The density of pure water at 25°C is 0.9971 g cm−3, and the 119 A review of thermodynamic concepts density of pure ethanol is 0.7851 g cm−3. The density of a 50 wt% solution of ethanol in water is 0.9099 g cm−3. 2.25 Explain why a water bug can walk on water. 2.26 A droplet of water at 25°C has a diameter of 0.1 μm. Calculate the pressure within the droplet of water. 2.27 What is the vapor pressure of the water within a droplet of water at 25°C that has a diameter of 10 nm? 2.28 Consider the situation of a liquid mixture where the solute molecules are much larger than those of the solvent. An example of such a mixture would be a polymer in a solvent or a protein solution. In the solution model developed by Flory and Huggins (Sandler, 1989), the entropy change as a result of mixing a solvent (1) with a much larger solute (2) is given by the following expression: D ffSR xx mix =- +()11 22ln ln where x1 and x2 are the mole fractions ϕ1 and ϕ2 are the volume fractions of the solvent and the solute, respectively The volume fractions are given by ff1 1 12 2 2 12 = + = + x xrx and rx xrx with r = V2/V1, where V1 and V2 are the molar volumes of each species. Using Equations 2.44 and 2.96 that define the property change of mixing and the excess property, respectively, along with the result from Example 2.6 that SS Rxi ideal solution ii=- ln , show that the excess entropy of the solution is given by S Rx x x x E =- + æ è ç ö ø ÷1 1 1 2 2 2 ln ln ff Note that if the volumes of the solvent and solute are comparable in size, then from the above expression SE = 0, and the solution is then an ideal solution. So, we see that it is the differ- ence in the size of the solvent and the solute that leads to the nonideal solution behavior in the model proposed by Flory and Huggins. The excess enthalpy (HE) was then expressed by the following equation: H RT xrx E =+()cf f12 12 where χ is an adjustable parameter known as the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter. The Flory- Huggins interaction parameter for nonpolar systems can be shown to be related to the solubility parameters of the solvent and the solute by the following equation (Prausnitz et al., 1986): cd d=-() V RT 1 12 2 120 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering A good solvent for the polymer or macromolecule is one for which χ is very small or δ1 ~ δ2. In addition, to ensure that the solvent and polymer are completely miscible, the largest value of χ is equal to 0.5. If χ > 0.5, the solvent and solute are only partially miscible.

Then, perform another nonlinear regression that includes Band C. 2.30 What is the predicted temperature of the seawater surrounding polar ice caps, assuming the seawater and the ice are in equilibrium? Assume the freezing point of pure water is 0°C and that the heat of fusion of pure water is 6012 J mol−1. 2.31 A mountain climber has reached an elevation where the observed boiling point of water is 97°C. Estimate how high above sea level the climber is. Carefully state your assumptions and any references that you have consulted. 2.32 The concentration of a macromolecule in an aqueous solution contained inside a semiperme- able membrane bag is 0.002 M. The macromolecule carries a net negative charge of minus 8. If the NaCl concentration in the solution outside the bag at equilibrium is 0.05 M, calculate the ratio of the concentration of the Na+ inside the bag to that outside the bag. Also, find the ratio of the concentration of the Cl− inside the bag to that outside the bag. What is the transmembrane 122 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering voltage at equilibrium based on the Na+ concentration and the Cl− concentration inside and outside the membrane bag? 2.33 Protein concentration in a membrane bag is 0.005 M with ZM = +15. NaCl outside the bag is 0.15 M. Find Π of the protein in the bag. 2.34 Find the concentrations of the species at equilibrium for the case when a 0.10 M solution of sodium acetate (NaOAc) is made. NaOAc is the salt of acetic acid (HOAc). Also determine the pH of the resulting solution. Assume that sodium acetate as a salt is a strong electrolyte and that it completely dissociates in water to form Na+ and OAc−. In this case, the high concentra- tion of OAc− will tend to consume H+ with the result that HOAc (acetic acid) will be formed and we expect the resulting solution to be basic. The water and HOAc dissociation equilibrium constants may be found in Example 2.29. 2.35 Tris, i.e., tris-(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (molecular weight = 121.14 g mol−1), is a weak base (i.e., removes H+) and a very important buffer used to make biological solutions. Although it is a weak base, it is still convenient in solving buffer problems to work instead with its acid dissociation reaction, which can be written as follows: Tris − H+ ↔ Tris + H+. Tris−H+ has a pKA = 8.3 at 20°C. If a 1 L solution contains 0.05 M of Tris and 0.03 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), what is the pH of this solution? Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and will completely dissociate in an aqueous solution. Suppose after this solution is formed that an additional mil- limole of HCl is added. What is the pH now? Note that the addition of 1 mmol of HCl to 1 L of pure water gives a solution pH of 3.0. 2.36 A protein with a molecular weight of 67,396 g mol−1 is added to water such that the concentra- tion of the protein is 4.0 g 100−1 cm−3 of solution. Estimate the osmotic pressure (mmHg) of the resulting solution at a temperature of 0°C. 2.37 The osmotic pressure (mmHg) of a protein solution at a temperature of 30°C was found to be 10 mmHg. If the concentration of the protein is 4.0 g 100−1 cm−3 of solution, estimate the molecular weight of the protein molecule. 2.38 A peptide solution containing 0.35 g of protein per 100 mL of solution has an osmotic pres- sure of 36 mmH2O at 25°C. What is the molecular weight of the protein? 2.39 What is the osmotic pressure of a solution at 37°C containing a solute with a molecular weight of 75,000 at a concentration of 30 g L−1 and a solute with a molecular weight of 20,000 at a concentration of 10 g L−1? The solute with a molecular weight of 75,000 is unstable in this solution and completely dissociates into four solutes of equal size. 2.40 A protein solution with an osmotic pressure of 45 mm of water needs to be prepared. If the molecular weight of the protein is 50,000 g mol−1, how many grams of the protein need to be in 100 mL of the solution at 25°C? 2.41 Estimate the osmotic pressure in mmHg of an aqueous solution containing a solute with a molecular weight of 120,000. The solute concentration is 15 g L−1, and the solute totally dis- sociates in water into three smaller solutes of equal size. You can assume the temperature is 37°C. 2.42 A protein with a molecular weight of 70,000 g mol−1 is added to water at a temperature of 25°C. If the resulting osmotic pressure is found to be equal to 25 mmHg, estimate the required concentration of the protein in grams per 100 cm3 of solution. 2.43 An aqueous solution (A) with an osmotic pressure of 5 atm is separated by a membrane from an aqueous solution (B) with an osmotic pressure of 2 atm. Both solutions are at a total pressure of 1 atm. The solutes in these two solutions cannot pass through the membrane. 123 A review of thermodynamic concepts Which way will the water flow, i.e., from (A) to (B) or from (B) to (A)? By how much must the hydrodynamic pressure be increased to stop the osmotic flow of water, and on which solution, (A) or (B), must this pressure increase be applied? 2.44 A protein is added to water such that the resulting protein concentration is equal to 12 g 100 cm−3. If the resulting osmotic pressure of this solution is found to be equal to 35 mmHg at a temperature of 25°C, estimate the molecular weight of this protein. 2.45 One hundred and twenty grams of a protein is added to water to make a 1 L solution. The molecular weight of this protein is 72,000 g mol−1. However, when the protein is dissolved in water at 20°C, it dissociates into three equal-sized fragments. What is the osmotic pressure of this solution in mmHg? 2.46 A protein with a high molecular weight is added to water at a temperature of 25°C. If the resulting osmotic pressure of a 94.2 g L−1 solution of this protein is found to be equal to 25 mmHg, estimate the molecular weight of the protein in grams per mole. 2.47 A cell has a radius of 5 μm and is in osmotic equilibrium with its surroundings at 300 mOsM for a temperature of 25°C. The cell is then placed in a 155 mM solution of NaCl at the same temperature. Will water now flow into the cell or out of the cell? 2.48 MoviPrep® is a low-volume colonoscopy preparation that is used to provide a clear view of the entire colon, thereby allowing your doctor to detect abnormal growths during the colo- noscopy procedure.

If the resulting osmotic pressure of this solution is found to be equal to 12 mmHg, estimate the molecular weight of the macromolecule in grams per mole. 2.50 Vilker et al. (1981) studied the osmotic pressure of bovine serum albumin in a 0.15 M sodium chloride solution at pHs of 4.5, 5.4, and 7.4. Their data at a pH of 7.4 is shown in the table below. Show that the following semiempirical equation represents these data. The first term on the right-hand side of this equation represents the contribution to the osmotic pressure due to the uneven distribution of the small ions between the solutions on each side of the membrane as a result of the Gibbs-Donnan effect, i.e., see the explanation regarding Equation 2.221. The second term is a virial expansion that accounts for the nonideal behavior of albumin at these relatively high concentrations: p= æ è ç ö ø ÷ + é ë ê ê ù û ú ú - ì í ï î ï ü ý ï þ ï ++RT ZC M mm RT M CA C p p ss p p2 2 2 2 2 12 2 / pppAC 2 3 3+é ë ù û What are the best values of the virial coefficients, i.e., A2 and A3?

Z is the charge carried by the albumin molecule in the solution and is equal to the difference between the number of bound protons (H+) and bound chloride ions (Cl−) on each albumin molecule. At a pH of 7.4, Z equals 20.5.

Many of our engineering calcula- tions or the development and design of new procedures, devices, or treatments will either involve or affect the fluids that are within the human body. Therefore, we will focus our initial attention on the types and characteristics of the fluids that reside within the body. The body fluids can be classified into three types: extracellular, intracellular, and transcellular flu- ids. As shown in Table 3.1, nearly 60% of the body weight for an average 70 kg male is comprised of these body fluids, resulting in a total fluid volume of about 40 L. The largest fraction of the fluid volume, about 36% of the body weight, consists of intracellular fluid, which is the fluid contained within the body’s cells, e.g., the fluid found within red blood cells, muscle cells, and liver cells. Extracellular fluid consists of the interstitial fluid that comprises about 17% of the body weight and the blood plasma that comprises around 4% of the body weight. Interstitial fluid circulates within the spaces (interstitium) between cells. The interstitial fluid space represents about one-sixth of the body volume. The interstitial fluid is formed as a filtrate from the plasma portion of the blood that is within the capillaries. The capillaries are the smallest element of the cardiovascular system and represent the site where the exchange of vital substances occurs between the blood and the tissue surrounding the capillary. We shall see that the interstitial fluid composition is very similar to that of plasma. The blood volume of a 70 kg male is 5 L, with 3 L consisting of plasma and the remaining 2 L rep- resenting the volume of the cells in the blood, primarily the red blood cells. The 2 L of cells found in the blood are filled with intracellular fluid. The fraction of the blood volume due to the red blood cells is called the hematocrit. The red blood cell volume fraction is found by centrifuging a given volume of blood in order to find the “packed” red cell volume. Since a small amount of plasma is trapped between the packed red blood cells, the true hematocrit (H) is about 96% of this measured hematocrit (Hct). The true hematocrit is about 40% for a male and about 36% for a female. The transcellular fluids are those fluids found only within specialized compartments and include the cerebrospinal, intraocular, pleural, pericardial, synovial, sweat, and digestive fluids. Some of these compartments have membrane surfaces that are in proximity to one another and have a thin layer of lubricating fluid between them. 126 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Measurement of these fluid volumes can be achieved by using “tracer materials” that have the unique property of remaining in specific fluid compartments. The fluid volume of a specific compartment can then be found by adding a known mass of a tracer to a specific compart- ment and, after an appropriate period of time for dispersal, measuring the concentration (mass/ volume) of the tracer in the fluid compartment. The compartment volume is then given by the ratio of the tracer mass that was added and the measured tracer concentration, i.e., mass/(mass/ volume) = volume. Examples of tracers used to measure fluid volumes include radioactive water for measuring total body water and radioactive sodium, radioactive chloride, or inulin for measuring extracellular fluid volume. Tracers that bind strongly with plasma proteins may be used for measuring the plasma volume. Interstitial fluid volume may then be found by subtracting the plasma volume from the extracellular fluid volume. Subtraction of the extracellular fluid volume from the total body water provides the intracellular fluid volume. 3.2 Fluid compositions The compositions of the body fluids are presented in Table 3.2 in terms of concentration in units of milliosmolar (mOsmole L−1 of solution or mOsM). The term osmole has been introduced to account for the effect of a dissociating solute in an aqueous solution. One osmole is therefore defined as 1 mol of a nondissociating substance. Therefore, one mole of a dissociating substance such as NaCl is equivalent to 2 osmoles or a 1 molar (M) solution of NaCl is equivalent to a 2 osmolar (OsM) solution. However, one mole of glucose is the same as one osmole since glucose does not dissociate in solution. Osmolarity simply defines the number of osmoles per liter of solution. Since the solutes listed in Table 3.2 do not dissociate, these concentrations are the same as milli- molar (mmol L−1 or mM). Of particular interest is the fact that nearly 80% of the total osmolarity of the interstitial fluid and plasma is produced by sodium and chloride ions. As we discussed earlier, the interstitial fluid arises from filtration of plasma through the capillaries. We would therefore expect the composition of these two fluids to be very similar. This is shown in Table 3.2. We find this to be true with the exception that the protein concentration in the interstitial fluid is significantly smaller in comparison to its value in the plasma.

Figure 3.1 illustrates the relative size of various solutes as a function of their molecular weight. The wall of a capillary, illustrated in Figure 3.2, consists of a single layer of endothelial cells that are surrounded on their outside by a basement membrane. The basement membrane is a mat-like cellular support structure, or extracellular matrix, that consists primarily of a protein called type IV collagen, and is joined to the cells by the glycoprotein called laminin. The base- ment membrane is about 50–100 nm thick. The total thickness of the capillary wall is about 0.5 μm. As shown in Figure 3.2, there are several mechanisms that allow for the transport of solutes across the capillary wall. These include the intercellular cleft and pinocytotic vesicles and channels. The intercellular cleft is a thin slit or slit pore that is formed at the interface between adjacent endothelial cells. The size of the openings or pores in this slit is about 6–7 nm, just sufficient to retain plasma proteins such as albumin and other larger proteins.

Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA, 1991, p. 277. 128 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The collective surface area of these openings represents less than 1/1000th of the total capillary sur- face area for a typical nonfenestrated capillary. The plasma proteins are generally larger than the capillary slit pores. Although ellipsoidally shaped proteins, e.g., the clotting protein fibrinogen, may have a minor axis that is smaller than that of the capillary slit pore, the streaming effect caused by the fluid motion within the capillary orients the major axis of the proteins parallel to the flow axis and prevents their entry into the slit pore. This streaming effect is shown in Figure 3.3. Therefore, the smaller substances found in the plasma, such as ions, glucose, and metabolic waste products, will readily pass through the slit pores of the capil- lary wall, whereas the plasma proteins will be retained in the lumen of the capillary. The composi- tion of the plasma and interstitial fluid should therefore only differ in their protein content. This is shown in Table 3.2. 0 5 10 15 10 1,000 100,000Molecule diameter, nm Molecular weight, g mol–1 ABC D E G H (log scale) A=water B=Na C= oxygen D=urea E=glucose F=insulin G=cytochrome C H=myoglobin I= thrombin J= hemoglobin K= albumin L=IgG M=IgM Diameter of capillary pores F M L J K I Figure 3.1 Approximate diameter of molecules as a function of their molecular weight.

We discussed the thermodynamics of osmosis in Section 2.6.3.5. Since the plasma proteins are the only constituent of the plasma that do not readily pass through the capillary wall, it is the plasma proteins that are responsible for the formation of the osmotic pressure between the interstitial and plasma fluids. The osmotic pressure created by these proteins is given the special name of colloid osmotic pressure or oncotic pressure. For human plasma, the colloid osmotic pressure is about 28 mmHg, with 19 mmHg caused by the plasma proteins and 9 mmHg caused by the cations within the plasma that are also retained through elec- trostatic interaction with the negative surface charges of these proteins (see Gibbs-Donnan Effect in Section 2.6.3.13). The colloid osmotic pressure is actually quite small in comparison to the osmotic pressure that develops when a cell is placed in pure water. In this case, it is assumed that all of the species pres- ent within the intracellular fluid are retained by the cell membrane. As shown in Table 3.2, the total osmotic pressure of the intracellular fluid in this case would be 5430 mmHg at 37°C. 3.4.1 Osmolarity Recognizing that it is the number of retained solute molecules that contributes to the osmotic pressure, we must be careful to make the distinction between a retained substance that dissociates and one that does not dissociate. The term “retained” means that the solute cannot move across the membrane that separates the solutions of interest. For example, compounds such as NaCl are strong electrolytes. In water, they completely dissociate to form two ions, i.e., Na+ and Cl−. For CaCl2, we end up with three ions or entities, i.e., Ca2+ and two Cl−. Each ion or entity formed will exert its own osmotic pressure. It is important to note that the charge of the ion has no effect (assuming an ideal solution) on the osmotic pressure, so a sodium ion with a charge of +1 is equiva- lent to a calcium ion of charge +2. Substances such as glucose do not dissociate and their osmotic pressure is based on their nondissociated concentration only. Endothelial cell Intercellular cleft or pore Protein Blood flow Figure 3.3 Orientation of ellipsoidal shaped proteins by streaming prevents their entry into the capillary pores. 130 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering If a cell is placed within a solution that has a lower concentration of solutes or osmolarity, then the cell is in a hypotonic solution, and establishment of osmotic equilibrium requires the osmosis of water into the cell. This influx of water into the cell results in the swelling of the cell and a subse- quent decrease in its osmolarity. On the other hand, if the cell is placed in a solution with a higher concentration of solutes or osmolarity, i.e., hypertonic, then osmotic equilibrium requires osmosis or diffusion of water out of the cell, concentrating the intracellular solution and resulting in shrinkage of the cell. An isotonic solution is a fluid that has the same osmolarity of the cell. When cells are placed in an isotonic solution, there is neither swelling nor shrinkage of the cell. A 0.9 wt% solution of sodium chloride or a 5 wt% solution of glucose is just about isotonic with respect to a cell. 3.4.2 Calculating the osmotic pressure Recall from our discussion in Chapter 2 on osmosis that for the special case where the solvent and solute form an ideal solution, the osmotic pressure given by Equation 2.147 may be written as P == RT V xRTC solute L solute A solute (3.1) Here, xsolute A represents the mole fraction of the nondissociating solute in the solution, which is region A in Figure 2.5. Recall that since the solute mole fraction is generally quite small, we may approxi- mate this as xV Csolute A solvent L solute= , where Csolute is the concentration of the solute in gmoles per liter of solution and Vsolvent L is the molar volume of the solvent. This ideal dilute solution osmotic pressure, described by Equation 3.1, is also known as van’t Hoff’s law. If the solution contains N ideal nondissociating solutes, then the total osmotic pressure of the solu- tion will be the summation of the osmotic pressure generated by each solute or entity according to Equation 3.1: P = =åRT C i N solutei 1 (3.2) For physiological solutions, it is convenient to work in terms of milliosmoles (mOsm) or millios- molar (mOsM). At a physiological temperature of 37°C, Equation 3.2 may be written as follows to give the osmotic pressure in mmHg when the solute concentration of each nondissociating species is expressed in mOsM: P = =å19 33 1 .Csolute i N i (3.3) As we discussed in Chapter 2, remember that osmotic pressure is not determined on the basis of the mass of the solute in the solution, but rather on the number of entities that are formed by a given solute. Each nondiffusing entity in the solution contributes the same amount to the osmotic pressure regardless its size. The following example shows how to apply Equation 3.2 in a situation with many species that dissociate in water. 131 Physical properties of the body fluids and the cell membrane Example 3.1 MoviPrep® is a low-volume colonoscopy prep that is used to provide a clear view of the entire colon, allowing your doctor to detect abnormal growths during the colonoscopy procedure. Each liter of a MoviPrep solution contains in millimoles the components shown in the follow- ing table.

Solution The salt components will completely dissociate in the aqueous solution that is formed. We can do a dissociation balance on each entity to find its concentration in the final solution. The PEG 3350 does not dissociate so its concentration in the solution is 29.6 mM. NamOsM + =+ ´+ =45 62 52 8298 181.. . ClmOsM - =+ =45 6142 59 8.. . SOmOsM4 2 52 8528 - ==.. KmOsM + ==14 2142..

P =+ +++ +() =19 33 29 6 181 59 8528 14 2298 7098.. .. .. mmHg 3.4.3 Other factors that may affect the osmotic pressure The previous discussion assumed the mixture of solutes formed an ideal solution. However, the osmotic pressure should take into account the various secondary solute interactions that occur within the solution due to their charge, size, shape, and other effects. These effects will either increase or decrease the osmotic activity of a particular solute and results in the corrected osmolar activity shown in Table 3.2. We see in Table 3.2 that the ratio of the corrected osmolar concentration to the total osmolar concentration is about 0.93 for each of the body fluids. This value of 0.93 represents the overall average activity coefficient. In most cases, it is conventional practice to disregard the calculation of solute activity coefficients and calculate the osmotic pressure on the basis of solute 132 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering concentration only, as just discussed. Since we will primarily be concerned with differences in the osmotic pressure and the generation of fluid flow across a membrane due to a difference in osmotic pressure, this constant of 0.93 will become absorbed in other constants that generally need to be determined by experiment. 3.5 Filtration flow across a membrane Recall that in general, a flow of something is proportional to a driving force and inversely propor- tional to the flow resistance or proportional to the flow conductance. The flow of fluid across the capillary wall, or, for that matter, any porous semipermeable membrane, is driven then by a differ- ence in pressure across the membrane, which is the driving force. This pressure difference arises not only from hydrodynamic effects but also from the difference in osmotic pressure between the fluids separated by the membrane. The properties of the fluid as well as the physical nature of the membrane produce the resistance to this flow. Figure 3.4 shows the hydrodynamic and osmotic pressures in the capillary and the surrounding interstitial fluid. In this case the capillary wall acts like a semipermeable membrane. The subscript C refers to the capillary space and the subscript IF refers to the interstitial fluid space that surrounds the capillary. The arrows indicate for each pressure the corresponding direction of fluid flow induced by that pressure.

Also remember that Equation 3.4 applies not only to the capil- lary membrane but to any semipermeable membrane. However, the subscripts C and IF should be changed to reflect the situation being considered. For example, the high-pressure side of the mem- brane can be denoted as A and the low-pressure side of the membrane as B. In this case Equation 3.4 becomes Q = LPS[(PA − PB) − (ΠA − ΠB)]. For the capillary membrane, Renkin (1977) reports values for LP as low as 3 × 10−14 m2 s kg−1 for the tight junctions between the endothelial cells found in the capillaries of the rabbit brain, 5 × 10−12 m2 s kg−1 for nonfenestrated or continuous capillaries, and as high as 1.5 × 10−9 m2 s kg−1 for the capillaries in the glomeruli of the kidney. In the synthetic membranes used, e.g., in a hemodialyzer, LP is usu- ally expressed in common engineering units and is on the order of 3 mL h−1 m−2 mmHg−1. For silicon nanopore membranes, LP can be as high as 130 mL h−1 m−2 mmHg−1 (Song et al., 2016). It is important to note that Equation 3.4 carries a sign sense with it in terms of the direction of the filtration flow, Q. For example, the first difference term in the brackets of Equation 3.4 represents the difference between the hydrodynamic pressure of the capillary (PC) and the interstitial fluid (PIF). When this term is positive, fluid will leave the capillary. When this term is negative, fluid will flow from the interstitial fluid into the capillary. The second difference term within the brackets repre- sents the difference in the osmotic pressure between the capillary (ΠC) and the interstitial fluid (ΠIF). When this parenthetical term is positive, there will be an osmotic flow of water from the interstitial fluid into the capillary, whereas if this difference is less than zero, there will be an osmotic flow of water out of the capillary. If the entire term in brackets in Equation 3.4 is positive, then there is a net flow of fluid from the capillary into the interstitium. If the bracketed term is negative, then there will be a net flow of fluid from the interstitium into the capillary. If the bracketed term in Equation 3.4 is zero, then there is no filtration flow and we have that (PC − PIF) = (ΠC − ΠIF). Equation 3.4 represents the filtration flow across the capillary membrane. It can also be used to describe the flow across any semipermeable membrane regardless of whether or not it is of biologi- cal or synthetic origin. We will find, e.g., that this equation applies to the dialysis membranes used in the artificial kidney as well in a variety of other membrane-based medical devices. 3.5.1 Predicting the hydraulic conductance We can also develop a model for describing how the hydraulic conductance (LP), or the resistance to fluid flow across the membrane, depends on the membrane pore geometry and the physical properties of the filtrate fluid. First, we model the porous structure of the membrane as a series of parallel cylindri- cal pores. We will show in Chapter 4 that Poiseuille’s equation (Equation 4.10) provides a relationship between flow (Q) and the pressure drop (P0 − PL) in a cylindrical tube or in this case a cylindrical pore: Q RP P L L pore = -()p m 4 0 8 (3.5) where μ is the viscosity (a measure of the flow resistance) of the fluid R is the radius of the cylindrical tube or pore Lpore is the length of the tube or pore 134 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Equation 3.5 provides the flow rate across a single pore in the capillary wall or in a semipermeable membrane. If we have a total of N pores in a membrane of total surface area S, then we can equate Equation 3.5 for N pores to Equation 3.4 and obtain the result shown here: QL SP N RL PP== æ è ç ö ø ÷DD p mt 4 8 (3.6) where we have replaced (P0 − PL) in Poiseuille’s equation with the effective pressure drop DP. The pore length, i.e., Lpore, is usually longer than the thickness of the capillary wall or membrane (L) since the pores are not straight but tortuous. Hence, we replaced Lpore in Equation 3.5 with the prod- uct of the tortuosity (τ) and the capillary wall or membrane thickness, L. The tortuosity is a correc- tion factor that accounts for pores that are longer than the thickness of the membrane. The total cross-sectional area of the pores, i.e., AP, is equal to NπR2. Substituting this into Equation 3.6 allows us to solve for the hydraulic conductance as shown here: L A S R L R L P P= æ è ç ö ø ÷ = 22 88mt e mt (3.7) Equation 3.7 provides a model that allows one to understand the factors that affect the hydraulic conductance. We see that the hydraulic conductance is directly proportional to the porosity (ε) of the capillary wall, i.e., (AP/S), and inversely proportional to the flow resistance of the fluid, i.e., its viscosity (μ), and the thickness of the capillary wall or membrane L( ). In addition, the hydraulic conductance is directly proportional to the square of the pore radius. Example 3.2 Calculate the filtration flow rate (cm3 s−1) of a pure fluid across a 100 cm2 membrane. Assume the viscosity (μ) of the fluid is 1.8 cP. The porosity of the membrane is 40% and the thickness of the membrane is 500 μm. The pores run straight through the membrane and these pores have a radius of 0.225 μm. The pressure drop applied across the membrane is 75 psi. (From Chapter 4 we have for the viscosity that 1 cP = 0.001 N s m−2 = 0.001 Pa s.) Solution To find the filtration flow rate, we will use Equations 3.4 and 3.7. Since there are no retained solutes, there are no osmotic effects and the effective pressure drop across the membrane is equal to the applied pressure drop of 75 psi. From the information about the membrane, we first calculate the value of the hydraulic conductance as shown here: A S Rm cm Lm cm cP p == =´ == == -04 0 225 22510 500 005 18 0 001 5., .. ,. , .. mm m 8875 1 14 7 10 1325 1 517105Pa sand Ppsi atm psi Pa atm Pa, . , .D= ´´ =´ 135 Physical properties of the body fluids and the cell membrane Now substituting these values in Equation 3.7 L cm Pa scm cm Pa s P = ´´() ´´ =´ - -0402 25 10 80 0018 005 2 813 10 5 2 7.. .. . and from Equation 3.4 Q cm Pa s cm Pa Q cm s =´ ´´ ´ = -2 813 10 100 51710 14 54 72 5 3 .. . 3.5.1.1 Rectangular pores If the pores in the membrane are not circular, but rectangular slits, a similar approach as previously discussed can be used to calculate the hydraulic conductance. For flow in the rectangular space formed between two large parallel plates of length L (in the flow direc- tion) and width W, it is shown in Problem 4.25 that the volumetric flow rate (Q) is given by QWH PP L L = -()2 3 3 0 m (3.8) where the plates are separated by a distance of 2H, and H ≪ L and W. Equation 3.8 gives the flow rate through a single rectangular pore. Assuming we have a total of N pores in the membrane of total surface area S, then we can equate Equations 3.4 and 3.8 to obtain QL SP N WH L PP== æ è ç ö ø ÷DD 2 3 3 mt (3.9) Once again we have replaced (P0 − PL) in Equation 3.8 with the effective pressure drop DP. The actual pore length is also equal to tL to account for pores that are not straight but tortuous. The total cross-sectional area of the slit pores, i.e., AP, is equal to N × 2HW. Using this result to eliminate N in Equation 3.9 gives the hydraulic conductance for slit pores L A S H L H L P P= æ è ç ö ø ÷ = 22 33mt e mt (3.10) Comparing the hydraulic conductance for a slit pore (i.e., Equation 3.10) to that for a cylindrical pore (i.e., Equation 3.7) with the slit pore half-thickness (H) equal to the cylindrical pore radius (R), we see that the slit pore, with everything else being the same, has a hydraulic conductance 2.67 times that of the cylindrical pore. This explains why we oftentimes see rectangular openings in many filtration situ- ations. For example, in nature we see this in the capillary membrane with the slit pores or intercellular cleft formed between the endothelial cells that line the capillary or in the baleen plates of certain whales that trap their food by filtering the ocean water. We also see this in storm sewer drain covers and in the colander found in your kitchen. Rectangular openings maintain the desired size exclusion for filtra- tion without impeding the flow of the fluid. Membranes based on rectangular slit pores are therefore receiving considerable attention for the next generation of a variety of membrane medical devices and artificial organs (Fissell et al., 2009, 2013; Kanani et al., 2010; Song et al., 2016). 136 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 3.6 Net capillary filtration rate We can use Equation 3.4 to estimate the net capillary filtration rate for the human body. To perform this calculation, we will first need to define nominal values for the properties of the capillaries that are in the body. These properties are summarized in Table 3.3 (Note: these are gauge pressures or relative to atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg). The capillary lumen lies within a circumferential ring of several endothelial cells, as shown earlier in Figure 3.2. Note that capillaries are very small having diameters of about 8–10 μm and lengths that are less than 1 mm. The residence time of blood in a capillary is also only on the order of 1 s. Each capillary can only supply nutrients and remove waste products from a very small volume of tissue that surrounds each capillary. There are also three types of capillaries. They are referred to as continuous, fenestrated, and discon- tinuous. The continuous capillaries are found in the muscle, skin, lungs, fat, the nervous system, and in connective tissue. Fenestrated capillaries are much more permeable to water and small solutes in comparison to continuous capillaries. Hence, fenestrated capillaries have a very high hydraulic conductance in comparison to continuous capillaries. The fenestrated capillaries are found in tis- sues that are involved in the exchange of fluid or solutes such as hormones. For example, within the kidney they are found in the glomerulus and allow for a high filtration rate of the plasma. The endothelium of these capillaries is perforated by numerous small holes called fenestrae. The fenes- trae are sometimes covered by a thin membrane that provides selectivity with regard to the size of solutes that are allowed to pass through. Discontinuous capillaries have large endothelial cell gaps that readily allow the passage of proteins and even red blood cells. At the arterial end of the capillary, the capillary pressure is about 30 mmHg, and at the venous end of the capillary, the pressure is about 10 mmHg. The mean capillary pressure is considered to be about 17.3 mmHg and its bias to the lower end is based on the larger volume of the venous side of the capillaries in comparison to the arterial side of the capillaries. The interstitial fluid pressure has surprisingly been found to be subatmospheric and the accepted value is −3 mmHg. As mentioned before, the colloid osmotic pressure for human plasma is 28 mmHg and the value for the interstitial fluid is about 8 mmHg. Table 3.3 Capillary Characteristics Property Value Inside diameter (Dc) 10 μm Length (L) 0.1 cm Wall thickness (tm) 0.5 μm Average blood velocity (V) 0.05 cm s−1 Pore fraction 0.001 Wall pore diameter (dp) 6–7 nm Inlet pressure 30 mmHg Outlet pressure 10 mmHg Mean pressure (PC) 17.3 mmHg Colloid osmotic pressure (ΠP) 28 mmHg Interstitial fluid pressure (PIF) −3 mmHg Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure (ΠIF) 8 mmHg 137 Physical properties of the body fluids and the cell membrane At the arterial end of the capillary, we can calculate the flow rate of fluid across the capillary wall by using Equation 3.4. Therefore, Q/LPS = [(30 −(− 3)) − (28 − 8)] = 13 mmHg, which is positive, indicating that there is a net flow of fluid from the capillary into the interstitium. At the venous end of the capillary, Q/LPS = [(10 −(− 3)) − (28 − 8)] = −7 mmHg, which is less than zero, indicating a net reabsorption of fluid from the interstitium back into the capillary. This flow of fluid out of the capillary at the arterial end, and its reabsorption at the venous end, is called Starling flow, after E.H. Starling who first described it over a hundred years ago. Equation 3.4 is also known as the Starling equation. If we base the filtration rate on the mean capillary pressure, then Q/LPS = [(17.3 −(− 3)) − (28 − 8)] = 0.3 mmHg. Hence, on average, there is a slight imbalance in pressure resulting in more filtration of fluid out of the capillary than is reabsorbed. Approximately 90% of the fluid that leaves at the arterial end of the capillary is reabsorbed at the venous end. However, the 10% that is not reabsorbed by the capillary collects within the interstitium and enters the lymphatic system where it is then returned to the cardiovascular system. The amount of this net filtration of fluid from the circulation for the human body can be estimated as illustrated in the following example. Example 3.3 Calculate the normal rate of net filtration for the human body. Assume the capillaries have a total surface area of 500 m2, that the tortuosity of the slit pores (τ) is equal to 2, and that the slit pore surface area is 1/1000th of the total capillary surface area. Solution We model the porous structure of the capillary wall as a series of parallel rectangular slit pores with a thickness of 7 nm. Plasma filtrate may be considered to be a Newtonian fluid with a viscosity of 1.2 centipoise (cP). The mean net filtration pressure, or the effective pressure drop for the capillary, was just calculated previously to be 0.3 mmHg. Using Equation 3.10, we can calculate the hydraulic conductance and then the net filtration rate: L m m m cP P cP g cm sP 0 P = æ è ç ö ø ÷ ´´() ´´ ´´ - . . . . 5 500 05 710 31 2 0011 10 2 2 9 2 001 1000 20 510 34010 6 12 2 cm m kgg m ms kg ´´ ´´ =´ - - . .

This perfusion of plasma across the capillary wall is also known as plasmapheresis. In the following example, we will compare the capillary filtration rate to the flow rate of the blood entering the capillary. Example 3.4 Calculate the filtration flow rate of plasma across the capillary wall and compare this to the flow rate of blood entering the capillary. Solution Using the capillary properties provided in Table 3.3 and the value of the hydraulic conduc- tance, i.e., LP, from Example 3.3, we can then calculate the filtration rate for a capillary using Equation 3.4. Note that the hydraulic conductance of 3.40 × 10−12 m2 s kg−1 found in Example 3.3 is equal to 1.63 cm3 h−1 m−2 mmHg−1: Q cm hm mmHg mmfiltration =´ ´´ ´´ --()-- -163 10 10 0 001 17 33 28 3 2 6. ..p 88 154101 54 10 83 15 1 ()éë ùû =´ =´ -- -- mmHg cm hL h.. m We can compare this value of the plasma filtration flow rate across the capillary wall to the total flow rate of blood entering the capillary, i.e., Q/ dVcapillary capillary= ()p 4 2 : Qm cm s cm m s h capillary =´() ´´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ ´ = -p 4 10 10 005 100 3600 141 6 2 2 . . ´´= -- -10 014 43 11cm hL h. m We find for the special case of a capillary that the volumetric flow rate of blood entering the capil- lary (Qcapillary) is significantly higher than the filtration flow of plasma (Qfiltration) across the capillary wall. We may therefore assume that the blood flow, i.e., Qcapillary, is constant along the length of the capillary. 3.7 Lymphatic system We must now address where this total net filtration of fluid from the capillaries ultimately goes. It clearly cannot continue to collect within the interstitium since this would lead to edema or excess fluid (swelling) within the tissues of the body. Edema is an excess extracellular fluid and is caused either by too much filtration of fluid from the capillaries as just discussed, a failure to drain this excess fluid from the interstitium, or reten- tion of salt and water as a result of impaired kidney function. Edema can also be caused by 139 Physical properties of the body fluids and the cell membrane intracellular accumulation of fluid as a result of cellular metabolic problems or inflammation. In these cases either the sodium ion pumps are impaired (see Section 3.10) or the cell membrane permeability to sodium is increased. In either case, the excess sodium in the cell causes osmosis of water into the cell. The lymphatic system is an accessory flow or circulatory system in the body that drains excess fluid from the interstitial spaces and returns it to the blood. The lymphatics consist of a system of lymphatic capillaries and ducts that empty into the venous system at the junctures of the left and right internal jugular and subclavian veins. The lymphatic system is also responsible for the removal of large proteins and other substances that cannot be reabsorbed into the capillary from the interstitial space. Like the capillaries of the vascular system, the lymphatic capillaries are also formed by endothelial cells. However, the lymphatic endothelial cells have much larger intercellu- lar junctions and the cells overlap in such a manner to form a valve-like structure. Interstitial fluid can force the valve open to flow into the lymphatic capillary; however, backflow of lymphatic fluid from the lymphatic capillary is prevented. 3.8 Solute transport across the capillary endothelium Lipid-soluble substances such as oxygen and carbon dioxide can diffuse directly through the endothelial cells that line the capillary wall without the use of the intercellular cleft slit pores. Accordingly, their rate of transfer across the capillary wall is significantly higher than water-soluble, but lipid-insoluble substances, such as sodium ions, chloride ions, and glucose, for which the cell membrane of the endothelial cell is essentially impermeable. The transport of these latter substances across the capillary wall is through the use of the capillary intercellular cleft slit pores. In addition to the slit pores, there are two other pathways that can provide an additional route for the trans- port of large lipid-insoluble solutes, such as proteins, across the endothelium of the capillary wall. These pathways are called pinocytosis and receptor-mediated transcytosis (Lauffenburger and Linderman, 1993). Pinocytosis is not solute specific and, as shown in Figure 3.5, involves the ingestion by the cell of the surrounding extracellular fluid and its associated solutes. A small portion of the cell’s plasma membrane forms a pocket containing the extracellular fluid. This pocket grows in size and finally O2, CO2Ions, glucose Endothelial cell Pinocytosis Receptor- mediated transcytosis Diffusion through intercellular cleft Ligand bound to receptor Figure 3.5 Mechanisms for solute transport across the capillary endothelium. 140 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering pinches off to form the intracellular pinocytotic vesicles. This ingestion of extracellular material by the cell is also known as endocytosis. The pinocytotic vesicles are either processed, and their contents used internally, or they migrate through the cell and reattach to the cell membrane on the opposite side, where they release their contents to the surrounding milieu. This release of material from the pinocytotic vesicle is known as exocytosis. Because of its nonspecific nature, pinocytosis is usually not a significant solute transport mechanism. However, receptor-mediated transcytosis can provide for significant transport of specific solutes across the capillary endothelium. This process is also shown in Figure 3.5. The solute, referred to as a ligand, first binds with complementary receptors that are located on the surface of the cell membrane. Unlike the nonspecific process of pinocytosis, receptor-mediated transcytosis can con- centrate a particular ligand by many orders of magnitude. This solute-concentrating mechanism by the cell-surface receptors is responsible for the significant transport rates that can be achieved by this process. The ligand-receptor complexes are then endocytosed forming transcytotic vesicles. These vesicles are either processed internally or they can move through the cell and reattach themselves to the opposite side of the cell. The transcytotic vesicle then releases its contents by exocytosis. The importance of receptor-mediated transcytosis of large lipid-insoluble solutes is provided by the fol- lowing example. In vitro studies of insulin transport across vascular endothelial cells have shown that 80% of the insulin was transported by receptor-mediated processes. The remaining 20% was transported either through the slit pores between the endothelial cells or by nonspecific pinocytosis (Hachiya et al., 1988). 3.9 The cell membrane The cell membrane, illustrated in Figure 3.6, is composed mainly of a lipid bilayer. Lipid molecules are insoluble in water but readily dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene. Three classes of lipids are found in cellular membranes. These are phospholipids, cholesterol, and glycolipids. The lipid bilayer results because the lipid molecule has a head and tail configuration, as shown in Figure 3.6. The head of the lipid molecule is polar and thus hydrophilic, whereas the tail of the lipid molecule is nonpolar and hydrophobic (typically derived from a fatty acid). Such molecules are also called amphipathic because the molecule has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. The term lipid bilayer indicates their Peripheral protein Carbohydrate Integral protein Lipid bilayer Cytoplasm Figure 3.6 Cell membrane structure. 141 Physical properties of the body fluids and the cell membrane tendency to form bimolecular sheets when surrounded on all sides by an aqueous environment, as is the case for a cell membrane. Thus, the hydrophilic heads of the lipid molecules face into the aqueous environment, and the hydrophobic tails are sandwiched between the heads of the lipid molecules. The lipid bilayer forms the basic structure of the cell membrane. However, other molecules such as proteins are scattered throughout the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and serve many important functions. For example, special proteins allow for the transport of specific molecules across the cell membrane. Other proteins have catalytic activity and mediate chemical reactions that occur within the cell membrane. These proteins are known as enzymes. Still other proteins provide structural support to the cell or provide connections to surrounding cells or other extracellular materials. Some proteins found in the cell membrane act as receptors to extracellular substances or chemical signals and, through transduction of these signals, control intracellular events. Other proteins present foreign materials to the immune system or identify the cell as self. Protein molecules associated with the cell membrane can be classified into two broad categories. The transmembrane proteins are also amphipathic and extend through the lipid bilayer. They typically have hydrophobic regions that may travel across the membrane several times and hydrophilic ends that are exposed to water on either side of the membrane. Integral membrane proteins are transmem- brane proteins that are held tightly within the cell membrane through chemical linkages with other components of the cell membrane. Integral proteins have major functions related to the transport of water-soluble but lipid-insoluble substances across the cell membrane. The peripheral membrane proteins are not located within the plasma membrane but associate on either side of the membrane with transmembrane or integral proteins. Peripheral proteins mostly function as enzymes. For the most part, the cell membrane is impermeable to polar or other water-soluble molecules. Hence, large neutral polar molecules, like glucose, have very low cell membrane permeabilities. Charged molecules and ions, such as H+, Na+, K+, and Cl−, also have very low permeabilities. Hydrophobic molecules, such as oxygen and nitrogen, readily dissolve in the lipid bilayer and show very high permeabilities. Smaller neutral polar molecules, such as CO2, urea, and water, are able to permeate the lipid bilayer because of their much smaller size and neutral charge. The transport of essential water-soluble molecules across the cell membrane is achieved through the use of special transmembrane proteins that have a high specificity for a certain type or class of molecules. These membrane transport proteins come in two basic types: carrier proteins and channel proteins. The carrier proteins bind to the solute and then undergo a change in shape or conformation (ding to dong; see Figure 3.7), which allows the solute to traverse the cell membrane. The carrier protein, therefore, Carrier protein “Ding”“Dong” Channel protein Cytoplasm Figure 3.7 Membrane transport proteins. Carrier protein exists in two conformational states, “Ding” and “Dong”. 142 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering changes between two shapes, alternately presenting the solute-binding site to either side of the mem- brane. Channel proteins actually form water-filled pores that penetrate across the cell membrane. Solutes that cross the cell membrane by either carrier or channel proteins are said to be passively transported. Figure 3.7 illustrates the passive transport of solutes through the cell membrane by either carrier proteins or channel proteins. Carrier proteins can transport only a single solute across the mem- brane, a process called uniport, or there can be transport of two different solutes, called coupled transport. The passive transport of glucose into a cell by glucose transporters is an example of a uniport. In coupled transport, the transfer of one solute occurs in combination with the transport of another solute. This coupled transport of the two solutes can occur with both solutes transported in the same direction, symport, or in opposite directions, antiport. An example of coupled transport is the sodium ion gradient–driven symport of glucose and sodium ions. In general, the driving force for the passive transport of these solutes is due to the combined effect of their concentration gradient and the electric potential difference that exists across the membrane. Neutral molecules diffuse from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration. However, if the molecule carries an electrical charge, then both the concentration gradient and the electric potential difference, or voltage gradient, across the cell membrane will affect the transport of the molecule. The electrochemical gradient is the term used to describe the combined effect of charge and solute concentration on the transport of a molecule. The voltage gradient for a cell membrane is such that the inside of the cell membrane is negative in comparison to the outside. This membrane potential (VM) for cells at rest is about −90 mV, which means that the potential inside the cell is 90 mV lower than the potential outside the cell. The flow of charged molecules through channels in the cell membrane is responsible for the cre- ation of the membrane potential. For example, the higher concentration of potassium ions within the cell relative to the surroundings will tend to cause a leakage of these ions out of the cell through the potassium ion leak channels. The loss of these positive ions will make the interior of the cell negative in charge. This creates an electric field that is called the membrane poten- tial. The growth of this membrane potential with continued loss of potassium ions will reach a point where the negative charge created within the cell begins to retard the loss of the positively charged potassium ions due to the difference in potassium concentration. When these two forces balance each other, there is no net flow of the ion, and the ion is at equilibrium. This balance or equilibrium of the concentration and voltage gradients for an ion is known as the Nernst equilibrium membrane potential for that ion. Recall from Chapter 2 that the following equation (Equation 2.228), known as the Nernst equation, can be used to calculate the Nernst equilibrium membrane potential for a particular ion: V RT zF C C RT zF C C outside inside inside outside == -ln ln (3.11) In this equation R represents the gas constant (1.987 cal g mol−1 K−1) T is the temperature in kelvin z is the charge on the ion F is Faraday’s constant (2.3 × 104 cal V−1 g mol−1) 143 Physical properties of the body fluids and the cell membrane At 25°C, for a univalent ion, ∣RT/zF∣ is equal to 25.68 mV, whereas at 37°C the value is 26.71 mV. Considering potassium ions, the intracellular concentration from Table 3.2 is 140 mOsM and the interstitial concentration is 4 mOsM. Therefore, the Nernst equilibrium membrane potential calculated from Equation 3.11 for this ion is equal to about −95 mV. Since this value is less than zero, this indicates that there are more negative charges within the cell than outside the cell. When this calculation is done for Cl− ions, the equilibrium membrane potential is about −90 mV. Since these Nernst equilibrium membrane potentials for K+ and Cl− ions are pretty close to the resting membrane potential of −90 mV, these ions are at equilibrium and their net transport across the cell membrane is zero. However, when we calculate the Nernst equilibrium membrane potential for Na+ and Ca++ using the values given in Table 3.2,* we find values of about 60 and 250 mV, respectively, for these ions. These Nernst equilibrium membrane potentials for Na+ and Ca++ are far different from the actual resting membrane potential (VM) of about −90 mV, and we conclude that these ions are not at equilibrium. So we see that for a resting cell, the large concentration gradients for K+ and Cl− ions between the inside and outside of the cell are balanced by the electric potential difference across the cell membrane. However, for Na+ and Ca++, their large concentration gradients are not balanced by the resting cell membrane potential, and these ions exist in a nonequilibrium state and will cross the cell membrane into the cell. The net driving force for the transport of an ion due to the combined effect of the concentration gradient and the resting membrane potential, i.e., the electrochemical gradient, is proportional to the difference between the actual membrane potential, VM, and the ion’s Nernst equilibrium potential, V. If the quantity (VM − V) is greater than zero, then the ion will be transported out of the cell through either the channel protein pores or by membrane carrier proteins. However, if this quantity is less than zero, then the ion will be transported into the cell. We shall soon see in Section 3.10 that the cell must expend cellular energy in order to maintain these large nonequilibrium sodium and calcium ion gradients, thereby maintaining its resting membrane potential. 3.9.1 Action potentials In nerve and muscle cells, the resting membrane potential can change very rapidly. This rapid change in the membrane potential is called an action potential and provides for the conduction of a nerve signal from neuron to neuron or the contraction of a muscle fiber. Any stimulus to the cell that raises the membrane potential above a threshold value will lead to the generation of a self-propagating action potential. It is also important to note that the action potential is an all-or-nothing response. The development of an action potential is dependent on the presence of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels. The voltage-gated sodium channels only open or become active when the membrane potential is less negative than during the resting state. They typically begin to open when the membrane potential is about −65 mV. These sodium gates remain open for only a few tenths of a millisecond after which time they close or become inactive. The voltage-gated sodium channels remain in this inactive or closed state until the * Here we have set the interior Ca ion concentration at 0.0001 mOsM since the table value is 0. 144 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering membrane potential has returned to near its resting value. The voltage-gated potassium chan- nels also open when the membrane potential becomes less negative than during the resting state; however, unlike the sodium channels, they open more slowly and become fully opened only after the sodium channels have closed. The potassium channels then remain open until the membrane potential has returned to near its resting potential. Figure 3.8 illustrates the events during the generation of an action potential. The first stage of an action potential is a rapid depolarization of the cell membrane. The cell membrane becomes very permeable to sodium ions because of the opening of the voltage- gated sodium channels. This rapid influx of sodium ions, carrying a positive charge, increases the membrane potential in the positive direction and, in some cases, can result in a positive membrane potential (overshoot) for a brief period of time. This depolarization phase may last only a few tenths of a millisecond. Following the depolarization of the membrane, the sodium channels close and the potassium channels, which are now fully opened, allow for the rapid loss of positively charged potassium ions from the cell, thus reestablishing within milliseconds the normal negative resting potential of the cell membrane (repolarization). However, for a brief period of time following an action potential, the sodium channels remain inactive and they can- not open again, regardless of external stimulation, for several milliseconds. This is known as the refractory period. The transport of ions across the cell membrane generates a current (i) that is given by the product, g(VM − V). The proportionality constant for the transport of an ion (g) due to its electrochemical gradient is referred to as the membrane conductance (g), which is the inverse of the membrane resistance. This current, or flow of charge, can be related to the flow of the ions themselves using the definitions summarized in Table 3.4. The following example illustrates the calculation of the flow of ions through a membrane channel. 0 Milliseconds –100 0Membrane potential, mV Na + channels open K + channels open Overshoot Action potential Depolarization Repolarization 40 Resting potential 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Figure 3.8 Action potential. 145 Physical properties of the body fluids and the cell membrane Example 3.5 Calculate the flow of sodium ions through the voltage-gated sodium channels in a cell mem- brane during depolarization. Assuming the cell membrane has a surface area of 1 μm2, how long would it take to change the membrane potential by 100 mV? Assume the equilibrium membrane potential for sodium ions is 62 mV (see Table  3.2 and Equation 3.11), that the threshold membrane potential for the sodium channels is −65 mV, and that at the peak of the action potential the membrane potential is 35 mV. In addition, the membrane conductance for the Na ions is 4 × 10−12 S channel−1. Solution Since the membrane potential rapidly changes during depolarization from the threshold value of −65 mV to the peak value of 35 mV, assume for calculation of the sodium ion flow that the “ average” membrane potential during this phase is −15 mV. The flow or current of sodium ions may then be calculated from the following equation: ig VV i S channel AV S Cs V A Na Na MNa Na =-() = ´ ´´ ´ ´ -- --4101 16 210 12 11 1 . 118 2 8 1 1000 175 15 62 14310 Å ´´ Å ´ ´- -() =- ´ - C V mV Na channels m mV Na s m . 112mm- This flow of sodium ions into the cell is also equivalent to a current of −23 pA μm−2. The flow of sodium ions transfers charge across the membrane, thereby changing the membrane potential. We can relate this change in charge and membrane potential to the membrane capacitance by the fol- lowing relationship, Cmembrane = iNat/ΔVM. Recall from Table 3.4 that the membrane capacitance is Table 3.4 Physical Constants Used to Describe the Electrical Properties of the Cell Membrane Basic Electrical Properties Units Charge Coulomb (C), charge carried by 6.2 × 1018 univalent ions Electric potential Volt (V), potential caused by separation of charges Current Ampere (A), flow of charge, C s−1 Capacitance Farad (F), amount of charge needed on either side of a membrane to produce a given potential, C/V Conductance Siemens (S), ability of a membrane to conduct a flow of charge, A/V Electrical Properties of Cells Typical Values Membrane potential −20 to −200 mV Membrane capacitance ~0.01 pF μm−2 of cell membrane surface area Conductance of a single ion channel 1–150 pS Number of specific ion channels ~75 μm−2 of cell membrane surface area Other Relationships milli (m) = 10−3, micro (μ) = 10−6 nano (n) = 10−9, pico (p) = 10−12 Source: Data from Alberts, B. et al., Molecular Biology of the Cell, 2nd ed., Garland Publishing, Inc., New York, 1989, p. 1067. 146 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering about .01 pF μm−2.

This process is known as active transport and involves the use of special carrier proteins. Since this is an “uphill” process, active transport requires the expenditure of cellular energy. As discussed earlier, the large concentration gradient and the favorable electrical field of the cell’s resting membrane potential will tend to drive the transport of sodium and calcium ions across the cell membrane and into the cell. There will also be some leakage of potassium and chloride ions out of the cell. However, as we have discussed, proper functioning of the cell requires that these concentration differences be maintained in order to preserve the cell’s resting membrane potential. Substances cannot diffuse against their own electrochemical gradient without the expenditure of energy. Therefore, to compensate for the loss of potassium ions by leakage through the cell mem- brane, the cell must have a “pump” mechanism to shuttle potassium ions from the external envi- ronment back into the cell. Similarly, sodium ions leak into the cell and the cell needs a “pump” to remove these ions. This process of shuttling substances across the cell membrane against their electrochemical gradient and at the expense of cellular energy is called active transport. The energy for active transport is provided by the cellular energy storage molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is a nucleotide consisting of three components: a base called adenine, a ribose sugar, and a triphosphate group. Through the action of the enzyme ATPase, a molecule of ATP can be converted into a molecule of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and a free high-energy phosphate bond that can cause conformational changes in special cell membrane carrier proteins. The best example of active transport is the sodium-potassium pump present in all cells. The Na-K pump transports sodium ions out of the cell and at the same time transfers potassium ions into the cell. Figure 3.9 illustrates the essential features of the Na-K pump. The carrier protein protrudes through both sides of the cell membrane. Within the cell, the carrier protein has three receptor sites for binding sodium ions and also has ATPase activity. On the outside of the cell membrane, the carrier protein has two receptor sites for binding potassium ions. When these ions are bound to their respective receptor sites, the ATPase then becomes activated liberating the high-energy phosphate bond (Pi) from ATP. The energy in the phosphate bond causes a shape or conformational change in the carrier protein that allows for passage of the sodium and potassium ions. The Na-K ATPase pump is electrogenic, i.e., removing a net positive charge from the cell equivalent to about −4 mV. Similar active transport car- rier proteins are also available to transfer other ions such as Cl−, Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO3 −. The only difference in the carrier proteins would be their preference for a specific ion. 147 Physical properties of the body fluids and the cell membrane Active transport of a solute can also be driven by ion gradients, a process referred to as second- ary active transport. For example, the higher concentration of sodium ions outside of the cell can lead to a conformational change in a carrier protein that favors the symport of another solute. The other solute is therefore pumped into the cell against its own electrochemical gradient. The sodium ion gradient that drives this pump is maintained by the Na-K ATPase pump discussed earlier. Sodium ion antiports are also used to control intracellular pH. In this case, the removal of excess hydrogen ions generated by acid-forming reactions within the cell is coupled with the influx of sodium ions. Problems 3.1 Derive Equation 3.3. 3.2 A membrane has pure water on one side and a protein solution on the other side. The mem- brane has pores equivalent in size to a spherical molecule with a molecular weight of 100,000. The protein solution consists of albumin (40 g L−1; MW = 69,000), globulins (70 g L−1; MW = 150,000), and fibrinogen (60 g L−1; MW = 340,000). Assuming that the proteins form an ideal solution, what is the osmotic pressure of the protein solution? What would be the osmotic pressure of the protein solution if the membrane was completely impermeable to the proteins? 3.3 Explain why osmotic pressure is based on the molar concentration of the solute and not the solute mass concentration. 3.4 Explain the difference between a mole and an osmole. Cite some examples. 3.5 You are concentrating a solution containing a polypeptide of modest molecular weight by pres- sure filtration through a membrane. The solute concentration on the feed side of the membrane is 0.10 M and the temperature is 25°C. The applied pressure on the feed side of the membrane is 6 atm (gauge), and the pressure on the opposite side of the membrane is 0 atm (gauge). If the polypeptide solute is completely rejected by the membrane, what is the “effective” pressure drop across the membrane? If the hydraulic conductance of the membrane is 3 mL h−1 m−2 mmHg−1, what is the filtration rate? Assume the membrane has a total surface area of 1 m2.

Hint: Base your analysis on Equation 3.7 and assume that the NMWCO is for a spherical molecule having the same size as the pores in the membrane. Show that the radius of a spherical molecule is proportional to the molecular weight to the 1/3 power as given by Equation 5.41. 3.7 Perform a literature search and write a short paper on the biomedical applications of liposomes. 3.8 Look up in a biochemistry text the chemical structures of collagen, laminin, cholesterol, and the various lipids found in the cell membrane. 3.9 Search the literature and write a short paper on the biomedical applications of osmotic pumps. 3.10 How many potassium ions must a cell lose in order to produce a membrane potential of −95 mV for potassium? How does this compare to the number of potassium ions within the cell? 3.11 Consider a membrane that is permeable to Ca2+ ions. On one side of the membrane the Ca2+ concentration is 100 mM, and on the other side of the membrane the Ca2+ concentration is 1 mM. The electric potential of the high-concentration side of the membrane relative to the low-concentration side of the membrane is +10 mV. How much reversible work is required to move each mole of Ca2+ from the low-concentration side of the membrane to the high- concentration side of the membrane? What is the equilibrium membrane potential? 3.12 The cell membrane is permeable to many different ions. Therefore, the equilibrium membrane potential for the case of multiple ions will depend not only on the concentrations of the ions within and outside the cell but also on the permeability (P) of the cell membrane to each ion. The Goldman equation may be used to calculate the equilibrium membrane potential for the case of multiple ions. For example, considering Na+ and K+ ions, the Goldman equation may be written as V PC PC PC PC , mV Na Na KK Na Na iK Ki =´ + + æ è ç ö ø ÷26 71 00.ln ,, ,, For a cell at rest, PNa is much smaller than PK; typically, PNa is about 0.01PK. Calculate the equilibrium membrane potential for a cell under these conditions. During the depolarization phase of an action potential, the sodium ion permeability increases dramatically due to the opening of the voltage-gated sodium ion channels. Under these conditions, PK is about 0.5PNa. Under these conditions, recalculate the value of the equilibrium membrane potential. 149 Physical properties of the body fluids and the cell membrane 3.13 Composite membranes are often used in membrane filtration and in hemodialysis (Clark and Gao, 2002). One of these membranes is used to provide structural support and can be tens or even hundreds of microns in thickness. This structural membrane is usually microporous to minimize its flow resistance and will therefore have pore diameters on the order of a micron. Attached to this structural membrane is a much thinner permselective membrane skin on the order of a micron in thickness that will have pores whose diameter is defined in terms of their nominal molecular weight cutoff (NMWCO; see Equation 5.41, which can be used to relate the molecular radius of a solute to its molecular weight). Hence, solutes whose molecular weight is less than the NMWCO of the selective membrane will travel across the membrane through the pores, whereas those solutes whose molecular weights are larger than the NMWCO will not cross the permselective membrane. Since the filtration flow rate, Qi (see Equation 3.4, where LP and DP are, respectively, the hydraulic conductance and the effective pressure drop across the ith membrane), through each membrane layer i has to be the same, show that the overall hydraulic conductance for three membranes that are stacked together is given by the following equation. Note that in this equation, LPi is the hydraulic conductance for the ith membrane, as calculated by Equation 3.7 or 3.10, or as found by independent filtration flow measurements for that particular membrane: L /L P i P composite i = =å 1 1 1 3 3.14 Consider a composite membrane that is being used to filter plasma from blood. Plasma has a viscosity of 1.2 cP. The composite membrane consists of a microporous sponge-like material that provides structural support. This membrane is 25 μm thick and has pores that are 2 μm in diameter. These pores are also tortuous and have a tortuosity (i.e., τ) of 1.67. The porosity of this membrane (i.e., AP/S) is also equal to 0.60. Attached to this microporous membrane is a thin permselective skin 3.23 μm thick that has a NMWCO of 1000. The pores in this membrane skin are therefore about 0.0015 μm in diameter. The tortuosity of the pores in the membrane skin is also equal to 1.67, and the porosity of the membrane skin is equal to 0.60. Use the formula found in Problem 3.13 to predict the overall hydraulic conductance for this composite membrane. Find the total filtration flow rate (mL h−1) across this composite mem- brane assuming the total surface area of the membrane is 1 m2 and that the overall effective pressure drop across the composite membrane is 160 mmHg. 3.15 Consider a solution of glucose on one side of a membrane that is impermeable to the trans- port of glucose. The temperature of the glucose solution is 20°C. What pressure must be applied on the glucose side of the membrane to stop the flow of water into the glucose solution? Assume the glucose concentration is 1 mg mL−1 and that the molecular weight of glucose is 180 g mol−1. 3.16 A hollow fiber membrane cartridge is being evaluated for use in an aquapheresis system. In one experiment using blood, a cartridge with a surface area of 1.5 m2 had a filtration flow across the hollow fiber membranes of 1000 mL h−1. The average pressure of the blood flowing inside the tubes of the hollow fiber membranes was 120 mmHg, and the suction pressure on the filtrate side of the hollow fibers averaged –150 mmHg. Assuming that the plasma proteins were totally retained on the blood side of the hollow fiber membrane, estimate the hydraulic conductance of these membranes in mL h−1 m−2 mmHg−1. 150 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 3.17 An aqueous solution (A) with an osmotic pressure of 5 atm is separated by a membrane from an aqueous solution (B) with an osmotic pressure of 2 atm. Both solutions are at a total pres- sure of 1 atm. The solutes in these two solutions cannot pass through the membrane. Which way will the water flow, from (A) to (B) or from (B) to (A)? By how much must the hydrody- namic pressure be increased to stop the osmotic flow of water and on which solution, (A) or (B), must this pressure increase be applied? 3.18 The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney. Fluid enters the space within Bowman’s capsule through filtration across the glomerular capillaries. The walls of these capillaries will allow small ions and other solutes to pass from the plasma phase of the blood to the filtrate in Bowman’s capsule. However, proteins are too big to cross the capillary, and these are retained within the capillaries. Estimate the total glomerular filtration rate (GFR) if the average glomerular pressure is 60 mmHg and the pressure within the Bowman’s cap- sule that collects the filtrate is 20 mmHg. The osmotic pressure of the retained plasma proteins is 25.6 mmHg. The value of LPS for the glomerular capillaries is about 8.7 mL min−1 mmHg−1. 3.19 The hydraulic conductance for pure water of a porous membrane (LP) was found to be 0.1350 cm mmHg−1 h−1. The porosity (ε) of the membrane was found to be 0.52 and the thickness (L) of the membrane was 32 μm. Assuming the pores in this membrane are rect- angular slits and that they run straight through the membrane (i.e., τ = 1), estimate the size of the slit opening (i.e., 2H) in microns. Water under these conditions has a viscosity (μ) of 0.0008 Pa s. 3.20 A membrane has a porosity (ε) of 0.60 and a thickness (L) of 45 μm, and the pores in this membrane are tortuous with a radius of 0.05 μm and tortuosity (τ) of 1.3. Estimate the hydrau- lic conductance (LP) of this membrane for plasma. Your answer for LP should be in units of cm mmHg−1 h−1. You can assume that plasma has a viscosity (μ) of 0.0012 Pa s. 3.21 Estimate the filtrate flux (mL cm−2 min−1) at 20°C for the filtration of a protein solution across a membrane that is impermeable to the protein. The hydraulic conductance of this membrane is equal to 0.01 mL cm−2 psi−1 min−1. The hydrodynamic pressure drop applied across the membrane is equal to 15 psi, and the protein concentration in the solution being filtered is equal to 22 g per 100 mL. The molecular weight of the protein is 69,000 g mol−1. 3.22 A drug delivery catheter consists of a cylindrical needle whose wall contains very small pores allowing the drug solution to leave the needle into the surrounding tissue. The hydrau- lic conductance of the needle wall is 10−5 cm2 s g−1. The needle has a length of 2 cm and the diameter of the needle is 200 μm. The sharp end of the needle is closed off so that any flow of drug solution into the needle must flow out through the porous wall of the needle. The drug solution has a viscosity of 1 cP. If the pressure driving the drug solution into the needle is 5 mmHg, how long will it take in seconds for this catheter to deliver 100 μL of the drug solution into the surrounding tissue? Assume that the pressure is constant at 5 mmHg (gauge) within the 2 cm length of the needle and that the pressure in the surrounding tissue is 0 mmHg (gauge). Also assume that the pores in the needle wall are of such a size that no solutes are retained. 3.23 Estimate the hydraulic conductance (cm3 dyne−1 s−1) of a dialysis membrane for water. The radius of the pores in the membrane through which water is filtered is 2.3 nm, the porosity of the dialysis membrane is 0.4, and the total length of a pore is 150 μm. Assume the viscosity of water is 1 cP. 151 Physical properties of the body fluids and the cell membrane 3.24 Estimate the hydraulic conductance, in mL (h m2 mmHg)−1, of a silicon nanopore membrane. Assume the pores are rectangular slits and run straight through the membrane. The slit height (2H) is 7 nm and the slit width is 2 μm. The thickness of the nanopore membrane is 300 nm and the porosity of the membrane is 0.0002. The fluid being filtered is human plasma with a viscosity of 1.2 cP and a density of 1.02 g cm−3. 3.25 The hydraulic conductance of a 2 μm thick silicon nanopore membrane was found to be 1200 mL h−1 m−2 mmHg−1 for human plasma having a viscosity of 1.2 cP and a density of 1.02 g cm−3. If the pores in this membrane run straight through the membrane, estimate the diameter of the membrane pores in nanometers (nm). The porosity of the membrane is 40%. 153 Chapter 4 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids 4.1 Physical properties of blood Blood is a viscous fluid mixture consisting of plasma and cells. Table 4.1 summarizes the most important physical properties of blood. Recall that the chemical composition of the plasma was previously shown in Table 3.2. Proteins represent about 7–8 wt% of the plasma. The major pro- teins found in plasma are albumin (MW = 69,000; 4.5 g 100 mL−1), the globulins (MW = 35,000– 1,000,000; 2.5 g 100 mL−1), and fibrinogen (MW = 400,000; 0.3 g 100 mL−1). Albumin has a major role in regulating the pH and the colloid osmotic pressure of blood. The so-called alpha and beta globulins are involved in solute transport, whereas the gamma globulins are the antibodies that fight infection and form the basis of the humoral component of the immune system. Fibrinogen, through its conversion to long strands of fibrin, has a major role in the process of blood clotting. Serum is simply the fluid remaining after blood is allowed to clot. For the most part, the composition of serum is the same as that of plasma, with the exception that the clotting proteins, primarily fibrinogen, and the cells have been removed. 4.2 Cellular components The cellular component of blood consists of three main cell types. The most abundant cells are the red blood cells (RBCs) or erythrocytes comprising about 95% of the cellular component of blood. Their major role is the transport of oxygen by the hemoglobin contained within the RBC. Note from Table 4.1 that the density of an RBC is higher than that of plasma. Therefore, in a quiescent fluid, the RBCs will tend to settle. The RBC volume fraction is called the hematocrit and typically varies between 40% and 50%. The true hematocrit (H) is about 96% of the measured hematocrit (Hct). The RBC has a unique shape described as a biconcave discoid. Figure 4.1 illustrates the size of the RBC and Table 4.2 summarizes its typical dimensions. RBCs can form stacked coin-like structures called rouleaux. Rouleaux can also clump together to form larger RBC structures called aggregates. Both rouleaux and aggregates break apart under conditions of increased blood flow or higher shear rates. Platelets are the next most abundant cell type, comprising about 4.9% of the blood cell volume. The platelets are major players in blood coagulation and hemostasis, which is the prevention of blood loss. The remaining 0.1% of the cellular component of blood consists of the white blood cells (WBCs) or leukocytes, which form the basis of the cellular component of the immune system. Since the WBCs and platelets only comprise about 5% of the cellular component of blood, their effect on the macroscopic flow characteristics of blood is negligible. 154 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 4.3 Rheology The field of rheology concerns the deformation and flow behavior of fluids. The prefix rheo- is from the Greek and refers to something that flows. Due to the particulate nature of blood, we expect the rheological behavior of blood to be somewhat more complex than a simple fluid such as water. Our understanding of the flow behavior of fluids begins by exploring the relationship between shear stress (τ) and the shear rate \u0000g( ). To develop this relationship, consider the situation shown in Figure 4.2. A fluid is contained between two large parallel plates both of area A. The plates are separated by a small distance equal to h. Initially the system is at rest. At time t = 0, the lower plate is set into Table 4.1 Physical Properties of Adult Human Blood Property Value Whole blood pH 7.35–7.40 Viscosity (37°C) 3.0 cP (at high shear rates) Specific gravity (25/4°C) 1.056 Venous hematocrit Male 0.47 Female 0.42 Whole blood volume ~78 mL kg−1 body weight Plasma or serum Colloid osmotic pressure ~330 mm H2O pH 7.3–7.5 Viscosity (37°C) 1.2 cP Specific gravity (25/4°C) 1.0239 Formed elements Erythrocytes (RBCs) Specific gravity (25/4°C) 1.098 Count Male 5.4 × 109 mL−1 whole blood Female 4.8 × 109 mL−1 whole blood Average life span 120 days Production rate 4.5 × 107 mL−1 whole blood/day Hemoglobin concentration 0.335 g mL−1 of erythrocyte Leukocytes Count ~7.4 × 106 mL−1 whole blood Diameter 7–20 μm Platelets Count ~2.8 × 108 mL−1 whole blood Diameter ~2–5 μm Source: Data from Cooney, D.O., Biomedical Engineering Principles, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1976, p. 39. 155 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids motion in the x direction at a constant velocity V. The velocity of the lower plate is sufficiently low such that the fluid motion is not turbulent, i.e., macroscopic or convective mixing of the fluid in the y direction does not occur. Rather, the fluid motion is laminar. In laminar flow, the fluid flows with- out any mixing in the y direction. This means that adjacent layers of fluid will slide past one another in a manner analogous to what is seen when a deck of playing cards is deformed. The fluid velocity is a vector and will have three components, which in these Cartesian coordinates are vx, vy, and vz. For the situation shown in Figure 4.2, vy and vz are both zero; vz is zero because the plates extend to a great distance in the z direction and the lower plate only moves in the x direction, so we conclude that there is no flow of fluid in the z direction; vy is zero since there is no motion of the lower or upper plate in the y direction and there are no holes in either of the plates that would cause the fluid to flow in the y direction. So we see that for the situation shown in Figure 4.2, the only velocity component is that in the x direction, i.e., vx, and this will depend, in general, on (x,y,z,t). Since the lower plate is set into motion at t = 0, and the fluid initially is not moving, there will be a transient period during which successive layers of the fluid will be set into motion. This means that 8 µm 1 µm (a) (b) (c) Figure 4.1 The dimensions of the red blood cell. (a) Top view, (b) side view, and (c) rouleaux.

The plate separation, i.e., h, is constant in the x direction so this means that vx will not depend on x. Since the lower plate is moving at V and the upper plate is stationary, vx will depend only on y. However, since the plates are very large in the z direction compared to their separation, i.e., h, vx at a given y and t will be the same for any value of z. So we conclude that vx can only be a function of y and t, i.e., vx(y,t). As time proceeds, momentum is transferred in the y direction to successive layers of fluid from the lower plate that is in motion in the x direction. In laminar flow, momentum transport occurs by dif- fusion and we say that momentum “flows or diffuses” from a region of high velocity to a region of low velocity. After a sufficient length of time, a steady-state velocity profile is obtained, i.e., a linear function of y, i.e., v y V h hyx () =-(). At steady state, a constant force (F) must be applied to overcome the resistance of the fluid and maintain the motion of the lower plate at velocity V. For the situation shown in Figure 4.2, the shear stress on the lower plate is defined as F/A and is given the symbol τyx, where the subscript yx denotes the viscous flux* of x momentum in the y direction (Bird et al., 2002). The shear stress, i.e., τyx, can also be interpreted as a force acting in the x direction on a surface that is perpendicular to the y direction. The shear rate at any position y in the fluid is defined as - () == dv y dy V h x \u0000g. The shear rate is given the symbol \u0000g. Notice that shear rate has units of reciprocal time. The shear rate is also the same as the strain rate or the rate of deformation. Newton’s law of viscosity states that for laminar flow (nonturbulent) the shear stress is proportional to the shear rate. The proportionality constant is called the viscosity, μ, which is a physical property of the fluid and is a measure of the flow resistance of the fluid. Viscosity is usually expressed in the following units where 1 P (poise) = 100 cP (centipoise) = 1 g cm−1 s−1 = 1 dyne s cm−2 = 0.1 N s m−2 = 0.1 Pa s. Also 1 cP = 0.001 Pa s. For the situation shown in Figure 4.2, Newton’s law of viscosity can be stated as follows: F A V h yx== =tm mg\u0000 (4.1) Most simple homogeneous liquids and gases obey this law and are called Newtonian fluids. * A flux is a flow that has been normalized with respect to the area that is perpendicular to the direction of the flow. x y h t<0 Rest t=0 Lower plate moves t> 0 Velocity develops t>>0 Steady velocity profile VV V F Figure 4.2 Velocity profile development for flow of a fluid between two parallel plates. 157 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids For more complicated geometries, the steady-state velocity profile is not linear. However, Newton’s law of viscosity can be stated at any point in the laminar flow field. In Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z), and in cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z), we can write Newton’s law of viscosity as tm mgyx xdv dy =- = \u0000 (4.2a) tm mgrz zdv dr =- = \u0000 (4.2b) where vx is the velocity in the x direction at position y vz is the velocity in the z direction at position r These equations tell us that the momentum flows in the direction of decreasing velocity. The veloc- ity gradient is therefore the driving force for momentum transport much like the temperature gradi- ent is the driving force for heat transfer, and the concentration gradient is the driving force for mass transport. A fluid whose shear stress-shear rate relationship does not follow Equation 4.1 is known as a non- Newtonian fluid. Figure 4.3 illustrates the type of shear stress-shear rate relationships that are typi- cally observed for non-Newtonian fluids. The Newtonian fluid is shown for comparison. Note from Equation 4.2a and b that the shear stress-shear rate relationship for a Newtonian fluid is linear with the slope equal to the viscosity. For non-Newtonian fluids, we can also define the observed or appar- ent viscosity for given values of τyx and \u0000g. Hence, from Equation 4.2a and b, and for given values of τyx and \u0000g, the apparent viscosity (μapparent) for a non-Newtonian fluid is given by tgyx /\u0000 or tgrz /\u0000. Note that the apparent viscosity is not constant and will depend on the shear rate, \u0000g. A dilatant fluid thickens or has an increase in apparent viscosity as the shear rate increases. An example of a dilatant fluid is a solution of cornstarch and water, which allows one to “walk on water.” As a person quickly walks or runs across this fluid, each step induces a high shear rate in the fluid surrounding the foot increasing the fluid viscosity and the resulting shear stress that is generated Bingham plastic Newtonian Casson Pseudoplastic Dilatant Shear rate Shear stress Figure 4.3 Types of shear stress–shear rate relationship. 158 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering supports the person and they do not sink into the fluid. A pseudoplastic fluid, on the other hand, tends to thin out, or its apparent viscosity decreases, with an increase in shear rate. Paint is an example of a pseudoplastic fluid, since it thins out as it is brushed or quickly shears as it is applied to a surface. Heterogeneous fluids that contain a particulate phase that forms aggregates at low rates of shear exhibit a yield stress, τy. The yield stress must be exceeded in order to get the material to flow. Two types of fluids that exhibit this behavior are the Bingham plastic and the Casson fluid. The Casson fluid has been used to describe liquids that contain particulates that also aggregate, forming large complex structures. An example of this type of fluid is the ink used in ball point pens. When the pen is not being used, the ink thickens and cannot flow out of the pen. As one writes, the rotating ball at the point of the pen shears the fluid, thinning it out so it can be applied to the paper. In the case of the Bingham plastic, once the yield stress is exceeded, the fluid behaves as if it were Newtonian. For the Casson fluid, we see that as the shear rate increases, the apparent viscosity decreases, indicating that the particulate aggregates are getting smaller and smaller and, at some point, the fluid behaves as a Newtonian fluid. Blood is a heterogeneous fluid, with the particulates consisting primarily of RBCs. As mentioned earlier and shown in Figure 4.1, the RBCs form rouleaux and aggregates at low shear rates. We will see in the ensuing discussion that the rheology of blood behaves like that of the Casson fluid. 4.4 The capillary viscometer and laminar flow in tubes The simplest approach for examining the shear stress-shear rate behavior of blood or other fluids is through the use of the capillary viscometer shown in Figure 4.4. The diameter of the capillary tube is typically on the order of 500 μm. To eliminate entrance and exit effects, the ratio of the capillary length (L) to its radius (R) should be greater than 100 (Rosen, 1993). For a given flow rate of fluid, Q, the pressure drop across the viscometer, –ΔP = P0 – PL, is measured. From this information, it is possible to deduce an analytical expression for the shear stress-shear rate relationship, i.e., \u0000\u0000gg t= ()rz . Analysis of the flow of a fluid in the horizontal cylindrical capillary tube illustrated in Figure 4.4 requires the use of cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z). In cylindrical coordinates, the components of the velocity vector are vr, vθ, and vz. With steady-state flow, i.e., no dependence on time, we can make the following simplifying assumptions: the length of the tube (L) is much greater than the tube radius (R) (i.e., L/R ~ 100) to eliminate entrance effects; the flow is incompressible (i.e., constant density) and isothermal (i.e., constant temperature); no external forces are acting on the fluid; no holes are in the tube so that there is no radial velocity component vr; there is no axisymmetric flow or no swirls so that the tangential velocity vθ is also zero; and the no-slip condition at the wall requires that vz = 0 r z R τrz Pz Pz+∆zQ L P0 PL r z z+∆z Figure 4.4 Forces acting on a cylindrical fluid element within a capillary viscometer. 159 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids at r = R. Continuity or conservation of mass for an incompressible fluid with these assumptions there- fore requires that only an axial velocity component exists, and it will be a function of the tube radius only; therefore vz = vz(r). Now consider in Figure 4.4 a cylindrical volume of fluid of radius r and length Δz. For steady flow, the viscous force acting to retard the fluid motion, i.e., τrz2πrΔz, must be balanced by the force developed by the pressure drop acting on the volume of fluid of length Δz, i.e., πr2(P∣z − Pz + Δz). Equating these forces, dividing by Δz, and taking the limit as Δz → 0, the following equation is obtained for the shear stress distribution for the fluid flowing within the capillary tube: trz Lr r dP dz PP L () =- = -()1 22 0 (4.3) In Equation 4.3, the first term on the left-hand side of the equation is only a function of r, and the middle term of the equation is only a function of z. Hence, both of these terms must equal the same constant, and this means that −dP/dz is equal to the pressure drop per unit length of the tube, i.e., (P0 − PL)/L. We note that the shear stress vanishes at the centerline of the capillary and achieves its maximum value, τw, at the wall where r = R. The wall shear stress is easily calculated by the following equation in terms of the measured pressure drop (P0 − PL) and the tube dimensions (R and L): ttwrz L R RdP dz PP R L = () =- = -() 22 0 (4.4) It should also be pointed out that Equations 4.3 and 4.4 hold whether the fluid is Newtonian or non- Newtonian. Nothing has been said so far about the relationship between a particular fluid’s shear stress and shear rate. Using Equation 4.4, one can rewrite Equation 4.3 to give the shear stress in terms of the wall shear stress and the fractional distance from the centerline of the capillary tube, i.e., r/R: ttrz wr r R () = (4.5) 4.4.1 Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow of a Newtonian liquid in a cylindrical tube Let’s first consider the flow of a Newtonian liquid in a cylindrical tube. Liquids are considered to be incompressible and their density is constant. For a Newtonian liquid flowing in a cylindrical hori- zontal tube, we know from Equation 4.2b that τrz = − μ(dvz/dr). Substituting this relation for τrz into Equation 4.3, we obtain tmrz z Ldv dr PP r L =- = -()0 2 (4.6) This equation can be easily integrated using the no-slip boundary condition (BC) that says that, at r = R, vz = 0. The result of this integration provides an equation that describes the velocity profile 160 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering for laminar flow of a Newtonian liquid in a cylindrical tube. The following equation shows that the velocity profile will have a parabolic shape: v r PP R L r R z L () = -() - æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú 0 2 2 4 1 m (4.7) Note that the maximum velocity (Vmaximum) occurs at the centerline of the cylindrical tube, where r = 0; hence the maximum velocity is given by V RP P L maximum L = -() 2 0 4 m (4.8) The total volumetric flow rate of the liquid in a cylindrical tube is given by Qv rrdr R z= ()ò 2 0 p (4.9) Substituting Equation 4.7 for vz(r) into Equation 4.9 and performing the integration gives Q RP P L dP P L LL = -() = -()p m p m 4 0 4 0 8 128 (4.10) where d is the tube diameter. Equation 4.10 is the Hagen-Poiseuille law for laminar flow of a Newtonian liquid in a cylindrical tube. It provides a simple relationship between the volumetric flow rate in the tube given by Q and the pressure drop between the entrance and the exit of the tube, i.e., P0 − PL, for the given dimensions of the tube R and L, and the fluid viscosity μ. Using the analogy that flow is proportional to a driving force divided by a resistance, we see that the driving force is the pressure drop, P0 − PL, and the resistance is given by 8μL/π R4. This resistance term is very important since it shows that for laminar flow within blood vessels, small changes in the radius of the vessel can have a significant effect on the blood flow rate for a given pressure drop. To achieve this control of the blood flow rate, the arterioles, the smallest elements of the arterial system with diameters less than 100 μm, consist of an inner endothelial cell lining that is surrounded by a layer of vascular smooth muscle cells. Contraction or relaxation of the smooth muscle layer provides a reactive method for controlling arteriole diameter and hence the blood flow rate within organs and tissues. For laminar flow in a network of tubes or small capillaries, the overall pressure drop across the network is P0 − PL, and the resistance for the ith element of the network is 8 4mpL/ Rii , where Li and Ri are, respectively, the length and radius of the ith element. We can then draw on the analogy to an electrical circuit with resistors in series and in parallel to solve for the overall flow (Q) in the network and for the flow (Qi) in each element of the network. 161 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids If the entrance of the tube is at a height Z0 above a reference elevation, and the exit of the tube is at a height ZL relative to the same reference elevation, then the pressure difference term in Equation 4.10 must account for the change in the hydrostatic pressure between the entrance and exit of the tube. Hence, in this case, we can write the pressure difference term in Equation 4.10 as [(P0 − PL) + ρg(Z0 − ZL)]. The average velocity (Vaverage) of the fluid flowing within a cylindrical tube is defined as the ratio of the volumetric flow rate (Q) to the cross-sectional area (i.e., A = πR2) of the tube normal to the flow direction, i.e., Vaverage = Q/A. Using Equation 4.10 for Q, the average velocity is then given by V RP P L Vaverage L maximum= -() = 2 0 8 1 2m (4.11) Example 4.1 Equation 4.10 was derived under the assumption of the laminar flow of a Newtonian liquid. What happens if the fluid is a Newtonian gas? Develop an expression for the pressure change over the length of the tube, i.e., (P0 − PL), for a gas in laminar flow. Solution Unlike a liquid whose density is constant, the density of a gas will change along the flow path because of the decrease in pressure. However, conservation of mass will require that the mass flow rate of the gas in the tube is constant, which means that at any axial location within the tube, we must have that \u0000m Q=r . Now assuming we have an ideal gas, the gas density is then given by ρ = P/RT. If we also assume that the gas flow in the tube is isothermal, then between the tube entrance, i.e., z = 0, and any location in the tube, z, we have that ρ(z)/P(z) = ρ0/P0. Now at some location z within the tube, the local volumetric flow rate for a Newtonian gas is given by Equation 4.10, where we have replaced (P0 − PL)/L with −dP/dz, to account for the change in the gas density as the pressure changes: Qz m z mP Pz RdP dz () = () = () =- \u0000\u0000 rr p m 0 0 4 8 This is a differential equation that can then be solved for the isothermal pressure change of a gas flowing in a cylindrical tube. Hence, Q mR L PP PP P LL 0 0 4 00 082 == æ è ç ö ø ÷ +æ è ç ö ø ÷ -æ è ç ö ø ÷ \u0000 r pm (A) where Q0 is the volumetric flow rate of the gas at the tube entrance. Gas viscosities at normal pressures are considerably less than liquids. For example, the viscosity of water is 1 cP at room temperature, whereas the viscosity of air is only 0.018 cP. Comparing Equation A in Example 4.1 for a gas, with Equation 4.10 for a liquid, with every- thing but the viscosity the same, we see that the flow rate of the gas in a tube would be about 50 times larger than that of the liquid. Conversely, for the same flow rate of the gas and liquid, the pressure drop for the gas would be about 50 times less than that for the liquid. Hence, in most biomedical engineering applications, the pressure drop for gas flow is usually negligible. 162 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Example 4.2 A hollow fiber module is being designed for a bioreactor application. Mammalian liver cells will be grown in the shell space surrounding the hollow fibers, and nutrient media will flow through the inside of the hollow fibers. The module will contain a total of 7000 hollow fibers with inside diam- eter of 500 μm and length 35 cm. If the pressure drop over the length of these fibers is 25 mmHg, estimate the total flow rate in mL min−1 of the nutrient media through the hollow fiber module. The nutrient media has a viscosity of 0.85 cP and a density of 1 g cm−3, and the flow is laminar. Solution Since the pressure drop over the length of each hollow fiber has to be the same, this means that we can calculate the flow rate for one hollow fiber and then multiply that value by the number of fibers to obtain the total flow rate. Using Equation 4.10, we have Q cm mmHgatm/ mmHgPa/atm fiber = () ´´ ´ ´ p 005251 760 101 325 128 00 4 ., . 00085 35 0 0172 0 0172 3 3 Pascm cm s QQ of fibers cm s totalfiber ´ = =´ = . #. ´´´ =7000 60 smL 7224 min min 4.4.1.1 Laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid through a tube of very short length If the length of the tube is comparable to the radius of the tube, then the Hagen-Poiseuille equation needs to take into account entrance effects. This can happen, e.g., in nanoengineered ultrathin membranes. This means that the velocity profile has to develop in the tube from its flat entrance profile to the parabolic veloc- ity profile given by Equation 4.7. Dagan et al. (1982) obtained a solution to this problem, and in this case the volumetric flow rate is given by Q RP P L R L = -() + æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú 3 0 3 8 m p (4.12) If 8 3 p L R æ è ç ö ø ÷ ≫ , then Equation 4.12 reduces to Equation 4.10. 4.4.2 Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow of a Newtonian liquid in tubes of noncircular cross section Solutions for laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid through tubes of noncircular cross sections have also been described in the literature (Lamb, 1932; Bird et al., 2002; Lekner, 2007).

Recall that for the capillary viscometer shown in Figure 4.4, we can write the total flow rate Q in terms of the axial velocity profile as follows: Qv rrdr R z= ()ò 2 0 p (4.16) Next, we integrate Equation 4.16 by parts to obtain the following equation: Qr dv r dr dr R z =- ()æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ò p 0 2 (4.17) Since \u0000g= -dv /drz and from Equation 4.5 we have that r = R(τrz/τw), we can show that the following equation is obtained. This is called the Rabinowitsch equation: Q R d W rz rz rz W = ()ò p t gt tt t 3 3 0 2\u0000 (4.18) For data obtained from a given capillary viscometer, the experiments will provide Q as a function of the observed pressure drop, i.e., P0 − PL. The wall shear stress, τw, is related to P0 − PL by Equation 4.4. The appropriate shear rate and shear stress relationship, i.e., \u0000\u0000gg t= ()rz , is the one that best fits the data according to Equation 4.18. For example, consider the simplest case of a Newtonian fluid. Equation 4.19 provides the relation- ship for \u0000gtrz(): \u0000gt t m rz rz() = (4.19) Substituting this equation into Equation 4.18 and integrating, we can readily obtain the result obtained earlier, i.e., Equation 4.10, for the laminar volumetric flow rate of a Newtonian liquid flow- ing in a cylindrical tube. 164 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 4.6 Other useful flow relationships Some other useful relationships for Newtonian flow in a cylindrical tube may be obtained by com- bining Equations 4.4 and 4.10. First, we obtain the following expression that relates the wall shear stress to the volumetric flow rate: t m p w Q R = æ è ç ö ø ÷ 4 3 (4.20) Also, by writing Equation 4.19 at the tube wall and using Equation 4.20, it is found that the shear rate at the wall is given by \u0000g p w averageaverageQ R V R Vd == = 4 48 3 (4.21) The reduced average velocity U is related to the wall shear rate and is defined as the ratio of the average velocity and the tube diameter. It is given by the following equation: U V d Q d average w== = 41 8 3p g\u0000 (4.22) The Rabinowitsch equation (4.18) can also be rewritten in terms of U, i.e., U Q d d w wrzrzrz w == ()ò 41 2 33 0 2 pt gttt t \u0000 (4.23) This equation predicts that the reduced average velocity is only a function of the wall shear stress. Table 4.3 provides a summary of these key flow equations. Example 4.3 A large artery can have a diameter of about 0.5 cm, whereas a large vein may have a diameter of about 0.8 cm. The average blood velocity in these arteries and veins is, respectively, on the order of 40 and 20 cm s−1. Calculate for these blood flows the wall shear rate, \u0000g w. Solution We can use Equation 4.21 to calculate the wall shear rates. For the large artery \u0000g w cm s cm s= ´ = - -440 025 640 1 1 . and for the large vein \u0000g w cm s cm s= ´ = - -420 040 200 1 1 . 165 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids Example 4.4 Nutrient media is flowing at the rate of 1.5 L min−1 in a tube that is 5 mm in diameter. The walls of the tube are covered with antibody-producing cells, and these cells are anchored to the tube wall by their interaction with a special coating material that was applied to the surface of the tube. If one of these cells has a surface area of 500 μm2, what is the amount of the force that each cell must resist as a result of the flow of this fluid in the tube? Assume the viscosity of the nutrient media is 1.2 cP = 0.0012 Pa s. Solution We can use Equation 4.20 to find the shear stress acting on the cells that cover the surface of the tube: t p w Pa scm cm s Pa= ´æ è ç ö ø ÷ () ´= = 40 0012 1500 025 1 60 2442 3 3 . min . min ..444 2Nm- Multiplying τw by the surface area of a cell gives the force acting on that cell as a result of the fluid flow.

At low shear rates, the apparent viscosity of blood is quite high due to the presence of rou- leaux and aggregates. However, at shear rates above about 100–200 s−1, blood behaves as if it were a Newtonian fluid. We then approach the asymptotic high shear rate limit for the apparent viscosity of blood, which is about 3–4 cP. At high shear rates, where blood is basically a Newtonian fluid, the following equations can be used to express the dependence of the blood viscosity on temperature and hematocrit (Charm and Kurland, 1974): mm a = - £plasma H forH 1 1 06,. whereH T Ha= +-() é ë ê ù û ú0 070 249 1107 169.exp .exp . (4.24) In the previous equations, temperature (T) is in K. These equations may be used to a hematocrit of 0.60 and the stated accuracy is within 10%. 4.7.1 The Casson equation The shear stress-shear rate relationship for blood can be described by the following empirical equa- tion known as the Casson equation: tt g 12 12 12// /=+y s \u0000 (4.25) In this equation, τy is the yield stress and s is a constant, both of which can be determined from vis- cometer data.

This was illustrated in Figure 4.3. The yield stress for blood at 37°C is about 0.04 dynes cm−2. It is important to point out, however, that the effect of the yield stress on the flow of blood is small, as the following example will show. Example 4.5 Estimate the pressure drop in a small blood vessel that is needed to just overcome the yield stress. Solution We can use Equation 4.4 to solve for the pressure drop needed to overcome the yield stress (τy = τw): PP L R L y 0 2 -( ) = min t Using the yield stress of 0.04 dynes cm−2 and an L/R of 200 for a blood vessel, the pressure drop required to just initiate the flow is PP dynescm bar dynescm mmH L0 2 622 200 004 1 10 750 061 -( ) =´ ´´ ´ - -min . . gg bar mmHg 1 0 012= . This result is considerably less than the mean blood pressure, which is on the order of 100 mmHg. At large values of the shear rate, the apparent viscosity of blood approaches its asymptotic value as shown in Figure 4.5. From Equation 4.25 at large shear rates, we see that the parameter s can be interpreted as the square root of the asymptotic Newtonian viscosity. The asymptotic viscosity of blood is about 3 cP; therefore, the parameter s is 31 732 12 cP cP= (). / or 0.173 (dynes s cm−2)1/2. It  should be stressed that the values of the yield stress and the parameter s will also depend on plasma protein concentrations, hematocrit, and temperature. Therefore, one must be careful to prop- erly calibrate the Casson equation to the actual blood and the conditions used in the viscometer or the situation under study. 4.7.2 Using the Casson equation For a Casson fluid like blood, we can rearrange Equation 4.25 and solve for the shear rate, i.e., \u0000gtrz(), in terms of the shear stress, τrz: \u0000gt tt rz rz y s () = -é ë ù û 12 12 2 2 // (4.26) This equation can be substituted into Equation 4.23 and the resulting equation integrated to obtain the following fundamental equation that describes the flow of the Casson fluid in a cylindrical tube. This equation depends on only two parameters, τy and s, which can be determined from experimental data: U s w yw y w y=- -+ é ë ê ù û ú 1 24 4 7 1 84 3 2 4 3 t tt t t t (4.27) 168 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Using Equation 4.22, we can replace the reduced average velocity in Equation 4.27 with the volu- metric flow rate, i.e., Q, and obtain Q RP P L L y w y w y w = -() -+ - æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú¥ p m t t t t t t 4 0 4 8 1 16 7 4 3 1 21 (4.28) where μ∞ is equal to s2 and is the viscosity of the fluid at high shear rates τw is given by Equation 4.4 Equation 4.28 is the Casson fluid equivalent to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, i.e., Equation 4.10. Example 4.6 Merrill et al. (1965) in a series of classic experiments studied the flow of blood in capillary tubes of various diameters. The blood had a hematocrit of 39.3 and the temperature was 20°C. They measured the pressure drop as a function of the flow rate for five tube diameters rang- ing from 288 to 850 μm. When they expressed the measured pressure drops in terms of the wall shear stress (Equation 4.4), and the volumetric flow rates in terms of the reduced average velocity (Equation 4.22), all of the data for the various tube sizes formed, within the experi- mental accuracy, a single line as predicted by Equation 4.23. From their results they provide the following values of the Casson parameters at 20°C: τy = 0.0289 dynes cm−2 and s = 0.229 (dynes s cm−2)1/2. Using these values for τy and s, show that Equation 4.27 provides an excel- lent fit to their data summarized in the following table. τw, dynes cm−2 U, s−1 0.06 0.01 0.10 0.05 0.15 0.10 0.40 0.50 0.70 1.0 2.7 5.0 4.4 10.0 17.0 50.0 30.0 100.0 Solution Figure 4.6 shows a good comparison between the data given in the previous table and the predicted reduced average velocity from Equation 4.27 using the parameter values from Merrill et al. (1965). 4.7.3 The velocity profile for tube flow of a Casson fluid We can also use the Casson equation to obtain an expression for the axial velocity profile for the flow of blood in a cylindrical tube or vessel. The maximum shear stress, τw, is at the wall. If the yield stress, τy, is greater than τw, then there will be no flow of the fluid. On the other hand, if τw is 169 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids greater than τy, there will be flow; however, there will be a critical radius (rcritical) at which the local shear stress will equal τy. From the tube centerline to this critical radius, this core fluid will have a flat velocity profile, i.e., vz(r) = vcore, and will move as if it were a solid body or in what is known as “plug flow.” For the region from the critical radius to the tube wall (rcritical ≤ r ≤ R), Equation 4.3 describes the shear stress distribution as a function of radial position. We can set this equation equal to the shear stress relation provided by the Casson equation (4.25) and rearrange to obtain the fol- lowing equation for the shear rate: \u0000gt t=- () = - - -é ë ê ù û ú + ì í ï îï ü ý ï þï dv r dr PP L r PP L r z L y L y 0 12 0 12 2 2 2 / / 11 2s (4.29) This equation can be integrated to find vz(r) using the boundary condition that at r = R, vz(R) = 0, thereby obtaining the following result: v r Rs r R r R z w y w () =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú t t t2 1 8 3 1 2 23 2/ úú + æ è ç ö ø ÷ - æ è ç ö ø ÷ ì í ï îï ü ý ï þï 21 t t y w r R (4.30) Equation 4.30 applies for the region defined by rcritical ≤ r ≤ R. At this point, however, we need to determine the value of rcritical. Since the shear stress at rcritical must equal the yield stress, i.e., τrz = τy, it is easy to then show from Equation 4.5 that rcritical = R(τy/τw).

This causes the apparent viscosity of blood to increase rapidly at low shear rates as we see in Figure 4.5. As these aggregates grow, their characteristic size can also become comparable to that of the tube diameter. The assumption of blood being a homogeneous fluid is then no longer correct. However, for practical purposes, blood flow in the body and through medical devices will be at significantly higher shear rates. Therefore, we really need not concern ourselves with the limiting case of blood flow at these very low shear rates. 4.8 The effect of tube diameter at high shear rates Tube flow of blood at high shear rates (i.e., >100 s−1) in tubes less than about 500 μm shows two anomalous effects that involve the tube diameter. These are the Fahraeus effect and the Fahraeus- Lindqvist effect (Barbee and Cokelet, 1971a,b; Gaehtgens, 1980; Pries et al., 1996). 4.8.1 The Fahraeus effect To understand the effect of tube diameter on blood flow, consider the conceptual model illustrated in Figure 4.7. In this figure, blood flows from a larger vessel, such as an artery, into a smaller vessel, after which the blood flows into a larger vessel as in a vein. We make the distinction between the hematocrit found in the feed to the smaller vessel, represented by HF, the hematocrit in the vessel of interest HT, and the discharge hematocrit HD. All of these hematocrits are averaged over the entire cross-sectional area of the tube. In tubes with diameters from about 10 to 500 μm, it is found that the tube hematocrit (HT) is actually less than that of the discharge hematocrit (at steady state, HD = HF, to satisfy the mass balance on the RBCs). This is called the Fahraeus effect and HT/HD reaches its minimal value of about 0.6–0.7 in tubes with a diameter of about 10–20 μm. Pries et al. (1996) have shown that the experimental data for HT/HD can be described by the fol- lowing equation that depends on the tube diameter (d, microns) and the discharge hematocrit (HD): H H HH ee T D DD dd=+ -() +-() --11 17 06 0 415 0 011.. .. (4.31) To explain the Fahraeus effect, it has been shown both by in vivo and in vitro experiments that the RBCs do not distribute themselves evenly across the tube cross section. Instead, the RBCs tend to Arterial end, HF Smaller vessel, HT Venous end, HD HT <HF, HD Figure 4.7 The Fahraeus effect. 171 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids accumulate along the tube axis forming, in a statistical sense, a thin cell-free layer along the tube wall. This is illustrated in Figure 4.8. Recall from Equation 4.7 that the fluid velocity is maximal along the tube axis. The axial accumulation of RBCs, in combination with the higher fluid velocity near the tube axis, maintains the RBC balance (HF = HD) even though the hematocrit in the tube is reduced. The thin cell-free layer along the tube wall is called the plasma layer (δ). The thickness of the plasma layer depends on the tube diameter and the hematocrit and is typically on the order of several microns. 4.8.2 The Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect Because of the Fahraeus effect, it is found that as the tube diameter decreases below about 500 μm, the apparent viscosity of blood also decreases, reaching a minimum value at a tube diameter of about 7 μm. Even though the shear rate is high enough for the blood to behave like a Newtonian fluid, the blood viscosity is no longer constant and just a material property of the blood, but also depends on the tube diameter. The decreased viscosity is a direct result of the decrease in the tube hematocrit and the presence of the cell-free plasma layer near the wall of the tube, which has the effect of reducing the flow resistance of the blood. This reduction in the viscosity of the blood as the tube diameter gets smaller is known as the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect. For the laminar flow of blood in tubes less than 500 μm, we can still use Equation 4.10 to express how the flow rate, i.e., Q, depends on the pressure drop and the tube dimensions R and L. However, we will need to replace the viscosity, i.e., μ, by its apparent value, i.e., μapparent, to account for the effect of the tube diameter. Hence, we can write Equation 4.10 as follows: Q RP Lapparent = p m 4 8 D (4.32) Pries et al. (1996) have shown that the in vitro experimental data for the apparent viscosity of blood as a function of tube diameter (d, μm) and the discharge hematocrit (HD) can be described by the following set of equations: m m h apparent plasma D C C H =+ -() -() - -() - 11 11 10 45 1 045. .

This is likely due to the presence of macromolecules on the endothelial surface of blood vessels retarding the flow of plasma. Example 4.7 Blood is flowing within a small hollow fiber module containing a total of 10,000 fibers. Each fiber has an internal diameter of 60 μm and a length of 20 cm. If the total flow rate of the blood is 10 mL min−1, estimate the pressure drop in mmHg across the hollow fibers. Also calculate the tube hematocrit, HT. Assume the discharge hematocrit of the blood is 0.40 and that the Newtonian viscosity of blood in large tubes is 3 cP. The plasma viscosity is 1.2 cP. Solution Since the hollow fiber diameter is less than 500 μm, we will need to take into account the Fahraeus and the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effects. First, we can calculate the tube hematocrit using Equation 4.31: H ee H T T 040 0401 0401 17 06 032 0 415 60 0 011 60 . .. .. . ..=+ -() +-() = -´ -´ 66 173 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids Next, we calculate the apparent viscosity of blood using Equations 4.33 through 4.35: C e=+() -+ + æ è ç ö ø ÷ + + =- -´ --08 1 1 11060 1 11060 081 0 075 60 11 12 11 12.. . 11 220 32 2442 148 1 045 13 60 006600 645 h m . .... . . =+ -= -´ -´ee apparent .. . . . . . .2 12 148 1 10 40 1 10 45 1 1 944 0 811 0 811cP ap =+ -() -() - -() - = - - m pparent cP cP Pas=´ ==1 944 12 2 333 0 00233.. ..

Using this theory, it is possible to obtain an expression for the apparent viscosity in terms of the plasma layer thickness, tube diameter, and the core and plasma viscosities. Development of the marginal zone theory makes use of the relation- ships for a Newtonian fluid that we developed earlier. These are summarized in Table 4.3. As shown in Figure 4.8, the blood flow within a tube or vessel is divided into two regions: a central core that contains the RBCs with a viscosity μcore and the cell-free marginal or plasma layer that consists only of plasma with a thickness of δ and a viscosity equal to that of the plasma given by the symbol μplasma. Note that the tube hematocrit (i.e., averaged over the entire tube cross section) is related to the core hematocrit by the expression H R HTC=- æ è ç ö ø ÷1 2 d . In each of these regions, the flow is considered to be Newtonian and Equation 4.6 applies to each. For the core region, we can then write tm d rz L core z core z core PP r L dv dr BC r dv dr BC rR = -() =- == =- 0 2 10 0 2 :, : ,, ttrz core rz plasma= (4.38) 174 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The first boundary condition (BC1) expresses the fact that the axial velocity profile is symmetric about the axis of the tube and the velocity is also a maximum at the centerline of the tube. The second boundary condition (BC2) derives from the fact that the transport of momentum must be continuous across the interface between the core and the plasma layer. For the plasma layer, the following equations apply: tm d rz L plasma z plasma z core z plasm PP r L dvdr BC rR vv = -() =- =- = 0 2 3: , aa z plasmaBC rR v40:,== (4.39) The third boundary condition (BC3) states the requirement that the velocity in each region must be the same at their interface. The last boundary condition (BC4) simply requires that the axial velocity is zero at the tube wall. Equations 4.38 and 4.39 can be readily integrated to give the following expressions for the axial velocity profiles in the core and plasma regions: v r PP R L r R forR rz plasma L plasma () = -() - æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú -£ £ 0 2 2 4 1 m d RR (4.40) v r PP R L RR r R z core L plasma plasma core () = -() - -æ è ç ö ø ÷ - æ è 0 2 2 4 1 m d m m çç ö ø ÷ + -æ è ç ö ø ÷ ì í ï îï ü ý ï þï ££ - 22 0 m m d d plasma core RR forr R (4.41) The plasma and core volumetric flow rates are given by the following equations: Qv rrdr Qv rrdr plasma R R z plasma core R z core = () = () - - ò ò 2 2 0 p p d d (4.42) Integration of Equation 4.42 with the values of vz plasma and vz core from Equations 4.40 and 4.41 pro- vides the following result for the volumetric flow rates of the plasma layer and the core: Q PPL RRplasma L plasma = - --()é ëê ù ûú p m d ()0 2 2 2 8 (4.43) Q PP R L R R core L plasma plasma core = -() -() -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ -()p m d m m d0 2 2 4 4 1 RR R R plasma core 2 4 22 - -()é ë ê ê ù û ú ú m m d (4.44) 175 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids The total flow rate of blood within the tube is equal to the sum of the flow rates in the core and plasma regions. After adding Equations 4.43 and 4.44, we obtain the following expression for the total flow rate: Q RP P LR L plasma plasma core = -() -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ - æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê p m d m m 4 0 4 8 11 1 ùù û ú ú (4.45) Comparing Equation 4.45 with Equation 4.32 allows one to develop a relationship for the appar- ent viscosity based on the marginal zone theory. We then arrive at the following expression for the apparent viscosity in terms of δ, R, μcore, and μplasma: m m d m m apparent plasma plasma coreR = -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ - æ è ç ö ø ÷11 1 4 (4.46) As δ/R → 0, then μapparent → μcore → μ, which is the viscosity of blood in a large tube at high shear rates, i.e., a Newtonian fluid, as one would expect. We can use Equations 4.45 and 4.46 for blood flow calculations in tubes less than 500 μm in diameter provided that we know the thickness of the plasma layer, δ, and the viscosity of the core, μcore. The next section shows how to determine the thickness of the plasma layer, δ, and the viscosity of the core, μcore, using apparent viscosity data. 4.8.3.1 Using the marginal zone theory If we have apparent viscosity data for blood at high shear rates in tubes of various diameters, we can use Equation 4.46 to fit these data. First, we can use the binomial series to approximate the term (1 − r/R)4 as follows: 11 4 4 - æ è ç ö ø ÷ »- dd RR (4.47) Substituting Equation 4.47 into Equation 4.46 and rearranging, we obtain 11 4 1 1 mm d m m mapparent core core core plasma R =+ - æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú (4.48) Equation 4.48 shows us that a plot of 1/μapparent versus 1/R should be linear with a y intercept equal to 1/μcore and a slope equal to the bracketed term. For a given plasma viscosity, the core viscosity can then be obtained from the y intercept, and we can solve for the thickness of the plasma layer (δ) from the slope. Example 4.8 shows how this is done. Example 4.8 Find the values of δ and μcore that represent the data for the apparent viscosity of blood as a function of tube diameter given in the paper by Gaehtgens (1980) and summarized in the following table.

From Equation 4.48, we see that the core viscosity is equal to 1/b = μcore = 3.349 cP.

Generally, the effect of the fluid viscosity is such that the fluid velocity changes from zero at the surface to the free stream value over a narrow region near the surface that is referred to as the boundary layer. It is the presence of this boundary layer that affects the rates of mass transfer and heat transfer between the surface and the fluid. Recall that the transport of something like momen- tum, mass, or energy is proportional to a driving force divided by a resistance. We will see that the boundary layer creates the resistance to the transport of momentum, mass, and energy. Interestingly, we will find that the thickness of the boundary layer is inversely proportional to the square root of the free stream velocity. Analysis of these types of problems using boundary layer theory for relatively simple cases can provide a great deal of insight on how the flow of the fluid affects the transport of momentum, mass, and energy and lead to the rational development of correlations to describe their transport in more complex geometries and flow systems. We will use these correlations in later chapters in problems that involve the transport of mass across a bounding surface into a flowing fluid. 4.9.1 The flow near a wall that is set in motion Consider the situation shown in Figure 4.10. A semi-infinite quantity of a viscous fluid is contacted from below by a flat and horizontal plate. For t < 0, the plate and the fluid are not moving. At t = 0, the y At t= 0, the plate starts moving to the right with a velocity of V. V x y V vx(y,t) For t> 0, an unsteady velocity gradient develops in the fluid. x y For t< 0, the plate and fluid are at rest. x (a) (b) (c) Figure 4.10 Flow of a fluid near a flat plate that is set in motion. (a) Plate and fluid at rest, (b) plate begins to move, and (c) plate moves at constant velocity V. 178 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering plate is set in motion with a constant velocity (V) to the right, as shown in Figure 4.10. There are no pressure gradients or gravitational forces acting on the fluid, so the motion of the fluid is solely due to the momentum transferred from the plate to the fluid. The flow is also laminar, meaning there is no mixing of fluid elements in the y direction. The velocity in Cartesian coordinates will have compo- nents vx, vy, and vz, and these will depend, in general, on x, y, z, and t. Since the plate does not move in the y direction, and we have no holes in the plate, vy is zero. Also, the fluid and plate are assumed to be infinite in the z direction, so vz is zero. The only component of the fluid velocity is therefore vx. Since the plate and the fluid are infinite in the x and z directions, vx can only depend on y, which makes sense since momentum is transported from the plate into the fluid in the y direction only. As time progresses, the x momentum of the plate is transported into the fluid in the y direction. In other words, for this laminar flow, the momentum diffuses in the y direction from a region of high velocity to a region of low velocity. This creates a velocity profile in the y direction that will depend on time. We can arbitrarily define the boundary layer thickness (δ) for this problem as the distance perpen- dicular to the plate surface where the fluid has just been set into motion, and this distance is defined as that point where the local velocity is equal to 1% of V. Our goal here is now to determine the velocity profile vx(y,t) and the boundary layer thickness, δ(t). The concept of a shell balance can be used to analyze this problem. The shell balance is an important technique for developing mathematical models to describe the transport of such quantities as momen- tum, mass, and energy. The shell balance approach is conceptually easy to use and is based on the application of the generalized balance equation (Equation 1.8) to a given finite volume of interest. In Figure 4.10, consider a small volume element of the fluid Δx Δy W, where W is the width of the plate in the z direction (normal to the page) and is assumed to be very large. Recall that momentum is (mass) × (velocity) and we can write the momentum per unit volume of the fluid as ρvx. The rate of accumulation of momentum within this volume element of the fluid is equal to r ¶ ¶ v t xyW x DD . This term has units of force and is also equal to the sum of the forces acting on this volume element of the fluid. The only forces acting on this volume element of fluid are the shear forces acting on the surfaces at y and y + Δy, i.e., τyx∣y and τyx∣y + Δy. These terms also, respectively, represent the flux of x momentum in the y direction at y and y + Δy, respectively. Hence, our momentum shell balance on the volume element can be written as rt t ¶ ¶ =-( )+ v t xyWxW x yx y yx yyDD D D (4.49) Eliminating Δx and W, and then dividing by Δy and taking the limit as Δy → 0, we obtain the fol- lowing partial differential equation: r t¶ ¶ =- ¶ ¶ v ty x yx (4.50) This equation is valid for any fluid, Newtonian or non-Newtonian. For the special case of the Newtonian fluid, we can use Newton’s law of viscosity, i.e., Equation 4.2a, for τyx, and obtain ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ v t v y xxn 2 2 (4.51) 179 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids where ν is the kinematic viscosity and is defined as μ/ρ.

Taking the Laplace transform of Equation 4.51 results in the following equation: sv vt dv dy xx x-=() =0 2 2n (4.54) where vx denotes the Laplace transform of the velocity.

Since this integral is quite common in the solution of many engineering problems, this function has been tabulated in mathematical handbooks and mathematical software and can be treated as a known function, much like logarithmic and trigonometric functions. Recall that we defined the boundary layer thickness as that distance y from the surface of the plate where the velocity has decreased to a value of 1% of V. The complementary error function of y/t41 821n= . provides a value of vx/V that is equal to 0.01. Hence, we can define the boundary layer thickness, δ(t), as follows: dn ntt t() =»3 642 4. (4.61) The value of δ can also be interpreted as the distance to which momentum from the moving plate has penetrated into the fluid at time t. Example 4.9 Calculate the boundary layer thickness 1 s after the plate has started to move. Assume the fluid is water for which ν = 1 × 10−6 m2 s−1.

The velocity in Cartesian coordinates will have components vx, vy, and vz, and these will depend, in general, on x, y, z. However, since the plate is large in the z direction, there will be no vz component of the velocity. Since the fluid velocity at the surface of the plate is zero, a boundary layer is formed near the surface of the plate, and within this boundary layer, vx increases from zero at the plate surface to its free stream value of V. We can estimate the boundary layer thickness as follows (Schlichting, 1979). Recall for the plate suddenly set into motion that from Equation 4.61, the boundary layer thickness, δ, is propor- tional to nt , where t is the time, since the plate was set into motion. For the situation shown in Figure 4.11, we can think of t as the time it takes to travel from the leading edge of the flat plate to a downstream location x. Hence, we can replace t in Equation 4.61 with x/V, and we obtain the following approximate relationship for how the boundary layer thickness, δ(x), changes along the surface of the flat plate: d n x x V () = 4 (4.62) The growth of the boundary layer along the surface of the plate will also cause the fluid flow to be displaced in the y direction, and this means that, in addition to the vx component of the velocity, there will also be a vy component. Both of these velocity components will depend on x and y. 4.9.2.1 Approximate solution for laminar boundary flow over a flat plate In the following dis- cussion, we will obtain an approximate solution for the boundary layer flow over a flat plate. The approximate solution is very close to the exact solution. Details on exact solutions to the boundary layer equations may be found in Schlichting (1979). Consider the shell volume shown in Figure 4.11 and located from x to x + Δx and from y = 0 to y = δ(x). We first perform a steady-state mass balance on this shell volume that is given by 0 0 d drr r x x x x xx y yxWv Wv dy vW x () + = ()ò -é ë ù û -= D D (4.63) The integral term in Equation 4.63 is the net rate (i.e., In – Out) at which mass is being added to the shell volume. The second term accounts for the loss of mass from the shell volume at the top of the boundary layer due to flow in the y direction. Eliminating ρ and W, and dividing by Δx, followed by taking the limit as Δx → 0, provides the following equation* for vy∣y = δ(x): v v x dy d dx vdyV dx dx y yx x x x x= () () () =- ¶ ¶ =- + () òòd dd d 00 (4.64) * Here we have used Leibnitz’s rule, i.e., d dt f x,t dx f t dx fb t,t db t dt fa t at bt () æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ =+ ()é ë ù û () - () () ò ¶ ¶ (()é ë ù û () () () ò ,t da t dtat bt 184 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering In a similar manner, we can write an x momentum balance on the shell volume as 0 0 0 d drr rt x xx x xx xx y yx yx yWv vW vv dy vVWx Wx () + = () =ò -é ë ù û -+ = D DD (4.65) The first term from the left in Equation 4.65 represents the net rate at which x momentum is being added to the shell volume. The second term represents the rate at which x momentum per volume of fluid (ρV) at the top of the boundary layer is being lost due to the flow of fluid out of the boundary layer in the y direction. The last term in this equation represents the loss of momentum as a result of the shear stress generated by the fluid at the surface of the plate. After eliminating W and dividing by Δx, taking the limit as Δx → 0, using Leibnitz’s rule* and Equation 4.64 to eliminate vy, we can write Equation 4.65 as -= -() æ è ç çç ö ø ÷ ÷÷ = () ò tr d yx y x xx d dx Vv vdy 0 0 (4.66) For a Newtonian fluid, we can use Equation 4.2a and obtain mr d ¶ ¶ =-() æ è ç çç ö ø ÷ ÷÷= () ò v y d dx Vv vdy x y x xx 0 0 (4.67) Equation 4.67 is also known as the von Karman momentum balance equation and forms the basis for obtaining an approximate solution to the boundary layer flow over a flat plate. To obtain an approxi- mate solution, we first need to approximate the shape of the velocity profile within the boundary layer, i.e., vx(x,y). The simplest function that reasonably approximates the shape of the velocity profile is a simple cubic equation: v ya by cy dyx () =+ ++ 23 (4.68) This velocity profile also has to satisfy the following boundary conditions: BC yv BC yx vV BC yx v y BC y v x x x x 10 0 2 30 40 2 :, :, :, :, == = () = = () ¶ ¶ = = ¶ ¶ d d yy2 0= (4.69) * Here we have used Leibnitz’s rule, i.e., d dt f x,t dx f t dx fb t,t db t dt fa t at bt () æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ =+ ()é ë ù û () - () () ò ¶ ¶ (()é ë ù û () () () ò ,t da t dtat bt 185 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids The first boundary condition (BC1) is referred to as the “no-slip” boundary condition, which requires that the velocity of the fluid at the surface of the plate be the same as the velocity of the plate, which, in this case, is zero. The last boundary condition (BC4) expresses the fact that the stress at the surface of the plate only depends on x and not on y. The second and third boundary conditions (BC2 and BC3) state that beyond the boundary layer, the velocity is constant and equal to the free stream value, V. When the above boundary conditions are imposed on Equation 4.68, the following expression is obtained for the velocity profile within the boundary layer: v x,y V y x y x x () = () æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ - () æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ 3 2 1 2 3 dd (4.70) Equation 4.70 shows that vx depends on δ(x), which is still not known. However, we can insert this equation into the von Karman momentum balance equation (Equation 4.67), and after some simpli- fication we obtain d dm r d dx V = æ è ç ö ø ÷ 140 13 (4.71) with the condition that at x = 0, δ = 0. Integration of this equation results in the following expression for the boundary layer thickness, δ(x): d n x x V () = 464. (4.72) This equation is very similar to the approximate relationship we got earlier, i.e., Equation 4.62. We can also rearrange Equation 4.72 and express the boundary layer thickness relative to the down- stream location x as d rm x x Vx x () == -464 464 12. .Re / (4.73) In this equation, Rex = ρVx/μ is defined as the local value (i.e., at location x) of the Reynolds number. The Reynolds number is a very important dimensionless number in the field of fluid mechanics. We see that the Reynolds number represents the ratio of the inertial forces (ρV × V L2 = ρ V2 L2) acting on the fluid to the viscous forces (μ(V/L) × L2 = μVL) acting on the fluid, where L is a characteristic dimension. A high Reynolds number indicates that the inertial forces dominate the viscous forces. On the other hand, a low Reynolds number means viscous forces are much larger than the inertial forces. The Reynolds number also provides insight into when the fluid transitions from uniform laminar flow to turbulent flow. This critical Reynolds number for transition from laminar to turbulent flow depends on the geometry of the flow being considered. For example, for boundary layer flow over the flat plate, experiments show that the flow is laminar provided Rex < 300,000, whereas for flow in a cylindrical tube of diameter d, the flow is laminar if the Red < ~2300 and can transition to turbulent 186 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering flow at a Red > ~4000. In this case of flow in a cylindrical tube, note that the characteristic dimen- sion is the diameter of the cylindrical tube (d). For flow over the flat plate of length L, the Reynolds number is ReL = ρVL/μ. The approximate velocity profile within the boundary layer for laminar flow on a flat plate is then given by the combination of Equations 4.70 and 4.72 as shown here: v x,y V y V x y V x x () = æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ - æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ 0 3233 0 005 3 .. nn (4.74) Note that vx(x, y)/V depends on the single dimensionless parameter η, where h n= yV/x. Equation 4.74 provides an excellent representation of the actual measured velocity profile for lami- nar boundary flow over a flat plate (see Problem 4.27 at the end of this chapter). We can also use Equation 4.64 to calculate the y component of the velocity at the outer edge of the boundary layer, i.e., vy∣y = δ(x), using Equation 4.74 for vx(x,y) and Equation 4.72 for δ(x): v V Vx V Vx Vy yx x = () == = d nm r 0870 87 087 1 .. . Re (4.75) The exact value of vy∣y = δ(x) given by Schlichting (1979) has the constant in Equation 4.75 as 0.8604 instead of the value given by our approximate solution of 0.87. Equation 4.75 shows that at the outer edge of the boundary layer, there is an outward flow of fluid in the y direction that is caused by the growth of the boundary layer thickness in the direction of flow, i.e., δ(x), as given by Equation 4.72. With the velocity profile given by Equation 4.74, we can also calculate the drag force exerted by the fluid on the plate. For a plate of length L and width W, the force that acts on the surface of both sides of the plate in the positive x direction is given by F v y dxdz LW Vx WL x y = ¶ ¶ æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ =òò = 21 293 00 0 23mrm. (4.76) The exact solution, as well as experimental data for the drag force on the flat plate, is about 3% greater than that predicted by the approximate solution to the flat plate boundary layer problem given by Equation 4.76. The constant in Equation 4.76 being 1.328 for the exact solution. Hence, we see that this approximate solution to the flat plate boundary layer problem is quite good not only predicting the x and y velocity profiles but also the drag as well. We can also calculate the power needed to overcome the drag force. Recall that power is defined as (force × velocity), so after multiplying Equation 4.76 by V, the power is given by PVFLWVx== 1 293 25. rm (4.77) 187 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids The friction factor (f) is defined as the ratio of the shear stress at the wall and the kinetic energy per volume of the fluid based on the free stream velocity.

Re (4.78) For a plate of length L and width W, the average value of the friction factor (f) is given by integrating Equation 4.78 as shown here: f dxdz WL x LW L ==òò 0 646 1 293 100 . Re . Re (4.79) where ReL = ρVL/μ. The definition of the friction factor given by Equation 4.78 means that the force acting on both sides of the plate (i.e., Fx) is given by the product of the kinetic energy per volume of the fluid ((1/2)ρV2), the area of the flat plate (2LW), and the friction factor (f) and is given by the next equation: F VAreaf VLWLWVx L =´()´= ´()´= 1 2 1 2 21 293 1 1 293 22 23rr rm. Re . (4.80) This result for Fx is, as expected, the same as that given by Equation 4.76. As shown by Equations 4.79 and 4.80, the friction factor is a convenient method for finding the force acting on a surface as a result of fluid motion. When the flow is across or over an object, the friction factor is also known as the drag coefficient (f = CD) since it allows for the calculation of the drag force exerted on the object by the flowing fluid. Example 4.10 Water (μ = 0.001 Pa s, ρ = 1000 kg m−3) is flowing over a flat plate at a speed of 0.1 m s−1. Over what length of the plate (cm) is the boundary layer flow laminar? What is the boundary layer thickness (cm) at the location where the flow becomes turbulent? If the plate has a width of 25 cm, what is the drag force (N) acting on the flat plate over this length? Solution The flow will transition to turbulent flow once the Reynolds number reaches 300,000.

Example 4.11 Consider a manta ray swimming along in the ocean at 0.75 m s−1. Assuming the ray approxi- mates a rectangular shape with a length of 0.30 m and a width of 0.75 m, estimate how much power the ray is expending to move through the water as a result of the drag force of the water  on its surface? Assume the density of the water is 1000 kg m−3 and the viscosity of the water is 1 cP = 0.001 Pa s = 0.001. Solution Assume the geometry of the manta ray approximates that of a flat plate, and we can assume that we have laminar flow of the seawater over a flat plate.

Oftentimes, we will need a more generalized relationship that can handle turbulent flow and account for not only the effect of the pressure drop on fluid flow but also the effect of changes in elevation, tube cross section, changes in fluid velocity, sudden contractions or expansions, pumps, as well as the effect of fittings such as valves. This general relationship for the flow of a fluid is called the Bernoulli equation and is valid for laminar or turbulent flow. 189 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids The Bernoulli equation accounts for the effect of changes in fluid pressure, potential energy, and kinetic energy on the flow of the fluid. It also accounts for the energy added to the fluid by pumps, the energy removed by turbines, and accounts for energy losses due to a variety of fric- tional effects. For steady-state flow of an incompressible fluid (density ρ = constant) from inlet station “1” to exit station “2” (see Figure 2.1), the Bernoulli equation can be written as follows (McCabe et al., 1985; Bird et al., 2002): P gZ V W P gZ V hdevice friction 1 1 11 2 2 2 22 2 22r a r a ++ += ++ + (4.81) In this equation P represents the pressure Z is the elevation relative to a reference plane V is the average fluid velocity Gravitational acceleration is represented by g and in SI units is equal to 9.8 m s−2. The α’s are kinetic energy correction terms that account for the shape of the velocity profile. For laminar flow in a cylindrical tube, i.e., for a Re = ρdtubeV/μ < 2300, α = 2.0, and for turbulent flow α = 1.0. The work effect per unit mass of fluid is Wdevice. If Wdevice > 0, then work is done on the fluid, e.g., by a pump. The actual work required to achieve these changes in the fluid properties will be greater than Wdevice due to frictional losses and mechanical inefficiencies within the pump. If Wdevice < 0, then the fluid produces work, e.g., by a turbine. The actual amount of work that is generated will be less than this value because of frictional losses and mechanical inefficiencies within the turbine. Other frictional effects between positions 1 and 2 due to the tube itself, contractions, expansions, and fittings are accounted for by the term hfriction. The units of each term in Equation 4.81 must be consistent with one another and are expressed in terms of energy per unit mass of fluid. In SI units, each term in Equation 4.81 will have units of m2 s−2. If these units of m2 s−2 are multiplied by kg kg−1, then as we see in the following equation, the units are the same as a J kg−1: m s m s kg kg kgm s m kg Nm kg J kg 2 2 2 22=´ =´ == (4.82) In addition to the Bernoulli equation, we also need to write a mass balance on the fluid. At steady state, this simply says that the rate of mass leaving the system, or a region of interest at position 2, must equal the rate at which mass enters the system at position 1. For steady-state flow, this can be expressed by the mass conservation or continuity equation given here: \u0000m VS VS constant= () = () =rr 12 (4.83) In this equation \u0000m is the mass flow rate S represents the cross-sectional area of the tube 190 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The frictional effects in Equation 4.81 are described by h f LV d V Kfriction i i ii i j j fitting j=+ æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷åå4 22 2 2 (4.84) In this equation, fi is the friction factor and accounts for the loss in fluid energy per unit mass of fluid in tube segment i of length Li and diameter di. Vi represents the average velocity, V Volumetric flow rate d/ within tube section ii i = p 2 4 ,. The friction factor f, also known as the Fanning friction factor, is defined as the ratio of the wall shear stress (τw) and the average kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid, also called the velocity head, i.e., ρV2/2. For laminar flow, it is easy to show from Equation 4.10 that f = 16/Re. For turbulent flow (Re > ~2300) in smooth tubes, the friction factor may be evaluated from either of the following equations (McCabe et al., 1985; Bird et al., 2002): 1 4070 60 0 0791 14 f f f = ()- = .log Re . . Re / (4.85) The second equation is valid up to a Re = 100,000 and is more convenient to use since f is explicit in Re. If the flow is turbulent, and the walls are not smooth, then the friction factor charts in McCabe et al. or Bird et al. should be consulted (i.e., graphs of f versus Re with surface roughness as a parameter). The term in the second summation of Equation 4.84, represented by Kfitting, accounts for energy loss in the fluid due to tube contractions, expansions, or fittings such as valves. It is important to note that for the most part, these fitting losses tend to be negligible for laminar flow of a fluid. The average velocity in this second summation of Equation 4.84 is for the fluid just downstream of the contraction, expansion, or fitting. A Kfitting for such items as valves is highly dependent on the valve’s degree of openness and on the type of valve used. It is generally best to consult the manu- facturer’s literature for the particular valve being considered. As examples, a gate valve that is wide open has a Kfitting of about 0.2 and a value of about 6 when half open. A globe valve that is wide open may have a value as high as 10. Simple fittings, such as a tee, has a Kfitting value of 2.0, and a 90° elbow has a value of about 1.0. For sudden contractions and expansions of the fluid, the following equations can be used to estimate Kfitting. Once again, S refers to the cross-sectional area of the tube: K S S suddencontracontraction downstream upstream =- æ è ç ö ø ÷0451., cctionturbulentflow K S S expansion downstream upstream , =- æ è ç ö ø 1÷÷ 2 ,,suddenexpansionturbulentflow (4.86) 191 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids If for an expansion Sdownstream ≫ Supstream, then Kexpansion = 1, and the velocity upstream of the expan- sion is used in Equation 4.84. In this case, the expansion means that we essentially lose all of the kinetic energy per mass of fluid (i.e., V/upstream 2 2) as it goes through the expansion. 4.10.1 The hydraulic diameter If the tube through which a fluid flows is not circular, then the hydraulic diameter can be used in the above calculations. The hydraulic diameter for flow in tubes of noncircular cross section is defined as four times the hydraulic radius (i.e., 4 × rH). The hydraulic radius is defined as the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the flow channel to the wetted perimeter of the tube. The factor of four is needed so that dH = d for a circular tube: d r Crosssectionalarea Wettedperimeter HH=´ = ´() () 4 4 (4.87) The hydraulic diameter is then used in the calculation of the Reynolds number, i.e., Re = ρVdH/μ, and in Equation 4.84. However, the average velocity (V) is still defined as the volumetric flow rate (Q) divided by the cross-sectional area normal to the flow. It is also important to note that the hydraulic diameter should only be used for turbulent flow. For flow in a cylindrical annulus with an inner tube of outer diameter di and an outer tube with inner diameter do, the hydraulic diameter is found from Equation 4.87 to be (do – di). For flow between two parallel plates of width, W, separated by a distance, H, and completely filled with fluid, the hydraulic diameter is equal to 2WH/(W + H). Note that for a very wide rectangular duct where W ≫ H, the hydraulic diameter for this slit flow is 2H, or twice the separation of the plates. The following examples illustrate the use of the Bernoulli equation and the above relationships. Example 4.12 Consider the flow of a fluid through an orifice located at the bottom of a tank. The cross- sectional area of the tank is S1, and the area of the orifice located at the bottom surface of the tank is S2. The fluid stream leaving through the orifice will tend to contract (called the vena contracta) such that at a short distance downstream of the orifice, its cross-sectional area will be about 0.64 times that of the area of the orifice or Svena contracta = 0.64 S2. If the pressure in the tank is maintained at P1, and if the fluid leaving through the orifice is at atmospheric pressure, develop an expression for the average fluid velocity at the vena contracta, assuming the height of the fluid in the tank is given by h. Solution First, we write the Bernoulli equation (4.81) for this situation, where the index 1 denotes the surface of the fluid within the tank. Note that there are no work devices and we ignore any frictional effects and assume the flow leaving the tank through the orifice is turbulent. We also set g(Z1 − Z2) = g h. Hence, for this situation we can write the Bernoulli equation as P gh V PVvena contractavenacontracta11 2 2 22rr ++ =+ 192 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Since Pvena contracta is the same as the atmospheric pressure (Patm), this equation can be rewritten as VV PP ghvena contracta atm2 1 2 1 22=+ -() + r Mass conservation given by Equation 4.83 allows for the calculation of the velocity of the fluid surface within the tank in terms of the velocity at the vena contracta, i.e., VV S S vena contracta vena contracta 1 1 = Using the previous equation to eliminate V1 in the previous equation for Vvena contracta allows for the calculation of the average velocity of the fluid in the vena contracta as V PP gh S S vena contracta atm vena contracta = -æ è ç ö ø ÷ + - æ è ç ö ø ÷ 22 1 1 1 r 22é ë ê ê ù û ú ú For the flow of a fluid from a tank through an orifice, we usually have that S1 ≫ Svena contracta.

(A) 193 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids Example 4.13 Consider a patient being evaluated for stenosis (narrowing) of their aortic valve. Catheterization of the heart gave a cardiac output of 5000 mL min−1, a mean systolic pressure drop across the aortic valve of 50 mmHg, a heart rate of 80 beats min−1, and a systolic ejection period of 0.33 s. From these data, estimate the cross-sectional area of the aortic valve. Solution We can use Equation A developed in the previous example to determine the cross-sectional area of the aortic valve (Sorifice = Saortic valve) from these data. From Table 4.1, the den- sity of blood is 1.056 g cm−3 = 1056 kg m−3. From the cardiac output and the number of heartbeats per minute, we find that each beat of the heart moves a volume of blood given by 5000 1 80 62 5 33cm beats cm beatmin min .´= .

The average velocity of the blood at the vena contracta is given by V cm scm cm s =´ ´ = 189 41 0640 83 356 6 3 2 . .. . From Table 4.1, we have that the viscosity of blood is 3 cP.

This device is used to measure the airspeed on airplanes and can be inserted into pipes to measure the velocity of the flowing fluid. As shown in Figure 4.12, the Pitot tube is aligned with the axis of the flow. At the tip of this tube (1), there is a small opening into an inner tube that leads to a pressure measuring system. In this case, the pressure measuring sys- tem is a simple manometer that contains a denser fluid such as mercury with density ρm. The fluid that impinges at the tip of the Pitot tube (1) stagnates or has a zero velocity (i.e., V1 = 0), and its kinetic energy is converted according to the Bernoulli equation into what is called the stagnation pressure, P1. Surrounding or coaxial to this tube is another tube, and along the sides of this tube are small holes that are also connected to the pressure measuring system. These small holes along the side of this outer tube sense the static pressure (P2) of the surrounding fluid that passes by at a velocity of V2. From this information, develop an expression for the velocity of the fluid flowing near a Pitot tube in terms of the pressure difference (P1 − P2). Also, write this expression for the velocity in terms of the manometer reading (h) for a manometer fluid of density ρm. Solution For the fluid flowing past the Pitot tube, there is no change in elevation. Also, since in this case we are measuring the local velocity of the fluid and not the average velocity, there is no kinetic energy correction term; hence α is equal to one. If we also neglect any work and frictional effects, the Bernoulli equation (4.81) can be written between the stagnation point (1) (note V1 = 0) and the static holes (2) as PP V12 2 2 2rr =+ Note that this equation says that the stagnation pressure (P1) is equal to the static pressure (P2) plus the dynamic pressure, or the velocity head of the fluid, i.e., 1 2 2rV2 ; hence PP V212 21 2 =+ r . This equation can then be rearranged and solved to give the velocity of the fluid passing near the static holes along the sides of the Pitot tube: V PP 2 122 = -() r h 1 2 Manometer fluid Figure 4.12 The Pitot tube. 195 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids If a manometer is used as shown in Figure 4.12 to measure the pressure difference (P1 − P2), then the Bernoulli equation can be used to express this pressure difference in terms of the difference in height (h) between the legs of the manometer fluid. At the surface of the upper leg of the manometer fluid, the pressure is P2 and the velocity of this surface is equal to zero. Similarly, at the surface of the lower leg of the manometer fluid, the pressure is P1 and the velocity of this surface is also zero. Neglecting work and frictional effects, the Bernoulli equa- tion for this situation becomes P gZ P gZ mm 1 1 2 2 rr += + Letting Z2 − Z1 = h, this equation can be solved for (P1 − P2) in terms of h for a manometer fluid of density ρm. This result is also known as the manometer equation: PP ghm12-( ) =r Using this result, we can express the velocity for the Pitot tube of Figure 4.12 as V ghm 2 2 = r r Example 4.15 Farmer Jones needs to pump water from the Maumee River to irrigate his soybean fields. He figures that he will need 250 ft of 2 in. inside diameter steel pipe and four 90° elbows to bring the water from the river to his water tower where the water is then stored. The total change in elevation from the river surface to where the water flows into the top of the water tower is 100 ft. Farmer Jones wants the water flow rate in this system to be 100 gal min−1. Assuming the pump down by the river has an efficiency of 80%, estimate the required horsepower of the pump that is needed. Solution We assume that the storage tank is vented to the atmosphere and that the pipe enters at the top of the storage tank where the water flows into the storage tank. We also let location (1) be the surface of the river and location (2) is the plane at the exit of the pipe. With these assumptions, the pressure at the surface of the river is the same as that inside the storage tank; hence we have P1 = P2. We also assume that the surface of the river adds no kinetic energy to the flow in the pipe, which means that V1 = 0. With these assumptions, we can then write the Bernoulli equation (4.81) from the surface of the lake (1) to where the water leaves the pipe (2): gZW gZ V hdevice friction12 22 2 2 += ++ a We now use Equation 4.84 for hfriction to account for the resistance of the pipe of length L and diameter d and the fittings.

The friction factor (f) in this term can be calculated after we find the Reynolds number and determine whether the flow in the pipe is laminar or turbulent.

We can also use Equation 4.85 to find the friction factor, which is found to be equal to 0.0041.

Now inserting the numerical values where the elevation change was given as 100 ft (30.48 m), the pipe length is 250 ft (76.2 m), the diameter of the pipe is 2 in.

If this result is then multiplied by kg kg−1 (see Equation 4.82), then Wdevice = 443.6 J kg−1.

Because of the inefficiencies of the pump, this value needs to be divided by the efficiency of the pump (here 0.80) to find the actual work required. This would be the rating of the pump. So, dividing this result by the efficiency gives a value of Wactual = 3.52 kW, since 1 kW = 1000 W. In terms of horsepower (HP), which is a common unit of power still used in the United States, we multiply this result by the conversion factor of 1.341 HP kW−1 and obtain Wactual = 4.72 HP. Example 4.16 Consider the design of a power injector that rapidly injects a bolus of imaging contrast agent into a blood vessel. The diameter of the injector barrel is 2.5 cm, and this is connected to a catheter with an inside diameter of 0.98 mm and a total length of 50 cm. Calculate the pressure (PSI) inside the power injector barrel and the force (N and lbf) required to deliver a flow rate of the contrast agent of 8 cm3 s−1 through the catheter. The contrast agent has a viscosity of 2.5 cP and a density of 1 g cm−3. The gauge pressure in the blood vessel is equal to 8 mmHg (gauge pressure*). Assume the power injector is horizontal and at the same level as the injection site on the patient’s arm. Also, you can neglect any frictional force developed between the power injector’s plunger and the barrel wall that encloses the contrast agent within the power injec- tor. In addition, the pressure losses due to fluid motion within the barrel itself are negligible in comparison to the pressure loss within the catheter and the pressure loss due to the contraction of the fluid as it enters the catheter. This means the pressure of the contrast agent fluid within the power injector barrel is constant. Solution We let location (1) be the contrast agent within the barrel of the power injector, and location (2) is the plane at the catheter exit where the contrast agent leaves and enters the blood vessel. We also assume that the velocity of the contrast agent within the catheter, i.e., V2, is much greater than the velocity of the contrast agent in the barrel of the power injector during the injection process, i.e., V1. With these assumptions, the Bernoulli equation, as given by Equation 4.81, simplifies to give PP V hfriction 12 22 2 2rr a =+ + From Equation 4.84, we can write hfriction as h f LV d V Kfrictioncontraction=+4 22 2 2 2 2 * Recall that gauge pressure is that pressure relative to the local atmospheric pressure. Absolute pressure is gauge pressure plus local atmospheric pressure. 198 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Using Equation 4.86, we can calculate the value of Kcontraction. Since the diameter of the power injector barrel is much larger than the diameter of the catheter, we have that Kcontraction = 0.45.

The next example illustrates a pseudo-steady-state application* of the Bernoulli equation to estimate the draining time of an IV bag. * Problem 4.7 at the end of this chapter discusses an unsteady-state solution. 199 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids Example 4.17 The simplest patient infusion system is that of gravity flow from an intravenous (IV) bag. A 500 mL IV bag containing an aqueous solution is connected to a vein in the forearm of a patient. Venous pressure in the forearm is about 8 mmHg. The IV bag is placed on a stand such that the entrance to the tube leaving the IV bag is exactly 1 m above the vein into which the IV fluid enters. The length of the IV bag is 30 cm. The IV fluid is fed through a tube with an internal diameter of 0.953 mm and the total length of the tube is 2 m. Calculate the flow rate of the IV fluid. Also estimate the time needed to empty the bag. Solution We apply the Bernoulli equation from the surface of the fluid in the IV bag (“1”) to the entrance to the vein (“2”). We expect the flow of the fluid through the bag and the tube to be laminar and therefore neglect the contraction at the entry to the feed tube and the expansion at the vein. The pressure at the surface of the fluid in the bag will be atmospheric (P1 = 760 mmHg absolute), since the bag collapses as the fluid leaves the bag. The venous pressure, or P2, is 8 mmHg gauge or 768 mmHg absolute. Because the fluid takes some length of time to leave the bag, we neglect the velocity of the surface of the fluid in the bag in comparison to the fluid velocity at the exit of the tube. Therefore, we assume V1 = 0 and V2  ≫ V1. We also set the reference elevation as the entrance to the patient’s arm; hence Z2 = 0. Therefore, Z1 is equal to the elevation of the bag relative to the position where the fluid enters the patient’s arm. This would equal 1 m plus the 30 cm length of the bag. Since there are no work devices in the system, Wdevice = 0.

Capillary action is responsible for transporting water to the uppermost parts of tall trees and has a variety of applications in the fields of printing, textiles, agri- culture, cleaning and sanitation products, and medical devices. 4.11.1 Equilibrium capillary rise Consider the situation shown in Figure 4.13. A small capillary tube is placed within a liquid. The liq- uid is drawn into the capillary as a result of the surface forces acting on the liquid wetting the inside surfaces of the capillary tube. These surface forces cause a curvature, called a meniscus, in the liq- uid surface as shown at position 3 in Figure 4.13, which, according to the Laplace-Young equation 201 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids (i.e., Equation 2.185), lowers the pressure there relative to that outside of the capillary tube. This creates a suction that draws the fluid into the capillary tube. The liquid continues to rise up in the capillary until the forces tending to draw up the liquid are balanced by the downward force of gravity acting on the fluid. The angle (θ) at the meniscus between the liquid surface and the wall of the capillary is called the contact angle. The radius of curvature of the meniscus (r) is related to the radius of the capillary tube (R) and the contact angle by the following equation: r R = cos q (4.88) The equilibrium capillary rise (h) can be found from an analysis of the pressures at points 1, 2, 3, and 4, shown in Figure 4.13. From the Laplace-Young equation that we developed in Chapter 2 (i.e., Equation 2.185), we can write at the meniscus interface that PP r 43 2 -= g (4.89) The pressure at point 2 is greater than the pressure at point 3 by an amount equal to ρLgh and the pressure at point 1 is greater than the pressure at point 4 by ρVgh; hence we can write that P1 = P4 + ρVgh, P2 = P3 + ρLgh. We also have the requirement that at equilibrium, P1 = P2. Therefore, P4 – P3 = (ρL − ρV)gh. Using this result, Equation 4.89 can be solved for the capillary rise as shown in the fol- lowing equation, recognizing that ρL ≫ ρV: h RgL = 2 gq r cos (4.90) Note that this equation also provides a simple means to determine the surface tension (γ) of a liquid by measuring its capillary rise. θ θ R r 2 1 34 h 4 Figure 4.13 Capillary rise of a liquid in a small diameter tube of radius R. 202 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Example 4.18 Calculate the capillary rise for water in a tube with a diameter of 1 mm.

For the situation shown in Figure 4.13, the liquid is drawn into the capillary by forces arising from the surface tension, and this capillary force is retarded by the inertial force due to the mass of the rising fluid, the viscous force, and the gravitational force acting on the fluid. In a general sense, this is a very difficult problem; however, an approximate solution can be obtained if we assume that the flow in the capillary tube is laminar (Re < 2300) and that the velocity profile maintains the same parabolic shape (i.e., Equation 4.7) as the liquid is drawn into the capillary tube. The capillary force draws fluid into the tube as a result of the suction pressure developed between positions 4 and 3 of Figure 4.13. This is given by the following expression, where we have also made use of Equations 4.88 and 4.89: F RP PR r Rcapillary force =-() ==pp g pg q 2 43 2 2 2cos (4.91) The gravitational force acts on the mass of fluid (ρLπR2h(t)) within the tube at time t. This is given by the following equation where ρL is the density of the fluid: F gR htgravitationalforce L= ()rp 2 (4.92) The viscous force arises as a result of the flow of the fluid as it is drawn into the capillary tube by the capillary force. It is assumed that the flow is laminar and that the Hagen-Poiseuille law (Equation 4.10) can be used to describe this unsteady flow. The driving force for this flow of fluid into the capillary tube is the pressure drop between points 2 and 3 as shown in Figure 4.13. Since the fluid is incompressible, the average velocity of the fluid (i.e., V) is the same as the observed meniscus velocity, which is dh(t)/dt. With these assumptions, the volumetric flow rate of the fluid at time t is given by Qt RV tR dh t dt RP P ht () = () = () = -() () pp p m 22 4 23 8 (4.93) 203 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids The wall shear stress (i.e., τw) is also related to (P2 − P3) through Equation 4.4, so we can solve this equation for (P2 − P3) in terms of the wall shear stress as shown here: PP ht R w 23 2 -( ) = ()t (4.94) Substituting Equation 4.94 into Equation 4.93 and solving for dh(t)/dt gives the next result: dh t dt Rh t ht w() = () () 2 8 pt pm (4.95) The viscous force is the wall shear stress times the circumferential area, which is the numerator of the right-hand side of Equation 4.95. Therefore, we obtain F ht dh t dt viscous force = () () 8pm (4.96) The inertial force is the mass of the fluid in the capillary tube multiplied by its acceleration. This is given by Newton’s second law: F mV mV t dmV dt d dt m dh t dt inertialforce t tt t= - = () = ()æ è çç ö ® +lim 0 D D øø ÷÷ = () ()æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ rpL R d dt ht dh t dt 2 (4.97) The inertial force is then equal to the sum of all the forces acting on the fluid as it rises in the tube through capillary action. The capillary force draws the fluid into the capillary tube and the viscous and gravitational forces work in opposition. Using the expressions developed earlier, we can then write that rp pg qpmr pL L 2R d dt ht dh t dt Rh t dh t dt gR 2 28() ()æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ =- () () -coshht() (4.98) Next, we rearrange Equation 4.98 and obtain what is known as the Bosanquet equation (Zhmud et al., 2000; Kornev and Neimark, 2001): d dt ht dh t dt R ht dh t dt R gh L () ()æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ + æ è ç ö ø ÷ () () =- 82 2 m r gq r cos tt() (4.99) Equation 4.99 can then be solved for the rise of the fluid in the capillary tube as a function of time, provided suitable initial conditions can be defined. The initial conditions can be found by consider- ing a solution to Equation 4.99 that is valid for short contact times when penetration of the fluid just begins. In this case, only the inertial and capillary forces are dominant and Equation 4.99 becomes d dt ht dh t dt RL () ()æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ = 2 gq r cos (4.100) 204 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Integration of Equation 4.100 with the initial condition that h(0) = 0 gives h t dh t dt R t L () () = æ è ç ö ø ÷ 2 gq r cos (4.101) The left-hand side of Equation 4.101 is proportional to the fluid momentum, rpL Rh t dh t dt 2 () () , and shows that as t → 0, the momentum of the fluid approaches zero. Since h(0) = 0, this implies for t → 0 that there is a finite velocity during the initial fluid entry phase, which is known as the Bosanquet velocity (UB), that is defined by the following relationships: For t dh t dt Uorh tU tBB® () » () »0, (4.102) Equation 4.102 predicts that during the initial time of fluid penetration, the capillary rise increases linearly with time. Upon substitution of the results from the previous equation into Equation 4.101, we can solve for the initial fluid velocity as it enters the capillary tube due to the capillary force: U R B L = æ è ç ö ø ÷ 2 12 gq r cos / (4.103) Hence, from Equations 4.102 and 4.103, the initial conditions for Equation 4.99 are h(0) = 0 and dh(0)/dt = UB. At long times, the fluid in the capillary reaches a stationary level, which represents a balance between the capillary forces and the gravitational forces. At this equilibrium, dh(t)/dt = 0, and Equation 4.99 simplifies to the following equation for the capillary rise, which is the same as Equation 4.90 that was found earlier: h Rg equilibrium L = 2 gq r cos (4.104) For intermediate times, the first term representing the fluid inertia in Equation 4.99 can be neglected and we then obtain the Lucas-Washburn equation. This equation describes the rise of the fluid after the initial entry of the fluid into the tube, since the fluid acceleration is decreasing and the inertial force is much smaller for these times than the viscous and gravitational forces: 82 2 m r gq rLLR ht dh t dt R gh t æ è ç ö ø ÷ () () =- () cos (4.105) If the capillary rise is not large, then the gravitational force can also be neglected, and Equation 4.105 can be integrated to give the following result for the capillary rise as a function of time: h t Rt () = gq m cos 2 (4.106) 205 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids This equation predicts that the capillary rise is directly proportional to t . Also, since Vt dh t dt andQ tR Vt() = () () = ()p 2 , we obtain the following equations for the average velocity and the volumetric flow rate after differentiating Equation 4.106 with respect to t: Vt R t andQ tR R t () = () = gq m p gq m coscos 88 2 (4.107) Equation 4.107 predicts that for long times, V and Q decrease in proportion to 1/ t . Notice also that Equation 4.107 at t = 0 gives the result that V and Q are infinite. This is a result of the neglect of the inertial forces when the fluid is first being drawn into the capillary tube. Example 4.19 Estimate the time for water at 25°C to reach a height of 15 mm in a capillary tube that has a diameter of 1 mm. Assume that cos θ ≈ 1 and that the surface tension of water is 72 mN m−1.

However, the IV bag has a length of 30 cm, and as the fluid drains from the bag, the potential energy (Z1) of the remaining fluid that drives the flow will change with time. Therefore, to obtain a better estimate of the time to drain the bag, we also need to include how Z1 changes with time. This can be obtained by combining the expression for the exit velocity (V2) derived in Example 4.17 with an unsteady mass balance on the fluid in the bag itself. Letting M(t) denote the mass of IV fluid remaining in the bag at any time t, we can write the IV bag mass balance as follows: dM t dt S dZ tH dt d VLbag L tube() = ()-() =-rr p 1 2 2 4 In this equation, H represents the height of the catheter tube leaving the bottom of the bag relative to where this tube then enters the patient’s arm. For this problem, H is equal to 1 m and Z1 − H is then the depth of the remaining fluid in the bag. Sbag is the cross-sectional area 206 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering of the IV bag, and dtube is the diameter of the tube. Use this equation, and the expression from Example 4.17 for V2 to obtain the time to just drain the bag. How does this time compare to the pseudo-steady-state estimate of drain time obtained in Example 4.17? 4.8 Derive Equation 4.10. Start with Equation 4.18 and the assumption of a Newtonian fluid. Also show that Equation 4.10 can be obtained by integrating vz(r) in Equation 4.7 using Equation 4.16. 4.9 The cardiac output in a human is about 6 L min−1. Blood enters the right side of the heart at a pressure of about 0 mmHg gauge and flows via the pulmonary arteries to the lungs at a mean pressure of 11 mmHg gauge. Blood returns to the left side of the heart through the pulmonary veins at a mean pressure of 8 mmHg gauge. The blood is then ejected from the heart through the aorta at a mean pressure of 90 mmHg gauge. Use the Bernoulli equation to obtain an esti- mate of the total work performed by the heart. Carefully state any assumptions and express your answer in watts. 4.10 Use the Bernoulli equation to describe the expected velocity and pressure changes upstream, within, and downstream of an arterial stenosis. A stenosis is a partial blockage or narrowing of an artery by formation of plaque (atherosclerosis). 4.11 Blood is flowing through a bundle of hollow fiber tubes that are each 50 μm in diameter. There are 10,000 tubes in the bundle. The hollow fiber tube length is 12 cm and the pressure drop across each tube is found to be 250 mmHg. The hematocrit of the blood is 0.40. Estimate the blood flow rate for these conditions in each tube. 4.12 Blood enters a hollow fiber unit that is used as an artificial kidney, i.e., for hemodialysis. The unit consists of 10,000 hollow fibers arranged in a shell and tube configuration. Blood flows from an artery in the patient’s arm through a catheter tube and is uniformly distributed to the fibers via an arterial head space region at the entrance of the unit. The blood then leaves each fiber through the venous head space region of the unit and is returned to a vein in the patient’s arm. Each hollow fiber has an inside diameter of 220 μm and a length of 25 cm. Assuming the maximum available pressure drop across the hollow fiber unit is 90 mmHg, estimate the total flow rate of blood through the hollow fiber unit. 4.13 You are designing a hollow fiber unit. The fiber diameter is 800 μm and their length is 30 cm. You want a blood flow rate of 8 mL min−1 for each fiber. What should be the pressure drop in mmHg across each fiber length to achieve this flow rate? 4.14 Using the data shown in Figure 4.5, find the best values of s and τy in the Casson equation that fit these data. Recall that the shear stress can be found from the data shown in Figure 4.5 from the following relationship, tm g= apparent \u0000 . Also, from the Casson equation, note that a plot of τ1/2 versus \u0000g12/ should be linear with a slope equal to s and an intercept of ty 12/ . Express the units of s as (dynes s cm−2)1/2 and τy in (dynes cm−2). 4.15 The following values were obtained for the apparent viscosity of blood (H = 40%) in tubes of various diameters.

For a flow rate of blood of 5 L min−1 through the cannula, estimate the pressure drop (mmHg) over the length of the cannula. 4.18 For a cell-free plasma layer of 3 μm and a blood hematocrit of 40%, calculate the apparent vis- cosity for blood flowing in a 100 μm diameter tube. Assume the plasma viscosity is 1.093 cP and the core viscosity is 3.7 cP. 4.19 You are designing a small implantable microfluidic pump for the continuous delivery of a drug. The pump is a two-compartment cylindrical chamber: one compartment contains the drug dissolved within a solvent, and the other compartment is the pump engine. These two compartments are separated by a movable piston that pushes on the drug compartment as the pump engine operates. At the other end of the drug compartment, there is an exit tube through which the drug solution flows. The exit tube of the pump through which the drug leaves the pump has an internal diameter of 10 μm and a total length of 15 cm. What gauge pressure is needed in mmHg within the drug compartment to maintain a flow rate of the drug solution of 350 μg day−1? You may assume that the drug solution has a density of 1 g cm−3 and a viscosity of 3 cP. 4.20 You are part of a team developing an osmotic pump for the delivery of a drug. An osmotic pump has two compartments; one compartment, the osmotic engine, contains an osmotic agent that is retained by a membrane and imbibes water when placed within the body. This compartment also has a piston that expands against another compartment containing the drug solution as water is imbibed from the surroundings. The movement of the piston then forces the drug solution out into the body. A question has been raised as to what would be the maximum pressure within the device if after implantation the exit tube that deliv- ers the drug becomes blocked? Assume the interstitial fluid pressure is –3 mmHg and its osmotic pressure is 8 mmHg. If the concentration of the osmotic agent is 0.05 OsM, what would be the maximum hydrodynamic pressure within the device assuming the delivery tube becomes blocked? 4.21 A viscometer has been used to measure the viscosity of a fluid at 20°C. The data of the shear stress versus the shear rate when plotted on a log-log graph is linear. Is this fluid Newtonian? Explain your answer. 4.22 Blood flows through a bundle of hollow fibers at a total flow rate of 250 mL min−1. There are a total of 7500 fibers. The diameter of each fiber is 75 μm and the length of a fiber is 15 cm. What is the pressure drop across a fiber in mmHg? 4.23 Commercially available spermicidal or contraceptive gels have been developed for the pur- pose of preventing sperm transport and thus blocking fertilization (Owen et al., 2000). Current interest has also lead to the possible use of contraceptive gels as a means to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS, and has led to interest in developing formula- tions of these gels for both prophylaxis and contraception. The physical properties of these gels must be such that, when applied, they spread to coat the vaginal epithelia, and then stay in place long enough to provide contraception, as well as adequate protection from disease causing agents such as bacteria and viruses. This is accomplished by gel formulations that 208 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering deliver topically bioactive compounds, such as microbiocides, and also by the physical barrier to infection provided by the coating layer. The spreading and retention of intravaginal contra- ceptive formulations are fundamental to their efficacy and these performance characteristics are governed in part by their rheological properties. In vivo, these contraceptive gels will experience a wide range of shear rates as a result of movements of the vaginal epithelial surfaces, gravity, capillary flow, and sex. It is estimated that these shear rates may range from as low as 0.1/s to as high as 100/s during sex. The polymeric nature of these gels suggests that they will exhibit non-Newtonian rheological behavior. A popular model for describing the rheological behavior of non-Newtonian gels is that of the two-parameter power law model. This model is shown by the following equations for flow in a cylindrical tube: tg gm mg m rz nn z apparent z apparent apparent mm dv dr dv dr == -= -= -\u0000\u0000 \u0000 1 == -m n\u0000g 1 In this equation, m and n are constants characterizing the fluid, and \u0000g is the shear rate equal to - dv dr z . Using this equation, derive an expression for the axial velocity profile, vz(r), and the mass flow rate \u0000mQL=( )r of a fluid described by the power law model. The following table shows data obtained from a rheometer for the commercially available gel called Conceptrol.

Perform a regression analysis of the data in this table and find the power law parameters m and n. Compare your model predictions to the data shown in this table. Carefully state the units these parameters have. 4.24 Bush et al. (1997) studied the flow of urine in an anatomical model of the human female urethra as shown in Figure 4.14. 209 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids They obtained the following data shown in the table from their experimental model.

Use the Bernoulli equation (Equation 4.81) to predict the pressure difference for each of the flow rates given in this table. Show your results as a graphical comparison between the data and the model. Assume that the diameter of the urethra is 3.25 mm and that its length is 4 cm. Determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. If the model does not fit the data, what parameters in the model can you change to improve the fit, e.g., what is the effect of the average ure- thral diameter? 4.25 Consider the steady laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in the thin channel formed between two large parallel and horizontal plates of length L in the flow direction and width W. The plates H 2 cm Fluid reservoir Urethra Open to the atmosphere Figure 4.14 An in vitro fluid flow model of the human urethra. (From Bush, M.B. et al., J.

Assuming the blood sample has a viscosity of 3 cP and that the plates forming the channel are separated by a distance of 1 mm, estimate the time for the sample of blood to travel a distance of 15 mm in the channel. Assume the blood has a surface tension of 0.06 N m−1 and that the contact angle is 70°. 4.27 The following table shows data for the measured velocity profile for the laminar boundary layer flow of a fluid across a flat plate (from Schlichting, 1979).

Compare these results to those predicted by the Lucas-Washburn 211 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids equation, i.e., Equation 4.106. The physical properties for dodecane are as follows: viscosity = 1.7 × 10−3 Pa s, surface tension = 2.5 × 10−2 N m−1, and density = 750 kg m−3.

(2000), the capillary rise for diethyl ether in a 1 mm diameter capillary tube was found to be 8.6 mm at equilibrium. How does this value compare with the value predicted by Equation 4.90? The physical properties for diethyl ether are as follows: surface tension = 1.67 × 10−2 N m−1, density = 710 kg m−3, contact angle = 26°. 4.30 Prove that for laminar flow in a cylindrical tube, the kinetic energy correction factor, α, in the Bernoulli equation is equal to 2. 4.31 Show that f = 16/Re for laminar flow in a cylindrical tube. 4.32 A small airplane is flying at 3000 m above sea level. The density of air at this altitude is 0.83 kg m−3. A Pitot tube gives a difference between the stagnation pressure and the static pressure of 50 mmHg. Based on this information, how fast is the airplane traveling in miles per hour? 4.33 The viscosity of a fluid (μtest) may be found in terms of the viscosity of another reference fluid whose viscosity is known (μreference) by measuring the time it takes for the fluid (ttest) to drain by gravity a certain distance within a vertical tube of constant cross section, and then comparing that time to the time (treference) for the reference fluid whose viscosity is known. Show that for either fluid the velocity of the fluid exiting the tube is related to the change in height (z) of the fluid by the following equation: dz dt V=- 2 where V2 is the velocity of the fluid exiting the bottom of the tube. Next, apply the Bernoulli equation to the fluid in the tube from the top of the fluid surface (1) to the bottom of the tube (2). 212 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Assuming laminar flow of the fluid with f = 16/Re and using the above equation for V2, show that dz/dt is also given by the following equation: dz dt dg =- r m 2 32 where d is the inside diameter of the tube g is the acceleration of gravity Next, integrate this equation and show that the time for the fluid to drain a distance equal to Δz is given by Dz dgt = r m 2 32 Now, if both fluids drain the same distance, i.e., Δztest = Δzreference, show that the following equation may be used to relate their viscosities in terms of their drain times and densities: m m r r test reference test test referencereference t t = Shown below are some data for the drain time of different concentrations of chitosan in water that were obtained by one of my former PhD students, Prasanjit Das. Pure water was used as the reference fluid with a viscosity of 0.001 Pa s or 1 cP and a density of 997 kg m−3. The time (treference) for the water to flow by gravity for a defined distance (Δztest = Δzreference) in a capillary tube was found to be 0.120 s. Calculate the viscosity (cP) of the chitosan solution for each of the concentration values given in the following table.

This is known as the hanging droplet method. The droplet can grow in size until the gravitational force exceeds the surface tension force that holds the droplet to the periphery of the tube, i.e., gp prDR gtube L= 4 3 3 where γ is the surface tension of the fluid R is the radius of the spherical droplet formed 213 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids Show that the surface tension is then given by the following equation: g r = 0 1667 3.d g D L tube where d is the diameter of the droplet that just releases itself from the tube. Shown below are some data that were obtained by my former PhD student, Prasanjit Das, on droplets formed at the tip of a 1 mm outside diameter capillary tube for different concentrations of chitosan in water. From these data, calculate the surface tension (mN m−1) of the chitosan solution for each of the concentration values given in the following table.

(2003) measured the entry capillary flow rate of water into a 0.65 mm diam- eter capillary tube. The average entry flow rate of the water was found to be 220 mm3 s−1. What is the entrance velocity of the water and how does this compare to that predicted by the Bosanquet equation? Assume the surface tension of water is 0.071 N m−1 and its viscosity is 0.001 Pa s. Also θ = 0°. 4.36 A concentrated solution of sugar dissolved in water is flowing through a capillary tube with an inside diameter of 2 mm. The capillary tube will be used to find the viscosity of this solution. The length of the capillary tube is 10 cm. The density of the solution is 1200 kg m−3. For a flow rate of 60 cm3 min−1, the pressure drop per length of the tube was found to be 1.0 mmHg cm−1. What is the viscosity (Pa s) of the fluid? 4.37 A polymeric fluid having a viscosity of 0.40 Pa s, a density of 800 kg m−3, and a surface ten- sion of 0.02 N m−1 is drawn by capillary action into a glass tube of radius 0.025 cm. If the contact angle is such that the cos θ ~ 1, estimate the time required for the fluid to reach a height equal to 90% of its equilibrium rise. Also, find the initial flow rate of this fluid into the tube in cm3 s−1. 4.38 The capillary rise, h(t), as a function of time, t, for a biofluid was measured in a capillary tube of radius 0.3 mm. When the data was plotted as h(t) versus t1/2 the data was found to be linear with a slope equal to 0.06 m s−1/2. If the fluid has a viscosity of 1.2 × 10−3 Pa s, and the contact angle ~0°, estimate the surface tension of the fluid in N m−1. 4.39 A particular fluid has a shear stress of 0.005 N m−2 at a shear rate of 1 s−1 and a shear stress of 2 N m−2 at a shear rate of 50 s−1. Present an argument as to whether this fluid is Newtonian or non-Newtonian. 4.40 Blood is flowing at a flow rate of 7 L min−1 through a tube that is 6 mm in diameter and 50 cm in length. Estimate the pressure drop of the blood over this length of tubing in mmHg. 4.41 The apparent viscosity of blood flowing in a 100 μm diameter tube was found to be 2.6 cP. Assuming that the core viscosity of blood is about 3.7 cP, estimate the thickness of the mar- ginal zone layer. Assume the plasma viscosity is 1.1 cP. 214 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 4.42 Blood flows through a 100 μm diameter glass tube that is 0.1 cm in length. Estimate the volu- metric flow rate of the blood in cm3 h−1 if the pressure difference over the length of the tube is 6000 Pa. 4.43 You are designing a hollow fiber unit with 10,000 fibers. The fiber diameter is 1000 μm and their length is 50 cm. You want a flow rate of 100 L min−1 for the entire unit. What should the pressure drop (mmHg) be across the unit to achieve this flow rate? 4.44 The broth from a continuous fermentor has a density of 1.02 g cm−3 and a viscosity of 1.8 cP. The broth is being pumped from the fermentor into the bottom of a filtration feed tank that leads into a filtration system. The surface of the liquid contained in the filtration feed tank is 20 feet above the surface of the liquid in the fermentor. The pressure in the fermentor is maintained at 1 atm and the pressure in the feed tank is maintained at 6 atm in order to facilitate the downstream filtration process. The pipe connecting the fermentor and the feed tank is equivalent to 75 ft of pipe with an inside diameter of 3 in., where, this equivalent length includes the additional resistance of any valves and pipe fittings. The desired flow rate of the fermentation broth as it is pumped to the feed tank is 100 gal min−1. What power (kilowatts) must be delivered by the pump to the fluid in order to effect this transfer of broth from the fermentor to the feed tank? 4.45 Water at 20°C is pumped through 3000 cm of pipe with an internal diameter of 7.8 cm into an overhead storage tank that vents to the surroundings. The total elevation change is 1000 cm. The valves and other pipe fittings are equivalent to an additional pipe length equal to 15 pipe diam- eters. What outlet pressure in atmospheres of the pump is needed to move the water at a flow rate of 70 L min−1? At 20°C the viscosity of water is 1.002 cP and the density is 0.9982 g cm−3. 4.46 The pressure drop of a nutrient fluid flowing through the hollow fibers of a bioreactor can- not exceed 50 mmHg. There are 10,000 fibers in the bioreactor, and the total flow rate of the nutrient media to the bioreactor is 50 L min−1. Estimate the allowable length of these fibers assuming the hollow fiber radius is 0.1 cm and the viscosity of the nutrient fluid is 0.05 Pa s. 4.47 You are studying in the laboratory the laminar boundary layer flow of a fluid across a very thin flat plate. The flat plate is suspended vertically from a spring in the range where Hooke’s law applies, i.e., F = k Δλ, where Δλ is the amount of spring extension from the unloaded position of the spring and k is the spring constant. Under conditions of no air flow, the extension of the spring due to the weight of the flat plate is Δλplate = 5 cm. When there is an upward flow of air, the resulting drag opposes the weight of the flat plate. Find the air flow in m s−1 for which the spring extension is zero, i.e., Δλ = 0. Use the following data to find your answer: Mass of the plate, M = 0.001 kg Plate length, L = 0.2 m Plate width, W = 0.1 m Air speed, V = find this Air density, ρ = 1.2 kg m−3 Air kinematic viscosity, ν = 1.51 × 10−5 m2 s−1 4.48 Estimate the maximum power that is generated in megawatts from a wind turbine whose blades are 300 ft in diameter. Assume the wind speed averages 20 miles h−1 and that the den- sity of air is 1.2 kg m−3. Carefully state your assumptions. 4.49 Estimate the pressure drop in mmHg of blood flowing in the annulus formed by two concen- tric cylindrical tubes. The inner tube has an outer diameter of 8 mm and the outer tube has an 215 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids inner diameter of 15 mm. The blood flow rate is 15,000 mL min−1, and the overall length of the tube section being considered is 40 cm. 4.50 For the flow of a fluid through a small tube that is 0. 9 mm in diameter, the flow rate was 0.3 cm3 s−1 and the pressure drop over the length of the 50 cm tube was found to be 50 kPa. Estimate the viscosity of this fluid in Pa s. 4.51 The rheological properties of a new personal lubricant were studied in a viscometer. A lin- ear regression of these data was performed after first taking the natural log of the apparent viscosity (cP) and the natural log of the shear rate (1/sec). The equation for the regression line is: ln µapparent = 11.02 – 0.75 ln \u0000g . What are the parameters in an appropriate viscosity model? Be sure to state what the viscosity model is and any units on your parameters. Is this lubricant’s behavior Newtonian or Non-Newtonian? 4.52 The equilibrium rise height of a rather viscous fluid in a small capillary tube of diameter equal to 0.1 mm was found to be 65 mm. The contact angle was also measured to be 75°. Estimate the surface tension of this fluid if its viscosity is μ = 0.75 Pa s and ρL = 800 kg m−3. 4.53 Water at 70°F enters a pump through a 3 in. schedule 40 pipe at atmospheric pressure and is being pumped at a rate of 100 gal min−1 (1 gal = 3.7853 L) through a pipe system made up of 500 ft of 3 in. schedule 40 steel pipe (internal diameter = 3.068 in.). The pipe circuit includes 4°–90° elbows. The total change in elevation from the pump entrance to the discharge of the water into the atmosphere is equal to 400 ft. Find the horsepower (HP) required for the pump assuming the pump efficiency is 70%. The viscosity of water under these conditions is 0.96 cP and the density of water is 1 g cm−3. 4.54 A Newtonian fluid with a density of 1.06 g cm−3 is flowing through a horizontal tube with a length of 50 cm and a diameter of 6 mm at a flow rate of 7.5 L min−1.

Estimate the viscosity of this fluid in cP. 4.55 A fluid with a density of 1.03 g cm−3 is flowing at the rate of 1.8 L h−1 through a small tube that is 1.5 mm in diameter and 50 cm in length. If the viscosity of this fluid is 2.8 cP, estimate the pressure drop over the tube length in mmHg. 4.56 A Newtonian fluid with a density of 1.03 g cm−3 is flowing through a horizontal tube with a diameter of 4 mm at a flow rate of 15 L min−1. The viscosity of this fluid is 1.1 cP. What pres- sure drop in mmHg would you expect over a 50 cm length of this tube? 4.57 Consider the rise of water in a capillary tube of radius equal to 50 μm. What is the equilibrium rise height in cm of the water after one end of the tube is immersed in water? Assume the viscosity of water is 0.001 Pa s, the surface tension of the water is 7.3 × 10−2 N m−1, and the density of the water is 1000 kg m−3. Assume cos θ = 1. 4.58 A woman decides to build a log cabin at the base of a tall mountain and is looking at the feasibil- ity of tapping into a snow melt fed lake that is about 500 ft above her cabin for her water supply. The plan is to install a small pipeline that runs from the lake into a water storage tank that will then provide water as needed to her cabin, which is located nearby. The change in elevation from the surface of the lake to where the water would empty into the storage tank is 475 ft. The plan is to use a 1.25 in. inside diameter pipe that would have an overall length of 600 ft. Included in the piping circuit is a priming pump (which only runs to get the water flowing, sort of like a siphon) with a Kpump = 1.5 and there are also 8–90° elbows (Kelbow = 1.0). When the water is flowing, what is the flow rate of the water in gallons per minute as it exits the pipe into the top of the stor- age tank? Assume that the water exiting the pipe is not submerged in the water. Also assume that the tank is vented to the atmosphere. You can also neglect the difference in barometric pressure 216 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering between the lake and the cabin. The water is at 41°F and its viscosity and density at this tempera- ture are, respectively, 1.519 cP and 1000 kg m−3. 4.59 A Newtonian fluid with a density of 1.10 g cm−3 and a viscosity of 1.5 cP is flowing through a horizontal tube with a diameter of 5 mm. If the pressure drop across the length of the tube cannot exceed 2000 mmHg, estimate the maximum length of the tube in cm. The flow rate of the fluid is 7 L min−1. 4.60 A fluid with a density of 1.03 g cm−3 is flowing through a small horizontal tube that is 1.25 mm in diameter and 75 cm in length. If the viscosity of this fluid is 1.8 cP, and the pressure drop over this length of tube is 60 mmHg, estimate the flow rate of the fluid in mL h−1. 4.61 A droplet of a nerve agent lands on the surface of a soldier’s clothing and covers an area of 2.8 cm2. The surface tension of the nerve agent is 0.028 N m−1. The material in the person’s cloth- ing is such that the weave makes tiny cylindrical openings that have a diameter of 0.5 mm. The cylindrical openings cover 45% of the clothing area. The contact angle (θ) of the agent and clothing material is such that the cos θ = 0.9063. From this information, estimate the initial mass flow rate of the nerve agent into the clothing material in grams per second. The density of the nerve agent is 1.04 g cm−3. 4.62 Blood flows through a vein that is 0.71 cm in diameter and 20 cm in length. If the blood has a viscosity of 4 cP and a density of 1.04 g cm−3, what is the flow rate of the blood in cm3 s−1 if the pressure drop over the length of the vein is equal to 1 mmHg? 4.63 The rheology of an infant gruel formula is being evaluated in a capillary viscometer. The vis- cometer is a glass tube that has an internal diameter of 1.25 mm and is 5 cm in length. When the flow rate of the gruel was 1 cm3 min−1, the pressure drop over the length of the viscometer was found to be 137 mmHg. What is the apparent viscosity of the gruel in units of Pa s? 4.64 A Newtonian fluid with a density of 1.06 g cm−3 is flowing through a horizontal tube with a length of 50 cm and a diameter of 6 mm at a flow rate of 7.5 L min−1. The viscosity of the fluid is equal to 2.55 cP. What is the pressure drop across this length of tube? 4.65 A fluid with a density of 1.03 g cm−3 is flowing through a small tube that is 1.5 mm in diameter and 50 cm in length. If the viscosity of this fluid is 2.8 cP, and the pressure drop over the tube length is 42.3 mmHg, what is the flow rate of the fluid in L h−1? 4.66 Calculate the pressure drop in mmHg for the flow of a liquid material in a horizontal, smooth, and circular tube 1000 cm in length that has an inside diameter of 3 cm. The liquid material flows through the tube at a mass rate of 1028 g s−1 and has a density of 0.935 g cm−3 and a viscosity of 1.95 cP. 4.67 A container of a viscous liquid makes contact with an open capillary tube that is vertical. The capillary tube has a diameter of 0.1 mm. The equilibrium rise height of this fluid in the capil- lary was found to be 0.0765 m. How long will it take for the viscous liquid to rise within the capillary tube to a height of 0.069 m? The contact angle of the liquid with the capillary tube is 60°, the viscosity of the liquid is 1 Pa s, and its density is 0.8 g cm−3. 4.68 The equilibrium rise height of a rather viscous fluid in a small capillary tube of diameter equal to 0.1 mm was found to be 65 mm. The contact angle was also measured to be 75°. Estimate the surface tension of this fluid if its viscosity is μ = 0.75 Pa s and ρL = 800 kg m−3. 4.69 A rapid blood bag infusion system is being designed that involves effectively squeezing the bag of blood through a tube (4.0 mm internal diameter with a total length of 2 m) into a vein in the patient’s arm. The blood bag is placed within another pressurizing bag that is pressur- ized with air that squeezes the blood bag at constant pressure. It is desired to empty the bag of blood using this method in 10 seconds. The bag contains 500 mL of blood. What pressure 217 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids (mmHg) is needed in the pressurizing bag to make this possible? Assume the pressure in the patient’s vein is 8 mmHg and that the bag of blood is 0.5 m above the point of entry of the blood into the patient’s arm. The density of blood is 1.06 g cm−3 and its viscosity is 3 cP. Also neglect any frictional losses due to the flow of blood within the blood bag. 4.70 A Newtonian fluid with a viscosity of 1300 cP needs to be pumped through a tube that has an internal diameter of 1.25 mm and a length of 10 cm. If the flow rate of this fluid is 1 cm3 min−1, what is the pressure drop (in mmHg) over the length of the tube that is needed to produce this flow? 4.71 Estimate the radius of a capillary tube (mm) from these measurements taken for the flow of a viscous fluid through the tube: capillary tube length = 50.02 cm, kinematic viscosity = 4.03 × 10−5 m2 s−1, fluid density (ρ) = 0.9552 × 103 kg m−3, pressure drop across the tube in a horizontal position = 4.766 atm, mass flow rate through the tube of the viscous fluid = 0.1798 kg min−1. 4.72 Calculate the pressure drop in mmHg for a fluid flowing within a smooth tube that is 0.8 cm in diameter and 20 cm in length. The fluid velocity in the tube is 200 cm s−1, and the fluid has a density of 1.04 g cm−3 and a kinematic viscosity of 0.04 cm2 s−1. 4.73 Α small bubble of air in water (γ = 0.073 N m−1) has a radius of 0.10 mm. Find the difference in pressure in mmHg between the inside and outside of the bubble. 4.74 A rectangular conduit 200 cm in length is needed to convey water at a flow rate of 18 mL s−1. The conduit cross section has a height of 0.23 cm and a width of 0.45 cm. Calculate the pres- sure drop (mmHg) over the length of the conduit to obtain this flow rate. Assume the kine- matic viscosity (ν) of water is 0.01 cm2 s−1 and its density is 1 g cm−3. 4.75 Water at 16°C (viscosity 1.13 cP and density 1 g cm−3) is pumped from a large lake to the top of a mountain through a 6 in. steel pipe at an average velocity of 10 ft s−1. The inside diameter of this schedule of pipe is 5.501 in. The pipe discharges into the atmosphere at a level 4000 ft above the level in the lake. The pipeline is 5000 ft in total length. You can neglect the pressure loss due to any valves and fittings. The overall efficiency of the pump and its motor is 70%. If electricity costs $.11 per kWh, what will it cost to pump this water for 1 h? 4.76 A commercial size hollow fiber bioreactor contains 1000 tubes, and each fiber has a length of 100 cm and an inside diameter of 6 mm. A Newtonian culture fluid with a density of 1.06 g cm−3 is flowing into the bioreactor at a flow rate of 125 L s−1, and this flow is evenly distrib- uted into each of these fiber tubes. The viscosity of the fluid is 15 cP. Is the flow in each tube laminar or turbulent? Estimate the pressure drop in mmHg across the bioreactor. 4.77 The following data were obtained for the flow of a viscous fluid in a capillary tube: L = 50 cm, μ = 5 cP, Q = 0.3 cm3 s−1, and ΔP = 0.375 mmHg. Estimate the diameter (cm) of this capillary tube from these data. 4.78 A capillary viscometer was used to measure the viscosity of a fluid at room temperature. At a pressure drop per unit length of 0.28 mmHg cm−1, i.e., ΔP/L, the measured flow rate of the fluid through the capillary viscometer was found to be 0.0125 cm3 s−1. When the value of ΔP/L was increased to 0.79 mmHg cm−1, the flow rate of the fluid was found to be .047 cm3 s−1. Under these conditions, is the fluid Newtonian or non-Newtonian? Be sure to justify your answer. 4.79 A fire suppression system (FSS) for a tall building pumps water from a river and delivers the water through a long pipe to where the water flows on top of the water already in a storage tank at the top of the building. When the pump is running, the water flows into the storage tank at 30 L s−1. The water exits the pipe 30 m above the surface of the river. The pipe has an internal diameter of 10 cm. What pumping power (HP) is needed to deliver the water? The viscosity of water is 1 cP and the density of the water is 1 g cm−3. Assume hfriction = 100.32 m2 s−2. 218 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 4.80 An absorbent material is being designed to clean up a toxic liquid material. The surface ten- sion of the toxic material is 0.028 N m−1. The absorbent material has within its structure tiny cylindrical openings that have a diameter of 0.5 mm. The cylindrical openings cover 45% of the absorbent material’s surface. The contact angle (θ) of the toxic substance and the absor- bent material is such that the cos θ = 0.9105. From this information estimate the initial mass flux (grams per second per cm2 of absorbent material) of the toxic material into the absorbent material. The density of the toxic substance is 1.04 g cm−3. 4.81 A polymeric material is being extruded as a very thin ribbon of thickness 3 mm and width 25 mm. As part of the extrusion process, the material is to be treated with an antistatic agent as it leaves the extruder. This antistatic agent wicks into the porous space of the poly- meric material. The radius of the pores in the polymeric material is 5 μm. It is desired that the antistatic agent penetrate 150 μm into the material. Estimate how long will it take for the antistatic agent to enter into the pores of the polymeric material. The antistatic agent has a viscosity of 38 cP and a surface tension of 30 milliN m−1. The cosine of the contact angle, i.e., cos θ, is equal to 0.84. 4.82 An adhesive material was studied in a viscometer. A linear regression equation based on the Casson equation was found to describe the data as tg 12 120 238 77 //..=+\u0000 , where τ is the shear stress in Pa and \u0000g is the shear rate in s−1. An adhesive applicator system is being designed that will dispense this adhesive material through a polymeric tube with an inside diameter of 2.3 mm and a total length of 100 cm. If the pressure drop over the length of this tube is 2000 mmHg, estimate the flow rate of the adhesive material through the tube in cm3 min−1. 4.83 A drug injection system consists of a large chamber (length to diameter ratio = 10) that contains the drug solution and a small catheter tube that goes to the patient. This chamber contains a moving piston that separates the drug containing region from the region of the chamber where air is introduced to pneumatically drive the piston to induce flow of the drug solution. The air is maintained at a constant pressure during the drug injection process. The drug solution is injected into the patient at a flow rate of 10 cm3 s−1 through a catheter tube that has an inner diameter of 1 mm and a length of 15 cm. Also, the drug solution has a viscosity of 0.85 cP and a density of 1.02 g cm−3. The drug is injected into the abdominal cavity of the patient where the local pressure is 0 mmHg gauge. Assume the drug chamber is horizontal and that you can neglect any frictional force developed between the piston and the walls of the chamber containing the drug solution. Also, any pressure losses due to fluid motion within the drug solution chamber are negligible in comparison to the frictional losses within the tubing that leads from the drug solution chamber and into the patient. What air pressure (mmHg) is required to achieve this flow rate of the drug solution? 4.84 Nutrient media is being transferred through a horizontal 2 in. diameter pipe from the feed- stock building to the fermentation building at a flow rate of 60 gal min−1. Pressure gauges are installed in the pipe in each building to monitor the transfer operation. If the length of the transfer pipe between these two pressure gauges is 75 ft, what would be the expected pressure drop in mmHg? At the planned operating conditions the nutrient media has a viscosity of 0.85 cP and a density of 1 g cm−3. 4.85 Experiments on a viscous biological fluid were done in a capillary viscometer having an inter- nal diameter of 1.75 mm. The data for eight experiments when plotted as the volumetric flow rate, Q, versus the pressure drop over the length of the capillary tube, i.e., ΔP/L, showed a 219 The physical and flow properties of blood and other fluids linear relationship between Q and ΔP/L. A regression line through these data with a zero intercept gave a slope of 83.5 mL cm min−1 mmHg−1, and the maximum flow rate for these experiments was Q = 50 mL min−1. Based on this information, estimate the viscosity (μ) of the solution in cP. Assume the density of this solution is about 1 g cm−3. 4.86 The Carreau viscosity model has been shown to describe the apparent viscosity of blood (Lee et al., 2014). mm mm lgapparent n =+ -() + ()é ëê ù ûú¥¥ - 0 2 1 21 \u0000 In this equation, μapparent is the non-Newtonian apparent viscosity of the fluid, n is the power law index, and λ is the relaxation time. μ0 and μ∞ are, respectively, the fluid viscosity at zero shear rate and at infinite shear rate. Using the data shown in Figure 4.5, find the best values of the parameters in the Carreau viscosity model. 4.87 Blood flows through a 75 μm diameter glass tube that is 10 cm in length. This particular blood has a core viscosity of 3.3 cP and a marginal zone layer thickness (or plasma layer) of 2.4 μm, i.e., δ. Estimate the volumetric flow rate of the blood in cm3 h−1 if the pressure difference over the length of the tube is 8000 Pa. The plasma viscosity of this blood is 1.2 cP. 4.88 Using the Carreau viscosity model described in Problem 4.86, if the shear rate on a Carreau fluid is 3 s−1, what is the shear stress on the fluid (Pa)? Use the following values for these parameters given by Lee et al. (2014): μ0 = 0.056 Pa s μ∞ = 0.0035 Pa s λ = 3.313 s n = 0.3568 4.89 A fire suppression system (FSS) at a remote resort in Jasper, Alberta, is being designed to take water from a river and send it through a hose where it exits through a nozzle at a turbulent velocity of 30 m s−1. The pump must be able to deliver 2000 L min−1 of water. The inside diameter of the hose is 0.10 m and the equivalent length of the hose, which includes the losses due to entrance and exit effects, valves, and fittings, is 90 m. Also, the FSS must be able to lift the water 30 m from the river surface to where it exits the nozzle. How much power must the pump in the FSS have to meet these conditions? The viscosity of water is 1 cP and its density is 1 g cm−3. 4.90 Derive Equation A in Example 4.1. 4.91 A capillary viscometer is being used to measure the viscosity of a liquid at 20 C. The capillary tube is 0.01 cm in diameter and has a length of 100 cm. When the pressure drop over the length of this capillary tube was 2 atm, the flow rate of the liquid was found to be 1.0 cm3 h−1. What is the viscosity of the liquid in cP? The density of the liquid is 1.025 g cm−3. 4.92 Two tanks are connected by 300 m of 7.5 cm diameter steel pipe. One of the tanks is open to the atmosphere (tank 2) and the other tank (tank 1) is maintained at an internal pressure of P1. The diameter of each tank is quite large so that the velocities of the liquid surface in each tank is negligible. The fluid in the tanks is a polymeric fluid with a viscosity of 100 cP and a density of 0.80 g cm−3. What should the pressure be in the closed tank, i.e., P1, relative to atmospheric pressure, i.e., P2, so that the flow rate of the oil from tank 1 to tank 2 is 7 kg s−1. Express the pressure in units of mmHg. The surface of the liquid contained in tank 1 lies 9 m below the surface of the liquid in tank 2. 221 Chapter 5 Mass transfer fundamentals 5.1 Description of solute mass transfer In this chapter, we will focus our discussion on the mass transfer of solutes. Our focus is on a homo- geneous solution where a solvent contains the solute of interest. Solute mass transfer occurs both through bulk fluid motion, also known as convection, and by solute diffusion due to the presence of solute concentration gradients. 5.2 Important definitions used in solute mass transfer In order to understand solute transport, we first need to define what we mean by the concentration of the solute in our solution of interest. The concentration of a solute in a solution is the amount of the solute per volume of solution. We can define the amount of the solute in terms of either its mass or by the number of moles. Hence, we have for a given solute, the mass concentration (ρi) or the molar concentration (Ci). The mass concentration for solute i is defined as the mass of solute i(mi) per unit volume (V) of solution, i.e., ρi = mi/V. The molar concentration for solute i is defined as the moles of solute i(ni) per unit volume (V) of solution, or Ci = ni V−1 = ρi MWi -1, where MWi is the solute molecular weight. We can also define the mole fraction of species i, i.e., xi, as the molar concentration of i, i.e., Ci, divided by the total molar concentration of the solution, i.e., C Cii N = =å 1 , where N is the number of components in the solution. Hence, xi = Ci/C. In a similar manner, we can define the mass fraction of species i as ωi = ρi/ρ, where ρ is the mass density of the solution. In order to solve mass transfer problems, we will need to determine the amount of solute trans- ported by convection, i.e., as carried along by the bulk motion of the fluid, and the amount of solute transported by diffusion. We assume that the total transport rate of the solute is the sum of that due to convection and that due to diffusion. We can think of the solute transport by diffusion as being superimposed on the transport of the solute due to the bulk motion of the solution. Now, to understand the role of convection and diffusion on the transport of the solute, it is first convenient to define the mass average velocity and the molar average velocity of the solution, both of which are defined relative to a stationary coordinate system. Also, recall that velocity is a vector and we will denote vectors with the additional decoration of a ~ on top of the symbol used for the vector variable name. The mass average velocity vector for the ith species relative to stationary coordinates is given by \u0000vi. It is important to note that this species velocity is not the velocity of an individual molecule but is the 222 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering average velocity of a very large number of species i molecules within a very small volume of the solution. The mass average velocity vector \u0000v is then defined by \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 v mv m /V /V mv m v i N ii i N i i N ii i N i i N ii i == = = = = = = = å å å å å1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 r NN i i N ii i N ii v v å å å== = =r r r w 1 1 \u0000 \u0000 (5.1) In Equation 5.1 ρi is the mass concentration of species i N is the total number of species in the solution In a similar manner, we can define the molar average velocity vector, \u0000v+, as follows: \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 v nv n /V /V nv n Cv i N ii i N i i N ii i N i i N ii i + = = = = = = == =å å å å å1 1 1 1 11 1 11 1 1 N i i N ii i N ii C Cv C xv å å å== = = \u0000 \u0000 (5.2) In mass transfer, we frequently work in terms of the mass and molar fluxes of species i. The mass and molar flux is defined as the mass or moles of species i that cross a given area per unit time. We can write these mass and molar fluxes, which are also vectors and relative to stationary coordinates, as MassfluxM vii i\u0000 \u0000=r (5.3) Molar flux NC vii i\u0000 \u0000= (5.4) The species mass and molar fluxes can also be written relative to the mass average velocity, i.e., \u0000v, and the molar average velocity, i.e., \u0000v+, as Massfluxj vv andj vvii ii i\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000=-() =-() ++rr (5.5) Molar flux JC vv andJ Cv vii ii ii\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000=-() =-() ++ (5.6) The velocity differences in Equations 5.5 and 5.6, i.e., \u0000\u0000vvi -( ) and \u0000\u0000vvi -() + , are the velocity of spe- cies i relative to the mass and molar average velocity of all the species in the solution, respectively. This relative velocity of species i is the result of the diffusion of that particular species relative to the bulk motion of the solution. The molar flux of species i relative to the molar average velocity, i.e., \u0000Ji +, can be written in terms of the molar flux of species i relative to stationary coordinates, i.e., \u0000Ni, as follows. First, we use Equation 5.2 to eliminate \u0000v+ in Equation 5.6, and then we use Equation 5.4 to replace C vii\u0000 with \u0000Ni. We then obtain \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000J Cv vC vC vC v C C Cv Nxii ii ii ii i j N jj ii j ++ + == =-() =- =- =-å 11 NN jNå \u0000 (5.7) 223 Mass transfer fundamentals 5.2.1 Binary diffusion For most diffusion problems that we will be discussing, we can treat the problem as a two compo- nent or binary system, i.e., the solute, which we will denote by the symbol A, and the solvent, which we will denote by B. In biological systems, the solvent is usually a mixture comprised of a complex collection of other species dissolved in water. This means that, in a strict sense, the diffusivity of A in this complex mixture is really an apparent diffusivity of this solute in the mixture B. Using Equation 5.7, we can then write the molar flux of solute A relative to stationary coordinates as \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000N Jx NNAA AA B=+ +() + (5.8) In Equation 5.8, the term given by xN NAA B\u0000\u0000+() represents the molar flux of solute A due to the convective or bulk flow of the solution. 5.2.2 Fick’s first law Diffusion is the result of the random motion of molecules superimposed on the bulk motion of the fluid itself. In a statistical sense, it is observed that molecules will tend to spread from a region of high concentration to a region of lower concentration. The \u0000JA + term in Equation 5.8 represents the molar flux of A relative to the molar average velocity of the solution, and this is a result of solute diffusion. Recall from Chapter 4 that for laminar flow of a fluid between two parallel plates, we obtained Newton’s law of viscosity to express the momentum transport flux, i.e., τyx, in terms of the velocity gradient, dvx/dy. Hence, we found that tmyx xdv dy =- , where μ was the viscosity of the fluid. The diffusion flux of solute A is analogous to this diffusive transport of momentum, and this is given by Fick’s first law, where \u0000JA + is proportional to the mole fraction gradient, which we can express in three dimensions as \u0000ÑxA, where the mole fraction gradient in Cartesian coordinates is given by \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000Ñ = ¶ ¶ + ¶ ¶ + ¶ ¶ xi x x j x y k x z A AA A (5.9) The proportionality constant in Fick’s first law is called the diffusivity of solute A in solution B, or DAB. The units of diffusivity are typically cm2 s−1. Hence, we can write Fick’s first law as \u0000 \u0000J CD xAABA + =- Ñ (5.10) We can combine Fick’s first law given by Equation 5.10 with Equation 5.8 to obtain the expression for the molar flux of solute A relative to stationary coordinates: \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000N xN NCDxAA AB AB A=+()-Ñ (5.11) Equation 5.11 is our usual starting point for mass transfer problems. In a similar manner, we can also obtain an expression for the mass flux of A relative to stationary coordinates, which is given by \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000M MM DAA AB AB A=+()-Ñwr w (5.12) 224 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 5.2.3 Simplifications of Fick’s first law Many of our problems will also be one dimensional, so we will only need to consider one com- ponent of the molar flux of A, e.g., NAz, where, e.g., z is in the direction of the bulk flow. Hence, Equation 5.11 becomes for one-dimensional mass transfer: N xN NCD dx dz Az AAzBzAB A=+()- (5.13) There are also four common physical situations that will allow for some simplification of Equation 5.11. These are forced convection, a stagnant or quiescent fluid, a dilute solution, and equimolar counterdiffusion. 5.2.3.1 The case of forced convection In some cases, the transport of solute A is dominated by the bulk flow of the solution. This means that the diffusion of A in the direction of the flow, e.g., in the z direction, is much smaller than the amount of A carried along by the flow in the z direction. In this case, Equation 5.13 simplifies to N xN Nx Cv Cv xCvC vAz AAzBzA AAzB Bz Az Az=+() =+() == ++ (5.14) Now, in Equation 5.14, C vAz + is the rate at which the moles of A are passing through a given unit cross section of area that is perpendicular to the molar average velocity, vz +. In the design of a medi- cal device, e.g., this forced convective flow is often occurring within a tube of cross-sectional area, Atube. Hence, we can also say that the molar flux of A in the direction of the flow, i.e., NAz, is the same as the volumetric flow rate of the fluid, i.e., Q, times the molar concentration of A, i.e., CA, divided by the cross-sectional area of the tube, i.e., Atube. Hence, NAz = QCA/Atube. If the x direction is perpen- dicular to the direction of the flow, then in the case of forced convection in the z or axial direction, with negligible axial diffusion, the molar flux of A at some value of x becomes N xC vC vxAz Az Az() == () + (5.15) It is important to remember though that the molar diffusion flux of A (\u0000JA + ) relative to the molar average velocity (\u0000v+) is a vector, and although the z component of this vector can be negligible, the other two components of \u0000JA + may not be negligible. For example, if there were a chemical reaction occurring at the surface of a cylindrical tube that was consuming A, then there will be a significant concentration gradient of A in the radial direction. 5.2.3.2 The case of a stagnant or quiescent fluid If the fluid phase B is not moving, or stagnant, then relative to a stationary coordinate system, \u0000NB = 0. Equation 5.11 then simplifies to \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000N xN CD x x CD xAA AABA A AB A=- Ñ= - - Ñ 1 1 (5.16) If xA is also much smaller than unity, then Equation 5.16 simplifies to \u0000 \u0000N CD xAABA=- Ñ (5.17) 225 Mass transfer fundamentals 5.2.3.3 The case of dilute solutions Oftentimes we have a dilute solution, which means that xA ≪ 1. For example, in biological solutions, the molar concentration of water is 55.6 M. Most solutes of interest will have concentrations that are significantly less than 55.6 M, as we see, e.g., in Table 3.2. So if we had a particular solute with a concentration of 0.1 M, then its mole fraction in this solu- tion would be equal to C CC M MM A Awater+ = + = 01 01 55 6 0 0018 . .. . . This means we can neglect the term, xN NAA B\u0000\u0000+( ), in Equation 5.11. Also, because the solution is dilute, the total concentration, i.e., C, is also constant. With these assumptions, Equation 5.11 becomes \u0000 \u0000\u0000N CD xD CAABA AB A=- Ñ= -Ñ (5.18) Most mass transfer calculations begin with Equation 5.18 and are based therefore on the assumption of a dilute solution. Although this seems like a serious limitation, this assumption of a dilute solution works surprisingly well in most cases. 5.2.3.4 Equimolar counterdiffusion Equimolar counterdiffusion means that for each mole of A that diffuses in a particular direction, a mole of B diffuses in the opposite direction. We see this many times in a chemical reaction occurring at the surface of an object. For example, suppose an enzyme is immobilized on the surface of a solid support. This enzyme catalyzes a simple isomerization of A to form B. The reaction stoichiometry, i.e., A → B, says that for every mole of A that diffuses to the surface, one mole of the reaction product, i.e., B, diffuses away from the surface. This means that \u0000\u0000N NAB=- and Equation 5.11 in this case becomes \u0000 \u0000N CD xAABA=- Ñ (5.19) 5.2.4 Boundary conditions for diffusion problems When we solve a diffusion problem, we will have conditions on the solute concentration that must be satisfied at the boundaries of the region of interest. These are called the boundary conditions and come about because of the physical nature of the situation we are considering. If the concentration of the solute is also changing with time, we also need to know what the concentration distribution in the region of interest is at time equal to zero. This is known as the initial condition (IC). In most cases, the initial concentration of the solute in the region of interest is uniform, and if the solute is not present initially, then its concentration is equal to zero. The boundary conditions specify what we know about the behavior of the solute concentration at the boundaries. There are several types of common boundary conditions that come up in mass transfer problems. 5.2.4.1 Concentration is known at the boundary The first type of boundary condition (BC) is when we know the value of the concentration at the boundary surface. So, e.g., in the following discussion, if we let the y direction extend outward and normal to the boundary, then we can write at the boundary surface C CA y AS= = 0 (5.20) Many times the concentration of solute A at the surface, i.e., CAS, is just the equilibrium solubility of the solute A in B. This means that the solute dissolves very quickly in comparison to the mass 226 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering transfer of the solute into the bulk fluid. Hence, the solute concentration at the boundary surface is constant and equal to its equilibrium solubility in the solvent. If there is a very fast or instantaneous reaction occurring at the surface of a boundary, then the concentration of the reactant is zero at the surface, and we can set CAS = 0. 5.2.4.2 Zero solute flux at the boundary The second situation involves specifying the flux of the solute at a boundary. If a boundary is impermeable to the solute, or if the boundary is a symmetry plane, then the solute flux across this boundary is zero, and from Equation 5.18 for a dilute solu- tion, where we let the y direction extend outward and is normal to the boundary, we have for the y component of the solute flux N D dC dy Ay y AB A y = = =- = 0 0 0. (5.21) 5.2.4.3 Convective transport at the boundary In other cases, as we will discuss later, there can be a fluid that is flowing over the surface. In this case, the mass transfer flux will depend on the nature of this flow over the surface. For this situation, the mass transfer flux of solute A across the surface is proportional to the difference in concentration between the surface, i.e., CAS = CA∙y = 0, and the concentration of A in the bulk solution, i.e., CA bulk. The proportionality constant is called the mass transfer coefficient, km, and will depend on the geometry and the nature of the flow over the surface. The boundary condition at the surface for this case is N D dC dy kC Ck CCAy y AB A y mA y A bulkm AS A bulk= = ==- =-()=-() 0 0 0 (5.22) 5.2.4.4 Chemical reaction at the boundary If there is a chemical reaction occurring at the bound- ary, then at steady state, the molar flux of solute A at the surface has to be equal to the rate of the reaction on the surface. This means N D dC dy kC CRAy y AB A y mASA bulkA= = ²=- =-() =- 0 0 (5.23) where RA ² is the rate of the surface chemical reaction and has typical units like mol cm−2 s−1. RA ² is positive for the consumption of solute A, and the y direction extends outward and normal to the boundary. Equation 5.23 also says that at steady state, the rate of mass transfer of the solute to the surface has to equal the solute reaction rate at the surface. Now let us consider the common situation where the surface reaction can be described by a first order reversible reaction, i.e., A ↔ C. By the law of mass action, the reaction rates are proportional to the concentrations of CA and CC at the surface. The proportionality constants are the first order rate constants for the forward and reverse reactions, i.e., kf and kr. Hence, we can write the surface reaction rate for solute A as Rk Ck CAf AS rCS ¢¢ =- (5.24) 227 Mass transfer fundamentals We can also define the equilibrium constant for the reaction as K C C k k eq CS AS eq f r = æ è ç ö ø ÷ = (5.25) and then we can rewrite Equation 5.24 in terms of the equilibrium constant: Rk C K CAf AS eq CS ¢¢ =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ 1 (5.26) Next, we recognize that in this situation where we have diffusion and a surface chemical reaction, the overall observed rate consists of three steps in series. First, the solute A must diffuse from the bulk solution to the surface, then it reacts at the surface reversibly to produce solute C, and then solute C diffuses back into the bulk solution. The surface reaction rate of solute A is given by Equation 5.26. The diffusion steps can be written in terms of the mass transfer coefficient using Equation 5.22 as N kC C Nk CC Ay y mA A bulkAS Cy y mC CS C bulk = = =-() =-() 0 0 (5.27) Equations 5.26 and 5.27 have been written to have a positive sense for the reaction of solute A. We also recognize that at steady state, NAy, NCy, and RA ² are all the same. If we divide the NCy molar flux in Equation 5.27 by Keq, and then do some algebraic manipulation, we can combine Equations 5.26 and 5.27 and obtain a single equation for NAy, NCy, and RA ² in terms of the bulk concentrations of solutes A and C, N NR KC C K Ay y Cy y AA bulk C bulk eq == ²== =- æ è ç ö ø ÷00 (5.28) where K is the overall rate constant and includes the effects of both solute diffusion and the surface reaction rate on the observed transport rate of solutes A and C. The overall rate constant is given by 11 11 Kk kK kmA feqmC =+ + (5.29) Each term on the right-hand side of Equation 5.29 represents a resistance, and in analogy to an electric circuit, we see that the overall resistance, represented by 1/K, is equal to the sum of the individual resistances due to the mass transfer of solutes A and C and the surface chemical reaction. There are also some special cases that need to be considered. First, suppose the mass transfer rates are very high, e.g., the bulk fluid is moving very fast, or being mixed very well. In this case, which is called reaction controlling, the mass transfer coefficients, i.e., kmA and kmC, are much larger than the reaction rate constant, kf. In this case, Equation 5.28 becomes N NR kC C K Ay y Cy y Af A bulk C bulk eq == ²== =- æ è ç ö ø ÷00 (5.30) 228 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering If the reaction rate is very fast, then we have the situation of mass transfer controlling, and we can write Equation 5.28 as N NR kK k C C K Ay y Cy y A mA eq mC A bulk C bulk eq == ²== = + æ è ç çç ö ø ÷ ÷÷ - æ 00 1 11 èè ç ö ø ÷ (5.31) If the reaction is also irreversible and very fast, i.e., Keq is really big, then Equation 5.31 becomes N NR kC kCAy y Cy y AmAA bulkmAA bulk== ²== =-() = 00 0 (5.32) Here, we see that the observed reaction rate is just the mass transfer rate of solute A to the surface. Also, since the surface reaction rate is also very fast, the surface concentration of solute A is equal to zero. Finally, for the special case of a finite irreversible reaction, Equation 5.28 becomes N NR kk CAy y Cy y A mA f A bulk== ²== = + æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷00 1 11 (5.33) 5.3 Estimating the diffusivity To solve diffusion problems, we will also need to know the diffusivity of the solute, i.e., DAB. The diffusivity typically has units of cm2 s−1 or m2 s−1. The solute diffusivity generally depends on the size of the solute, its concentration, the temperature and pressure, and the physical properties of the fluid or material in which the solute is diffusing. The value of the diffusivity for a given solute is best found from experimental data. Literature searches can be used to see if the diffusivity has been determined for a particular solute. Cussler (1984) and Tyn and Gusek (1990) also provide data on the diffusivity for a variety of solutes. However, many times, experimental data do not exist for the solute and medium of interest, and performing experiments to measure the solute diffusivity can be time consuming and expensive. Hence, we must resort to methods that allow us to estimate the diffusivity. Cussler (1984) and Bird et  al. (2002) summarize methods for estimating diffusivities in gases, liquids, and solids. Young et al. (1980) have also developed a correlation for estimating the diffusivity of proteins. For gases, the diffusivity is on the order of 0.1 to 1.0 cm2 s−1. According to the Chapman-Enskog the- ory of solute diffusion in a gas (Cussler, 1984), the diffusivity of the solute is inversely proportional to the pressure and directly proportional to the temperature in K to the nth power, i.e., D T P AB n µ , where n ranges from 1.5 to 1.8. If a gas diffusivity is known at conditions (T1, P1), then its value at conditions (T2, P2) can be estimated by DD P P T T AB AB n 21 1 2 2 1 = æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ (5.34) where the temperature is absolute. 229 Mass transfer fundamentals In liquids such as water, the diffusivity is around 10−5 cm2 s−1 for molecules with a MW on the order of 100. For example, the diffusivity of oxygen in water at 37°C was found to be 2.76 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 (Yoshida and Ohshima, 1966), and at 25°C the value is 2.1 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 (Cussler, 1984). For large macromolecules like a polypeptide, the diffusivity in water is on the order of 10−6 cm2 s−1, and protein molecules can have a diffusivity in water on the order of 10−7 cm2 s−1. In polymers, the diffusivity is on the order of 10−8 cm2 s−1, and in solids the diffusivity can be as low as 10−10 cm2 s−1. Figure 5.1 presents a plot of diffusivity data (Renkin and Curry, 1979) for a variety of solutes in dilute aqueous solutions at 37°C as a function of solute MW. Note that the diffusivity for the data shown in this figure has been multiplied by 105. The solid line through the data is the result of a linear least squares regression. The following empirical equation based on the data in Figure 5.1 provides a useful relationship for estimating the diffusivity of a solute in water at 37°C knowing only the MW of the solute. DMWcmsAB =´ () - - -1 013 10 4 46 21., . (5.35) 5.3.1 Stokes-Einstein equation The diffusivity of a solute in a dilute liquid solution can also be estimated from the Stokes-Einstein equation (Einstein, 1956; Cussler, 1984; Bird et al., 2002). We assume that the solute can be repre- sented as a solid sphere of radius a moving through a continuous solvent phase where we assume that the solvent molecules are much smaller than the solute molecules. The steady motion of the solute molecule represents a balance between the drag force exerted on the solute molecule as the solvent flows across its surface and the force exerted on the solute molecule due to its concentration gradient (Einstein, 1956). For a spherical object of radius a moving slowly through a quiescent fluid, Stokes law (Bird et al., 2002) says that the drag force on the object, i.e., Fdrag, is given by 6πμav∞, where μ is the fluid 10 10 100 1,000 10,000 Solute molecular weightDiffusivity×105, cm2 s−1 100,000 1,000,000 1 0.1 0.01 Figure 5.1 Solute diffusivity in water at 37°C. (Based on data from Renkin, E.M. and Curry, F.E., Transport of water and solutes across capillary endothelium, in: Membrane Transport in Biology, vol. 4, Giebisch, G. and Tosteson, D.C. (eds.), Springer-Verlag, New York, 1979, Chapter 1.) 230 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering viscosity and v∞ is the velocity of the spherical object relative to that of the solvent. In terms of the velocity of the solute molecule, we then have v F a drag ¥ = 6pm (5.36) Now if we focus on the steady motion of solute A in the x direction only, then to balance the drag force on the solute molecule, Einstein (1956) showed that the gradient of the osmotic pressure of the solute, i.e., - d dx P , is equal to the force per unit volume of solution exerted on the solute molecules that causes their motion in the x direction. We can express this force on each solute molecule as F NC d dx RT NC dC dx N d dxAA AA A A A ideal solution =- =- =- 11Pm (5.37) where NA is Avogadro’s number and we have used van’t Hoff’s law, i.e., Equation 2.147, to replace Π with RTCA. Then, using Equation 2.75, we see that this force is also equal to the chemical poten- tial gradient, assuming we have an ideal dilute solution. Substituting Equation 5.37 for Fdrag in Equation 5.36, we obtain v RT aN C dC dxAA A ¥ =- 6 1 pm (5.38) If the solute concentration at some position x is CA, then by Equation 5.4, the molar flux of solute A relative to stationary coordinates, i.e., NAx, is given by v∞CA; hence, we have using Equation 5.38 that N RT aN dC dx Ax A A=- 6pm (5.39) For a dilute solution, Equation 5.18 says that N D dC dx Ax AB A=- , and comparing this with the result given by Equation 5.39, we obtain the Stokes-Einstein equation for the diffusivity: D RT aN AB A = 6pm (5.40) In Equation 5.40 R is the ideal gas constant T is the absolute temperature a is the solute radius NA is Avogadro’s number (6.023 × 1023 mol−1) μ is the solution viscosity For solute diffusion in water, the viscosity is 0.691 cP at 37°C, 0.89 cP at 25°C, and 1.002 cP at 20°C. For solute diffusion in plasma, the viscosity at 37°C is 1.2 cP. Recall that 1cP = 1 centipoise = 0.01 g cm−1 s−1 = 0.001 Pa s. 231 Mass transfer fundamentals If the diffusivity for a solute in a given solvent is known, then Equation 5.40 can also be used to obtain an estimate of the molecular radius (a) of the solute. This value is known as the Stokes- Einstein radius. If the radius of the solute, i.e., a, is not known, it can be estimated from its MW by the following equation. This equation assumes that a molecule of the solute is a sphere with a density (ρ ≈ 1 g cm−3) equal to that of the solute in the solid phase. a MW NA = æ è ç ö ø ÷ 3 4 13 pr / (5.41) If we use Equation 5.41 to find the solute radius and use this in the Stokes-Einstein equation, i.e., Equation 5.40, we find that the diffusivity, i.e., DAB, is directly proportional to the following quan- tity, i.e., T MWm 13/ . In the paper by Young et al. (1980), the proportionality constant was found by analyzing the measured diffusivity of 143 proteins. For DAB in cm2 s−1, the proportionality constant was found to be 8.34 × 10−8, with the solution viscosity in cP, the temperature in absolute K, and the MW in g mol−1. If the solute diffusivity in a liquid is known at conditions (T1, μ1), then its value at conditions (T2, μ2) can be estimated from Equation 5.40 as shown next: DD T T AB AB21 1 2 2 1 = æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ m m (5.42) Example 5.1 Using the Stokes-Einstein equation, estimate the diffusivity of ovalbumin (MW = 45,000) in water at 25°C. Cussler (1984) reports a value for the diffusivity of ovalbumin of 7.8 × 10−7 cm2 s−1. Also estimate the ovalbumin diffusivity using the correlation developed by Young et al. (1980), i.e., D T MW AB =´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ -83410 8 13. /m . The viscosity of water at 25°C is 0.89 cP.

This would make the diffusivity of the solvated solute smaller than the value calculated from the Stokes-Einstein equation. The Young et al. (1980) correlation gives a diffusivity for ovalbumin that compares very well with the value reported by Cussler (1984). Example 5.2 Estimate the diffusivity of oxygen in water at 25°C. The oxygen diffusivity in water at 37°C was found to be 2.76 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 by Yoshida and Ohshima (1966). Solution We can use Equation 5.42, which is based on the Stokes-Einstein equation (Equation 5.40), to estimate the diffusivity of oxygen in water at 25°C. The viscosity of water is 0.691 cP at 37°C and 0.89 cP at 25°C. Hence, we calculate the oxygen diffusivity as follows: DcmsAB C25 52 1527610 691 89 298 310 20610 ° =´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ =´ -- -. . . .ccm s 21- The value for the oxygen diffusivity in water at 25°C is reported to be 2.1 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 (Cussler, 1984). 5.4 Fick’s second law Consider the situation shown in Figure 5.2. The surface of a semi-infinite plate of length L in the x direction contains a solute that maintains a constant concentration, CAS, along the surface of the plate at y = 0. At t = 0, this surface is contacted with a stagnant medium that has a uniform initial x y t= 0t >> 0t> 0 Plate makes contact Solute diffuses into surroundings CAS CAS CAS y y+ \u0000y CA0 CA0 CA0 Figure 5.2 Solute concentration in the vicinity of a flat plate of constant surface concentration. 233 Mass transfer fundamentals concentration of the solute equal to CA0, and we assume, e.g., that CAS > CA0. The solute therefore diffuses from the surface of the plate into the stagnant medium. As time progresses, the solute will penetrate more and more into the stagnant medium. Figure 5.2 shows a thin slice of fluid of thickness Δy, with a surface area normal to the y direction of S, giving a shell volume of S Δy. The rate at which the solute enters and leaves this thin shell volume by diffusion at y and y + Δy is given by our one-dimensional diffusion equation, i.e., Equation 5.13, written here in terms of the y component of the diffusion flux, i.e., NAy. N xN NCD dx dy Ay AAyByAB A=+()- (5.43) Assuming a dilute medium, Equation 5.43 simplifies to N CD dx dy Ay AB A=- (5.44) Now, we perform an unsteady solute mass balance on our shell volume equal to SΔy. We can then write, using Equation 1.8 as our guide, that S y C t NS NS SCD x y CD x y A Ay y Ay yy AB A y AB A yy D D D ¶ ¶ =- =- ¶ ¶ -- ¶ ¶ æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ + + ÷÷ (5.45) The term on the left of the first equal sign in Equation 5.45 represents the accumulation of the sol- ute within the control volume S Δy. The terms on the right of this equal sign express the net rate at which the solute enters the control volume by diffusion according to Fick’s first law. We can elimi- nate S in Equation 5.45, and after dividing by Δy, taking the limit as Δy → 0, and assuming that DAB and C are constant, we obtain the following result that is known as Fick’s second law: ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ C t D C y A AB A 2 2 (5.46) Equation 5.46 is the one-dimensional form of Fick’s second law, which describes solute diffusion in a stagnant or quiescent medium. Equation 5.46 can be extended to give Fick’s second law in three dimensions, and other coordinate systems such as Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical, by recognizing that the second derivative of CA with respect to y can be generalized as the Laplacian of the scalar CA. Hence, Equation 5.46 can be written in terms of the Laplacian operator as ¶ ¶ =Ñ C t DC A AB A 2 (5.47) The Laplacian operator for scalar variable s in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates is shown next: Cartesian coordinates x, y, z s s x s y s z () Ñ= ¶ ¶ + ¶ ¶ + ¶ ¶ 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 (5.48) 234 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Cylindrical coordinatesr, , z s rr r s rr s q() Ñ= ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶2 2 211 ¶¶ + ¶ ¶J 2 2 2 s z (5.49) Spherical coordinatesr,, s rr r s rr qf J () Ñ= ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶2 2 2 2 11 sin ¶¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶ ¶J J JJ f sin sin s r s1 22 2 2 (5.50) 5.5 Some solutions to Fick’s second law Next, we will consider several cases where we can obtain an analytical solution to Fick’s second law as given by Equation 5.47. 5.5.1 Solution for the concentration profile for diffusion from a flat plate into a semi-infinite stagnant medium Equation 5.46 describes the situation in Figure 5.2, and we can obtain a solution in terms of the con- centration relative to CA0. We can also write the following initial condition and boundary conditions for solute A within the stagnant medium: IC tC C BC yC C BC yC C AA AAS AA :, :, :, == == =¥ = 0 10 2 0 0 (5.51) Next, we let θ = CA – CA0, and Equations 5.46 and 5.51 then become in terms of θ ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ qq t D y AB 2 2 (5.52) and IC t BC yC C BC y SASA :, :, :, == == - =¥ = 00 10 20 0 q q q (5.53) Equations 5.52 and 5.53 are analogous to the problem we examined in Chapter 4 for the flat plate that is set in motion within a semi-infinite fluid, which is described by Equations 4.51 and 4.52. In that case, we used Laplace transforms to obtain a solution for the unsteady velocity profile within the fluid, i.e., vx(y,t). We can therefore use that result here, i.e., Equation 4.59, by simply recogniz- ing that we can replace vx with θ, V with θS, and the kinematic viscosity, ν, by the diffusivity, DAB. Hence, we obtain the following result for the concentration profile within a stagnant semi-infinite medium, at any location y, and time t: q q y, tC y, tC CC erfc y Dt erf y DtS AA AS A AB AB () = ()- - = æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ =- 0 0 4 1 4 ææ è çç ö ø ÷÷ (5.54) 235 Mass transfer fundamentals We can also define a concentration boundary layer thickness, δC, as that distance where the relative concentration, i.e., qd q C S ,t(), has decreased to 1% of the value at the surface of the plate. Recall from Chapter 4 that the complementary error function (erfc) of y DtAB4 1 821= . provides a value of θ/θS that is equal to 0.01. Hence, we can define the concentration boundary layer thickness, δC, as follows: dCABABtD tD t() =»3 642 4. (5.55) The value of δC can also be interpreted as the distance to which the solute from the plate has pen- etrated into the fluid at time t. Note that this penetration distance is proportional to the square root of time. This result also tells us that the characteristic time for the diffusion of a solute, i.e., τdiffusion, is proportional to the square of a characteristic dimension, i.e., L, divided by the solute diffusivity, i.e., tdiffusion AB L D µ 2 . Example 5.3 Calculate the concentration boundary layer thickness 1 second after the plate has made contact with the medium. Assume that the medium is water and that the solute diffusivity is DAB = 1 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. Solution Using Equation 5.55, we can calculate the thickness of the concentration boundary layer as shown below: dmC cm ss cm m=´ == --4101 0 0126 126 52 1 . Example 5.4 A polymeric material is being used as a barrier for a protective garment. The polymeric mate- rial has a thickness of 0.075 in. For a particular toxic agent, the diffusivity in this material was found to be equal to 1 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. If the protective garment comes into contact with the toxic agent, estimate the time it will take for the toxic agent to just penetrate the garment. Solution Assume that there is no toxic agent within the material before contact is made. Hence, CA0 = 0. We can then use Equation 5.54 to estimate the breakthrough time, assuming that CA/CAS = 0.001 is a reasonable criterion for breakthrough of the toxic agent. Hence, we have that erf y DtAB4 10 001 0 999 æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ =- =.. From this equation, we have for this case that the erf (2.327) = 0.999. Therefore, y Dt in cm in cm stAB4 2 327 0 075 254 41 10 1 62 1 == ´ ´´ ´ - -- . .. .. Solving for the time, we get that t = 1675 s or 28 min. 236 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 5.5.1.1 Calculation of the solute flux at the surface of the plate The flux of solute diffusing at any location y for the situation shown in Figure 5.2 is given by Equation 5.43 for this one-dimensional problem. Assuming we also have a dilute solution, then Equation 5.43 at the plate surface becomes N D dC dy Ay y AB A y = = =- 0 0 (5.56) We can find ¶ ¶ C y A y=0 by differentiating Equation 5.54 with respect to y and evaluating this result at y = 0. We find for this case that N CC D Dt Ay y AS AAB AB = = -() 0 0 p (5.57) If CAS > CA0, then the diffusion flux is from the surface of the plate into the medium. Letting S be the area normal to the y direction, the total amount of solute taken up by the medium at any time t, i.e., M(t), can be found by integrating Equation 5.57 with respect to time. The result is given by M tS NdtC CS Dt t A y AS A AB() == -() æ è ç ö ø ÷ò = 0 0 0 12 2 p / (5.58) If CAS < CA0, then the diffusion flux is from the medium to the surface of the plate. In this case, Equation 5.57 still applies; however, the flux will carry a negative sign because the direction of this flux is opposite to the y direction. The total amount of solute removed from the medium in this case is still given by Equation 5.58, with the understanding that the negative sign in this case represents loss of the solute from the medium to the surface. 5.5.2 Solution for the concentration profile for diffusion from a planar source into an infinite stagnant medium Now consider in Figure 5.3 that the surface at y = 0 initially contains a finite amount of solute A contained within an infinitesimally thin planar volume at y = 0. As time progresses, solute A spreads –y y x z Stagnant medium Figure 5.3 A very thin planar surface of area S containing a finite amount of solute A surrounded by a stagnant medium. 237 Mass transfer fundamentals by diffusion into the stagnant medium, and in this case, we let the medium be symmetrical about the plane y = 0, so this means the medium now extends in both the +y and the –y directions. Once again we can use Fick’s second law to describe this one-dimensional diffusion of solute A into the medium. ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ C t D C y A AB A 2 2 (5.59) The initial condition and the boundary conditions are given next. Here, we assume that solute A is not present initially in the surrounding medium. IC tC BC yC BC yC A A A :, :, :, == =¥ = =-¥= 00 10 20 (5.60) The following equation can be shown to be a general solution to Equation 5.59: C y,t N t y Dt A AB () =- æ è ç ö ø ÷exp 2 4 (5.61) In Equation 5.61, N is an arbitrary constant, and we also note that this solution is symmetrical about the plane y = 0 and tends to zero as y goes to infinity in either the +y or –y directions. Letting S denote the surface area normal to the y direction, the total amount of solute A in the medium at time t, i.e., M(t), is given by M tS C y,t dyA() = () -¥ ¥ ò (5.62) Substituting Equation 5.61 into Equation 5.62 for CA(y,t), we obtain M t SN t y Dt dy AB () =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ -¥ ¥ ò exp 2 4 (5.63) Now in Equation 5.63, we let z y DtAB 2 2 4 = , which also gives dyD tdzAB= 2 , and substituting these relationships into Equation 5.63, we have M tSND zdzAB() =-() -¥ ¥ ò 2 2exp (5.64) The integral term in Equation 5.64 is a form of the Gaussian integral and is equal to p. Therefore, Equation 5.64 becomes M tSNDAB() = 2 p (5.65) 238 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Equation 5.65 gives the interesting result that the amount of solute A within the medium at any time t is a constant and must therefore be equal to the original amount deposited on the area S on the plane at y = 0, i.e., M0. This means that we can use Equation 5.65 to solve for the value of the arbitrary constant we denoted earlier by N in Equation 5.61, which gives N M SDAB = 0 2 p , and with this result, Equation 5.61 becomes C y, t M SD t y Dt A AB AB () =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ 0 2 2 4p exp (5.66) Equation 5.66 is also known as a Gaussian distribution and gives the concentration of solute A in the medium for any value of y and t. The total width of the distribution will broaden with time, and we let δC represent the distance into the medium to which the solute has just penetrated; hence, dCABDt= 4 (5.67) 5.5.3 Solution for the concentration profile for diffusion from a point source into an infinite planar stagnant medium Now let us consider the solution for the diffusion of a solute from a point source on the planar surface of an infinite stagnant medium, which is shown in Figure 5.4. In a Cartesian coordinate sys- tem, this planar surface exists at z = 0 and extends in both the –x, x and –y, y directions. The point source, defined at x = 0 and y = 0, initially contains a finite amount of solute A deposited upon an infinitesimally small area. We define CA as the amount of solute A per unit surface area. As time progresses, solute A spreads by diffusion into the plane of the stagnant medium in both the –x, x and –y, y directions. We can write Fick’s second law in two dimensions for a dilute solution to describe the diffusion of solute A into the surrounding planar medium. ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ + ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ C t D C x C y A AB AA 2 2 2 2 (5.68) –z z x y –y –x Figure 5.4 Diffusion from a point source located at (0,0,0) on an infinite planar surface at z = 0. 239 Mass transfer fundamentals The initial condition and the boundary conditions are given next.

The total amount of solute A in the medium at time t, i.e., M(t), is given by M tC x, y, tdxdyA() = () -¥ ¥ -¥ ¥ òò (5.71) Substituting Equation 5.70 into Equation 5.71 for CA(x, y, t), and integrating, we obtain M tNDAB() = 4p (5.72) Equation 5.72 shows that the amount of solute A within the medium at any time t is a constant and must therefore be equal to the original amount deposited at the point source located at x = 0 and y = 0, i.e., M0. Hence, we have that N M DAB = 0 4p , and using this result, Equation 5.70 becomes C r, t M Dt r Dt A AB AB () =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ 0 2 44p exp (5.73) where r is the radial distance from the point source, i.e., r xy=+ 22 . Example 5.5 An interesting application of Equation 5.73 is its use to describe the dispersal of an insect population (Kareiva, 1983). As we have been discussing, diffusion is the result of the random motion of molecules, and molecules will tend to spread from a region of high concentration to a region of lower concentration. The same can be said about the movement of an insect population. Insects will move in a random walk from where they are at a high concentration to a location where their numbers are lower. This random walk of an insect population can be shown to be described by Fick’s second law of diffusion (Phillips et al., 2013). In this case, 240 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering we let CA represent the population density, i.e., the number of insects per unit area, and DAB is the insect diffusivity. M0 represents the initial number of insects at the point source. Suppose 1000 Trirhabda virgata, a leaf beetle, are placed on a goldenrod. Kareiva (1983) gives a dif- fusivity for this beetle of 0.41 m2 day−1. After 14 days, what radial distance from the point source on the goldenrod will contain 95% of these beetles? Assume that all of the beetles are still alive. Solution The number of beetles confined within a circle of radius R at some time t is given by M R,tC r,trdr R A() = ()ò 2 0 p When Equation 5.73 is substituted into the previous equation, we obtain after integration M R,tM e R DtAB() =- æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ - 0 41 2 (A) Equation A can then be solved for R: RD t MR,t M AB=- - ()é ë ê ê ù û ú ú ì í ï îï ü ý ï þï 41 0 12 ln / With MR,t M () = 0 095. and DAB = 0.41 m2 day−1, we can solve the above equation for the value of R at 14 days: Rm daydaysm=´ ´´ --(){} = -40 41 14 10 95 829 21 12 .ln. . / 5.6 The mass transfer coefficient The solution of many diffusion problems is facilitated through the use of the mass transfer coef- ficient, km. This is especially true for problems where there is both convection and diffusion, which means the solute is diffusing through a fluid that is also flowing. The mass transfer coefficient is used to calculate the solute flux at the surface of a boundary and was defined earlier by Equation 5.22: N D dC dy kC Ck CCAy y AB A y mA y A bulkm AS A bulk= = ==- =-()=-() 0 0 0 (5.74) The mass transfer coefficient, i.e., km, can be thought of as the proportionality constant that relates the flux of the solute at a boundary surface, i.e., NAy∣y = 0, to the overall concentration driving force, 241 Mass transfer fundamentals i.e., (CA∣y = 0 − CA bulk) = (CAS − CA bulk), where CAS is the solute concentration at the surface and CA bulk is the solute concentration in the flowing medium. The total mass transfer rate of the solute from a surface, i.e., \u0000mA, is given by the product of the solute flux, i.e., km (CAS – CA bulk), and the surface area normal to that solute flux, i.e., S: \u0000m kS CCAm AS A bulk=-() (5.75) The solution of most mass transfer problems will begin with Equation 5.75 and involves solving for one of the variables in this equation. 5.6.1 The Sherwood number The mass transfer coefficient is usually expressed in terms of the dimensionless group known as the Sherwood number (Sh). The Sherwood number is the ratio of the transport rate of the solute by convection to that by diffusion and is defined as Sh kL D m AB = , where L is a characteristic length. For example, for convective mass transfer within a cylindrical tube, the characteristic length is the tube diameter, dtube. The mass transfer coefficient, and hence the Sherwood number, is usually found from engineering correlations that are based on mass transfer experiments. However, there are special situations where an analytical solution for the mass transfer coefficient and the Sherwood number can be obtained. These situations usually have well-defined geometries and laminar flow of the fluid. We will now take a closer look at several situations where an analytical solution can be found for the mass trans- fer coefficient and the Sherwood number. 5.7 Diffusion from a flat plate into a semi-infinite stagnant medium Recall the problem considered in Section 5.5.1, i.e., solute diffusion from a flat plate into a semi- infinite stagnant medium shown in Figure 5.2. Equation 5.57 gave the flux of solute A at the surface of the flat plate as N CC D Dt Ay y AS AAB AB = = -() 0 0 p (5.76) Comparing Equation 5.76 with Equation 5.74, and recognizing that (CA∣y = 0 − CA bulk) = (CAS – CA0), we see that the mass transfer coefficient is then given by k D Dt D t m AB AB AB C == ()ppd 4 (5.77) where we recall from Equation 5.55 that dCABtD t() = 4 . For this unsteady diffusion problem shown in Figure 5.2, we see that the mass transfer coefficient is not constant but decreases as the concentration boundary layer thickness, i.e., δC(t), increases over time. 242 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 5.7.1 Film theory From Equation 5.77, we also see that the mass transfer coefficient is directly proportional to the solute diffusivity and inversely proportional to the concentration boundary layer thickness. This shows us that the mass transfer coefficient can be thought of as the solute diffusivity divided by the thickness of a thin film of the medium over which the concentration change occurs, i.e., (CA∣y = 0 − CA bulk) = (CAS – CA0). Hence, this so-called film theory of diffusion says that the mass transfer coefficient is given by k D m AB film = d (5.78) where in this case for the diffusion of the solute from a flat plate into a stagnant medium, the film thickness, i.e., δfilm, from Equation 5.77 is equal to 1 4 pdC t(). The film thickness will depend on the geometry and the physical properties of the medium through which the solute is diffusing and will be affected by the bulk flow of the medium. Recall from lami- nar boundary layer flow over a flat plate that the boundary layer thickness, i.e., δ(x), is inversely proportional to the square root of the local Reynolds number (see Equation 4.73). Hence, we would expect that as the bulk flow rate, or the free stream velocity, increases, which gives a higher Reynolds number, the film thickness (δfilm) should decrease in a manner similar to that of the momentum boundary layer thickness. This will increase the mass transfer coefficient and, by Equation 5.75, the solute mass transfer rate. This will be shown to be the case when we look at mass transfer in laminar boundary flow over a flat plate in Section 5.9.3. Although film theory gives us some insight into the nature of the mass transfer coefficient, it really just lumps everything into a new unknown quantity, the film thickness. Example 5.6 Calculate the value of the mass transfer coefficient for the situation described in Example 5.3. Solution Using Equation 5.77, and the concentration boundary layer thickness of 0.0126 cm after 1 s of contact, we can calculate the mass transfer coefficient as shown below: k D Dt D t cm s cm cm sm AB AB AB C == () = ´ ´ = -- - ppdp 44 10 0 0126 0 0018 52 1 1 . . Example 5.7 A flat plate is coated with a layer of a volatile material. Air flows along the surface of the plate. After 12 days, it is found that the thickness of the layer of volatile material has decreased by 1 mm. Estimate the mass transfer coefficient and the mass transfer film thickness. The satura- tion concentration of the volatile material in air for these conditions is 1.85 × 10−9 mol cm−3, and its diffusivity in air is 0.068 cm2 s−1. The density of the volatile material as coated on the flat plate is 1.21 g cm−3, and its MW is 140.2. 243 Mass transfer fundamentals Solution We assume that the evaporation of the volatile material from the plate surface does not affect the mass transfer process. Also, the concentration of the volatile material in the bulk air is negligible in comparison to the saturation concentration. The mass transfer rate of the volatile material is then given by Equation 5.75, i.e., \u0000m kS CAm AS=-()0 (A) In this case, we can choose as a basis for our calculation that S = 1 cm2 of the plate surface. Over the 12-day period of time, we lose 1 mm of volatile material from the plate surface; hence, the mass of volatile material that is lost from the surface of the plate is given by the product of the volume of this lost material and its density, i.e., M mm Smm cm mm cm gcmglost =´ ´= ´´ ´= -11 1 10 11 21 0 121 23r .. The mass transfer rate is then given by the mass lost divided by the length of time: \u0000m M days g days hday sh gA lost== ´´ =´ -- - 12 0 121 12 24 3600 1 167 10 11 7. .ss-1 We can then calculate the value of km from Equation A: k m SC gs cm molcmg m m A AS = -() = ´ ´´ ´ -- -- \u0000 0 1 167 10 11 85 10 140 2 71 29 3 . .. ool cm s - -= 1 1045.

The concentration of the solute at the surface of the sphere is given by CAS, and its concentration far from the surface of the sphere is CA∞. We can use Fick’s second law given by Equation 5.47 for a dilute solution, which says for this steady-state situation that ∇2CA = 0. Using Equation 5.50 to express the Laplacian of CA in spherical coordinates, and recognizing that diffusion is only in the radial direction, we get the following differential equation for the solute concentration (CA) in the fluid surrounding the sphere: d dr r dC dr A2 0 æ è ç ö ø ÷ = (5.79) 244 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The boundary conditions for the previous equation are BC rR CC BC rC C AAS AA 1 2:, :, == =¥ = ¥ (5.80) If the differential equation given by Equation 5.79 is integrated twice, we then obtain C r C r CA () =- + 1 2 (5.81) Applying the boundary conditions to this equation allows us to find the integration constants C1 and C2. Hence, it is easily shown that C2 = CA∞ and C1 = R(CA∞ − CAS). With these constants, the concentration profile and its first derivative in the fluid surrounding the sphere are given by C rC CC R r dC dr CC R r AA AAS A AAS () =- -() =-() ¥¥ ¥ 2 (5.82) From Equation 5.74, we can next write the solute flux at the surface of the sphere as N D dC dr kC CAr rR AB A rR mASA= = ¥=- =-() (5.83) However, from Equation 5.82, -= - = ¥dC dr CC R A rR AS A , and when this is substituted into Equation 5.83 for - = dC dr A rR, we obtain the result that k D R m AB= . When this result is rearranged with the character- istic length based on the sphere diameter (dsphere = 2R), we find that the Sherwood number is equal to 2 for the case of steady diffusion of a solute from the surface of a sphere into a quiescent fluid, i.e., Sh kd D msphere AB == 2 (5.84) Example 5.8 A drug has an equilibrium solubility in water of 1.5 g L−1. The diffusivity of the drug in water is 0.6 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. One gram of the drug is made into particles that are 0.1 cm in diameter, and these particles have a density of 1.15 g cm−3. These particles are then vigorously mixed in a stirred vessel containing 1 L of water. After mixing for 10 min, the drug concentration in the solution was 0.03 g L−1. Estimate the value of the mass transfer coefficient (cm s−1) for the drug under these conditions. Also find the Sherwood number (Sh). Assume that the particle size does not change significantly during the 10 min. Solution The concentration of the drug at the surface of the particles is equal to the equilibrium solubil- ity of the drug in water, which is equal to 1.5 g L−1. This is CAS in Equation 5.75. The concen- tration of the drug dissolved in the solution, i.e., CA bulk, starts at 0 g L−1 and increases after 245 Mass transfer fundamentals 10 min to 0.03 g L−1. Although CA bulk is changing with time, which means the mass transfer driving force, i.e., (CAS – CA bulk), is also changing with time, we can approximate CA bulk in Equation 5.75 by the average of these values, or 0.015 g L−1, since CA bulk ≪ CAS. The total amount of drug that was dissolved over the 10 min period is equal to 0.03 g L−1 × 1 L = 0.03 g. The average dissolution rate is therefore 0.03 g of drug in 10 min or 5.0 × 10−5 g s−1. The dis- solution rate of the drug ( \u0000mA) is then given by Equation 5.75, where the total area available for mass transfer is equal to the number of particles in the solution (Nparticles) times the surface area of a single particle (Sparticle). \u0000m kN SC Ck NSAm particlesparticle AS A bulkm particlesparticl=-() = ee gL gs´-() =´ -- -15 0 015 50 10 15 1.. . The area of a single drug particle is given by 4πR2, where R is the particle radius. Hence, we find that Sparticle = 0.0314 cm2. The number of particles can be found by dividing the mass of drug placed into the solution by the drug density, which gives the total volume of particles, and then dividing this result by the volume of a given particle. When this is done, it is found that 1 g of the drug is equivalent to 1661 particles. With these parameters found, the previous equation can now be solved for the mass transfer coefficient as follows: k gs gL L cm particles cm m = ´ ´ ´ ´ -- - 50 10 1 485 1 1000 1 1661 0 0314 51 1 3 . . . 22 4164610 particle cm s=´ --. The Sherwood number is calculated as Sh kd D cm scm cm s mparticle AB == ´´ ´ = -- - 646100 1 06 10 10 76 41 52 .. . . In this case, the Sh is greater than 2 indicating that solute transport from the drug particles is a result of convection and diffusion. Example 5.9 In Example 5.8, the concentration of drug dissolved in the solution, i.e., CA bulk, starts at 0 g L−1 and increases after 10 min to 0.03 g L−1. Thus, CA bulk is changing with time, which means the mass transfer driving force, i.e., (CAS – CA bulk), is also changing with time. However, in Example 5.8, we approximated CA bulk in Equation 5.75 by the average of the initial bulk con- centration and the value at 10 min, or 0.015 g L−1, since CA bulk was much smaller than CAS. Compare the results obtained in Example 5.8 to a rigorous solution that accounts for the changing bulk concentration of the solute. Solution We assume that the particle size does not change significantly over the course of the 10 min. We can then write the following unsteady mass balance on the solute dissolved in the bulk fluid phase using Equation 1.8 as a guide. In this case, the accumulation of solute mass in the bulk solution is equal to the solute mass transfer rate. V dC dt NS kC Cbulk A bulk particlesparticle mASA bulk=-() 246 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The previous equation can be rearranged and integrated to obtain an expression for the mass transfer coefficient as shown next: k t V NS CC t C m bulk particlesparticle AS A bulk AS =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ - ()æ è çç 1 ln öö ø ÷÷ (A) Substituting in the values of the parameters in Equation A: k s cm cm m =- ´´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ - - 1 10 60 1000 1661 0 0314 15 003 1 1 3 2min min . ln .. .55 64610 41 æ è ç ö ø ÷ =´ --kcmsm . We see that the rigorous solution that accounts for the changing bulk solute concentration gives the same result for the mass transfer coefficient that was found in Example 5.8. This is because when CA bulk ≪ CAS, the two solutions can be shown to be the same. In Example 5.8, we expressed the mass transfer rate of the solute as \u0000m VC t t kN SC Ct kA bulkA bulk mparticlesparticle AS A bulk= () =- ()() » mmparticlesparticle ASNS C which can be solved for the mass transfer coefficient: k t V NS Ct C m bulk particlesparticle A bulk AS = æ è ç ö ø ÷ ()1 (B) In Equation A, when CA bulk ≪ CAS, then ln CC t C Ct C AS A bulk AS A bulk AS - ()æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ »- (), and when this result is substituted into Equation A for the natural log term, we then get Equation B, showing that the two solutions are equivalent when CA bulk ≪ CAS. Example 5.10 If the drug particles in Example 5.8 are placed in a very large volume of water and gently mixed, how long will it take for them to totally dissolve into the bulk solution? Solution In this case, the gentle mixing of the particles means that the Sherwood number is equal to 2. Also, since the particles are placed in a large volume of water, we can assume that CA bulk ~ 0. Using Equation 1.8 as a guide, and Equation 5.75 as the rate of mass transfer from the particle surface, we can write an unsteady mass balance on a drug particle: dM dt dV dt kS CC particle particle particle mparticle AS A bulk== --(r )) =-kS Cmparticle AS (A) 247 Mass transfer fundamentals Next, assuming a spherical particle, we let Sparticle = 4πR2 and VRparticle = 4 3 3p . Also, since Sh = 2, we also have that k D R m AB= . We also recognize in this problem that R depends on time. Substituting these previous relationships into Equation A, we get dR dt D R C AB particle AS=- r (B) With the initial condition that at t = 0, R = R0, we can integrate Equation B for the dissolution time, which is when R becomes equal to zero. t R CD dissolution particle AS AB = r 0 2 2 Using the data given in Example 5.8, we then calculate the dissolution time for the drug par- ticles as t gcmcm gcmcms dissolution = ´ ´´ ´ - -- - 1150 05 20 0015 06 10 32 2 35 2 .. .. 11 516 10 44 4=´ =..sh 5.8.1 Mass transfer between the surface of a sphere and a flowing fluid If the relative velocity between the sphere and fluid is v∞, then the Sherwood number will be greater than 2. In this case, it has been found that the Sherwood number is given by Sh kd D dv D msphere AB sphere AB == + æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¥20 06 12 13 .. // r m m r 220 06 12 13.. Re //+ Sc (5.85) where Sc DDAB AB == nm r is a dimensionless number known as the Schmidt number. The Schmidt number is the ratio of momentum diffusivity n m r = æ è ç ö ø ÷ to the mass diffusivity, i.e., DAB. For solutes diffusing through liquids, the Schmidt number is much greater than unity, and for solutes diffusing through gases, the Schmidt number is on the order of unity. 5.9 Solute transport by convection and diffusion Now we will consider several examples where we can obtain an analytical solution for mass transfer problems where there is both convection and diffusion of the solute. In all of these problems, the fluid is in laminar flow. The mass transfer coefficient for situations involving the much more com- plex nature of turbulent flow needs to be found from experimental data. 248 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 5.9.1 Solute mass transfer from a gas into a falling liquid film: short contact time solution Consider the situation shown in Figure 5.5 for the diffusion of a gas into a falling liquid film. Here, we have a thin liquid film that flows in laminar flow down a flat vertical surface of width W in the y direction. One side of this liquid film wets the surface of the plate and the other side of the film is exposed to a gas containing solute A, which is only sparingly soluble in the liquid. To analyze the mass transfer of solute A into the liquid film, we perform a steady-state mass bal- ance on the small shell volume given by Δx Δz W. We also neglect any entrance and exit effects and assume the film thickness, i.e., δ, at any value of z, is constant. In this case, we also recognize that the solute flux relative to stationary coordinates has the following two components, i.e., NAx and NAz. With these conditions, we can write our solute A mass balance as W xN Wx NW zN Wz NAz z Az zz Ax x Ax xxDD DD DD-+ -= ++ 0 (5.86) Now, if we divide through by Δx Δz W and take the limits as Δx and Δz become infinitesimally small, we then obtain ¶¶ + ¶¶ = N z N x Az Ax 0 (5.87) Next, we make some reasonable assumptions that will lead us to an analytical solution to this prob- lem. First, we seek a solution in which solute A has only penetrated a short distance into the liquid film, i.e., the penetration distance is much less than the thickness of the film. This will also be the region of the film where the velocity is pretty much equal to the maximum film velocity, which is at the film surface, so we can let vz(x) = vmax. This is also known as a short contact time solution since the exposure time of the liquid film to the gas over a given length L, i.e., L/vmax, is small. δ Gas Liquid film x y z vmax x+∆xx Solid wall z z+∆z Figure 5.5 Diffusion from a gas into a falling liquid film. 249 Mass transfer fundamentals Since the penetration depth of the solute for any value of z is much less than the film thickness, the short contact time solution means that the diffusion of the solute is unaffected by the presence of the wall at x = δ. In other words, the solute does not “know” how thick the liquid film really is. So, this means that we can replace the boundary condition at x = δ with the condition that at x = ∞, CA = 0. Because the film is flowing in the z direction, we also expect that the transport of solute A will be greater in that direction by convection than by diffusion. For example, the amount of solute A being carried along by the bulk flow of the fluid is on the order of vmax CA, and the amount of diffusion in the z direction over the length L is on the order of DC L AB A . The ratio of these two quantities is known as the Peclet number (Pe), which is a dimensionless number. If Pe vL DAB = max ≫ 1, then we can ignore axial diffusion in comparison to axial convection. This means that we can use Equation 5.15 and write that NAz = CA vz(x) = CA vmax. Since solute A is also sparingly soluble in the liquid film, we have by Equation 5.18 that N D C x Ax AB A=- ¶ ¶ . Substituting these for NAz and NAx in Equation 5.87, we obtain v C z D C x A AB A max ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ 2 2 (5.88) The solution to Equation 5.88 is subject to the following boundary conditions: BC zC BC xC C BC xC A AAS A 10 0 20 30 :, :, :, == == =¥ = (5.89) where we have assumed that there is no solute A in the entering liquid film and we let CAS equal the equilibrium solubility of solute A in the liquid film. Now, to obtain a solution to Equations 5.88 and 5.89, let us first transform the z direction into time. We can do this by defining t as the time it takes for an element of fluid in the film to reach a position z; hence, t = z/vmax. Hence, we have that z = vmax t and dz = vmax dt, and we can transform Equations 5.88 and 5.89 as follows: ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ C t D C x A AB A 2 2 (5.90) with BC tC BC xC C BC xC A AAS A 10 0 20 30 :, :, :, == == =¥ = (5.91) Equations 5.90 and 5.91 are identical to the problem we solved earlier in Section 5.5.1 for the dif- fusion of a solute from a planar surface into a semi-infinite stagnant medium. We can therefore use 250 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering the solution there, as given by Equation 5.54, with CA0 = 0 and replacing y with x, to obtain the fol- lowing expression for the solute A concentration within the liquid film. Cx,t C erfc x Dt erf x Dt A AS AB AB () = æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ =- æ è çç ö ø ÷÷4 1 4 (5.92) In terms of x and z = vmax t, we can write Equation 5.92 as Cx,z C erfc x Dz v A AS AB () = æ è ç ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ ÷ 4 max (5.93) The maximum distance to which the solute has penetrated into the liquid film at the distance L is given by Equation 5.55 where we now let t = L/vmax. Therefore, the maximum concentration bound- ary layer thickness is given by dC AB ABL DL v DL v () =»3 642 4. maxmax (5.94) In Example 5.9, we will show that the liquid film thickness δ is given by the following equation: d m r = æ è ç ö ø ÷ 3 13 Q gW / (5.95) where Q is the volumetric flow rate. If δC(L) ≪ δ, then the short contact time solution is valid. In a mass transfer problem such as this, we are also interested in knowing the solute mass transfer flux at the surface of the film, i.e., at x = 0, since by Equation 5.74, this allows us to find the mass transfer coefficient. Hence, at the surface of the film, we have by Equation 5.74 N zD C x kC Ck CAx x AB A x mASA bulkm AS() =- ¶ ¶ =-() = = = 0 0 (5.96) since CA bulk = 0. Using Equation 5.93 to find ¶ ¶ C x A x=0 , and substituting that result into Equation 5.96, we obtain N zC Dv z kCAx x AS AB mAS() == =0 max p (5.97) From Equation 5.97, we then see that the mass transfer coefficient is given by k Dv z mlocal AB= max p (5.98) 251 Mass transfer fundamentals It is important to recognize that the value of the mass transfer coefficient given by Equation 5.98 is a local value of the mass transfer coefficient since it depends on the value of z, which is the axial position in the direction of the film flow. From Equation 5.95, the volumetric flow rate of the liquid film is given by Q gW = rd m 3 3 . The average and maximum velocity of the liquid film are also given by v Q W g vavg == = d rd m 2 3 2 3 max (5.99) Using Equation 5.99 to replace vmax with vavg in Equation 5.98 gives the following expression for the local value of the Sherwood number: Sh kz D vz D local mlocal AB avg AB == 069. (5.100) Over the entire liquid film surface of width W and length L, the total mass transfer rate of solute A that is transported from the gas into the liquid film is given by integrating the surface flux of solute A given by Equation 5.97 over the entire surface: \u0000m NdzdyWC Dv zdzLWC Dv A WL Ax x AS AB L AS AB== =òò ò= - 00 0 0 12 2 max / max ppLL (5.101) Comparing this result to Equation 5.75 with S = LW, we see that the average mass transfer coefficient and Sherwood number, i.e., Sh kL D m AB = , based on the total surface area, where S = LW, is given by k Dv L Dv L Sh vL D m AB AB avg avg AB == = 21 38 138 max . . p (5.102) Example 5.11 Yoshida and Ohshima (1966) used a falling liquid film on the outside vertical surface of a cylin- drical tube of outside diameter d to determine the diffusivity of oxygen in serum. Serum is the fluid portion of the blood that remains after the blood has clotted. They used Equation 5.101 to find DAB from the measured oxygen absorption rate, i.e., \u0000mA. Analyze some of their data and find the value of DAB for serum at 37°C. Solution In order to understand how Yoshida and Ohshima (1966) analyzed their data, we first need to find the velocity profile for the laminar flow of a liquid film on a vertical surface. For the 252 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering situation shown in Figure 5.5, we can write the following z momentum balance over a fluid shell volume of length L defined as ΔxLW: WLWLW xv vW xv vW xL gxz x xz xx zz z zz zLtt Dr Dr r-+ -+ = += =D D 0 0 (A) The first and second terms in this equation represent the transport of z momentum in the x direction, recognizing that momentum is transported from a region of high velocity to that of lower velocity. The third and fourth terms represent the momentum of the fluid entering and leaving the shell volume by bulk flow. Since the velocity in the z direction for any value of x is the same at z = 0 and at z = L, these terms cancel out. The last term is the force of gravity acting on the mass of fluid within the shell volume. Now we divide Equation A by LWΔx and take the limit as Δx → 0 and obtain d dx g xzt r= (B) For a Newtonian fluid, we have that tmxz zdv dx =- , and when this is substituted into Equation B, we get dv dx gz 2 2 =- r m (C) Equation C is then integrated twice, and the following boundary conditions are used to find the integration constants: BC x dv dx BC xv z z 10 0 20 :, :, == ==d (D) Using these boundary conditions, the velocity profile is v x gx z () =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú rd md 2 2 2 1 (E) Because we assume that the oxygen does not penetrate very far into the liquid film, i.e., the short contact time solution, the velocity in the region near x = 0 is vmax, which is then given by v g max = rd m 2 2 (F) The total volumetric flow, i.e., Q, is given by integrating vz(x), i.e., Equation E, over the area normal to the bulk flow: Qv xdxdy gW WL z= () =òò 00 3 3 rd m (G) which is Equation 5.95 given earlier. 253 Mass transfer fundamentals The average film velocity is then given by v Q W g vavg == = d rd m 2 3 2 3 max (H) We then use Equation G to replace δ in terms of Q, i.e., d m r = æ è ç ö ø ÷ 3 13 Q gW / , and for flow down the outside of a vertical tube of outside diameter d, where δ is much smaller than d, we can let W = πd. Substituting these into Equation F, we obtain v gQ d max / / = æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ 3 23 13 23 rmp (I) Yoshida and Ohshima (1966) then defined the liquid film exposure time as t = L/vmax = LFQ−2/3, where F is a constant defined as F g d= æ è ç ö ø ÷ () 2 3 3 13 23m r p / / (J) Letting L/vmax = LFQ−2/3 in Equation 5.101, we then obtain \u0000m CdLQ D F AAS AB= 2 12 13// p (K) In a given experiment, if the data are plotted as \u0000m Q A 2 23/ versus the length of the liquid film, i.e., L, then Equation K says that the value of the oxygen diffusivity, i.e., DAB, can be obtained from the slope of this plot, i.e., m Cd D F AS AB= æ è ç ö ø ÷4 22 p . Although their data showed the presence of entrance and exit effects, the slope is not affected by these entrance and exit effects, and there was a region where the data showed a constant slope, and from the slope of these data, the diffusivity can be found. For example, the table below presents some of their data for the transport of oxygen into a liquid film of ox serum. The solubility of oxygen in the serum at the gas-liquid interface, i.e., CSA, was equal to 2.87 × 10−5 g cm−3. The outside diameter of the vertical glass tube, i.e., d, was 1.03 cm.

Next, we calculate the value of F from Equation J using a value of the serum viscosity at 37°C of 1.01 cP. This gives F = 0.0458 cm sec1/3. Then, since the slope, i.e., m Cd D F AS AB= æ è ç ö ø ÷4 22 p , we can calculate the value of DAB as shown next: D mF Cd gcms cm s AB AS == ´´ ´ -- - 4 4 635 10 0 0458 42 87 1 22 12 23 43 13 p p .. . // 001 03 19310 53 2 2 52 1 -- -- () ´() =´ gcmcm DcmsAB . . The diffusivity of oxygen at 37°C in the fluid portion of blood is therefore on the order of 1.9  × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The value measured for the diffusivity of oxygen in water at 37°C by Yoshida and Ohshima (1966) using the same method was found to be 2.76 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. 5.9.1.1 A general solution for gas absorption into a laminar falling liquid film If the short contact time solution obtained previously is not valid, i.e., δC ~ δ, then we have to assume that the solute concentration profile extends across the film thickness.

Example 5.12 A device for the oxygenation of plasma consists of 10 vertical plates with air flowing between the plates. The plates are 10 cm in width (W) and 25 cm in length (L). The air flow is suffi- ciently high so that we can assume the concentration of oxygen in the gas is constant. Plasma at 37°C containing no dissolved oxygen enters the oxygenator at a flow rate of 1000 mL min−1 and is evenly distributed to each side of each plate. The plasma flows down the surface of each side of the plate in laminar flow. The saturation concentration of oxygen in plasma is 216 μM, the viscosity of the plasma is 1.2 cP, and the diffusivity of oxygen in the plasma is 1.9 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. Calculate the total oxygen transfer rate and estimate the maximum dis- solved oxygen concentration (μM) in the plasma as it leaves the oxygenator. Solution We assume that the oxygen transport for each side of the vertical plates is the same and we neglect entrance and exit effects. We can calculate the oxygen transported into the plasma on one side of a plate and then multiply that value by 20 (2 sides per plate × 10 plates) to find how much oxygen was transported into the plasma. We then use an overall oxygen mass bal- ance across the oxygenator to find the exiting dissolved oxygen concentration in the plasma. 255 Mass transfer fundamentals First, we calculate the film thickness from Equation 5.95 with the flow rate on one side of the plate equal to 0.83 cm3 s−1. d m r = æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ´´ ´ -- --33 12 0010 83 1 024 13 11 13 1Q gW cP gcms cP cm s / .. . . ggcmcms cm cm --´´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = 32 13 980 10 0 0144 / .

Since δC is greater than the actual film thickness, we need to calculate the mass transfer coef- ficient from Equation 5.103.

The disk rotates within a large volume of fluid, which itself is at rest. The rotation of the disk causes a thin layer of fluid at its surface to flow outward in the radial direction as a result of the centrifugal forces caused by the rotation of the disk. This flow of the fluid will create a boundary layer near the surface of the plate where the velocity and solute concentration changes will be confined. There will also be a flow of the fluid toward the surface of the disk to maintain this outward radial flow of fluid along the disk surface. Clearly, this is a very complex 3D flow. However, with some reasonable assumptions, a solution can be obtained that describes the mass transfer rate of the solute very well when compared to experi- mental data. We can use cylindrical coordinates to describe the solution to this problem, so we have velocity and solute molar flux components in the r, θ, and z directions. However, because of axial symmetry about the z axis, these velocity and molar flux components do not vary in the θ direction. R z r ω Flow Figure 5.6 Mass transfer from a rotating disk. 257 Mass transfer fundamentals Schlichting (1979) has also shown that the momentum boundary layer thickness along the surface of the rotating disk is given by d n w » (5.104) where ω is defined as the disk rotation rate in radians per second ν is the kinematic viscosity This result is also consistent with the momentum boundary layer thickness given by Equation 4.72 for flow over a flat plate if we let x = R and replace V with the angular velocity, ω R. If we assume that this momentum boundary layer thickness is much smaller than the disk radius, i.e., δ ≪ R, then we can assume to a good approximation that the solute concentration will only depend on the axial position z. This means that near the surface of the rotating disk, we can write a steady-state solute balance in the z direction over a thin annular shell volume, i.e., 2πr Δr Δz, of radial thickness Δr and axial thickness Δz: v zr rC vz rr CD rr dC dz DzA z zA zz AB A zz AB()() - ()() + () - + + 22 2pp pDD D D D 220prr dC dz A z D() = (5.105) Next, we divide Equation 5.105 by 2πr Δr Δz and take the limit as Δz → 0 and obtain v z dC dz D dC dz z A AB A() = 2 2 (5.106) The boundary conditions for Equation 5.106 are BC zC C BC zC AAS A 10 20 :, :, == =¥ = (5.107) Next, we introduce a dimensionless distance from the surface of the rotating disk, i.e., V d w n == z z , and a dimensionless velocity, i.e., H vz vzzz V dw nw () = () = (). Substituting these quantities into Equation 5.106, we get H dC d Dd C dSc dC d AABA AV zn zz () == 2 2 2 2 1 (5.108) where Sc DDAB AB == nm r . The boundary conditions can also be written in terms of ζ: BC CC BC C AAS A 10 20 :, :, z z == =¥ = (5.109) 258 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering To facilitate the integration of Equation 5.108, we let Y dC d A= V and substitute this into that equation to give dY d ScHY V V= () (5.110) Integration of Equation 5.110 then gives ln lnYScH dC= () +ò 0 1 V VV (5.111) and then dC d CScH d A V VV V = () é ë ê ê ù û ú úò 1 0 exp (5.112) Equation 5.112 can then be integrated to give C CScH sdsd CA VV VV () = () é ë ê ê ù û ú ú +òò 1 00 2exp (5.113) Next, we use the boundary conditions given by Equation 5.109 to eliminate C1 and C2, which then gives the following equation for the solute concentration in the fluid: C C Sc Hs ds d Sc Hs ds A AS V V VV V () =- () é ë ê ù û ú () é ë ê ù û òò òò ¥1 00 00 exp exp úú dV (5.114) Provided that we know H(ζ), we can solve the previous equation for the solute concentration in the fluid above the surface of the disk. Recall that the axial velocity is given by v HHz VV dw Vnw() = () = () . We will skip the details here on the solution for the velocity profiles since it is a rather involved calculation. However, Schlichting (1979) outlines the solution procedure for obtaining the velocity profiles and provides a graph and table for the values of H(ζ) as a function of V d w n w == = z zz DScAB . Now for a large value of Sc, and in the region near the surface of the disk, we expect ζ < 1. In this region, which is of the most interest to us since the solute flux at the surface is given by - = D dC d AB A V V 0, 259 Mass transfer fundamentals we find from Schlichting’s results that H(ς) ≈ − 0.510ς2. When this expression for H(ζ) is substituted into Equation 5.114, and the integral term within the exponential is evaluated, we obtain C C Sc d Sc d A AS V VV VV V () =- -é ë ù û -é ë ù û ò ò ¥1 017 017 0 3 0 3 exp. exp.

Hence, Equation 5.115 becomes C C Sc Sc d A AS V VV G V () =- () -é ë ù û æ è ç ö ø ÷ ò 1 0170 17 4 3 13 0 3.exp . / (5.116) The solute molar flux in the z direction is then given by N D dC dz CD Sc Sc d dz Az AB A AS AB=- = () æ è ç ö ø ÷ -() 017 4 3 017 13 3. exp. / G V V NN CD Sc ScAz AS AB= () æ è ç ö ø ÷ -() 017 4 3 017 13 3. exp. / G V w n (5.117) in which d dz Vw n = . Now, we can use Equation 5.74 with Equation 5.117 to find the solute flux at the surface of the rotat- ing disk and then the mass transfer coefficient: N D dC dz kC CD Sc Az z AB A z mASASAB= = =- =-() = () æ è ç ö ø ÷ 0 0 13 0 017 4 3 . / G w n NN kC CD ScAz z mASASAB= == 0 13062. / w n (5.118) Equation 5.118 has the interesting property that the solute flux at the surface of the rotating disk is independent of the disk diameter, ddisk. This also means that the mass transfer coefficient is also independent of the disk diameter. Because of this property, the rotating disk is a very useful device for mass transfer studies. 260 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The mass transfer coefficient expressed by the Sherwood number can then be shown to be given by Sh kd D d D mdisk AB disk AB == æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ =0620 62 2 12 13 1.. Re / / rw m m r ///21 3Sc (5.119) Example 5.13 Tao et al. (1974) provides the following data for the dimensionless mass transfer rate of benzoic acid from the surface of a rotating disk into water.

The diffusivity of benzoic acid in water, i.e., DAB, at 25°C is 0.9 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 (Noulty and Lealst, 1987). Using this value of the diffusivity gives Sc = 989. For benzoic acid in water, the value of the slope m should then equal 6.18. Compare this theoretical value of the slope, i.e., m = 6.18, to the slope of the line for the benzoic acid mass transfer data shown below.

The error in the slope from Equation 5.119 and these data is equal to 2.23%. The correlation constant is also equal to 0.9998, which indicates an excellent fit to the data. 261 Mass transfer fundamentals Example 5.14 A design for a contact lens cleaning system uses a 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution to kill any microorganisms on the lenses. The killing of the microorganisms occurs very quickly when the lens is in this solution. However, the remaining hydrogen peroxide needs to be neutralized before the lenses can be worn again. It is proposed to neutralize the hydrogen peroxide by having within the lens cleaning container a thin rotating disk that has a catalyst on its surface. The disk is rotated at 60 RPM. As the catalyst disk rotates, the residual hydro- gen peroxide moves to the surface of the disk where it is decomposed into water and oxygen according to the following irreversible equation: H OH OO22 22®+ ½. At 25°C, the density of the hydrogen peroxide solution is 1 g cm−3 and its viscosity is 0.90 cP. The diffusivity of hydrogen peroxide in water is 1.43 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, and the MW of hydro- gen peroxide is 34. The hydrogen peroxide volume in the cleaning container is 15 cm3. If the catalyst disk (ddisk) is 5/8 inch in diameter, and both sides of the disk are catalytically active, estimate how long it will take for 99.99% of the hydrogen peroxide to be removed from the cleaning solution. The decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide at the surface of the disk is a first order reaction, i.e., Rk CAf AS ² = , where kf is the first order rate constant for the decompo- sition reaction and is equal to 0.008 cm s−1. How long will it take if the surface reaction was instantaneous? Solution Since the hydrogen peroxide reaction at the surface of the rotating disk is a first order irrevers- ible reaction, we can use the result given by Equation 5.33 to calculate the mass transfer flux of the solute at the disk surface.

Now we calculate the value of the overall rate constant, i.e., K, which 262 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering includes the solute mass transfer coefficient and the surface reaction rate constant.

The surface of the plate maintains a constant concentration of a solute (CAS), and the concentration of the solute in the fluid is given by CA. Unlike the situation shown in Figure 5.1, here the solute diffuses from the surface of the plate and is then swept away by the flowing fluid. Hence, in this problem, the solute is transported away from the flat plate surface by a combination of diffusion and convection. We also assume that the bulk of the fluid is free of the solute except in the region adjacent to the flat plate, which is defined as the concentration boundary layer. If the fluid approaching the plate has a solute concentration of CA bulk, then the following analysis still applies; however, the concentration will need to be defined as C CCAA A bulk=- . 263 Mass transfer fundamentals In Section 4.9.2, we developed an approximate solution for the steady laminar flow of a fluid along a flat plate and determined the velocity profile within the boundary layer that is formed along the length of the plate. Here, we will extend this solution to determine the concentration profile of the solute in the concentration boundary layer that is also formed along the surface of the flat plate. Consider the shell volume shown in Figure 5.7 of width W and located from x to x + Δx and from y = 0 to y = δC(x), where δC is the concentration boundary layer thickness. We first perform a steady- state solute balance on this shell volume, which is given by 0 0 0 d d C C x Ax x Ax xx Ay yx Ay yWC vWCv dy Cv Wx NW x () + = () =ò -é ë ù û -+ = D DD (5.120) The integral term in Equation 5.120 represents the net rate at which the solute is being added to the shell volume by flow of the fluid in the x direction. The second term represents the loss of the solute from the top of the shell volume as a result of flow in the y direction. The last term represents the rate at which the solute is diffusing away from the surface of the flat plate. After eliminating the plate width, W, and dividing by Δx, and taking the limit as Δx → 0, we can write Equation 5.120 as N d dx Cv dy CvAy y x Ax Ay yx C C= () = () =+ò0 0 d d (5.121) Assuming a dilute solution, we can use the form of Fick’s first law given by Equation 5.18 for NAy∣y = 0 and obtain -= + = () = ()ò D dC dy d dx Cv dy CvAB A y x Ax Ay yx C C 0 0 d d (5.122) y x x x+ ∆x δC(x), the concentration boundary layer thickness Free stream with velocity V δ(x), velocity boundary layer CAS Figure 5.7 Laminar boundary layer flow in the vicinity of a flat plate of constant surface concentration. 264 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The solution of Equation 5.122 requires that we know how vx and CA depend on x and y in their respective boundary layers. Since we only want to obtain an approximate solution, we can use our previous result for vx(x, y), i.e., Equation 4.70: v x,y V y x y x x () = () æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ - () æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ 3 2 1 2 3 dd (4.70) and in a similar fashion propose that the concentration profile in the concentration boundary layer is approximately described by the following cubic equation: C ya by cy dyAC CC C() =+ ++ 23 (5.123) The concentration profile described by Equation 5.123 also has to satisfy the following boundary conditions: BC yC C BC yx C BC yx C y BC y AAS CA C A 10 20 30 40 :, :, :, :, == = () = = () ¶ ¶ = = ¶ d d 22 2 0 C y A ¶ = (5.124) The first boundary condition (BC1) expresses the fact that the concentration of the solute is con- stant along the surface of the flat plate. The second and third boundary conditions (BC2 and BC3) state that beyond the concentration boundary layer, the solute is not present. This allows us to eliminate the last term in Equation 5.122, which then becomes -= = () ò D dC dy d dx Cv dyAB A y x Ax C 0 0 d (5.125) The fourth boundary condition (BC4) expresses the fact that the flux of solute along the surface of the plate is only a function of x. After imposing the boundary conditions given by Equation 5.124 on Equation 5.123, the following expression is obtained for the concentration profile within the concentration boundary layer in terms of the concentration boundary layer thickness, δC(x), which at this time still needs to be determined. C x,y C yx yx A AS CC () =- () æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ + () æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ 1 3 2 1 2 3 dd (5.126) 265 Mass transfer fundamentals We now can substitute Equations 4.70 and 5.126 into Equation 5.125. We also assume that the ratio of the boundary layer thicknesses, i.e., D d d = () () C x x , is a constant. The algebra is a bit overwhelming, but one can obtain the following differential equation for the thickness of the concentration bound- ary layer: 0150 0107 3 2 3..DD d d -( ) = d dx D V CAB C (5.127) with the boundary condition that at x = 0, δC = 0. The solution of Equation 5.127 is then given by d DD C ABx Dx V () = -() 3 0150 0107 3.. (5.128) Recall from Equation 4.72 that the momentum boundary layer thickness δ is given by d m r x vx V x V () ==4644 64.. (4.72) Dividing Equation 5.128 by Equation 4.72, and simplifying, results in the following equation for D d d = () () C x x : 1 0765 0 0768 135..DD r m -= = D Sc AB (5.129) where Sc DAB = m r is once again the dimensionless number known as the Schmidt number. For solutes diffusing through liquids, the Schmidt number is generally much greater than unity; hence, from Equation 5.129, we have that Δ < 1 and δ > δC. This shows that for liquids, the concentration bound- ary layer lies within the velocity or momentum boundary layer. For solutes diffusing through gases, the Schmidt number is on the order of unity and Δ is approximately equal to unity and δ ≈ δC. For solutes diffusing through materials like liquid metals, the Schmidt number is much less than unity and then Δ > 1 and δC > δ. In general, if one knows the value of the Schmidt number for the mass transfer problem being con- sidered, then Equation 5.129 can be solved for the value of Δ. The velocity boundary layer thickness is then given by Equation 4.72, and the concentration boundary layer thickness is equal to Δ δ(x). For many mass transfer problems of interest to biomedical engineers, the solute is diffusing within a liquid, and this means the Schmidt number is much larger than unity. This makes the right-hand side of Equation 5.129 much smaller than unity. The only way this can happen is if Δ is also much smaller than unity. This means that the concentration boundary layer lies well within the boundary layer for the velocity. Hence, for Δ ≪ 1, Equation 5.129 simplifies to the following result: D d d = () () » -C x x Sc 13/ (5.130) 266 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Combining this with Equation 4.72 results in Equation 5.131 for the thickness of the concentration boundary layer: d m r r m C AB ABx xVx Dv Vx D() = æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = æ è ç ö ø ÷4644 64 12 13 12 .. // / vvScx æ è ç ö ø ÷ = æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ 13 12 13 464 11 / / / . Re (5.131) Note that the concentration boundary layer thickness depends on two dimensionless parameters that describe the nature of the flow, as given by the Reynolds number (Rex), and the physical properties of the solute and the fluid, as given by the Schmidt number (Sc). Recall that the mass transfer coefficient is proportional to the solute diffusivity and inversely propor- tional to the concentration boundary layer thickness (see Equation 5.78). This means that since δC depends on x, the mass transfer coefficient will depend on the location along the surface of the flat plate. We can calculate this local value of the mass transfer coefficient using Equation 5.74, which says the local mass transfer coefficient is given by k D CC dC dy D C dC dy mlocal AB AS A bulk A y AB AS A y =- -() =- ==00 (5.132) After substituting Equation 5.126 into the above expression, and replacing δC(x) with Equation 5.131, we obtain the following expression for the local mass transfer coefficient for laminar flow over a flat plate: Sh kx D Vx D local mlocal AB AB == æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ =0 323 0 323 12 13 .. // rm m r RRe // x Sc 12 13 (5.133) where Shlocal is the local Sherwood number at location x. Recall that the Sherwood number is the ratio of the transport rate of the solute by convection to that by diffusion. In Equation 5.133, km local is the local value of the mass transfer coefficient. As the fluid progresses down the length of the plate, the concentration boundary layer thickness increases, and by Equation 5.133, we see that km local decreases in inverse proportion to x1/2. For a plate of length L, the average mass transfer coefficient is given by k L kx dxm L mlocal= ()ò 1 0 (5.134) Substituting Equation 5.133 into Equation 5.134 results in Equation 5.135, which is also known as the length averaged mass transfer coefficient. kL D Sh VL D Sc m AB AB == æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ =0 646 0 646 12 13 12 13..

In Equation 5.136, recall that CAS is the concentration of the solute at the surface of the plate and CA bulk is the concentration of the solute in the fluid outside the boundary layer. Note that km is calculated from Equation 5.135, which is the average value of the mass transfer coefficient for the surface area, i.e., S = LW. \u0000m kLWC CAm AS Abulk=-() (5.136) Example 5.15 Blood is flowing across the flat surface of a polymeric material coated with an anticoagulant drug. Equilibrium studies of the drug coated on the polymer show that the drug has a solubility of 100 mg L−1 of blood. The fluid adjacent to the plate equilibrates quickly; hence, the con- centration of the drug at the surface of the plate, i.e., CAS, is for practical purposes the same as this equilibrium value. Find the following: a. The distance at which the laminar boundary layer for flow over the surface of the polymeric material ends b. The thickness of the velocity and concentration boundary layers at the end of the polymeric material c. The local mass transfer coefficient at the end of the polymeric material and the average mass transfer coefficient for the drug d. The average mass transfer flux of the drug from the polymeric material assuming the con- centration of the drug in the blood is much smaller than at the surface, i.e., CA bulk = 0 Assume that the blood traveling across the polymeric material has a free stream velocity, i.e., V, of 40 cm s−1. The polymeric material has a length in the direction of the flow of 30 cm. The diffusivity of the drug in blood is 4.3 × 10−6 cm2 s−1.

Note that this distance for the transition to turbulence is much greater than the actual length of the flat polymeric material; hence, the flow is laminar over the region of interest.

Note that both δ and δC are much larger than the plasma layer thickness (see Section 4.8); hence, we are justified in using the properties of whole blood in these calculations.

A fluid in laminar flow is flowing through a cylindrical tube and comes into contact with a section of the tube that maintains a constant con- centration of a solute that diffuses into the fluid. We want to determine the mass transfer rate of the solute from the surface. Hence, we will need to find an expression for the mass transfer coefficient in terms of dimensionless quantities such as the Reynolds number and the Schmidt number. In order 269 Mass transfer fundamentals to obtain an analytical solution to this rather complex problem, we will make a simplifying assump- tion, i.e., we will only be interested in obtaining what is known as a short contact time solution. This means that the solute does not penetrate very far from the surface of the tube. Hence, the change in concentration of the solute occurs only near the surface of the tube wall. From Chapter 4, we know that the velocity profile for laminar flow in a tube is given by the follow- ing expression, i.e., Equation 4.7: v r PP R L r R z L () = -() - æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú 0 2 2 4 1 m (4.7) Next, we perform a steady-state solute balance on the cylindrical shell volume shown in Figure 5.8. 2 2pprr vC vC rr D C z D C z zA z zA zz AB A zz AB A z DD D D -()+ ¶ ¶ - ¶ ¶ æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ + + + 220prz D C r D C r AB A rr AB A r D D ¶ ¶ - ¶ ¶ æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ = + (5.137) The first parenthetical term in Equation 5.137 represents the net rate at which solute is added to the shell volume by bulk flow of the fluid. The second term in parentheses represents the net rate at which solute is added to the shell volume by diffusion of solute in the z direction. The final par- enthetical term in Equation 5.137 represents the net rate at which solute enters the shell volume by diffusion in the r direction. Now, if we divide through by 2πrΔr Δz and then take the limit as Δr and Δz → 0, we then obtain the following partial differential equation that describes the transport of solute at any value of r and z within the tube: v C z D rr r C r C z z A AB AA¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ 1 2 2 (5.138) The term on the left-hand side of Equation 5.138 represents the solute transport in the flowing fluid by axial (z) convection or bulk flow of the fluid. The right-hand side represents the transport of the solute by diffusion in the radial (r) and axial (z) directions.

For example, the amount of solute A carried along by the bulk flow of the fluid is on the order of Vaverage CA, and the amount of diffusion in the z direction over the tube length L is on the order of DC L AB A . The ratio of these two quantities is the dimensionless Peclet number (Pe). If Pe VL D average AB = ≫ 1, then we can ignore axial diffusion in comparison to axial convection. This means in Equation 5.138 that v C z D C z z A AB A¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ≫ 2 2 , and in this case Equation 5.138 becomes v C z D rr r C r z A AB A¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ 1 (5.139) Next, we let s = R – r represent the distance from the wall of the tube. Since we are only interested in a solution near the wall, s will be small relative to R and we can neglect the effect of the curvature of the tube. With these assumptions, Equation 5.139 becomes v C z D C s z A AB A¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ 2 2 (5.140) We also recognize that near the tube wall the velocity profile is nearly linear in s, and from Equations 4.7 and 4.11, we see that v PP R L s Vs R z L average» -() » 02 4 m . Using this result for vz, Equation 5.140 can then be written as PP R L s C z Vs R C s D C s L A average A AB A0 2 22 4-() ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶m (5.141) The boundary conditions for Equation 5.141 are as follows: BC zand alls C BC sand zC C BC sand zC A AAS A 10 0 20 0 30 :, , :, , :, , == => = =¥ >== 0 (5.142) The last boundary condition (BC3) results from the short contact time assumption, which means that the solute does not penetrate very far into the fluid. We have also assumed that the bulk of the fluid is free of the solute except in the region adjacent to the tube wall. If the fluid has a solute concentra- tion of CA bulk, then the following analysis still applies; however, the concentration will need to be defined as C CCAA A bulk=- . The solution of Equations 5.141 and 5.142 is facilitated by rewriting these equations in terms of dimensionless variables defined as follows. We let qe sºº º C C z R and s R A AS ,, , where θ is defined 271 Mass transfer fundamentals as a dimensionless concentration, ε is a dimensionless axial position, and σ is a dimensionless dis- tance from the tube wall. If these dimensionless variables replace CA, z, and s in Equations 5.141 and 5.142, the following result is obtained: Ns q e q s ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ 2 2 (5.143) where N RP P DL RV D L AB average AB º -() = 3 0 2 4 m . The boundary conditions become BC andall BC and BC and 10 0 20 01 30 0 :, , :, , :, , es q se q se q == => = =¥ >= (5.144) Now to solve Equations 5.143 and 5.144, the similarity transform technique or combination of vari- ables approach can be used. In this approach, we define a new independent variable η that is a suit- able combination of ε and σ that converts Equation 5.143 from a partial differential equation into an ordinary differential equation that only depends on η. If we let h s e º æ è ç ö ø ÷ = æ è ç ö ø ÷ N s V DRz average AB 3 13 13 9 4 9 / / , then it can be shown with a little bit of effort that Equations 5.143 and 5.144 become d d d d 2 2 230 q h h q h += (5.145) and the boundary conditions become BC BC 10 20 1 :, :, hq hq =¥ = == (5.146) The integration of Equations 5.145 and 5.146 then gives the following result for the solute concen- tration profile as a function of h s e º æ è ç ö ø ÷ = æ è ç ö ø ÷ N s V DRz average AB 3 13 13 9 4 9 / / : C C ed AASh h G h h () = æ è ç ö ø ÷ ¥ -ò 3 4 3 (5.147) Obtaining the solution given by Equation 5.147 involves the use of the gamma function, which is defined as G je x xj() º --ò 1 0 , along with the gamma function property that jΓ(j) = Γ(j + 1). The Γ(4/3) = 0.893. We can also use Equation 5.147 to define the concentration boundary layer thickness at any position z as that distance away from the tube wall where CA(η) = 0.01CAS. Hence, letting C C A AS h() = 001. , 272 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering we can solve Equation 5.147, and we find that the value of η is equal to 1.404. From the definition of η, we can then find the value of δC with s now equal to δC, i.e., h s e d== æ è ç ö ø ÷ = æ è ç ö ø ÷1 404 9 4 9 3 13 13 . / / N V DRz average AB C. We can then solve this previous result for δC and obtain dC AB average zRD V = æ è ç ö ø ÷184 13 . / (5.148) The above result gives the thickness of the concentration boundary layer as a function of the axial tube position z. Since we are considering a short contact time solution, this means that the solute has not penetrated very far into the fluid from the surface of the tube; hence, this type of solution is valid as long as δC ≪ R. The solute flux from the tube surface at any value of z is given by Equation 5.18 for a dilute solution, which in cylindrical coordinates is N D C r DC R DC V DR Ar rR AB A rR AB AS AB AS average AB = == =- ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ = q s s 0 0 855. zz æ è ç ö ø ÷ 13/ (5.149) From Equation 5.149, the local value of the mass transfer coefficient, defined by Equation 5.22, can then be written as k N C D V Dd z mlocal Ar rR AS AB average AB tube = -() = æ è ç ö ø ÷ =0 1 077 13 . / (5.150) where the average velocity of the fluid in the tube is equal to the volumetric flow rate (Q) of the fluid divided by the tube cross-sectional area, i.e., V Q R average = p 2 .

The total mass transfer rate of the solute from the surface of the tube is given by \u0000m kRLC CAm AS A z=-()=2 0p (5.154) Since this is a short contact time solution, the bulk concentration of the solute is constant and equal to the concentration of the solute as it enters the tube. Any change in the solute concentration in the fluid flowing through the tube is confined to a very thin region near the tube wall. Thus, the mass transfer driving force over the length of the tube is constant and equal to (CAS − CA∣z = 0). 5.9.4.1 Overall solute mass balance for the short contact time solution If the fluid exiting the cylindrical tube considered in Section 5.9.4 is then completely mixed, we can find the mixed solute concentration by performing an overall steady-state solute mass balance between the entrance to the tube at z = 0 and the tube exit at z = L: pp pRV CR VC kRLC CaverageA zL averageA z mASA z 22 002 == ==+ -() (5.155) Equation 5.155 says that the rate at which solute is leaving the tube at z = L is equal to the rate at which the solute enters the tube at z = 0 plus the rate at which the solute is being transported from the tube surface as given by Equation 5.154.

The equilibrium concentration of the drug in plasma is 100 mg L−1. Find the average mass transfer coefficient over the 10 cm length of the tube that is coated with the drug. Also, find the total transport rate of the solute and the mixed con- centration of the drug in the plasma after the coated section of the tube. Show that the short contact time solution is a valid approach for solving this problem. The diffusivity of the drug in plasma is estimated to be 4 × 10−6 cm2 s−1.

This value of δC is significantly less than the tube radius of 0.5 cm; hence, the short contact time solution is valid for the mass transfer conditions in this example. Another way to look at whether the short contact solution is valid is to compare the characteristic time for solute convection and the time for radial diffusion within the tube. In terms of convection, the solute 275 Mass transfer fundamentals residence time within the tube for this example is on the order of L V cm cm s s average == - 10 15 067 1 . . The radial diffusion time for the solute is on the order of R D cm cm s s AB 2 2 62 1 05 410 62 500= () ´ = -- . , . Hence, we see that the time for the solute to diffuse far from the tube surface to the center of the tube is many orders of magnitude longer than the time the solute actually spends in the tube once it is released from the surface of the tube. In this example, we see that the solute will not be able to penetrate very far from the surface of the tube wall. Therefore, the short contact time solution is valid for these conditions. 5.10 The general case of mass transfer between the wall of a cylindrical tube and a flowing fluid In Section 5.9.4, we obtained a short contact time solution for the mass transfer of a solute between the tube wall and a fluid in laminar flow. In this case, we assume that the solute does not penetrate very far from the surface of the tube and this means as well that the bulk concentration of the solute in the flowing fluid remains constant along the length of the flow path. However, in many situations, the assumption of a short contact time solution is not valid. This means we need to take into account the fact that the bulk concentration of the solute will be changing along the length of the flow path. This also means that the concentration driving force is no longer constant as we assumed in Equation 5.154 but now changes with the axial position in the tube. This is shown in Figure 5.9 for the case of mass transfer of the solute from the surface of the tube into a flowing fluid. Clearly, the concentration driving force at the entrance of the tube is much larger in this case than at the exit of the tube. We can still write our solute mass transfer rate in terms of the length averaged mass transfer coef- ficient, i.e., km, and the circumferential area of the tube, but the question becomes how do we express the solute concentration difference? The analysis in Section 5.10.1 will show that the proper concen- tration driving force in this case is the log mean concentration difference given by ΔCLM.

The fluid flow can be either laminar or turbulent. The average velocity of the fluid is Vaverage, and the solute concentration at the tube surface is CAS. The bulk concentration of the solute in the fluid is CA and is defined as the mixing cup average concentration, which is given by C vr Cr dA vr dA A zA A z A = () () () ò ò (5.157) In the above equation, vz(r) is the axial velocity in the tube, and the integrations are over the cross- sectional area normal to this flow. The numerator of this equation reflects the fact that, in general, the flow is higher near the axis of the tube, so this flow will bring more solute into the mixing cup than the slower flow near the wall of the tube. The denominator is just the volumetric flow rate. We can then perform a steady-state shell balance on the solute in the direction of the flow from z to z + Δz as shown below: VR CV RC RzkC CaverageA zz averageA z mlocal AS App p 22 2 + =+ -() D D (5.158) Note that in Equation 5.158, we use the local value of the mass transfer coefficient to describe the mass transfer rate in the region from z to z + Δz. When the solute mass balance given by Equation 5.158 is divided by Δz and the limit taken as Δz → 0, we get dC dz k VR CC A mlocal average AS A=-() 2 (5.159) with the boundary condition that at z = 0, C CAA in= and at z = L, C CAA out= .

If 2 kmL ≫ VaverageR, then C CA out AS® , and the solute transport is flow limited, and in the limit the solute concentration leaving the tube approaches that at the tube surface. 277 Mass transfer fundamentals We can also write a total mass balance on the solute over the tube length (L) and obtain the following result that expresses the total solute transport rate \u0000mA( ): \u0000m VR CC RLkCAaverage A out A in mLM=-() =pp D 2 2 (5.161) Here, we let ΔCLM represent the concentration driving force that when multiplied by the average mass transfer coefficient (km) and the total surface area available for mass transfer (2πRL) gives the solute transport rate. We can solve for ΔCLM from the previous equation: DC VR CC kL LM averageA out A in m = -() 2 (5.162) From Equation 5.160, we have that 2k L VR CC CC m average AS A in AS A out= - - æ è ç ö ø ÷ln (5.163) Using this result in Equation 5.162, we obtain the following equation for ΔCLM: DC VR CC kL CC CC CC LM averageA out A in m A out A in AS A in AS = -() = -() - - 2 ln AA out AS A in AS A out AS A in AS A out CC CC CC CC æ è ç ö ø ÷ = -()--() - - æ è ç ö ø ln ÷÷ (5.164) Equation 5.164 defines the log mean concentration difference (ΔCLM), and this is the proper driving force to be used when calculating the total solute mass transfer rate from Equation 5.161. Equation 5.161 can also be used to determine the average mass transfer coefficient, i.e., km, from measure- ments of the entering and exiting solute concentrations as shown below: k m RL C VR CC RL C V m solute LM averageA out A in LM avera== -() = \u0000 22 2 pD p pD gge AS A in AS A out R RL CC CC p p 2 2 ln - - æ è ç ö ø ÷ (5.165) 5.10.2 Mass transfer in a tube of arbitrary cross section We can generalize the results obtained in Section 5.10.1 to a tube of constant arbitrary cross section.

In many cases, we find that mass transfer coef- ficient data can be correlated with general functions that are very similar in form to these equations. For example, for problems involving forced convection where the fluid is flowing over the surface, we can propose a functional dependence for the Sh on the Re and Sc that is very similar to Equations 5.135 and 5.153, i.e., the Sh = A Rem Scn. The values of A, m, and n can then be found by fitting this equation to experimental mass transfer data. Table 5.1 provides a summary (Cussler, 1984) of some useful mass transfer coefficient correlations for a variety of geometries and flow situations, i.e., both laminar and turbulent flows. 5.11.1 Mass transfer for undeveloped laminar flow in a cylindrical tube A particularly important mass transfer coefficient correlation is for the general case of laminar flow of a fluid within a cylindrical tube. When a fluid containing a solute enters a tube, we assume that the velocity profile and the concentration profile are flat and everywhere the same in the radial direction at the tube entrance. This means that the velocity and concentration profiles in the radial direction will change with axial position as the fluid experiences drag and momentum is lost at the tube wall, and solute mass transfer occurs between the bulk fluid and the surface of the tube. The length averaged mass transfer coefficient (km) for this particular case can be estimated from the following equation (Thomas, 1992): Sh kd D Sc dL Sc dL mtube AB tube tube == + æ è ç ö ø ÷ + æ 366 0 104 10 016 . .Re .Re èè ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú 08.

Recall that a fully developed laminar flow velocity profile is parabolic and is given by Equation 4.7. For the velocity profile to be fully developed at any axial position z, experiments show that z > 0.05 Re dtube. For the concentration profile to be fully developed, we have that z > 0.05 Re Scdtube. If both of these conditions are satisfied, i.e., the flow is fully developed in terms of the velocity and 279 Mass transfer fundamentals Table 5.1 A Selection of Useful Mass Transfer Coefficient Correlations Physical Situation Correlation Sphere in a stagnant fluid kd D msphere AB = 2 Forced convection around a sphere kd D dV D msphere AB sphere AB =+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷20 06 12 13 .. // r m m r Laminar flow over a flat plate at location z kz D Vz D mlocal AB AB = æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷0 323 12 13 . // r m m r Laminar flow over a flat plate kL D VL D m AB AB = æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷0 646 12 13 . // r m m r Laminar flow in a circular tube, short contact time solution kd D Vd D dL mtube AB tube AB tube= æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø 1 615 13 13 . // r m m r ÷÷ 13/ Laminar flow in a circular tube, short contact time solution, at location z kd D Vd D d z mlocaltube AB tube AB tube= æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷1 077 13 13 . // r m m r ææ è ç ö ø ÷ 13/ Laminar flow in a circular tube, undeveloped flow kd D Vd D dLmtube AB tube AB tube =+ æ è ç ö ø ÷æ è ç ö ø ÷ + 366 0 104 10 01 . . . r m m r 66 08 r m m r Vd D dL tube AB tubeæ è ç ö ø ÷æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ .

The plasma will flow through the bioreactor at a total flow rate of 250 mL min−1. The bioreactor consists of a bundle of hollow fibers. The plasma flows on the inside of the hollow fibers and is evenly distributed among them. The total circumferential surface area of these hollow fibers is 5000 cm2, the length of each fiber is 25 cm, and the inside diameter of each fiber is 300 μm. The inside surface of these hollow fibers is covered with an enzyme that rapidly converts the toxic material into a harmless product.

The diffusivity for the toxic material in plasma is 6 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. Solution Since the enzyme reaction at the surface of the hollow fiber is very fast, this means that CAS = 0. The % removal of each hollow fiber will be the same since the plasma flow rate and the enzyme loading for each hollow fiber are assumed to be the same. Hence, we only need to focus on what happens in a given hollow fiber.

The concentration of a drug is maintained at 10 mg L−1 along the inside surface of the hollow fiber. The diffusivity of the drug in blood is 4 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. Estimate the mass transfer coefficient km for the drug. Assuming no drug enters the hollow fiber with the blood, estimate the exiting concentration of the drug in the blood. 5.6 Derive Equation 5.126. 283 Mass transfer fundamentals 5.7 Derive Equations 5.127 and 5.129. 5.8 Starting with Equation 5.143, derive Equation 5.145. 5.9 Derive Equation 5.147. 5.10 A stainless steel disk is coated on one side with a drug called Rocketinfusiola having a MW of 341. The radius of the disk is 0.9 cm. The coated disk is placed in a solution of ethanol, and the disk is then rotated at an angular speed of 80 RPM (RPM = revolutions per minute). The density of ethanol is 0.80 g cm−3 and its viscosity is 1.198 cP. Estimate the dissolution rate of the Rocketinfusiola. The drug’s equilibrium solubility in ethanol is equal to 5.86 mg cm−3. Assume the concentration of the Rocketinfusiola in the bulk solution surrounding the spinning disk is zero and the temperature is 20°C. 5.11 The antibody IgG has a MW of 150,000. Estimate its diffusivity in water at a temperature of 20°C. 5.12 Consider the flow of an aqueous solution within a 400 μm diameter hollow fiber that is 20 cm in length. A drug is impregnated into the wall of the fiber, and the equilibrium solubil- ity of the drug in water is 3 mg L−1. The Reynolds number for the flow conditions is 16,000 and the Schmidt number is 10,000. If the diffusivity of the solute of interest in the water is 0.6 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, what is the maximum total mass transfer rate (mg h−1) of the drug from the fiber surface? 5.13 A particular drug is a solid at 300 K and is soluble in water. The equilibrium solubility of the drug in water is 0.005 g cm−3. The MW of the drug is 600. 100 g of the drug is made into particles that are 0.2 cm in diameter. The density of the drug particles is 1.05 g cm−3. These particles are then very gently mixed in a stirred vessel containing 100 L of water. After 10 min of mixing, estimate how many grams of the drug have dissolved into the water. 5.14 Estimate the diffusivity of a drug in a solvent at 315 K. The MW of the drug is 526. The vis- cosity of the solvent at this temperature is 0.295 cP. 5.15 A flat plate coated with a layer of a volatile organic material is exposed to a parallel flow of air at 20°C with a free stream air velocity of 5 m s−1. The length of the flat plate in the direction of the flow is 0.5 m. Estimate how long it will take for the average thickness of the volatile organic layer to decrease by 1 mm. The saturation concentration of the organic material in air at these conditions is 1.85 × 10−9 mol cm−3, and its diffusivity in air is 0.068 cm2 s−1. The density of the volatile organic material as a solid is 1.21 g cm−3 and its MW is 140.2. Also the kinematic viscosity of air at these conditions is 0.155 cm2 s−1. 5.16 A cylindrical tube 1 cm in diameter and 10 cm in length has a drug immobilized on its surface. The equilibrium solubility of the drug in the fluid flowing through the tube is 100 mg L−1. The fluid flows through the tube at an average velocity of 10 cm s−1. If the exiting concentration CA out( ) of the drug in the fluid is 0.163 mg L−1, estimate the average value of the mass transfer coefficient (km) assuming that there is no drug in the fluid that enters the tube. 5.17 A liquid extraction process is proposed for removing a drug from the solution leaving a fermentation system. As part of the design process, you need to provide an estimate of the diffusivity of this drug at 17°C in the extraction solvent cyclohexane. The MW of the drug is 765 g mol−1. The viscosity of cyclohexane at this temperature is 1.02 cP. 5.18 A spinning disk is being proposed as a room deodorizer. The deodorizer is basically a small cylindrical disk 5 cm in diameter. One side of the disk is coated with a layer of a volatile sub- stance that smells really good. The disk will rotate at 300 RPM, and the average room temper- ature is 20°C. Estimate how long it will take (in hours) for the average thickness of the volatile 284 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering substance layer to decrease by 1 mm. The saturation concentration of the volatile substance in air at these conditions is 3 × 10−8 mol cm−3, and the diffusivity of the volatile substance in air is given by DAB = 0.06 cm2 s−1. Also, the kinematic viscosity of air at these conditions is 0.151 cm2 s−1. The density of the volatile substance layer is 1.1 g cm−3 and its MW is 175 g mol−1. 5.19 A rotating disk 1 cm in diameter is coated on one side with a drug that bears a fluorescent tag that allows for determining its concentration in solution. The spinning disk is placed in 100 cm3 of pure water at 37°C and the disk is spun at 25 RPM. After 60 min, the concentration of the drug in the water was found to equal 0.075 g L−1. The equilibrium solubility of the drug in water at these conditions is 3.0 g L−1. From this information, estimate the diffusivity of the drug in water in cm2 s−1. 5.20 Water containing a solute is flowing through a 0.2 cm diameter tube, which is 50 cm in length, at an average velocity of 1 cm s−1. The temperature of the water is 37°C. The walls of the tube are coated with an enzyme that makes the solute disappear instantly. The solute enters the tube at a concentration of 0.1 M and the solute has a MW of 300 g mol−1. Estimate the fraction of the solute that leaves the tube. 5.21 Yoshida and Ohshima (1966) used a falling liquid film on the outside vertical surface of a cylindrical tube of outside diameter dtube to determine the diffusivity of oxygen in water. The table below presents some of their data for the oxygen and water experiments at 37°C. The solubility of oxygen in water at the gas-liquid interface, i.e., CSA, was found to be 3.12 × 10−5 g cm−3. The outside diameter of the vertical glass tube, i.e., dtube, was 1.03 cm. Analyze their data and find the value of DAB for oxygen diffusion in water at 37°C.

The volume of this disinfectant solution surrounding the contact lens is 50 ml. The disinfectant material has a diffusivity in water of 7.5 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, the viscosity of the solution is 1 cP, and its den- sity is 1 g cm−3. The initial concentration of the disinfectant in this solution is 7.5 mg L−1. The lens is spun at 100 RPM. How long will it take in hours for the disinfectant concentration to decrease to 1 mg L−1 assuming that the disinfectant agent reacts instantaneously at the surface of the contact lens? You can treat the contact lens as a flat disk that is 14.5 mm in diameter. 5.23 A drug with a MW of 700 g mol−1 is added to a solvent at a temperature of 25°C. The solvent viscosity at 25°C is 1.5 cP. Estimate the solute diffusivity in this solvent at this temperature. 285 Mass transfer fundamentals 5.24 The diffusivity of a drug in a solvent is 2.8 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 at a temperature of 25°C. The solvent viscosity at 25°C is 1.25 cP. Estimate the MW of the drug. 5.25 A system for sterilizing a thin cylindrical bone scaffold disk before they are packaged for ship- ment consists of spinning the disk in a sterilization solution. The disinfectant material in this solution has a diffusivity in the solution of 3.0 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, and the viscosity of the solution is 1.2 cP and its density is 1.05 g cm−3. The initial concentration of the disinfecting agent in this solution is 10 mg L−1. The scaffold material is a flat disk that is 15 mm in diameter. The disk is spun at 200 RPM. What volume of disinfecting solution is needed if the requirement is to decrease the disinfectant concentration to 1 mg L−1 in 3.5 h? You can assume that the disinfectant agent reacts instantaneously at the surface of the disk. 5.26 A hollow fiber enzyme reactor (HFER) consists of 5000 fibers. Each fiber has an internal diameter of 0.04 cm, and on the inside surface of the fibers, an enzyme has been immobilized that removes a toxin from plasma that is flowing through the inside of the fibers. The enzyme reaction is very fast so a good assumption is that the concentration of the toxin at the surface of the hollow fiber is equal to zero. The HFER operates at 37°C and the plasma enters at a total flow rate of 200 mL min−1. The concentration of the toxin in the plasma that enters the HFER is 1 mg L−1 and its MW is 636 g mol−1. If the fibers in the HFER are 50 cm in length, what is the concentration of the toxin in the plasma as it leaves the HFER? 5.27 A spheroid of hepatocytes is suspended within a large amount of stagnant nutrient media containing a drug. The experiment is being done to measure the rate of metabolism of this drug by the cells in the spheroid. The spheroid has a diameter of 0.08 cm. At a particular time during the experiment, it was found that the drug concentration in the bulk media solution was equal to 0.190 μmol cm−3 and the drug concentration at the surface of the spheroid of cells was found to be 0.07 μmol cm−3. From these data, determine the reaction rate per volume of spheroid (i.e., μmol L−1 s−1) at which the hepatocyte cells in the spheroid are metabolizing the drug. The diffusivity of this drug in the nutrient media is 7.35 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. 5.28 The diffusivity of a drug in water at 37°C was found to be 6.5 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. What would its diffusivity be in a solvent A at 20°C? The viscosity of solvent A at this temperature is 0.86 cP. 5.29 A solid sphere with a diameter of 2 mm has a thin film of a drug (MW = 475 g mol−1) coated on its surface. Water at 37°C flows past the sphere with an average velocity of 2 cm s−1. The equilibrium solubility of the drug in water at these conditions is 20 μM. If the drug concentra- tion far from the surface of the sphere is zero, calculate the mass transfer rate of the drug from the surface of the sphere in ng s−1. 5.30 It is desired to remove a toxic substance from plasma by passing the plasma through the inside of the hollow fibers of a bioreactor. The flow rate of the plasma is 2000 cm3 min−1, and the bioreactor contains 1000 hollow fibers each with a diameter of 800 μm and a length of 50 cm. The walls of these hollow fibers contain an enzyme coated on their surface that rapidly converts the toxic material into a harmless substance. The toxic substance has a diffusivity in plasma of 6 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, and the viscosity of the plasma is 1.2 cP and its density is 1.02 g cm−3. Estimate the % removal of the toxic substance from the plasma by this device. 5.31 A drug has a measured diffusivity of 5 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 at 37°C. What is this drug’s Stokes- Einstein radius in nm? 5.32 As part of the design of a bioartificial liver, there is a hollow fiber membrane cartridge that treats plasma with activated carbon to remove toxic components that are in the plasma. The plasma to this device comes from a plasmapheresis unit that separates a portion of the plasma from the patient’s blood. The activated carbon particles are in the shell space that surrounds 286 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering the hollow fibers. The plasma therefore flows within the hollow fibers. The plasma flow rate to the device is 250 mL min−1, and there are 6500 hollow fibers in the device. The inside diameter of the hollow fibers is 400 μm. These fibers are microporous and have a very high solute permeability. During the early period of time after the device has been in contact with the plasma, the activated carbon has a very large capacity for the adsorption of toxic materi- als that are present in the plasma. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the concentration of any toxic material in the plasma is zero at the inside surface of the hollow fibers. For a target toxin having a MW of 300 g mol−1, the diffusivity of this solute in the plasma would be about 4.5 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. If the hollow fibers are 40 cm in length, estimate the fractional removal of this toxin during the early phase of the device’s operation. Assume the density of the plasma is 1.024 g cm−3 and the viscosity is 1.2 cP. 5.33 Air at 100oF and 2 atm is being passed over a shallow bed of naphthalene spheres that are 0.5 inch in diameter at a superficial velocity (V0) of 5 ft s−1. The MW of naphthalene is 128.2 g mol−1, and its diffusivity in air at these operating conditions is 0.033 cm2 s−1. The porosity of the bed is 0.40, and the total surface area of the naphthalene particles is 86.3 ft2 for each 1 ft3 of packed bed. The viscosity of air under these conditions is 0.0184 cP and the density of air is 0.0023 g cm−3. The equilibrium concentration of naphthalene in the air under these condi- tions is 0.006 mol L−1. Assuming the concentration of the naphthalene in the air stream is negligible, estimate the initial evaporation rate of the naphthalene in pounds per second from 1 ft3 of bed. 5.34 Genetically modified endothelial cells are grown on the inside surface of a cylindrical hol- low fiber with an internal diameter of 200 μm and a length of 15 cm. This bioreactor is being used to remove toxin A from plasma at 37°C. These cells carry on their surface an enzyme that instantly converts toxin A into a harmless substance. The plasma flows through the hol- low fiber at the rate of 0.75 cm3 min−1. If toxin A enters the bioreactor at a concentration of 0.01 mol L−1, find the toxin concentration at the outlet of the hollow fiber bioreactor. The toxin has a MW of 785 g mol−1. 5.35 A drug has a Stokes-Einstein radius of 0.6 nm. What is its diffusivity (cm2 s−1) in a solvent at 20°C having a viscosity of 0.8 cP? 5.36 The diffusivity of a molecule in a solvent at 25°C was experimentally found to be equal to 4 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. The viscosity of the solvent at these conditions is 0.86 cP. Estimate the molecular radius of this molecule in nanometers (nm). 5.37 A new design for a contact lens cleaning system uses a 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution to kill any bacteria on the lenses. The killing of the bacteria occurs quickly when the lens is in this solution. However, the remaining hydrogen peroxide needs to be neutralized before the lenses can be worn again. It is proposed to neutralize the hydrogen peroxide by having within the lens cleaning container a thin rotating disk that has a catalyst on its surface. The disk is rotated at 200 RPM. As the catalyst disk rotates, the residual hydrogen peroxide diffuses to the surface of the disk where it is instantly converted into water and oxygen according to the following equation: H2O2 → H2O + ½O2. At 25°C, the density of the hydrogen peroxide solu- tion may be assumed to be 1 g cm−3, and the viscosity is 0.90 cP. The diffusivity of hydrogen peroxide in water is 1.43 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide is pretty close to 0.03 g cm−3. The MW of hydrogen peroxide is 34 g mol−1. If the catalyst disk is 5/8 inch in diameter, and both sides of the disk are catalytically active, estimate initially how many milliliters of oxygen per minute will be evolved at a temperature of 25°C and a pressure of 1 atm. The molar density of oxygen as a gas at these conditions is 0.041 mol L−1. 287 Mass transfer fundamentals 5.38 Chloropicrin, also known as PS and nitrochloroform, is a chemical compound currently used as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, and nematicide. In World War I, the Germans used it as tear gas since it is also an airway irritant. This substance is a liq- uid at room temperatures. Suppose there was a small spill of this material on a paved surface at a chemical plant. The spill has a width of 0.8 ft and a length of 2.5 ft. The prevailing wind is 10 miles per hour in a direction parallel to the length of the spilled material. Estimate the rate of evaporation in grams per hour of this material. Chloropicrin has a diffusivity in air of 0.088 cm2 s−1. At 25°C, its vapor pressure is such that its equilibrium concentration in air would be equal to 0.211 g L−1. The kinematic viscosity of air under these conditions is 0.157 cm2 s−1. Carefully state your assumptions. 5.39 Design a hollow fiber plasma oxygenator. The operating conditions are as in Example 5.12. Assume there is no oxygen in the entering plasma and that the saturation oxygen level in plasma is 216 μM. 5.40 Air at 100°C and 1 atm flows over a flat plate of a volatile substance at a free stream velocity of 3 m s−1. The plate is 2 m in length and 0.5 m in width. The viscosity of air at these condi- tions is 0.0215 cP and the density of the air is 948 g m−3. The equilibrium concentration of the volatile substance in the air at the surface of the plate is 64.5 g m−3. What is the total mass transfer rate of the volatile substance from the plate to the air in g min−1? The concentration of the substance in the air far from the surface is zero, and the diffusivity of the volatile substance in the air is 0.094 cm2 s−1. 5.41 Estimate the liquid diffusivity of acetic acid at 25°C in a dilute solution of ethyl acetate. Molecular models of the acetic acid molecule give a molecular radius of about 0.22 nm. The viscosity of the ethyl acetate is 0.462 cP. 5.42 As part of the design of a bioartificial liver, there is a hollow fiber membrane cartridge that first treats the plasma with a mix of immobilized enzymes to remove any toxic components that are in the plasma. The plasma to this device comes from a plasmapheresis unit that separates a portion of the plasma from the patient’s blood. The immobilized enzyme par- ticles are in the shell space that surrounds the hollow fibers. The plasma therefore flows within the hollow fibers. The plasma flow rate to the device is 250 mL min−1 and there are 6500 hollow fibers in the device. The inside diameter of the hollow fibers is 400 μm. The enzyme loading in the shell space is quite large, and the enzyme reactions may be consid- ered to be very fast in comparison to the mass transfer processes. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the concentration of any toxic material in the plasma is zero at the inside surface of the hollow fibers. For a target toxin having a MW of 300 g mol−1, and if the hollow fibers are 25 cm in length, estimate the fractional removal of this toxin from this device. Assume the density of the plasma is 1.024 g cm−3, the viscosity is 1.2 cP, and that the device operates at 37°C. 5.43 A hazardous chemical was spilled into a quiescent pond. The chemical is immiscible with water and has a density of 0.9 g cm−3. A hazmat team estimated that there is a layer of the chemical on the pond surface that is 2 cm in thickness. Measurements made with a portable gas chromatograph show that the vapor film layer above the surface of this chemical layer is about 0.5 cm in thickness. The diffusivity of this chemical in air is known to be 0.03 cm2 s−1. Since the pond is in a remote location, it has been decided to just let the chemical evaporate into the air. Assuming the concentration of the chemical in the bulk air is so low that it can be neglected, estimate how many days this will take. The saturation concentration of the chemi- cal in the air is 6.73 × 10−5 g cm−3. 289 Chapter 6 Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials The heterogeneous nature of biological tissues and medical devices complicates the description of solute mass transfer in these systems. There will be regions where the solute molecule will encounter obstacles that either will hinder the movement of the solute or cannot be penetrated. For example, sol- utes will need to diffuse through porous structures such as the capillary wall or a polymeric membrane, around or through cells, and through fluids containing a variety of macromolecules. The mass transfer of the solute will therefore be affected by the presence of these heterogeneous structures and the compo- nents found in complex macromolecular solutions. Hence, we will have to make suitable adjustments to the solute diffusivity and be careful with how we apply Fick’s first and second laws in these situations. 6.1 Solute diffusion within heterogeneous media To understand mass transfer in heterogeneous materials, we will need to expand our understanding of solute diffusion to see how these heterogeneous structures affect solute diffusion. We will begin by considering as an example the transport of a solute from the blood across the capil- lary wall into the surrounding tissue space. The concepts introduced by this example are general and can be applied to other heterogeneous structures, such as mass transfer across a variety of membranes. Figure 6.1 illustrates the situation for the diffusion of a solute from the blood, through the cell-free plasma layer, across the capillary wall, and into the surrounding tissue space. The figure shows many of the types of solute diffusivity that we will need to consider. These are the solute diffusivity in blood or tissue (DT), the diffusivity in plasma (Dplasma), the diffusivity within a pore of the capillary wall (Dpore), the diffusivity in the interstitial fluid (D0), and the diffusivity through cells (Dcell). The following discussion will show how to relate these various solute diffusivities to the diffusivity of the solute in a homogeneous medium, like water, where we defined the solute diffusivity as DAB. 6.1.1 Solute transport across thin porous membranes For solute transport by diffusion through the pores of the capillary wall, or a porous membrane in general, the available surface area for mass transfer of the solute is not the total surface area of the membrane, i.e., S, but the pore area, AP. The porosity, i.e., ε, of the membrane is the volume fraction of the porous void volume within the membrane divided by the total membrane volume. The poros- ity, i.e., ε, of the membrane is then given by AP/S. The solute itself is only soluble in the fluid contained within the pores and is not soluble in the  continuous nonporous phase. Furthermore, in many cases, the pores are not perfectly straight and will have a length greater than the membrane thickness, L. This means the solute must follow a path through the pores that is tortuous, making the diffusion distance greater than the thickness Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 290 of the membrane. We account for this tortuous diffusion distance by the tortuosity (τ), which when multiplied by the thickness of the membrane, i.e., τ × L, gives the total pore diffusion distance. 6.1.1.1 Steric exclusion and hindered diffusion In many cases in pore diffusion, the solute radius, i.e., a, is also comparable to that of the pore radius, r. This leads to two additional effects, both reduc- ing the diffusivity of the solute within the pore. The first effect, called steric exclusion, is illustrated in Figure 6.2. Steric exclusion restricts the ability of the solute from entering the pore from the bulk solu- tion. In Figure 6.2, we see that to a first approximation, a solute can get no closer to the pore wall than its radius (a). Therefore, only a fraction of the pore cross-sectional area is available to the molecule. The fraction of the pore cross-sectional area available to the solute is given by the following ratio: K ra r a r C C A pore A bulk poremouth = -() =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ = p p 2 2 2 1 (6.1) Solute Capillary Capillary wall Capillary pore Cell Blood flow Tissue space Interstitial fluid space Dplasma Dcell D0 DT Dpore Dcell DT Red blood cell L Figure 6.1 Solute transport from blood. Pore in capillary wall or a synthetic membrane Solute of radius a r r–a Figure 6.2 Steric exclusion. Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 291 where K is also known as the solute partition coefficient. Because of steric exclusion, the equilib- rium concentration of the solute is lower at the pore mouth than in the bulk solution adjacent to the pore entrance, i.e., CA pore∣pore mouth < CA bulk∣pore mouth. This simple expression for K ignores any sec- ondary attractive or repulsive interactions between the solute and the pore and basically treats the molecule as a hard sphere. Attractive forces between the solute and the pore will tend to increase the value of K, and repulsive forces will decrease the value of K, relative to that based on steric exclu- sion alone. In these cases, it is best to measure K experimentally. As the solute molecule diffuses through the pore, it experiences hydrodynamic drag caused by the flow of the solvent over the surface of the solute. This is shown in Figure 6.3. As the solute radius increases relative to that of the pore radius, this hydrodynamic drag increases, reducing or restricting the diffusion of the solute through the pore compared to its motion in the bulk fluid. This drag effect on the solute in the pore results in a decrease in the solute diffusivity within the pore relative to its value in the bulk solution and is called restricted or hindered diffusion. 6.1.1.2 Solute diffusion in a single pore of a thin planar membrane Now we can apply Fick’s first law to the situation of solute diffusion through a single straight cylindrical pore. Letting x denote the direction along the length of the pore, we can write the following steady-state solute balance over a control volume from x to x + Δx as shown below: 0 22=- -- + pprD dC dx rD dC dx pore A pore x pore A pore xxD (6.2) In Equation 6.2 Dpore is the diffusivity of the solute in the fluid contained within the pore CA pore is the solute concentration within the pore Dividing by Δx, and taking the limit as Δx → 0, Equation 6.2 becomes dC dx A pore 2 2 0= (6.3) If we integrate Equation 6.3 once, we find that dCA pore/dx = C1, which says that the solute flux within the pore of a thin planar membrane is equal to a constant. If we integrate this result, we then get that CA pore(x) = C1 x + C2, where C1 and C2 are the integration constants. This shows that the solute concentration profile within the pore of a thin planar membrane is linear. Capillary pore Figure 6.3 Solvent flow across solute in small pores increases drag. Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 292 The integration constants, i.e., C1 and C2, can be found from the boundary conditions (BCs) at the entrance and exit of the pore. At the pore entrance, where x = 0, we have that C CA poreA pore x= =0 , and at the pore exit, where xL= , we have C CA poreA pore xL= = . Using these boundary conditions, we find for a thin planar membrane that C CA pore x 2 0= = and C CC /L dC /dx.A pore xL A pore x A pore1 0=-() = == The concentration profile along the length of the pore is then given by C xC CC x L A poreA pore x A pore x A pore xL() =- -() == =00 (6.4) From Fick’s first law for a dilute solution, we have for the solute flux within the pore that N D dC dx D CC L Ax pore pore A pore pore A pore xL A pore x =- =- - ==0 (6.5) The solute concentration within the pore is difficult to measure. However, the bulk concentrations of the solute outside the membrane are known. We can relate the solute concentrations within the pore at the entrance and exit of the pore to the bulk solute concentration just outside the pore by the partition coefficient given by Equation 6.1. Hence, Equation 6.5 can be written as N D CC L DK CC Ax pore pore A pore xL A pore x pore A bulk xL A bulk=- - =- - == =0 xx L =0 (6.6) Next, we can account for the tortuous nature of the pore by increasing the membrane thickness, i.e., L, by the tortuosity, τ. Also, because of the hindered or restricted diffusion effect within the pore, the value of Dpore will be smaller than the value of DAB by a factor we will call ωr, which we expect to depend on the ratio of the solute radius to the pore radius, i.e., a/r. With these adjustments, Equation 6.6 becomes N DK CC L D K C Ax pore pore A bulk xL A bulk x AB r A bulk x =- - =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ == =0 w t LL A bulk xC L - =0 (6.7) Equation 6.7 gives the solute flux in a given pore of a thin planar membrane written in terms of the measurable bulk solute concentrations at the surface on either side of the membrane. From Equation 6.7, we see that the diffusivity of the solute in the pore, i.e., Dpore, and the solute diffusivity across a single membrane pore relative to the bulk solute concentrations, i.e., Dm, are defined as DD DKDD poreAB r m poreAB r = == æ è ç ö ø ÷ w t w t K (6.8) 6.1.1.3 Solute diffusion across a thin planar membrane To find the solute flux for a membrane of total surface area S, and a total cross-sectional pore area of AP, we multiply NAx pore by the total area of all the pores, i.e., AP, which gives the total mass transfer rate, and then we divide that result by the total membrane area, i.e., S, to get the solute flux based on the total membrane area, i.e., NAx: N A S ND A S K CC L D C Ax P Ax pore AB Pr A bulk xL A bulk x e=´ =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ - =- ==w t 0 AA bulk xL A bulk xC L ==- 0 (6.9) Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 293 where De is called the effective diffusivity of the solute for a heterogeneous membrane material.

For mass transfer across a thin planar membrane placed between two well-stirred solutions, the sol- ute mass transfer rate across the membrane of total surface area S is then given by \u0000m SD CC L Ae A bulk x A bulk xL = - ==0 (6.11) 6.1.1.4 The Renkin equation Beck and Schultz (1970) studied the diffusion of a variety of solutes across track-etched mica membranes. The mica membranes were bombarded with U235 fission frag- ments. The etched particle tracks that were formed resulted in relatively straight pores (i.e., τ = 1) with a narrow pore size distribution. Their data for a number of solutes is shown in Figure 6.4, where the ratio of the solute diffusivity in a membrane pore (Dm) based on the bulk solute con- centrations and the bulk diffusivity (DAB) is plotted as function of the ratio of the solute radius to pore radius, i.e., λ = a/r. We see that this hindered diffusion effect significantly affects the solute diffusivity. Note from Figure 6.4 that when the solute radius is only one-tenth of the pore radius, the solute diffusivity is reduced by about 40%. When λ is equal to 0.40, the solute diffusivity has been reduced by nearly 90%. 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1Dm/DAB a/r Equation 6.12 Figure 6.4 Solute diffusivity in the pores of a membrane. (Data from Beck, R.E. and Schultz, J.S., Science, 170, 1302, 1970.) Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 294 According to Equation 6.8, we have τ = 1 in their experiments, Dm/DAB = Kωr, and the data in Figure 6.4 shows that Kωr is only a function of λ = a/r. The solid line in Figure 6.4 represents the fit of the Renkin equation (1954) to their data, which is given by the following expression: D D K a r a r a r m AB r æ è ç ö ø ÷ == - æ è ç ö ø ÷ - æ è ç ö ø ÷ + æ è ç ö ø ÷ - =t w 1 23 11 21 209.. 0095 5 . a r æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú (6.12) We see that the Renkin equation describes their data rather well. The first term in parentheses on the right-hand side of Equation 6.12 is the partition coefficient, i.e., K, given by Equation 6.1, and rep- resents the effect of steric exclusion, or the reduction in the solute concentration at the pore mouth compared to its value in the well-stirred bulk solution. The bracketed term on the right-hand side of Equation 6.12 is the hindered diffusion term, i.e., wr a r a r a r =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ + æ è ç ö ø ÷ - æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ 12 12 09 095 35 .. . (6.13) and accounts for the increased hydrodynamic drag in a pore comparable in size to that of the solute. Additional expressions for describing the hindered diffusion of large molecules in liquid-filled pores can be found in the review paper by Deen (1987). Example 6.1 Estimate the diffusivity (Dm) of ovalbumin at 25°C through the cylindrical pores of a mem- brane that are 28 nm in diameter. The pores have a tortuosity of 1.2. Assume that the molecule enters the pores of the membrane from a well-stirred bulk solution. Solution Cussler (1984) gives the ovalbumin diffusivity as 7.8 × 10−7 cm2 s−1. In Example 5.1, we estimated that this solute has a radius of 2.61 nm. The pore radius is given as 14 nm, so λ = 2.61 nm/14 nm = 0.186. With these values, we can then use Equation 6.12 to find Kωr, which is equal to 0.413. Next, we calculate Dm from Equation 6.8: DD K cm scmmAB r= æ è ç ö ø ÷ =´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ =´ -- -w t 78 10 0 413 12 2 685 10 72 17. . . . 221s- Example 6.2 Suppose the concentration of ovalbumin in the previous example is 5 g L−1 in the bulk solution at the entrance to the pore and 0 g L−1 at the pore exit. Calculate the ovalbumin solute flux in g cm−2 s−1 through a 28 nm diameter pore assuming its length is 0.02 cm and the tortuosity of the pore is 1.2. Consider next a membrane with a total surface area of 100 cm2 that consists of a multitude of these pores such that the porosity of the membrane (ε) is 0.40. Calculate the total ovalbumin transport rate in g h−1 for the membrane. Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 295 Solution To calculate the solute flux across a single pore, we use Equation 6.7 and the value of Dm from Example 6.1: N D K CC L D CC Ax pore AB r A bulk xL A bulk x m A bulk xL A=- æ è ç ö ø ÷ - =- - == =w t 0 bbulk x Ax pore L N cm s gL L cm = -- - =- ´´ -() ´ 0 72 1 1 3 2 685 10 05 1 1000 002 . . ccm gcms=´ -- -6 713 10 82 1.

This ratio, i.e., D/Le , is called the membrane permeability (Pm) and is often used to describe solute transport across a membrane. The membrane permeability lumps together all of the membrane properties that affect the transport of the solute across the membrane. In terms of the membrane permeability, we can rewrite Equation 6.11 for the solute mass transfer rate across the membrane as \u0000m PS CCAm A bulk x A bulk xL=-() ==0 (6.14) From Equations 6.9 and 6.10, we see that for microporous membranes, the membrane permeability can be expressed in terms of the membrane properties as P D L D L A S K m eABP r== æ è ç ö ø ÷æ è ç ö ø ÷ w t (6.15) For a membrane with cylindrically shaped pores, the quantity Kωr can be estimated from the Renkin equation given by Equation 6.12. The porosity of the membrane, i.e., ε = AP/S, is usually known or easily measured for a given membrane. The tortuosity, i.e., τ, is best measured from experiments of solute mass transfer rates across the membrane. Tortuosity usually falls in the range from 2 to 6 (Cussler, 1984) and, in the absence of any other information, is on the order of 1/ε. 6.1.1.6 Capillary wall solute permeability We can also use Equation 6.14 to describe solute trans- port across the capillary wall. The intercellular cleft, as shown in Figures 3.2 and 3.3, forms pores through which the solute diffuses. The capillary wall for many solutes that are lipid insoluble is therefore like a microporous membrane. Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 296 For solute transport by diffusion through capillary pores, it is more convenient to work with the product of Pm and S, rather than specific values of Pm or S. Hence, Renkin and Curry (1979) sum- marized their results for solutes of various sizes in continuous capillaries in terms of PmS. These data are shown in Figure 6.5. Note that in some cases for a given solute size, the value of PmS can vary by almost an order of magnitude. This arises from molecular shape effects, hydration of the solute that increases the effective diffusion size of the solute, and other interactions between the solute and the capillary wall. In addition, fenestrated and discontinuous capillaries can have PmS values that are several orders of magnitudes higher than those given in Figure 6.5. The solid lines in Figure 6.5 represent a linear least square regression of the data. The following empirical equations can be used to estimate capillary PmS values for a given solute of radius (a).

(6.16) 6.1.1.7 Membrane permeability and the overall mass transfer coefficient In many medical devices, a membrane separates two fluid regions. The solute is transported from one fluid region, across the membrane, and then into the other fluid region. These transport processes are illustrated in Figure 6.6 where the solute is transported from region 1 to region 2, since we will assume that C CA bulk A bulk12> . The concentrations of the solute at the fluid-membrane interfaces are assumed to be at equilibrium, and the partition coefficient (K) is used to describe the solute equilibrium at the membrane surfaces.

(eds.), Springer-Verlag, New York, 1979, Chapter 1.) Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 297 As shown in Figure 6.6, the solute concentration just inside the membrane is related to the bulk concentration adjacent to the outside of the membrane surface by the following relationships, C KCA membrane x A surface x== = 00 and C KCA membrane xL A surface xL== = . If a fluid region is well mixed, then the solute concentration at the surface of the membrane is the same as its concentration in the bulk fluid, i.e., CA bulk1 or CA bulk2. Each of these fluid regions, as well as the membrane itself, acts as a resistance to the transport of the solute. These individual mass transfer resistances can be combined into an overall mass transfer coefficient (KO) defined in terms of the overall mass transfer driving force based on the bulk fluid concentrations, i.e., CCA bulk A bulk12-( ). The solute mass transfer rate is then given as \u0000m KS CCAO A bulk A bulk=-() 12 (6.17) The overall mass transfer coefficient can be written in terms of the mass transfer coefficients of the respective fluid regions, i.e., km 1() and km 2(), and the membrane permeability, Pm. The mass transfer coefficients and Pm are conductances, and their reciprocal represents the solute mass transfer resis- tance. These mass transfer resistances occur in a series, and by analogy to an electrical circuit, we can then write that the overall resistance is the sum of the individual resistances. The overall mass transfer coefficient is then given by 11 11 12K k P kO m m m =+ + () () (6.18) The smallest value of km 1(), Pm, or km 2() for a given solute is said to be the controlling resistance.

Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 298 The mass transfer coefficients in Equation 6.18 can be estimated using the correlations we discussed in Chapter 5. The mass transfer coefficients depend on the physical properties of the fluid regions and the nature of the flow in each of the fluid regions. They also can depend on the position due to boundary layer growth, so we usually use length-averaged values of the mass transfer coefficients in Equation 6.18. The membrane permeability, although best measured experimentally (Dionne et al., 1996; Baker et al., 1997), is defined by Equation 6.15. 6.1.2 Diffusion of a solute from within a porous polymeric material Biocompatible polymers are widely used in a variety of medical devices and for the controlled release of a variety of drugs (Ritger and Peppas, 1987; Serra et al., 2006). Many of these polymeric materials also have a microporous structure. Consider the situation shown in Figure 6.7. A drug is uniformly distributed within a microporous polymeric disk of radius R and thickness L. The disk is very thin so R ≫ L making the diffusion pro- cess one dimensional in the x direction. All of the surfaces of the disk are coated with an imperme- able material except for the surface located at x = L. Since the drug release is assumed to occur over a long period of time, which can be many days or weeks, the rate-limiting process for the release of the drug from the polymeric support at x = L is diffusion of the drug through the polymeric material. The concentration of the solute is expressed in terms of the void volume of the polymeric structure, where ε is the void volume fraction or the porosity.

Dividing by SεΔx, and taking the limit as Δx → 0, gives Fick’s second law for the one-dimensional diffusion of the solute within the polymeric material: ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ C t D C x A e A 2 2 (6.19) Since the solute is diffusing through a heterogeneous polymeric structure, we use the effective dif- fusivity, i.e., De, to describe the diffusion of the solute through the void space within the polymeric material. In this case, De = DAB(ωr/τ), where we adjust the solute diffusivity in the solvent-filled pores to account for hindered diffusion and the tortuosity of the void space. The initial concentration of the drug in the material is CA 0 , and the drug concentration at x = L is zero since we assume the drug is immediately taken up by the surroundings, a process that is much faster x L t= 0 CA =CA 0 t>0 CA(L)=0 x x+∆x R Figure 6.7 Diffusion of a solute within a polymeric disk.

A solution to Equations 6.19 and 6.20 can be obtained using the separation of variables technique, which will be briefly described in the following discussion (check out any advanced calculus book for more information on this technique). We let CA(x, t) be given by the product of a function that depends only on x, i.e., F(x), and we define another function that depends only on t, i.e., T(t). Therefore, CA(x, t) = F(x) T(t). We substitute this equation into Equation 6.19 and obtain 11 2 2 2 TD dT dt F dF dxe == -l (6.21) Note that the term on the left side of the previous equation depends only on t and the term in the middle only depends on x. The only way they can then be equal to each other is if they equal the same constant, i.e., λ2. The minus sign is in front of λ2 in order to obtain a solution that remains finite as time increases. Equation 6.21 can then be rearranged to give the following two ordinary differential equations: dT dt DT and dF dx Fe=- +=ll 2 2 2 2 0 (6.22) These equations can then be integrated to give TC eand FC xC x Dte== + - 12 3 2l llsincos (6.23) Applying boundary conditions 1 and 2 on the expression for F, we obtain that C2 = 0 and that C3 cos λL = 0. C3 cannot be equal to zero since that provides a trivial solution. Because of the periodic nature of the cosine function, there are an infinite number of λ’s that can satisfy the condition that the cos λL = 0. It is easy to show that these λ’s are given by l p n n L forn= +æ è ç ö ø ÷ =¼¥ 21 2 012,, , (6.24) The λn are also known as eigenvalues, and the cos λnx are known as the eigenfunctions. The nth value of our solution is then given by C x,t Ce x,An n Dt n ne() = -l l 2 cos for n = 0, 1, 2, … ∞. Each value of n gives us a solution to the original partial differential equation, i.e., Equation 6.19, that Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 300 satisfies boundary conditions 1 and 2. We can also sum all of these n solutions and obtain the fol- lowing general solution: C x,t Ce xA n n Dt n ne() = = ¥ -å 0 2l lcos (6.25) The Cn’s can then be obtained by requiring that this equation satisfies the initial condition in Equation 6.20; hence, at t = 0, Equation 6.25 becomes C CxA n nn 0 0 = = ¥ å cos l (6.26) Next, we multiply both sides of Equation 6.26 by cos λmx and integrate from x = 0 to x = L.

Hence, we then can solve Equation 6.28 for Cn, which is given by C C n n A n = -() +() 41 21 0 p (6.29) Combining Equations 6.25 and 6.29 then provides the solution for the concentration distribution of the drug or solute within the polymeric material.

This is discussed later in Chapter 8. The amount of drug or solute remaining in the polymeric material at any time t is also of interest. Since S is the total surface area of the polymeric material normal to the diffusion direction, then the total amount of drug (A0) initially present in the polymeric material is equal to A CSL,A0 0=e where CA 0 was defined in terms of the void volume of the polymeric material that contains the drug or solute. The amount of drug remaining in the polymeric material at time t, i.e., A(t), is then given by integrating the concentration distribution at any time t, i.e., Equation 6.30, from x = 0 to x = L: A tS C x,t dx A n e L A n nD t L e () = () = +()ò å = ¥ - +() e p p 0 2 0 0 2 21 481 21 2 2 2 (6.32) We can also define the cumulative fraction of the drug (fR) that has been released as the amount of drug released, i.e., A0 – A(t), divided by the amount of drug originally present, i.e., A0.

In this case, Equation 6.19 still describes the diffusion of the drug within the polymeric material; however, we replace x with y, which represents the distance into the material from the exposed surface. The boundary conditions are given by IC tC y,t C BC yC BC yC C AA A AA :, :, :, = () = == =¥ = 0 10 0 2 0 0 (6.34) Boundary condition 2 expresses the fact that at distances far from the exposed surface, the drug concentration within the polymeric material is still equal to its initial value. Equations 6.19 and 6.34 can be solved using the Laplace transform technique. If we let C CCAA A ¢ º- 0 , then Equation 6.19 remains the same with the exception that CA is replaced by CA ¢ and the initial and boundary conditions given in Equation 3.4 become IC tC y,t BC yC C BC yC A AA A :, :, :, = () = == =¥ = ¢ ¢ ¢ 00 10 20 0 (6.35) Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 302 The solution to this problem for CA ¢ using Laplace transforms is identical to the solution we obtained earlier for Equations 5.46 and 5.51, which is given by Equation 5.54. Using that solution, it is easy to show that C y,t Cerf y Dt AA e () = æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ 0 4 (6.36) The flux of a drug from the surface at x = L is given by N D C y Ay y e A y = = =- 0 0 ¶ ¶ .

Hence, f AA t AL Dt D L tR ee= - () == 0 0 2 1214 4 4pp / (6.39) Equation 6.39 shows that for short contact times, a plot of the fraction of the drug released, i.e., fR, versus t1/2 is linear with a zero intercept and a slope, m, equal to 4 4 2 D L e p . This provides a convenient method for finding the effective diffusivity of a solute within a polymeric structure as illustrated in Example 6.3. This short contact time solution is valid for 0 ≤ fR ≤ 0.4. Example 6.3 Bawa et al. (1985) investigated the release of macromolecules from small slabs of a polymeric material made of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer. The polymeric material was formed into slabs that were 1 cm × 1 cm and 1 mm in thickness. All surfaces of the slab were coated with paraffin except one 1 cm × 1 cm face, which was exposed to the surroundings. During the Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 303 formation of the polymeric slabs, bovine serum albumin (BSA) particles were incorporated within the polymer, forming a system of interconnected pores after the BSA became solubi- lized when the polymeric slabs were immersed in an aqueous solution. In one case, the BSA particles ranged in size from 106 to 150 μm, and the cumulative fraction of BSA released (i.e., fR) as a function of the square root of the time was measured as shown in the table. From these data, estimate the effective diffusivity of BSA within the polymeric material.

The solid line is a linear regression of these data with a zero intercept. As shown in the figure, we obtain an excellent fit of Equation 6.39 to the experimental data.

Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 304 From Equation 6.39, this value of the slope, i.e., m, is equal to 4 4 2 D L e p . Hence, we can solve for the value of De as shown next: Dm Lh cm cm he == ´() ´´() =´ -- -1 4 1 4 0 01678 01 22110 22 2 1 2 62 1pp.. . The same value of De was also found when a nonlinear regression of these data was done using the exact solution for fR versus t given by Equation 6.33. 6.1.2.2 A solution valid for long contact times For long contact times, the summation term in Equation 6.33 for the fractional release converges rapidly. In this case, we can use just the n = 0 term of the summation for which Equation 6.33 becomes f eR Dt L e =- - 1 8 2 4 2 2 p p (6.40) This equation has been found to be valid for 0.4 ≤ fR ≤ 1. Equation 6.40 can be rearranged to give a form that is convenient for analyzing fractional release data. ln ln1 8 4 2 2 2-() = æ è ç ö ø ÷ - æ è ç ö ø ÷f D L tR e p p (6.41) Equation 6.41 shows that a plot of ln(1 – fR) versus t will be linear and from the slope, m, we can find the value of De, i.e., D Lm e =- 4 2 2p (6.42) 6.1.3 Diffusion in blood and tissue In heterogeneous regions like the blood or tissue, the solute can diffuse through both the continu- ous fluid space and through the cells themselves. For solute diffusion in the blood or the tissue, we let DT represent the effective diffusivity of the solute through this heterogeneous region. One approach for estimating DT is based on a model developed by Maxwell (1873). D D DD DD DD DD T cell cell cell cell0 00 00 22 2 = +- -() ++ -() f f (6.43) Interestingly, we see that Equation 6.43 does not depend on the size of the cells, but only on their volume fraction, ϕ. In Equation 6.43, Dcell is the diffusivity of the solute in the cells. For a Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 305 lipid-insoluble solute, Dcell, in the absence of any data, can be taken to be equal to zero. If Dcell = 0, then Equation 6.43 simplifies to D D T 0 21 2 2 3 = -() + = - f f e e (6.44) where ε is the void fraction within the tissue space, which is equal to 1 − ϕ. If the cell volume frac- tion is 0.85 and Dcell = 0, then the solute diffusivity is about 10% of its value in the fluid phase. Riley et al. (1994, 1995a–c, 1996) have developed an empirical relation based on Monte Carlo simulations for DT/D0 that shows good agreement with available data throughout a wide range of cell volume fractions, i.e., 0.04 < ϕ < 0.95. D D D D T cell 00 2311 1 727 0 8177 0 09075=- - æ è ç ö ø ÷ -+().. .ff f (6.45) In Equations 6.43 through 6.45, D0 is the diffusivity of the solute through the interstitial fluid space or, in the case of blood, through plasma, for which D0 = Dplasma. For plasma, we can use the Stokes- Einstein relation, i.e., Equations 5.40 and 5.42, to estimate the solute diffusivity in plasma, i.e., D0 = Dplasma. In order to do this, we adjust the diffusivity of the solute in water, i.e., DAB, for the increased viscosity of plasma relative to that of water. Using this approach, the diffusivity of a solute in plasma at 37°C is given by the following equation: DD cP cP Dplasma AB AB=´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = 0 691 12 0 576 . . . (6.46) 6.1.3.1 Diffusion in the interstitial fluid and other gel-like materials The interstitial fluid that lies between the cells has a hydrogel-like consistency due to the presence of a variety of macromolecules like collagen and glycosaminoglycans. Therefore, the solute must diffuse through and around this random network of macromolecular obstacles. The reduction in the solute diffusivity relative to its value in pure water (DAB) due to this network of macromolecules within the interstitial fluid or a gel- like material can be described by the following equation developed by Brinkman (1947). D D aaAB r 0 2 1 1 1 3 == ++ () w kk (6.47) where the ratio of D0 to DAB is equal to the solute diffusional hindrance caused by the macromole- cules in the interstitial fluid and depends on the solute radius, i.e., a, and one adjustable parameter, κ. κ is a function of the gel’s microstructure and can be found by fitting the above equation to experi- mental data for solute diffusion in the gel. The steric exclusion, or equilibrium partitioning, of a solute upon entrance from a bulk solution into a gel-like material such as the interstitial fluid can be described by the following equation developed by Ogston (1958): K a af =- + æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú exp f 1 2 (6.48) Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 306 In this equation, af represents the radius of the macromolecules, which are assumed to form very long cylindrical fibers. If the length of these fibers per volume of gel is given in terms of l, then the volume fraction of these macromolecular fibers is given by fp= alf 2 (Tong and Anderson, 1996). Nugent and Jain (1984a,b) examined the diffusion of various-sized solutes through normal and tumor tissue. Their results are shown in Figure 6.9, where we see the ratio of the solute diffusivity in tissue, i.e., DT, to its aqueous diffusivity, i.e., DAB, plotted as a function of the solute radius. This figure can also be used to estimate solute diffusivities in tissue. 6.1.4 Solute transport across gel membranes The effective diffusivity, i.e., De, of a solute diffusing from one fluid region across a gel-like membrane into a second fluid region, as in Figure 6.6, is given by De = KD0 = KωrDAB. In terms of Equations 6.47 and 6.48, this becomes DD a a aa eAB f = -+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú ++ () exp f kk 1 1 1 3 2 2 (6.49)DT/DAB 0 1 2 3 4 56 10–3 10–2 10–1 100 Solute radius, nm Figure 6.9 Effective diffusivity (DT) in tissue as a function of the solute radius.

Tong and Anderson (1996) showed that Equation 6.49 provided excellent representation of the par- titioning and diffusion of two representative globular proteins (albumin and ribonuclease-A) in a polyacrylamide gel (see Problems 6.2, 6.3, and 6.5 at the end of this chapter). Example 6.4 The antibody IgG is diffusing from a bulk solution across a 5% agarose hydrogel membrane into another bulk solution. The membrane is 1 mm in thickness and the temperature of this system is at 37°C. The radius (a) of the IgG molecule based on Equation 5.41 and its molecu- lar weight of 150,000 is estimated to be 3.90 nm. The polymer fibers in the hydrogel have a radius (af) of 2.79 nm. The volume fraction of the polymer fibers in the hydrogel is ϕ = 0.05 and the value of κ is 0.57. Estimate the effective diffusivity and the membrane permeability of IgG in this hydrogel membrane. Solution Since the IgG is diffusing across a gel membrane in contact with bulk solutions on either side of the membrane, we can use Equation 6.49 to find the effective diffusivity of this solute. The diffusivity of IgG in water at 37°C can be estimated from Figure 5.1 or by Equation 5.35 from which we find that DAB = 4.21 × 10−7 cm2 s−1.

These driving forces include differences in pressure, concentration, and even the electrical potential across the membrane. In this discussion, we will ignore electrical potential gradients and just focus Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 308 on the pressure and concentration driving forces. Electrical potential effects are discussed in Cussler (1984) and Grodzinsky (2011). The presence of pressure and concentration differences across a membrane means that solute mass transfer can occur by a combination of bulk flow or convection, and by diffusion. The convective flow across a membrane is also called a filtration flow. In some cases, the relative magnitudes of the diffusive and convective transport rates for a given solute are comparable, and we must consider the fact that these processes are therefore interdepen- dent. This interaction makes the description of the solute transport rate much more complicated and to arrive at the proper result requires an understanding of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. The application of irreversible thermodynamics to membrane transport was developed by Staverman (1948) and Kedem and Katchalsky (1958). For dilute solutions, the theory of irreversible thermo- dynamics states that the filtration rate of the solvent (Q) across the membrane and the filtration rate due to the solute relative to that of the solvent (QV) both depend in a linear manner on the driving forces ΔP and RTΔCA. This linear combination of the driving forces is then given by the following equations for a membrane of surface area S: QSLP SL RT CPPSA=+DD (6.51) QSLP SL RT CVSPS A=+DD (6.52) Q and QV must have the correct sign sense for proper interpretation. This is easily accomplished if we simply assume in our analyses a vertical orientation for the membrane. The solute concentration is higher in the solution to the left of the membrane than in the solution to the right of the membrane. The flow of solvent and solute from left to right is considered positive. The Δ sign in this case also represents the value of the property (P or CA) on the left side of the membrane minus the correspond- ing value on the right side of the membrane. The cross coefficients (LPS and LSP) in Equations 6.51 and 6.52 represent secondary effects that are caused by the primary driving forces. For example, the primary ΔP driving force generates the filtra- tion flow (Q) and also induces a relative flow (QV) between solute and solvent represented by LSPΔP. This relative flow between the solute and solvent is capable of producing a separation of solute and solvent and is referred to as ultrafiltration. Along the same line of reasoning, the RTΔCA primary driving force is responsible for solute diffu- sion. This diffusive transport produces an additional contribution to the filtration flow that is given by LPSRTΔCA, and from Equation 3.1, Van’t Hoff’s equation, we recognize this as an osmotic flow. The coefficient LP in Equation 6.51 is the hydraulic conductance of the membrane defined earlier by Equations 3.4 and 3.7. We will soon show that LS in Equation 6.52 is related to the permeability of the membrane, i.e., Pm. Another basic theorem from the work of Onsager is that the cross coefficients LSP and LPS are equal. We can then simplify Equations 6.51 and 6.52 as follows: QL SP RT CPA=-()Ds D (6.53) Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 309 QL SP L L RT CVP S P A=- + æ è ç ö ø ÷sDD (6.54) The parameter σ, defined as −(LSP/LP) or −(LPS/LP), is called the Staverman reflection coefficient. Note the similarity between the filtration flow rate (Q) in Equation 6.53 and that given by Equation 3.4, recognizing that RTΔC is equivalent to (ΠC − ΠIF). These equations are identical when σ = 1, which implies that the pores of the membrane are impermeable to the solute as required by the derivation of Equation 3.4. The solute is therefore completely “reflected” by the membrane, and the RTΔCA term in Equation 6.53 is the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane. When σ = 0 in Equation 6.53, we have that Q = LP SΔP. This result is also known as Darcy’s law, which says that the filtration flow of the solution is proportional to the pressure drop across the mem- brane. Also, in this case, there is no secondary effect of osmotic flow caused by the primary con- centration difference driving force. This means that the solute flows through the pores completely unimpeded, just as easily as the solvent; hence, the solute is not “reflected” and σ = 0. The concept of the reflection coefficient is illustrated in Figure 6.10. The total mass transfer rate of the solute, i.e., \u0000mA, across the membrane is given by the product of the average solute concentration ( \u0000CA) within the membrane and the combined flow rate of the solu- tion due to the applied pressure and concentration differences, i.e., \u0000 \u0000m CQ QAA V=+(). Combining Equations 6.53 and 6.54 in this fashion results in Equation 6.55 for the mass transfer rate of the solute across the membrane. \u0000 \u0000m CL SP L L RT CAA P S P A=-() +- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú1 ss DD (6.55) This equation can be rewritten by using Equation 6.53 to express ΔP as a function of Q and ΔCA.

Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 310 The second term in Equation 6.56 has the following factor, i.e., ((LS/LP) − σ2), that must be deter- mined. Recognizing for the case of no filtration flow that Q = 0 and diffusion is the only solute transport mechanism, then by Equation 6.53 we have DPRTC Q A Q=== 00sD (6.57) Substituting this expression into Equation 6.54 for the case where Q = 0 and with \u0000 \u0000m CQAA V= gives Equation 6.58, where we must recognize that in the absence of Q, the transport rate of the solute across the membrane must be equal to our previous result given by Equation 6.14 or 6.50. \u0000 \u0000m CL SRTC L L PS CA Q AP A Q S P mA Q= = == () - æ è ç ö ø ÷ = 0 0 2 0Ds D (6.58) We can then solve Equation 6.58 for ((LS/LP) − σ2), which is given by L L P LRTC S P m PA - æ è ç ö ø ÷ =s2 \u0000 (6.59) where Pm is the membrane permeability. Equation 6.56 can now be simplified using Equation 6.59 to give our final result for the solute transport across a membrane, recognizing that Q is the filtration flow rate given earlier by Equation 6.53. \u0000 \u0000m CQ PS CAA mA=-() +1 sD (6.60) where \u0000CA represents the average solute concentration in the membrane ΔCA is the solute concentration difference across the membrane This is an interesting result. We went through a lot of mathematics to get a result that confirms our engineering intuition. Equation 6.60 says that the solute mass transfer rate across the membrane is the sum of the amount carried by the filtration flow plus the amount that diffuses. That is, the first term on the right-hand side of Equation 6.60 represents the amount of solute transported by the con- vective or filtration flow of the solvent across the membrane corrected for solute reflection and the second term represents the contribution of diffusion to the solute transport rate. 6.2.1 Finding LP, Pm, and σ In a general sense, we must know the three parameters, LP, Pm, and σ, in Equations 6.53 and 6.60 to calculate the mass transfer of a solute across a membrane. Recall that LP is the hydraulic conduc- tance and it can be estimated using Equation 3.7 for cylindrical pores or Equation 3.10 for slit pores. The hydraulic conductance can also be measured for a given membrane by using a pure solvent whose value of σ = 0, and measuring the flow rate Q across the membrane for a given ΔP. Then from Equation 6.53, which simplifies to Darcy’s law, we have L Q SP P = =D s 0 (6.61) Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 311 Recall that Pm is the permeability of the solute in the membrane and can be estimated from the solute’s effective diffusivity, i.e., De, by Equations 6.15 and 6.49. Alternatively, in the absence of any bulk flow across the membrane (i.e., Q = 0), the permeability can be obtained by measuring the solute mass transfer rate ( \u0000mA) for a given concentration difference. Then from Equation 6.60, the permeability is given by P m SC m A A Q = = \u0000 D 0 (6.62) The reflection coefficient, σ, can be measured by one of two ways. In the first method, one employs a pressure drop across the membrane and measures the filtration flow rate, Q, as well as the transport rate of the solute, \u0000mA, across the membrane in the absence of a solute concentration difference across the membrane. Then, from Equation 6.60, we obtain that 1 0 -( ) = = s D \u0000m CQ A A CA (6.63) where CA is the solute concentration in the feed solution. Alternatively, we can measure the filtration flow rate, Q, in the absence of a pressure drop across the membrane, but under the control of a concentration difference across the membrane (osmotic flow). Then from Equation 6.53, the reflection coefficient is given by s D =- = Q SL RT CPA PD 0 (6.64) 6.2.1.1 Estimating the reflection coefficient The reflection coefficient can also be estimated using theories developed to describe the motion of particles in small pores. Anderson and Quinn (1974) reexamined the basic hydrodynamic equations that describe hindered particle motion in small pores in which a fluid is flowing. Under the assumptions of a rigid and spherical solute, and no electro- static interactions with the pore wall, which is assumed to be inert, they showed that the sieving coefficient, S m/CQaA Aº \u0000 , is the same as (1 − σ), where CA is the concentration of the solute on the feed side of the membrane pore. The sieving coefficient is defined as the ratio of the solute concen- tration in the filtrate to that at the surface of the membrane on the feed side. This definition of Sa also implies that solute transport by diffusion through the pore is negligible in comparison to the solute transported through the pore by convection or filtration. Theoretical expressions based on the motion of a spherical solute moving through a cylindrical pore have been developed to estimate the value of the sieving coefficient (Anderson and Quinn, 1974; Deen, 1987). The development of these expressions neglects the secondary effects between the solute and the membrane pore, e.g., electrostatic, hydrophobic, and van der Waals interactions. The following expression can be used to estimate the sieving coefficient. Sa =-() --()é ëê ù ûú -- é ë ê ù û ú12 11 2 3 0 163 22 23ll ll.

If no other information is available, the solute radius can be estimated from the solute molecular weight using Equation 5.41.

(6.66) 6.2.2 Multicomponent membrane transport Equations 6.53 and 6.60 describe the filtration flow rate and the solute transport rate in a system comprised of only a single solute and a solvent. However, similar equations can be derived for a multicomponent solute and solvent system by recognizing that now Equations 6.51 and 6.52 become QSLP SRTL CPPSi i = 1 N i=+ åDD (6.67) QS PL SRTL CVSP N Si N i = 1i = 1 ii=+ååDD (6.68) The summations are over each solute in the system. Using the approach outlined earlier for the deri- vation of Equations 6.53 and 6.60, the following equations are obtained for the filtration rate (Q) and the transport rate of solute i, i.e., \u0000mi, across the membrane in multicomponent systems: QSLP RT CPi i N i = 1 =- é ë ê ê ù û ú úåDs D (6.69) \u0000 \u0000m CQ PS Cii im ii=-() +1 sD (6.70) 6.2.3 Membrane Peclet number We can use the Peclet number (Pe) as a means to determine in membrane solute transport the relative importance of solute convection (filtration) and solute diffusion. The membrane Peclet number is defined as the amount of solute transported across the membrane by convection or filtration to that transported by diffusion. From Equation 6.60, we can write this as Pe Q PS membrane m = -()1 s (6.71) assuming that \u0000C orderCAA» ()D . Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 313 If the Pemembrane ≪ 1, then we can conclude that the amount of solute carried across the mem- brane by filtration flow is much smaller than that transported by diffusion. On the other hand, if Pemembrane ≫ 1, then transport of solute by filtration dominates and transport by diffusion is negligible. 6.3 Solute transport by filtration and diffusion across the capillary wall In this section, we will use the capillary wall as a representative membrane to illustrate in the following examples the calculation of solute transport rates using the relationships developed in the previous sections. Table 3.3 summarizes the characteristics of a typical capillary. In our discussion, we will find it convenient to classify solutes into three categories: The first category  concerns  the transport of small water- soluble but lipid-insoluble substances such as Na+ and K+ ions, glucose, amino acids, many drugs, and other metabolites. The second cat- egory of solutes is lipid-soluble substances such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and the third category we will discuss is the transport  of large lipid-insoluble substances such as proteins (macromolecules). Example 6.5 Calculate the rate of transport by filtration and diffusion of a small water-soluble but lipid- insoluble solute, such as glucose, with a molecular weight of 180 g mol−1, across the capillary wall at 37°C. Using Equations 5.35 and 5.41, the diffusivity of glucose (DAB) in water is esti- mated to be 0.93 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 and its molecular radius is 0.41 nm. The average concentration of glucose in plasma is about 5 μmol cm−3, and it is assumed that all the glucose transported to the extracapillary space is consumed instantly by the cells. We will also assume that all of the plasma proteins are retained by the capillary wall and that they generate an oncotic or colloid osmotic pressure of 28 mmHg. We will also assume that the tortuosity of the capillary wall is equal to 2. Solution The filtration flow rate of plasma (Q) across the capillary wall is given by Equation 6.53 with σ = 1.0 and was shown earlier in Example 3.4 to be equal to 1.54 × 10−8 cm3 h−1. Equation 6.60 can be used to calculate the solute transport rate of glucose across the capillary wall. We first need to estimate the reflection coefficient (σ) for glucose. Equation  6.66 can be used to obtain an estimate. The slit pores of the capillary wall have a thickness of 7 nm, and from Equation 5.171, the hydraulic diameter for this slit is 14 nm. s= -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú - æ è ç ö ø ÷11 041 7 21 041 7 1 2 3 041 7 22 2 .. . -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú = 0 163 041 7 0 015 3 . . .s Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 314 From Equation 6.46, the diffusivity of glucose in plasma is estimated to be 0.54 × 10−5 cm2 s−1.

Comparing these values, we find that the transport rate of small water-soluble but lipid-insoluble solutes such as glucose across the capillary wall is several thousand times higher by diffusion than by convection or filtration!

Since the Pemembrane ≪ 1, this shows as well that we can neglect the amount of solute carried across the membrane by filtration flow in comparison to the amount of solute that is trans- ported by diffusion. We can therefore neglect the convective or filtration transport of a small molecule like glucose across the capillary wall and base our calculations on the diffusive transport of the solute alone. Example 6.6 Now consider the transport rate of lipid-soluble solutes such as oxygen across the capillary wall. In this case, the entire surface area of the capillary wall is available for transport. Oxygen has a considerable solubility in the cell membrane and will readily diffuse through the endo- thelial cells of the capillary wall. Oxygen can also diffuse through the pores in the capillary wall. The diffusivity of oxygen (DAB) in water at 37°C is 2.76 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 (Yoshida and Ohshima, 1966), and its molecular radius from Equation 5.41 is estimated to be 0.23 nm. Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 315 The average concentration of oxygen in the capillary is 0.09 μmol cm−3. Once again we will assume that the tortuosity of the capillary wall is 2. Solution The filtration flow rate of plasma (Q) across the capillary wall was shown earlier in Example 3.4 to be equal to 1.54 × 10−8 cm3 h−1. Equation 6.60 can be used to calculate the solute transport rate of oxygen through the pores in the capillary wall. We first need to estimate the reflection coefficient for oxygen. Equation 6.66 can be used to obtain an estimate assuming the hydraulic diameter of the capillary pores is 14 nm. s= -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú - æ è ç ö ø ÷11 023 7 21 023 7 1 2 3 023 7 22 2 .. . -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú = 0 163 023 7 0 0049 3 . . .s From Equation 6.46, the diffusivity of oxygen in plasma is estimated to be 1.59 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The permeability of oxygen in the capillary wall due to the pores can be estimated using Equation 6.15, and the quantity Kωr can be obtained from Equation 6.12.

An upper limit for the permeability of oxygen through the capillary wall itself is given by assuming the capillary wall diffusional resistance is that of plasma.

The smaller value of the oxygen transport rate through the pores (1.41 × 10−4 μmol h−1) in comparison to the value given previously for the entire capillary wall (0.01 μmol h−1) represents the fact that the pore surface area is 1/1000th that of the capillary wall. Since the permeability of oxygen through the pores of the capillary and the capillary wall itself need to be multiplied by the same values of S and ΔCA to calculate the transport rate of oxygen, it is seen that regardless of these values, the diffusive transport of oxygen is 1000-fold higher through the endothelial cells lining the capillary walls than what is transported by diffusion through the capillary pores. Thus, we can conclude that the dominant mode for transport of oxygen is simple diffusion across the entire surface area of the capillary walls. Example 6.7 Our final category of solute to consider is a lipid-insoluble macromolecule such as a pro- tein. Here, the molecular radius is comparable to the size of the pores in the capillary wall. Calculate the rate of transport by filtration and diffusion through the capillary wall of a protein with a molecular weight of 50,000. Assume the concentration of the protein in the plasma is 0.05 μmol cm−3. Solution The filtration flow rate of plasma (Q) across the capillary wall is given by Equation 6.53 and was shown earlier in Example 3.4 to be equal to 1.54 × 10−8 cm3 h−1. Since we only know the molecular weight of the protein, we need to first estimate its radius and its diffusivity. From Equation 5.41, we find that the radius of the solute is equal to 2.71 nm. We can also use Equation 5.35 to estimate the diffusivity. Therefore, we find that DAB = 7 × 10−7 cm2 s−1. From Equation 6.46, the diffusivity of the protein in plasma is estimated to be 4.03 × 10−7 cm2 s−1. Equation 6.60 can be used to calculate the solute transport rate of the protein across the capillary wall. We first need to estimate the reflection coefficient (σ) from Equation 6.66. The slit pores of the capillary wall have a thickness of 7 nm, and from Equation 5.171, the hydraulic diameter for this slit is 14 nm. s= -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú - æ è ç ö ø ÷11 271 7 21 271 7 1 2 3 271 7 22 2 .. . -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú = 0 163 271 7 0 457 3 . . .s Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 317 The permeability of the protein for the capillary wall can be estimated using Equation 6.15, and the quantity Kωr can be obtained from Equation 6.12.

Since the Pemembrane is still quite smaller than unity, this shows that even for a rather large mac- romolecule, we can still neglect the amount of solute carried across the membrane by filtration flow in comparison to the amount of solute that is transported by diffusion. 6.4 Transport of a solute between a capillary and the surrounding tissue space Now that we have developed an understanding of solute transport across a semipermeable mem- brane like the capillary wall, it is possible to develop a model for the spatial distribution and con- sumption or production of a particular species within the tissue space surrounding a given capillary. The following equations also describe the transport of a solute between a fluid flowing within a hollow fiber and the cylindrical space surrounding the hollow fiber under conditions where diffu- sion dominates the solute transport. From Equation 6.71, this means that the Pemembrane ≪ 1. In the Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 318 case of oxygen transport where the flowing fluid is blood, the situation is somewhat more complex since the red blood cell provides an additional source or sink of oxygen through interactions with hemoglobin. We will discuss oxygen transport from blood later in Chapter 7. 6.4.1 The Krogh tissue cylinder Microscopic studies support, somewhat, the notion that a bed of capillaries in tissue can be rep- resented as a repetitive arrangement of capillaries surrounded by a cylindrical layer of tissue. Figure 6.11 shows an idealized sketch of the capillary bed and the corresponding cylindrical layer of tissue of thickness equal to rT. Krogh (1919) used this cylindrical capillary-tissue model to study the supply of oxygen to muscle. This approach is now known as the Krogh tissue cylinder model. A steady-state mathematical model for the transport of a solute can be developed using the Krogh tissue cylinder model. Although this model is developed for a single capillary surrounded by tis- sue, it can also be extended to a single hollow fiber membrane found in a bioartificial organ or in a bioreactor. In the case of the hollow fiber, the radius and length of the fiber is much larger than the dimensions of a single capillary. We will treat the tissue space surrounding the capillary as a continuous phase and ignore the fact that it is comprised of discrete cells. Therefore, the diffusion of the solute in the tissue space may be described by an effective diffusivity (DT) as defined earlier by Equations 6.43 and 6.45. The driving force for diffusion of the solute is created by the consumption (or production) of the solute by the cells within the tissue space. We also need to have an expression that relates the consumption or production of the solute to the concentration of the solute in the tissue space, i.e., CA. The Michaelis-Menten equation can be used to describe the metabolic consumption (or production) of the solute in the tissue space. The Michaelis-Menten equation can be written as follows: ¢¢¢ = + R VC KC A A mA max (6.72) ArterioleVenule Idealized capillary bed Capillary Tissue cylinder Figure 6.11 The Krogh tissue cylinder. Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 319 For consumption of the solute, the solute reaction rate, i.e., ¢¢¢RA, will be assumed to have a positive value, whereas if the solute is produced, then ¢¢¢RA will have a negative value. The units on ¢¢¢RA are in moles A per volume of tissue per time, e.g., mol L−1 s−1. In Equation 6.72, Vmax represents the maximum reaction rate. The maximum reaction rate occurs when C KAm≫ , and the reaction rate is then said to be zero order in the solute concentration, i.e., CA 0 . Km is called the Michaelis constant and represents the value of CA for which the reaction rate is one-half the maximal value. When C KAm≪ , then ¢¢¢ =RV C/KAA mmax , and the reaction is first order in the solute concentration, i.e., CA 1 . In many cases for biological reactions, C KAm≫ , and we can reasonably assume that the reaction is zero order and that ¢¢¢ ==RV RA Amax max. In Chapter 7, we will see this is the case for oxygen consumption by cells. This will considerably simplify the following mathematical analysis and allow us to find an analytical solution for solute diffusion in the tissue space that surrounds a given capillary. 6.4.2 A model of the Krogh tissue cylinder Figure 6.12 illustrates the Krogh tissue cylinder that surrounds a capillary. Within the capillary, the solute is transported primarily by convection in the axial direction and by diffusion in the radial direction. Diffusion of the solute from the blood and through the capillary wall is proportional to the concentration difference of the solute between that in the bulk fluid and that at the interface between the outer capillary wall and the surrounding tissue, i.e., at r rLc=+ . This concentration difference is multiplied by the overall mass transfer coefficient, i.e., KO, defined earlier by Equation 6.18. This gives the local solute flux across the capillary wall and into the tissue space. The overall mass transfer coefficient represents the combined resistance of the fluid flowing through the capillary, i.e., km, on the blood or capillary side, and the permeability of the solute in the capillary wall, i.e., Pm. The local solute flux across the capillary wall is given by dividing both sides of Equation 6.60 by S. Unless there is known to be a significant filtration flow across the capillary wall or membrane, the convective solute flux in Equation 6.60, i.e., CA(1 − σ)Q/S, is negligible in comparison to the amount of solute transported by diffusion, i.e., PmΔCA. From Equation 6.71, this also means that the Pemembrane ≪ 1. When calculating the value of km, one needs to determine whether the transport properties, as repre- sented by the viscosity and the solute diffusivity, should be based on their respective plasma values or on those of blood. Recall from Chapter 4 that the red blood cells have a tendency to accumulate along their axis of flow. This creates a cell-free plasma layer (δplasma) adjacent to the capillary wall that is on the order of a few microns in thickness. Also, the thickness of the concentration boundary layer can be approximated from the fact that km ≈ D0/δC. Hence, we can first determine the value of km using the properties of blood. Then the concentration boundary layer thickness is approximately given by rC rT Capillary Krogh tissue cylinder r z+ ∆z r+∆r V L z Figure 6.12 Geometry of the Krogh tissue cylinder. Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 320 δC ≈ D0/km. If δC > δplasma, then the value of km should be based on the properties of blood since the concentration boundary layer is expected to be comprised of blood. Otherwise, if δC < δplasma, then the concentration boundary layer lies within the plasma layer and the physical properties should be those of plasma. In developing the Krogh tissue cylinder model, we will also treat the blood as a continuous phase and ignore the finite size of the red blood cells. We will assume that the blood flows through the capillary with an average velocity of V. With these assumptions, a steady-state shell balance on the solute in the blood from z to z + Δz (see Figure 6.12) provides the following equation: Vr CV rC rzKC CcA z cA zz cO AA rLc pp pD 22 2-= -( )+ +D (6.73) Dividing by Δz, and taking the limit as Δz → 0, results in the following differential equation for the solute concentration in the blood. -= -( )+ V dC dz r KC C A c OA A rLc 2 (6.74) A steady-state shell balance at a given value of z from r to r + Δr can also be written for the solute concentration in the tissue space. -+ -= ¢¢¢ +D dC dr rz D dC dr rz R rrzT A r T A rr A22 2pp pDD DD D (6.75) This equation neglects axial diffusion in comparison to radial diffusion within the tissue space. After dividing by 2πrΔr, and taking the limit as Δr → 0, the following differential equation results for the solute concentration in the tissue space: D r d dr r dC dr R TA A æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¢¢¢ (6.76) The boundary conditions for Equations 6.74 and 6.76 are BC zC C BC rr LC C BC rr dC dr AA cA A rL T A c 10 2 30 0:, :, :, == =+ = == + (6.77) It should be noted that even though we neglect axial diffusion in the tissue space in comparison to radial diffusion, the solute concentration in the tissue space will still have an axial dependence. This axial dependence of the tissue space solute concentration results from the boundary condition at r rLc=+ and the solute flux term, K CCO AA rLc-()+ , which couples the solutions for the solute concentration within the capillary and the tissue space. In this way, the axial variation of the solute concentration in the capillary is impressed on that of the tissue space. The solute concentration in the tissue space is then easily found by solving Equation 6.76 subject to boundary conditions 2 and 3 in Equation 6.77. Here, we assume the consumption of solute is Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 321 zero order as discussed earlier; hence ¢¢¢ ==RV RAAmax max is a constant. The following equation is then obtained: C r,zC z R D rr L Rr D AA rL A T c AT T c() = () +- +()( ) é ëê ù ûú - + maxmax ln 44 2 2 2 rr rLc + æ è ç ö ø ÷ (6.78) This equation provides no information on the value of the solute concentration at the interface between the capillary wall and the tissue space, i.e., C zA rLc() + . However, at any axial position z from the capillary entrance, we must have at steady state that the change in solute concentration within the blood must equal the consumption of solute in the tissue space. Therefore, we can express this requirement by writing the following equation: Vr CV rC rr LzRcA cA z Tc App p 20 22 2 -= -+()é ëê ù ûú max (6.79) This equation can be rearranged to give Equation 6.80, which provides for the axial variation of the solute concentration in the capillary.

Equations 6.78, 6.80, and 6.81 can now be combined to give Equation 6.82 for the solute concentration in the tissue space.

Any one of these conditions can lead to regions of the tissue that have no solute. We can then define a critical radius in the tissue, rcritical(z), defined as the distance beyond which no solute is present in the tissue. For this situation, we need to modify boundary condition 3 in Equation 6.77 to the following: BC rr z dC dr andCcritical A A¢ = () ==30 0:, (6.83) Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 322 Under these conditions, the solute concentrations in the capillary, i.e., CA(z), at the interface between the capillary and the tissue space, i.e., C zA rLc() + , and in the tissue space itself, i.e., C r,zA (), are still given respectively by Equations 6.80, 6.81, and 6.82. However, the Krogh tissue cylinder radius in these equations, i.e., rT, is replaced with rcritical(z) once the solute concentration in the tissue at a particular location has reached zero. The critical radius is found by recognizing that at rcritical(z), C r,zA () = 0. Thus, we can use Equation 6.82, with rT = rcritical(z) and C r,zA () = 0, to obtain the following expression for the critical radius. rz rL rz rL rcritical c critical c crit() + æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ () + æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ - 22 ln iical c TA Ac T c z rL DC Rr L D Vr () + æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ += +() æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ - 2 0 2 2 1 4 4 max rrz rL z D rK rz r critical c T cO critical() + æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ - é ë ê ê ù û ú ú - () 2 1 2 cc L+ æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ - é ë ê ê ù û ú ú 2 1 (6.84) This is a nonlinear algebraic equation that can be solved for the critical radius at a given axial posi- tion, z, along the length of the capillary. Of particular interest are the conditions under which the solute just begins to be depleted within the tissue space. The depletion of the solute will start at the downstream corner of the Krogh tissue cylinder represented by the coordinates z = L and r = rT. Equation 6.82 can be used to explore the conditions when the solute depletion just begins by recog- nizing that C r,LT() = 0. Example 6.8 Calculate the glucose concentration at the exit of an exercising muscle capillary. Also cal- culate the glucose concentration in the tissue space at r = rT and z = L. Assume the capillary properties summarized in Table 3.3 apply and that the glucose consumption rate, RA max, is equal to 0.007 μmol cm−3 s−1 and the glucose concentration in the blood entering the capillary is 5 μmol cm−3. Also assume that the Krogh tissue cylinder radius, rT, is 40 μm. Solution From Equation 6.80, we can calculate the glucose concentration in the blood as it exits the capillary: C Lmol cm molcms cm scm A () =- ´() ´ - -- - 5 0 007 0050 0005 000 3 31 1 2m m. .. .440 0005 0 00005 01 412 22 cm cm cm cm C Lmol cmA () -+()é ëê ù ûú ´ () = - .. . . m 33 We will assume that within the capillary, the red blood cells are spaced by intervals of plasma. Hence, the properties of plasma will be used to describe the blood in the capillary. In Example 6.5, the diffusivity of glucose in plasma was estimated to be 0.54 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. For plasma flowing in a capillary, we find that Reynolds number (Re) = 0.0043 and Schmidt number (Sc) = 2188. Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 323 For the velocity profile to be fully developed in a capillary, the distance downstream must be greater than 0.05Re d capillary. This distance is equal to 2 × 10−7 cm, which is much smaller than the capillary length of 0.1 cm, so we conclude that the velocity profile is fully developed in the capillary. For the concentration profile to be fully developed, the distance downstream must be greater than 0.05Re Sc dcapillary, which is equal to 0.00047 cm, and we conclude that the concen- tration profile is also fully developed. From Equation 5.169, we have that Sh = 3.66. From this asymptotic value of the Sh, we can calculate the blood-side mass transfer coefficient: k D d cm s cm m plasma capillary =´ =´ ´ = -- 3663 66 05410 0 001 002 52 1 .. . . .ccm s-1 From Example 6.5, the capillary wall glucose permeability, i.e., Pm, was estimated to be 4.2 × 10−5 cm s−1. We see that Pm ≪ km and we conclude that the bulk of the mass transfer resistance is in the capillary wall, and we can ignore the blood-side mass transfer resistance since it is much smaller in comparison to that of the capillary wall. Therefore, from Equation 6.18, we have that KO ≈ Pm = 4.2 × 10−5 cm s−1. We can estimate the diffusivity of glucose in the tissue using the results shown in Figure 6.9. For a glucose radius of 0.41 nm, we have DT/DAB ≈ 0.5. With DAB = 0.93 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, this gives a DT = 0.47 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. Next, we use Equation 6.82 to calculate the glucose concentration in the tissue at r = rT and z = L.

We can easily check the validity of this assump- tion through the following arguments. The amount of solute carried by convection in a capillary of diameter, dc, is on the order of Solutetransportbyaxial convection d VC c A= p 2 0 4 (6.85) Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 324 and the amount of solute carried by axial diffusion is on the order of Solutetransportbyaxial diffusion d DC L c AB A = -()æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ p 2 0 4 0 (6.86) where DAB is the solute diffusivity L is the length of the capillary By taking the ratio of Equations 6.85 and 6.86, we obtain the Peclet number, whose magnitude in this case represents the importance of axial solute convection in comparison to axial  solute  diffusion. The criterion for ignoring axial diffusion is then given by the fact that Pe = VL/DAB ≫ 1. For the example problems presented previously, Pe = VL/DAB = (0.05 cm s−1 × 0.1 cm)/(0.93 × 10−5 cm2 s−1) = 538 ≫ 1 and we conclude that we can ignore axial diffusion in comparison to axial convection. A similar line of reasoning can be applied to the tissue space to support the neglect of axial diffusion in comparison to radial diffusion. The solute transport by radial diffusion is on the order of Solutetransportbyradialdiffusion rL DC rr c TA Tc = -() - æ è ç ç ö ø 2 0 0 p ÷÷ ÷ (6.87) and the amount of solute transport by axial diffusion is on the order of Solutetransportbyaxial diffusion rr DC L Tc TA =-() -()æ è ç ç ö ø p 22 0 0 ÷÷ ÷ (6.88) The ratio of Equations 6.87 and 6.88 is a measure of the relative importance of radial diffusion in comparison to axial diffusion.

We can also assume that the blood offers little resistance to the solute transport rate in comparison to that of Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 325 the capillary wall; hence KO ≈ Pm. For these conditions, Equation 6.74 simplifies to dC dz P Vr C r Q PC Am c A c mA=- =- 22p (6.89) Here, we have replaced the capillary blood velocity (V) with the volumetric flow rate of blood in the capillary (Q). Equation 6.89 is easily integrated to obtain the solute concentration in the capillary at any axial position z. E CC z C rP z Q AA A cm= - () =- - æ è ç ö ø ÷ 0 0 1 2 exp p (6.90) where CA 0 is the solute concentration in the blood that enters the capillary. Equation 6.90 is known as the Renkin-Crone equation and describes how the solute concentration varies along the length of the capillary for the special case where the solute concentration in the tis- sue space is very small in comparison to its value in the blood. The solute extraction is represented by E, which is the ratio of the actual amount of solute trans- ported across the capillary, i.e., QC CAA 0 -(), to the maximum amount of solute that can be trans- ported across the capillary, QCA 0 . Hence, E QCA´ 0 represents the actual solute transport rate for the given conditions. The solute extraction is therefore a measure of the removal efficiency of the solute from the capillary. Equation 6.90 shows that solute transport from the capillary is strongly dependent on the ratio of the permeability of the capillary wall (2πrCPmz) to the blood flow rate (Q). This ratio can be used to define conditions under which the solute transport is either flow limited or diffusion limited as follows: if rP z Q then flow limitedand E if rP z Q then diffusi cm cm 2 11 2 1 p p ≫ ≪ , , ® oon limitedand E ® 0 (6.91) Flow limited means that the mass transport rate of the solute by diffusion out of the capillary and into the tissue space is much faster than the rate at which the solute is entering the capillary by the flowing blood. In this situation, solute transport to the tissue surrounding a given capillary can only be increased by increasing the blood flow rate. In the diffusion-limited case, blood supply is more than adequate and the limitation is the difficulty of transporting the solute across the capillary wall. Equation 6.90 is for a single capillary. For regions of tissue containing many capillaries, we can replace the quantity 2πrCPmz with the group PmS, where S represents the total surface area of the capillaries within the tissue region of interest. Hence, Equation 6.90 for a tissue becomes E CC z C PS Q AA A m= - () =- - æ è ç ö ø ÷ 0 0 1exp (6.92) Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 326 6.4.3.1 Determining the value of PmS The multiple tracer indicator diffusion technique can be used to obtain a test solute’s permeability (PmS) across the capillary wall in organs and large tissue regions. This technique can also be used to evaluate the solute permeability in medical devices that employ membranes, e.g., in hemodialyzers, bioreactors, and bioartificial organs. In this technique, a solution containing equal concentrations of a permeable test solute and a non- permeable reference solute, typically labeled albumin, is rapidly injected into a main artery leading to the region of interest (Levick, 1991). Venous blood samples are then collected over the next few seconds and analyzed for the concentrations of the test and reference solutes. Because the test sol- ute is permeable to the capillary wall, its concentration in the venous blood will initially fall below that of the reference solute due to its diffusion into the tissue space that surrounds the capillaries. This is shown in Figure 6.13. Because of the transient nature of this technique and the mass transfer resistance of the capillary wall, the concentration of the test solute in the tissue space surrounding the capillaries can be assumed to be close to zero or much smaller than the value within the blood. The concentration of the reference solute in the venous blood provides an estimate of what the test solute concentration would have been at a particular time if no transport of the test solute out of the capillaries had occurred. After several seconds, the reference solute concentration in the blood will fall below that of the test solute since the reference solute has been nearly washed out of the capil- lary and the test solute concentration in the tissue space is now larger than that in the blood. Hence, the test solute starts to diffuse back into the blood. The concentrations of the test and reference solutes, Ctest and Creference, in the venous blood at a particular time can then be used to calculate, using Equation 6.92, the test solute extraction (E) and the value of PmS for a given blood flow rate (Q). From Equation 6.92, we then have at a particular time, t, E Ct Ct Ct PS Q referencetest reference m= ()- () () =- - æ è ç ö ø ÷1exp (6.93)Venous concentration Time Reference solute, Creference(t) Test solute, Ctest(t) Region where Creference(t) >Ctest(t) t Creference(t)– Ctest(t) Figure 6.13 Multiple tracer indicator diffusion technique. Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 327 It is important to note that accurate results require that the test be repeated at increasing blood flow rates (Q) to ensure that the solute transport is not flow limited. To show that the solute trans- port is not flow limited, it is convenient to express Equation 6.92 in terms of the clearance. The term clearance is often used to describe the removal of a solute from a flowing fluid such as in a capillary. Clearance, given the symbol CL, is the volumetric flow rate of the fluid that has been totally cleared of the solute. Clearance is then defined by the following expression where we see that CL = QE. CLz QC Cz C QE Qe AA A PS Q m () º - ()() == - æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ - 0 0 1 (6.94) This expression shows that capillary solute clearance is linearly dependent on the flow rate, i.e., CL = Q, under flow-limited conditions where PmS ≫ Q and E ≈ 1. However, under diffusion-limited conditions, where PmS ≪ Q, the parenthetical term in the above equation becomes equal to PmS/Q and we obtain the result that the clearance becomes independent of the flow rate Q and is equal to the capillary wall permeability, i.e., CL = PmS. Hence, in experiments to determine the value of PmS using the multiple tracer indicator diffusion technique, the value of PmS should not be dependent on the flow rate, Q. Example 6.9 Blood is flowing through a hollow fiber–based bioartificial organ at a flow rate (Q) of 8 cm3 min−1 for each fiber. Surrounding the fibers in the shell space are living cells obtained from a pig’s liver. Each fiber has a diameter of 800 μm and a length of 30 cm. At time equal to zero, equal concentrations of a permeable (relative to the fiber wall) test solute and labeled albumin (impermeable) are injected into the blood entering the device. Exiting blood sam- ples are collected over the next few seconds and analyzed for the concentrations of the test solute (Ctest) and the reference solute, albumin (Creference). At a particular time, the value of Ctest/Creference was found to equal 0.60. Estimate the solute permeability (Pm) of the hollow fiber membrane (cm s−1).

In many cases, a model is needed to describe the solute transport in a much larger region containing numerous capillaries, as illustrated for the capillary bed shown in Figure 6.11. One simple approach to describe solute transport in this situation is to treat the blood in the capillary bed and the tissue space as separate well-mixed regions. To facilitate the analysis, we introduce two parameters that characterize the degree of vasculariza- tion in the region of interest. The first parameter is the surface area capillary density (s), which is the capillary surface area per unit volume of tissue. Assuming the geometry of the Krogh tissue cylinder shown in Figure 6.11, the following equation provides an estimate of (s) based on the given values of the capillary radius, rc, and the Krogh tissue cylinder radius, rT. s r r c T = 2 2 (6.95) The second parameter is the volume of capillaries per unit volume of tissue (v). In terms of the Krogh tissue cylinder model, this may also be expressed in terms of rc and rT. v r r c T = æ è ç ö ø ÷ 2 (6.96) A steady-state solute balance, assuming only diffusion is relevant for solute transport across the capillary wall, can then be written for the capillary bed illustrated in Figure 6.11. We can write that the solute carried into the capillary bed by blood flow must equal the amount removed by diffusion across the capillary walls and that which leaves with the blood flow. QC PS CC QCA in mA A out 0 =-()+ (6.97) In this equation, Q is the volumetric flow rate of blood to the region of interest. If VT is the volume of the tissue region considered, then qb = Q/VT, defined as the tissue blood perfusion rate. Assuming a capillary of length L, and blood velocity within the capillary of V, it is easily shown that q r r V L v b T c= æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = 2 t (6.98) where τ is the blood residence time in the capillary, i.e., τ = L/V = 0.1 cm/ cm ss.0052 1. - = At steady state, the amount of solute diffusing out of the capillaries must equal the consumption rate of the solute in the tissue space. Hence, the diffusion term, PS CCmA A-(), must equal VRTA max, for a zero order reaction occurring within the tissue space. After equating these two expressions, we can write the solute concentration in the tissue space as C C VR PS AA TA m =- max (6.99) Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 329 Replacing the diffusion term in Equation 6.97 with VRTA max allows for the calculation of the solute concentration in the blood exiting the tissue region of interest. C C VR Q C R q AA TA A A b =- =- 00 maxmax (6.100) When this equation is substituted into Equation 6.99 for CA, the solute concentration within the tis- sue space is then given by the following equation: C CR q V PS AA b T m =- + é ë ê ù û ú 0 0 1 (6.101) The following example illustrates the use of these equations. Example 6.10 Consider the transport of glucose from the capillary blood to an exercising muscle tissue. As a basis, consider 1 g of tissue. The glucose consumption of the tissue is 60 μmol min−1 (100 g)−1 or 0.01 μmol s−1 g−1. Blood flow to the region is 60 cm3 min−1 (100 g)−1 or 0.01 cm3 s−1 g−1. The arterial glucose concentration is 5 mM (5 μmol cm−3). The value of PmS based on capillary recruitment during exercise is 0.33 cm3 s−1 (100 g)−1 or, for the 1 g of tissue considered here, 0.0033 cm3 s−1. Calculate the glucose concentration in the tissue space and in the exiting blood (based on data provided in Levick, 1991).

Because of the size of the pores in the capillary wall or the membrane, this filtration flow can also be used to separate the solutes on the basis of their size. For example, for the capillary wall, the pores in the membrane will stop the transport of the cellular components of the blood, and the smaller solutes like ions, glucose, and amino acids will readily pass through the capillary pores. However, larger proteins will be hindered to varying degrees in their pas- sage across the capillary wall based on the relative size of these components in comparison to the size Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 330 of the pores. This selective filtration is used in a variety of membrane systems that are used in bioreac- tors, in processes for bioseparations, and in medical devices like artificial organs. In these membrane filtration applications, the solute transport by filtration is usually much greater than that by diffusion. From Equation 6.71, this means that the membrane Peclet number is much greater than unity. The solute selectivity during this membrane filtration process is described by the actual sieving coefficient (Sa), which was given earlier by Equation 6.65. The actual sieving coefficient was defined as the ratio of the solute concentration in the filtrate (CA filtrate) to the solute concentration at the surface of the membrane on the feed side (CA surface). Hence, S C C a A filtrate A surface== -() --()é ëê ù ûú -- é 12 11 2 3 0 163 22 23ll ll. ëë ê ù û ú (6.102) where λ is defined as the ratio of the solute radius (a) to the membrane pore radius (r). However, under most membrane filtration conditions, the filtration rates are much higher than those for which Equation 6.102 applies. These higher filtration rates will lead to the formation of a layer of retained or hindered solutes that will concentrate along the surface on the feed side of the membrane. These retained solutes will have a higher concentration near the surface of the membrane than in the bulk solution. This effect, which is shown in Figure 6.14, is called concentration polarization, and the layer of retained solutes will affect the transport of the solutes. Concentration polarization is par- ticularly important at the higher filtration rates used in commercial membrane-based plasmapheresis systems used for separating plasma from the cellular components of blood, as well as in membrane systems used to purify protein solutions. Bulk flow Q Concentration polarization region z y CA bulk CA filtrate CA surface Figure 6.14 Sieving and concentration polarization. Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 331 The observed sieving coefficient for the case of concentration polarization (SO) is defined as the ratio of the solute concentration in the filtrate (CA filtrate) to that in the bulk solution on the feed side of the membrane (CA bulk). An expression for the observed sieving coefficient can be developed as follows using film theory to describe the solute mass transfer. The convective transport rate of solute at any position y in the concentration polarization region shown in Figure 6.14 has to equal the rate at which the solute is diffusing back toward the bulk solution plus the rate the solute is carried away by the filtration flow. This can be expressed by the following equation: QC DS dC dy QCA y A y A filtrate=- +0 (6.103) where S is the surface area of the membrane normal to the direction of the filtration flow D0 is the solute diffusivity within the concentration polarization region Q, the filtration flow rate across the membrane, is given by Equation 6.53 Equation 6.103 can then be rearranged and integrated across the concentration polarization region having a film thickness δC as follows: q dy D dC CC C A surface A bulk C C A AA filtrate 0 0 d òò =- - (6.104) where the filtration flux q is equal to Q/S. After performing the integration, we obtain q DC C CC k C A bulk A filtrate A surface A filtrate m=- - - æ è ç ö ø ÷ =- 0 d ln ln CCC CC A bulk A filtrate A surface A filtrate - - æ è ç ö ø ÷ (6.105) In Equations 6.104 and 6.105, δC is defined as the film thickness of the concentration polarization region, and from our discussion of mass transfer and film theory in Section 5.7.1, we can replace D0/δC with the mass transfer coefficient, km. Equation 6.105 can then be rearranged, and after some algebra, we obtain the following expression for the observed sieving coefficient: S C C S Se S O A filtrate A bulk a a q k a m == -() + - 1 (6.106) where Sa is given by Equation 6.102 km is the mass transfer coefficient, which, as discussed in Section 5.11, is dependent on the fluid properties and the nature of the flow field Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 332 Note that in Equation 6.106, if the ratio of the filtration flux to the mass transfer coefficient, i.e., q/km, approaches zero, meaning that the filtration flow is small in comparison to solute mass transfer, then SO → Sa. On the other hand, if q/km is much greater than unity, meaning that the solute transport by the filtration flow is much larger than that by diffusion, then SO → 1 and the solute concentration in the filtrate is the same as that in the bulk solution on the feed side of the membrane. Example 6.11 A protein with a MW of 15,000 in an aqueous solution is being filtered at 20°C through a microporous membrane within a 25 mm diameter stirred ultrafiltration cell. The membrane has a nominal molecular weight cutoff (NMWCO) of 30,000. The stirring speed is 1000 RPM. Estimate the observed sieving coefficient, SO. The filtration flux, i.e., q = Q/S, is equal to 1.5 × 10−3 cm s−1. Solution First, we calculate the radius of the protein and the radius of the membrane pores using Equation 5.41: r gmol gcmmol = ´ ´´ ´´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ =´ - -- 330 000 41 6 023 10 2 283 1 3231 13 , . . / p 110 2 283 315 000 41 6 023 10 7 1 3231 - - -- = = ´ ´´ ´´ æ cm nm a gmol gcmmol . , .pèè ç ö ø ÷ =´ = - 13 71 812 10 1 812 / ..cm nm Next, we calculate λ = a/r = 0.794.

Assume the length of the hollow fiber is given by L and the radius of the hollow fiber is R. We need to develop the differential equation that describes the steady-state change with axial position (z) of the volumetric flow rate of the fluid (F) as a result of filtration across the walls of the hollow fiber. We can write a shell balance across a finite axial shell volume of the hollow fiber equal to π R2Δz. The amount of the fluid filtered across the wall of the hollow fiber within the shell volume is equal to 2πRΔz q, where 2πRΔz is the circumferential surface area of the shell volume and q(z) is the local filtration flux, which is given by Equation 6.53 with q = Q/S: q zL PRTCPA() =-()Ds D (6.107) In Equation 6.107, ΔP is the local hydrodynamic pressure difference that is driving the filtration flow across the membrane, i.e., ΔP = Pfiber – Pfiltrate, where Pfiber is the pressure of the fluid flowing inside the hollow fiber and Pfiltrate is the pressure of the filtrate fluid. The osmotic pressure effect on the filtration flow is given by σRTΔCA, where ΔCA is the local solute concentration difference across the membrane, i.e., DCC CAA surface A filtrate=- . Because the local values of the pressures and sol- ute concentrations can be changing along the length of the hollow fiber, this means that in general the filtration flux is dependent on the axial fiber position, i.e., z. Our steady-state shell balance assuming constant fluid density can then be written as 0 2=- - () +FF Rzqz zz zD pD (6.108) Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 334 Dividing Equation 6.108 by Δz, and taking the limit as Δz → 0, results in the following differential equation that describes the axial variation of the volumetric flow rate within the hollow fiber: dF dz Rq zRLP RT CPA=- () =- -()22pp sDD (6.109) If q(z) is constant, then Equation 6.109 can be integrated to give F zF Rqz() =-0 2p (6.110) where F0 is the volumetric feed rate to the hollow fiber. 6.5.2 Describing the change in the bulk concentration of a solute in a fluid flowing in a hollow fiber with filtration We can perform a solute mass balance on solute A over the length of a fiber from z to z + Δz. We assume that the filtration rate is high enough so that the transport of solute A across the membrane is by convection (filtration) and not by diffusion. Therefore, Pemembrane ≫ 1. We also use the observed sieving coefficient, i.e., SO, defined by Equation 6.106, to relate the solute concentration in the fil- trate to that in the bulk fluid flowing within the hollow fiber. FCFCR zqCR zS CA bulk z A bulk zz A filtrate OA bulk-= = +D DD22pp (6.111) After dividing by Δz, and taking the limit as Δz → 0, we obtain dFC dz F dC dz C dF dz RqSC A bulk A bulk A bulk OA bulk=+= -2p (6.112) From Equation 6.109, we also have that dF/dz = − 2πRq(z), and using this result, we can write Equation 6.112 as dC dz RS qz Fz C A bulk O A bulk= -() () () 21p (6.113) Equation 6.113 can then be solved, along with Equation 6.109, to find how the flow rate and bulk solute concentration vary along the length of the hollow fiber. If the filtration flux q(z) is constant along the length of the fibers, then we can use Equation 6.110 to describe F(z), and Equation 6.113 becomes dC dz RS qz Fz C RS q FRqz C A bulk O A bulk O A bulk= -() () () = -() - 21 21 20 pp p (6.114) Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 335 Equation 6.114 can then be readily integrated to obtain an expression for how the bulk solute con- centration changes with position in the hollow fiber for the case when the filtration flux is constant. First, we rearrange and separate the variables in Equation 6.114 as shown next: C Cz A bulk A bulk O z A bulk A bulk dC C RS q dz FRqz 0 0 0 21 2 () () òò =-() - p p (6.115) Equation 6.115 is then integrated to give C zC Rq F zA bulk A bulk SO () = () - æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú --() 01 2 0 1 p (6.116) Note that if the solute is totally retained by the hollow fiber membrane, then SO = 0, and Equation 6.116 simplifies to give C FC zF RqzC zF zA bulk A bulk A bulk0200() = () -() = () ()p (6.117) Equation 6.117 says that for a retained solute, the mass rate at which that solute enters the hollow fiber equals the mass rate at which that solute crosses any axial position z in the hollow fiber. Example 6.12 Consider a hollow fiber module that is being used to concentrate a protein solution at 37°C. The module contains 10,000 fibers, and each fiber has a diameter of 400 μm and a length of 20 cm. The pore length in the wall of the hollow fibers is 75 μm. The NMWCO for the hollow fibers is 100,000, and the porosity of the hollow fibers (ε = AP/S) is equal to 0.40. The protein solution has a viscosity of 0.001 Pa s. The protein solution enters the hollow fiber module at a flow rate of 250 mL min−1. The composition of the protein solution is protein A (4 g L−1, MW = 20,000), protein B (7 g L−1, MW = 150,000), and protein C (6 g L−1, MW = 300,000). The diffusivity of protein A in the solution is 6.42 × 10−7 cm2 s−1. Determine the total filtration flow rate across the hollow fibers assuming the average pressure drop across the hollow fiber membrane wall is 750 mmHg. What is the composition of the fluid leaving on the filtrate side? What is the fractional removal of protein A from the feed solution to the hollow fiber module? What is the composition of the fluid leaving the hollow fibers? Solution To obtain a solution, we will need to make some reasonable assumptions. Proteins B and C are retained by the hollow fiber membranes. We can estimate their osmotic pressure from Equation 3.3.

Next, we calculate the hydraulic conductance of the hollow fiber membrane from Equation 3.7, assuming that the radius of the membrane pores can be found from the NMWCO using Equation 5.41. r gmol gcm mol = ´ ´´ ´ æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ =´ - - 3 100 000 41 6 023 10 1 341 1 323 13 , . . / p 110 7- cm and L cm Pa scm cm PaP = ´´() ´´ =´ - --0403 41 10 80 001 0 0075 77510 7 2 10 1.. .. .ss-1 Next, we can calculate the total filtration flow for the hollow fiber module using Equation 3.4.

To find km, we will need to know the fluid velocity within the hollow fiber. Because of filtration, the fluid velocity will change along the length of the hollow fiber. We will base the calculation of km on the average velocity of the fluid in the hollow fiber. The average of the entrance and exit flow rates is F cm scmsaverage =+() = --1 2 4172 23 32 13 1.. .

In this case, the velocity profile is fully developed if z > 0.002 cm. Since this is much smaller than the fiber length of 20 cm, we conclude that the velocity profile within the hollow fiber is fully devel- oped. For the concentration profile to be fully developed, we have that z > dtube × 0.05 Re Sc, which in this case gives that z > 31 cm, which is longer than the given length of the hollow fibers. Hence, the concentration profile is not fully developed and we should use Equation 5.169 to calculate the value of km as shown below.

How does this value compare with the pressure drop in the direction of the fluid flowing within the hollow fibers? Recall that the total flow rate of the protein solution to the hollow fiber unit is 4.17 cm3 s−1 and the flow rate leaving the hollow fibers is 2.23 cm3 s−1. This gives an average flow rate within the hollow fiber unit of 3.2 cm3 s−1 or Qfiber = 3.2 × 10−4 cm3 s−1 in each of the hollow fibers. Since the flow in the fibers is laminar, Mass transfer in heterogeneous materials 339 we can calculate the pressure drop using this average value of the flow rate according to Equation 4.10 as follows: DP QL R cm sPas cm cm fiber== ´´ ´´ ´() ´ --88 32 10 0 001 20 002 4 43 1 4 m p p .. . 7760 101 325 076 mmHg Pa mmHg , .= This pressure drop over the length of the hollow fiber is negligible in comparison to the pres- sure that is driving the filtration flow. Therefore, our assumption in this case of a constant average filtration pressure of 750 mmHg is reasonable. In this example, we also assumed that solute transport by filtration was much greater than that by diffusion across the hollow fiber membrane. We can calculate the membrane Peclet number from Equation 6.71 to see if this assumption is reasonable. First, we calculate Pm from Equation 6.15 with Kωr calculated by the Renkin equation, i.e., Equation 6.12, with λ = 1.994/3.41 = 0.585: P cm s cm m = ´ ´-() -´ +´ --64210 0 0075 0401 0 585 12 10 585 209 72 1 2 . . .. .. .00 585 0950 585 73610 35 71 .. . . -´()é ëê ù ûú =´ --Pcmsm We then calculate the membrane Peclet number as shown next: Pe Q PS Sq P cm s cm membrane m O m = -() == ´´ ´ -- - 1 0 398 77210 73610 51 7 s .. . ss- => 1 41 74 1. Since the membrane Peclet number is much greater than unity, we conclude that filtration is the dominant mode of solute transport across the hollow fiber membranes. Problems 6.1 Consider a polymeric membrane within a 6 cm diameter stirred ultrafiltration cell. The mem- brane is 30 μm thick. The membrane has pores equivalent in size to a spherical molecule with a molecular weight of 100,000, a porosity of 80%, and a tortuosity of 2.5. On the feed side of the membrane, we have a solution containing a protein at a concentration of 8 g L−1 with these properties: a = 3 nm and DAB = 6.0 × 10−7 cm2 s−1. The solution viscosity is 1 cP. The hydrody- namic pressure on the protein side of the membrane is 20 pounds per square inch (psi) higher than on the filtrate side of the membrane. Determine the convective flow rate of the solution across the membrane and the rate at which the protein crosses the membrane. The solution on the feed side of the membrane is being stirred at 900 RPM. 6.2 Tong and Anderson (1996) obtained for BSA the following data in a polyacrylamide gel for the partition coefficient (K) as a function of the gel volume fraction (ϕ).

The boundary condi- tions are given by Equation 6.77. 6.8 Membrane plasmapheresis (Zydney and Colton, 1986; Zydney, 1995) is a technique used to separate plasma from the cellular components of the blood. The plasma that is collected can be processed further to yield a variety of substances that are useful for the treatment of a variety of blood disorders. Membrane-based systems employ blood flow that is parallel to the mem- brane. The filtrate of plasma is therefore perpendicular to the membrane. A cell-free filtrate with minimal retention of plasma proteins is obtained since the membrane pores are typically 0.2–1.0 μm in diameter. The filtrate flux is limited, however, by the accumulation (concentra- tion polarization) of blood cells along the surface of the membrane that provides an additional hydraulic resistance. Figure 6.14 illustrates the situation. In this case, the solute is the cells, and the filtrate concentration of the cells, i.e., Ccells filtrate, is equal to zero since they are totally retained by the membrane wall of the hollow fibers. At any axial position (z) from the device inlet, this layer of cells at steady state represents a balance between the flux of cells carried to the membrane surface by the filtration flux, i.e., q(z) Ccells(z), and the diffusive flux of cells carried away from the membrane, i.e., - () D dC z dy cells cells . Hence, we can write q zC zD dC z dy cells cells cells () () =- () Here q(z) is the filtration flux (Q(z)/S) Ccells(z) is the concentration of the cells in the blood Dcells is the diffusivity of the red blood cells y is the distance from the membrane surface on the blood side Show that after equating these flux expressions as above and integrating over the thickness of the cell boundary layer (δcells), the following expression is obtained for the filtrate flux: q z DC C k Ccells cells cells surface cells bulk m cell() = æ è ç ö ø ÷ = d ln ln ss surface cells bulkC æ è ç ö ø ÷ where km represents the film mass transfer coefficient (i.e., Dcells/δcells) Ccells surface and Ccells bulk represent the cell concentration at the membrane surface and in the bulk blood, on the blood side of the membrane, respectively Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 342 Also, the thickness of the cell boundary layer is much thinner than that of the flow channel. Hence, under these conditions, the axial velocity profile will vary linearly across the cell boundary layer and the mass transfer coefficient for this situation is given by what is known as the Leveque approximation, which gives a result similar to Equation 5.151 with the lead constant of 1.077 replaced with the value of 1.03. The shear-induced diffusivity of the red blood cells was found through experimental measurements to be described by the following equation (Zydney and Colton, 1986). Dacells W= 003 2. \u0000g Here a represents the radius of the red blood cells, about 4.2 μm \u0000g W is the wall shear rate given by the following equation for flow of blood in a single cylin- drical hollow fiber of radius equal to R (see Equation 4.21) \u0000g p W Fz R = ()4 3 Show that Equation 5.151 (with 1.077 replaced with 1.03) can be rewritten as follows for the flow of blood in the hollow fiber membrane. k a z mW= æ è ç ö ø ÷005 4 13 . / \u0000g The previous expressions can then be substituted into Equation 6.109 to obtain an expression for the axial change of the volumetric flow rate of the blood, i.e., F(z), as a result of plasma filtration. dF z dz Rq zR a z Fz R Ccells su() =- () =- ´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ ´ () ´22 005 4 4 13 3pp p .ln / rrface cells bulkC æ è ç ö ø ÷ The plasma filtration rate (Qf) is defined as the difference between the flow rate of the enter- ing blood, i.e., F(0), and that leaving the device, i.e., F(L). With Qf = F(0) – F(L), the previ- ous differential equation can be integrated over the length of the hollow fibers (L) to find the fractional filtrate yield, defined as the ratio of the total plasma filtrate formed (Qf) and the inlet blood flow rate F(0).

How does the value of PmS compare to the data shown in Figure 6.5? 6.10 Using the Renkin-Crone equation, make a graph of capillary solute extraction (E) as a func- tion of capillary position (z) for various values of the ratio 2prP z Q cm . Identify conditions on your plot for which the solute transport is flow limited and diffusion limited. 6.11 Levick (1991) presented the following data obtained by Renkin (1977) for the capillary clear- ance of antipyrine and urea as a function of blood flow in skeletal muscle. Based on this data, which of these solutes’ transport rate is flow limited and which is diffusion limited? Calculate the value of PmS for urea.

The following table summarizes the concentration of these solutes (% dose per 0.2 mL of perfusate sample) for various periods of time following their injection into the gland.

The hollow fiber is 20 cm in length and has a diameter of 400 μm. The flow rate of a liquid through the hollow fiber is 1 cm3 min−1, and in the shell space, another liquid also flows through at a flow rate of 100 cm3 min−1. The liquid enter- ing the hollow fiber also contains a permeable solute. It is found that the concentration of the permeable solute exiting the hollow fiber is 10% of the concentration of this solute when entering the hollow fiber in the liquid.

The metabolic needs of the cells near the center of the cell aggregate exceed the supply of oxygen available by simple diffusion. This is illustrated in Figure 7.1 for isolated insulin- producing islet organs (Brockmann bodies) of the fish, Osphronemus goramy. The islet organs, typically 800 μm in diameter, were placed in culture media, and the oxygen partial pressure in the surrounding media and within the cells was measured radially using an oxygen microelectrode. For the case with no convection in the media (diamond symbols), we see that the oxygen partial pres- sure drops sharply and has been reduced to nearly zero within a few hundred microns of the Brockmann bodies’ surface (electrode position of 0 μm). Those cells that experience reduced oxygen levels suffer from hypoxia. If the oxygen level is reduced beyond some critical value, the cells may die, which is called necrosis. Note that with increased convection (fluid mixing) in the surrounding media (square symbols), the partial pressure of oxygen at the surface and core regions of the Brockmann bodies is increased significantly in comparison to the case without convection. This is a result of the decrease in the resistance to oxygen transport of the fluid surrounding the islets. However, we still observe a large decrease in the oxygen partial pressure within the islet bodies. Clearly, the development of such complex cellular systems as vertebrates required the development of oxygen delivery systems that are more efficient than diffusion alone. This has been accomplished by the development of two specialized systems that enhance the delivery of oxygen to cells. The first is the circulatory system, which carries oxygen in the blood by convection to tiny blood vessels called capillaries in the neighborhood of the cells. Here, oxygen is released and then diffuses over much shorter distances to the cells. Second, a specialized oxygen carrier protein, called hemoglobin, is contained within the red blood cells (RBCs) that are suspended within the blood plasma. The pres- ence of hemoglobin overcomes the very low solubility of oxygen in water. In this chapter, we will investigate the factors that affect oxygen delivery to cells. 7.1.1 pO2 and Henry’s constant Figure 7.1 provides measured values of the oxygen concentration within a spherical volume of cells. We see that the oxygen concentration is expressed in terms of the partial pressure of oxygen. It is quite common to express oxygen concentration in terms of its partial pressure in units of mmHg. Recall that the gas-phase equilibrium partial pressure of oxygen, or pO2, above a liquid solution is related to the oxygen concentration in the solution by Henry’s law, which is expressed by the following equation: pOPyH Coxygen oxygen oxygen2 º= (7.1) 350 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering In Equation 7.1, Hoxygen is Henry’s constant. Henry’s constant for oxygen in water at temperatures from 0°C to 40°C is shown in Table 7.1. Here, we will usually express the dissolved oxygen con- centration (Coxygen) in μM, i.e., micromoles of oxygen per liter of solution. With the pO2 in mmHg, this means Henry’s constant will have units of mmHg μM−1. For blood at 37°C, Henry’s constant is 0.74 mmHg μM−1. 7.1.2 Oxygen transport to a spherical volume of cells We can develop a reaction-diffusion model that can be used to describe the pO2 profiles shown in Figure 7.1. From this description we can also determine from data like that shown in Figure 7.1 the oxygen consumption rate of the cells. 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 0 50 100 150 Radial position, µmpO2, mmHg Cell phase Nutrient medium phase Cell surface Figure 7.1 pO2 profiles of Brockmann bodies with convection (square symbols) and without convection (diamond symbols) in the nutrient medium.

Coxygen is the oxygen concentration within a given volume of tissue, which includes the cells and surrounding interstitial fluid. The product of Coxygen and this tissue volume gives the mass of oxygen in the volume of tissue. DT is the effective oxygen diffusivity within the tissue and is described by Equations 6.43 or 6.45. At 37°C, Bentley et al. (1993) found that DT = 2.41 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. This difference in the diffusional oxygen transport rate at steady state must equal the amount of oxygen consumed by the cells, which is given by the expression on the right-hand side of Equation 7.2. Γoxygen represents the rate of oxygen consumption by the cells contained within the volume of cells given by 4πr2Δrϕ, where ϕ is the volume fraction of the cells. The units on Γoxygen are moles of oxy- gen per volume of cells per unit time, which we will express in μM s−1. Now, if we divide Equation 7.2 by Δr and take the limit as Δr → 0 and replace Coxygen with the pO2 using Equation 7.1, we obtain D r d dr r dpO dr H T oxygen oxygen2 2 2æ è ç ö ø ÷ =f G (7.3) The boundary conditions (BC) for Equation 7.3 are BC r dpO dr BC rR pO pO rR 10 0 2 2 22 :, :, == == = (7.4) The oxygen consumption rate for the tissue, i.e., Γoxygen, can be described by Michaelis-Menten type kinetics,* where the oxygen consumption rate of the tissue is dependent on the pO2 in the tissue: Goxygen m VpO KpO = + max2 2 (7.5) It turns out that in most cases for oxygen consumption by cells, Km ≪ pO2. For example, for the islets of Langerhans, the value of Km is 0.44 mmHg (Dionne et al., 1989, 1991). Since the pO2 in tissue usually falls in the range of 10 to 100 mmHg, this means from Equation 7.5 that Γoxygen ≈ Vmax, or Γoxygen is a constant. Vmax is often expressed as the oxygen consumption rate on a per cell basis, and ρcell is the cell density, i.e., the number of cells per total volume, then ϕΓoxygen = ρcellVmax, where ϕ is the * A derivation of the Michaelis-Menten equation can be found in Section 9.6.3. 352 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering volume fraction of the cells within the total volume. In terms of the volume of a single cell, i.e., Vcell, we also have that ϕ = ρcellVcell. With Γoxygen a constant, we can then integrate Equations 7.3 and 7.4 to get pOr pO HR D r R rR oxygen oxygen T 22 2 2 6 1() =- - æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú = fG (7.6) If we have an external concentration boundary layer in the fluid phase surrounding the cells as shown in Figure 7.1, then we can add the external mass transfer resistance by incorporating the mass transfer coefficient into Equation 7.6. At steady state, the rate of mass transfer of oxygen from the bulk solution must equal the rate at which oxygen is being consumed by the cells. Hence, for constant Γoxygen, we can write 4 4 3 23pp fGRk CC Rm oxygen bulk oxygen rR oxygen-() = = (7.7) We can then solve Equation 7.7 for pO2∣r = R after using Henry’s law to replace Coxygen with pO2 as the dependent variable; hence pOpO RH k rR bulk oxygen oxygen m 22 3 = =- fG (7.8) We can then substitute Equation 7.8 into Equation 7.6 for pO2∣r = R to give pOr pO RH k HR D rbulk oxygen oxygen m oxygen oxygen T 22 2 36 1() =- -- fG fG RR æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú 2 (7.9) Equation 7.9 can then be used to describe data like that shown in Figure 7.1 for a spherical volume of cells. Example 7.1 Using the diamond symbol data shown in Figure 7.1, estimate the oxygen consumption rate of the Brockmann bodies, i.e., the value of Γoxygen. Assume the volume fraction of the cells in the Brockmann body is about 0.85. Also, compare the predicted value of the pO2∣r = R from Equation 7.8 to the value given in Figure 7.1. Assume the Brockmann bodies have a diameter of 800 μm and that Henry’s constant for oxygen is 0.70 mmHg μM−1. Solution The data in the following table summarize the pO2 values as a function of radial position mea- sured from the center of the Brockmann bodies. 353 Oxygen transport in biological systems Radial Position in the Brockmann Body, μm pO2, mmHg 100 10.58 150 14.10 175 16.22 200 17.63 225 20.68 250 23.5 275 25.85 300 30.55 325 35.25 350 41.83 400 57.58 We can perform a linear regression of the data in the table using Equation 7.6.

Figure 7.2 shows the results of the linear regression. The slope is found to be equal to −47.6456 mmHg. In order to determine the value of Γoxygen, we need to estimate the value of DT for oxygen. Bentley et al. (1993) provide a value of DT = 2.41 × 10−5 cm2 s−1.

From the linear regression of the data in the table, the y intercept was found to be 53.51 mmHg, which is the same as the surface value of the pO2, and this value compares reasonably well with the measured value of 57.6 mmHg. We can also use Equation 7.8 to find the value of pO2∣r = R. From Figure 7.1 we see that pO mmHg bulk 2 140= . Also, for a sphere of cells like the Brockmann bodies in a stagnant fluid, the Sherwood number (Sh) = 2. Assuming the nutri- ent media is mostly water, then DAB ≈ 2.76 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 (Yoshida and Ohshima, 1966).

This value of the pO2 at the surface of the Brockmann bodies compares really well with the measured value and shows the reasonableness of the parameter values that were used. 7.2 Hemoglobin Figure 7.3 shows the basic structural features of the hemoglobin molecule. The hemoglobin found in adult humans is called hemoglobin A. Hemoglobin consists of four polypeptide chains (a polymer of amino acids), two of one kind called the α chain and two of another kind called the β chain. These polypeptide chains of hemoglobin A are held together by noncovalent attractions. The hemoglobin molecule is nearly spherical with a diameter of about 5.5 nm and a molecular weight of 68,000. The oxygen binding capacity of hemoglobin* depends on the presence of a nonpolypeptide unit called the heme group. The iron atom within heme gives blood its distinctive red color. The heme group is also called a prosthetic group because it gives the hemoglobin protein its overall functional activity. The heme group consists of an organic part that binds through four nitrogen atoms with * Abbreviated as Hb. Heme, oxygen binding site α α β β Figure 7.3 Structure of hemoglobin. 355 Oxygen transport in biological systems the iron atom within the center. The organic part is called the protoporphyrin and consists of four pyrrole rings linked by methene bridges. The iron atom can form up to six bonds, four of which are committed to the pyrrole rings. So we have two additional bonds available, one on each side of the heme plane. A heme group can therefore bind one molecule of oxygen. The four heme groups in a hemoglobin molecule are located near the surface of the molecule, and the oxygen binding sites are about 2.5 nm apart. Each of the four chains contains a single heme group and therefore a single oxygen binding site. A molecule of hemoglobin therefore has the poten- tial to bind four molecules of oxygen. Hemoglobin is an allosteric protein, and its oxygen binding properties are affected by interactions between these separate and nonadjacent oxygen binding sites. The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin enhances the binding of additional oxygen molecules. The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is therefore said to be cooperative.* 7.3 The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve The binding of oxygen with hemoglobin is described by the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve shown in Figure 7.4. This is an equilibrium curve that expresses, for a given oxygen partial pressure (or pO2), the fractional occupancy of the hemoglobin-oxygen binding sites (Y) on a large number of hemoglobin molecules. The equilibrium partial pressure of oxygen, or pO2, above a solution of blood is related to the dissolved oxygen concentration by Henry’s law, which is given by Equation 7.1. In Equation 7.1, Hoxygen is Henry’s constant with a value for blood at 37°C of 0.74 mmHg μM−1. Coxygen is the dissolved oxygen concentration (μM) in the blood. It is important to realize that the pO2 is exerted only by the dissolved oxygen. Oxygen bound to hemoglobin does not directly affect the pO2 but serves only as a source or sink for oxygen. * An analogy for cooperative binding would be several people entering a life raft from the water. Because of the high sides of the life raft it is very difficult for the first person to get aboard. Once one person is aboard she can help the next person. Two people on board make it even easier to load the next person and so on. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 pO2 Oxygen partial pressure, mmHgFractional Hb saturationY pO2 Figure 7.4 Oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. 356 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 7.4 Oxygen levels in blood Table 7.2 summarizes some typical properties of arterial and venous blood. The concentration of hemoglobin in blood (see Table 4.1) is about 150 g L−1 = 15 g dL−1 = 2200 μM. Since each molecule of hemoglobin can bind at most four molecules of oxygen, the saturated (Y = 1) concentration of oxygen bound to hemoglobin, i.e., CSAT ¢ , is equal to 8800 μM. Comparing this saturated value, or even the arterial or venous values shown in Table 7.2 (i.e., as oxyhemoglobin), to the arterial dis- solved oxygen value of 130 μM clearly shows that the bulk of the oxygen that is available in the blood is carried by hemoglobin. The P50 value represents the value of the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) at which 50% of the oxygen binding sites are filled, i.e., Y = 0.5. From Figure 7.4, we see this occurs when the pO2 ≈ 26 mmHg. 7.5 The Hill equation In 1913, Archibald Hill proposed that the sigmoidal shape of the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve shown in Figure 7.4 can be described by the following equilibrium reaction: HbO k k Hb nO n2 1 1 2() ¬¾¾¾ ¾®¾ + - (7.10) In this equation, n represents the number of molecules of oxygen that bind with hemoglobin (Hb) to form oxyhemoglobin, i.e., [Hb(O2)n]. Writing an elementary rate expression for the appearance of hemoglobin, with k1 and k−1 representing the reaction rate constants, we obtain dHb dt kHbO kHbO n néë ùû = ()é ë ù û - éë ùû éë ùû =-12 12 0 (7.11) where the brackets imply the concentration of the respective chemical species. Assuming the reac- tion given by Equation 7.10 is at equilibrium, we can set Equation 7.11 equal to zero and solve for the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin in terms of the free hemoglobin and dissolved oxygen concentrations: Hb OHbO n n 22()é ë ù û = éë ùû éë ùûk (7.12) Table 7.2 Oxygen Levels in Blood Oxygen Property Arterial Venous Partial pressure (tension), pO2, mmHg 95 40 Dissolved O2, μM 130 54 As oxyhemoglobin, μM 8500 6424 Total effective (dissolved + oxy − Hb), μM 8630 6478 Other useful data: Hoxygen = 0.74 mmHg μM−1; saturated oxyhemoglobin = 8800 μM; P50 ~ 26 mmHg; n = 2.34. 357 Oxygen transport in biological systems In Equation 7.12, κ is defined as k−1/k1. The fraction of hemoglobin that is saturated (Y) is defined by the following relationship: Y Hb O Hb OHb Hb O Hb Hb O n n n n º ()é ë ù û ()é ë ù û + éë ùû = ()é ë ù û éë ùû + () 2 2 2 2 1 éé ë ù û éë ùûHb (7.13) This equation can be simplified using Equations 7.1 and 7.12 to obtain the following result: Y O O pO PpO n n n n n= éë ùû + éë ùû = () + () k k 2 2 2 50 21 (7.14) The Pn 50 value was substituted for Hoxygen n k . Equation 7.14 is called the Hill equation and can be used to provide a mathematical relationship between Y and pO2 that describes the behavior shown in Figure 7.4 and is convenient to use in design calculations. The regression analysis of Y and pO2 data is facilitated by the following rearrangement of the Hill equation: ln ln ln Y Y npOn P 1 250 - = ()- (7.15) A plot of ln Y Y1- æ è ç ö ø ÷ versus ln(pO2) is linear with a slope equal to n and a y intercept equal to −n ln P50. This is called the Hill plot. The following example illustrates the use of the Hill equation to represent the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve. Example 7.2 The following table presents data that represents the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation. Show that the Hill equation provides excellent representation of this data.

We also see in Figure 7.5 (dashed line) that the Hill equation provides for an excellent representation of the oxygen hemoglobin dis- sociation curve. 7.6 Other factors that can affect the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve Other molecules, such as H+, CO2, and organic phosphates (such as 2,3-diphosphoglycerate [DPG]) also bind on specific sites on the hemoglobin molecule and greatly affect its oxygen binding abil- ity through allosteric interactions. A lowering of the pH shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the right as shown in Figure 7.6.

CO2 at increased levels and constant pH also lowers the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. In metabolically active tissues such as the muscle, the higher levels of CO2 and H+ in the capillaries have a beneficial effect by promoting the release of oxygen. This is called the Bohr effect. As shown in Figure 7.6, we see that the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve shifts to the right when the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) is increased. Under these conditions, CO2 can reversibly bind to hemoglobin displacing oxygen to form a compound known as carbaminohemoglobin. The reverse process also occurs, i.e., oxygen binding to hemoglobin has the ability to displace CO2 that is bound to hemoglobin. This is important in both tissues and in the lungs. In the tissue capillaries, the higher pCO2 in the tissue space results in the formation of carbaminohemoglobin, which increases the release of oxygen from hemoglobin. Within the lungs, where the pO2 is much higher within the gas space of the alveoli, there is a displacement of CO2 from the hemoglobin by oxygen. This is called the Haldane effect. The affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen within the RBC is significantly lower than that of hemoglobin in free solution. Within the RBC, there exists an organic phosphate called 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) at about the same concentration as hemoglobin. DPG binds to hemoglobin and reduces the oxygen binding capacity as shown in Figure 7.6. Without DPG, the value of P50 is reduced to about 1 mmHg. This makes it very difficult for hemoglobin to release the bound oxygen at low values of the pO2. Note that without DPG, there would be essentially no release of oxygen in the physiological range of pO2 values from 40 to 95 mmHg. Therefore, the presence of DPG within the RBC is vital for hemoglobin to perform its oxygen carrying role. 7.7 Tissue oxygenation With this understanding of the oxygen binding ability of hemoglobin, we can now focus on tis- sue oxygenation. Hemoglobin rich with oxygen within the RBCs is transported by the circulatory system to the capillaries where the oxygen is able to diffuse out of the capillary to the tissue that surrounds each capillary. The consumption of oxygen by the tissues creates the driving force for oxygen diffusion and also causes the pO2 level to decrease along the length of the capillary, which causes a release of oxygen from the hemoglobin in the blood. Consider the capillary bed shown earlier in Figure 6.11. We can develop the following simple mathematical model to describe oxygen consumption by the tissue. We assume that the capillary bed and the surrounding tissue space are each well mixed with respect to oxygen. This assumption allows us to write the following mass balance equations for oxygen between the arterial and venous flows of the capillary blood and the tissue. We will let VT represent the volume of the tissue space (including the capillaries), let q be the tissue blood perfusion rate, i.e., Q/VT, in units of cm3 of blood (cm3 tissue)−1 min−1, and let Goxygen¢ represent the tissue oxygen consumption rate (μM s−1) on a total tissue volume basis; hence, G fGoxygen oxygen¢ = . Coxygen represents the dissolved oxygen con- centration in the blood (μM) and CHbO¢ represents the concentration of oxygen in the blood that is bound to hemoglobin (μM), Coxygen represents the concentration of oxygen in the tissue (μM), PC (cm s−1) is the permeability of oxygen through the capillary wall, and SC represents the total surface area of the capillaries (cm2). With these definitions, we can then write the following steady-state oxygen mass balances for the blood and tissue regions: 0 =+ ¢() -+ ¢() -qV CC qV CC PST oxygenHbO arterial T oxygenHbO venous CC CCCoxygen venous oxygen-() (7.16) 360 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 0 =-()- ¢PS CC VCC oxygen venous oxygenT oxygenG (7.17) Note that the convective terms (containing q) in Equation 7.16 include oxygen transported in the dissolved states as well as that bound to hemoglobin. However, the mass transfer of oxygen across the capillary wall is only based on the difference between the dissolved oxygen concentration in the blood and that within the tissue. Equations 7.16 and 7.17 can then be added together and solved to give Equation 7.18 for the value of the tissue oxygen consumption rate. Goxygen oxygenHbO arterial oxygenHbO venous qC CC C¢ =+ ¢() -+ ¢()é ë ù ûû (7.18) 7.7.1 Nominal tissue oxygen consumption rate To solve Equation 7.18 for the oxygen consumption rate of tissue requires a value of the tissue blood perfusion rate, q. Table 7.3 provides representative values for the blood flow to various organs and tissues in the human body. The blood perfusion in this table is expressed on the basis of blood flow in milliliters per min per 100 g of tissue or organ. A nominal tissue perfusion rate is on the order of 0.5 mL cm−3 min−1 (assuming the density of tissue, ρtissue ≈ 1 g cm−3). The nominal arterial and venous pO2 levels from Table 7.2 are 95 and 40 mmHg, respectively. We can then use Equation 7.18 to obtain an estimate of the nominal oxygen consumption rate, Goxygen¢ , as shown in the following example. Example 7.3 Calculate the oxygen consumption rate in μM s−1 using the previous nominal values for the blood perfusion rate and the arterial and venous pO2 levels.

The actual value for any given tissue will depend on the cells’ specific requirement for oxy- gen. McMurtrey (2016) summarized the oxygen and glucose consumption rates for a variety of cell types. 7.7.2 Calculating the venous pO2 for a given oxygen demand If the value of G¢oxygen is known for a given tissue, then Equation 7.18 can be rearranged to solve for the change in blood oxygenation in order to provide the oxygen demands of the tissue: CC CC q oxygenHbO venous oxygenHbO arterial oxygen+ ¢( ) =+() -¢ ¢G (7.19) To illustrate this type of calculation, where G¢oxygen is known, consider the islet of Langerhans. The islets of Langerhans are a specialized cluster of cells located within the pancreas. The islets amount to about 1%–2% of the pancreatic tissue mass. The cells that lie within the islet are responsible for the control of glucose metabolism through the secretion of the hormones insulin (β cells) and glu- cagon (α cells). The loss of the β cells as a result of an autoimmune response of the immune system results in type I or insulin-dependent diabetes. An islet of Langerhans is only about 150 μm in diameter. The single islet blood flow has been deter- mined to be about 7 nL min−1, which gives an islet tissue perfusion rate of about 4 mL cm−3 min−1 (Lifson et al., 1980). This value is about four times the blood perfusion rate of the pancreas itself and is probably related to the hormonal function of the islet. The oxygen consumption rate for tissues like islets can be described by Michaelis-Menten type kinet- ics as given by Equation 7.5. For islets, the value of Km is 0.44 mmHg and the value of Vmax is 26 μM s−1 when the islets are exposed to basal levels of glucose (100 mg dL−1) and 46 μM s−1 under stimulated glucose levels (300 mg dL−1) (Dionne et al., 1989, 1991). Because of the small value of Km, the tissue oxygen consumption rate is generally independent of the tissue pO2 until the pO2 in the tissue reaches a value of just a few mmHg. Cellular metabolic processes are therefore relatively insensitive to the local pO2 level until it reaches a value of about 5 mmHg. Therefore, we can approximate the value of Γoxygen as simply the value of Vmax. Only at very low pO2 levels would this approximation be no longer valid. 362 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering From Equation 7.19, we know the value of G¢oxygen , and the value of CCoxygenHbO arterial +( )¢ is the nomi- nal arterial value of 8630 μM (from Table 7.2). We can now solve for the value of CCoxygenHbO venous +( )¢ recognizing that C HbO¢ (the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin) depends on Coxygen (the dissolved oxygen concentration) through the Hill equation (Equation 7.14), where we make use of the fact that pO2 = Hoxygen Coxygen (i.e., Henry’s law). Hence, CHbO¢ is given by C CH C PH C HbO SAT oxygen oxygen n n oxygen oxygen n¢ ¢ = () + ()50 (7.20) where CSAT¢ is the saturated amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin, which is 8800 μM. Substituting this equation into Equation 7.19 for the venous value of CHbO¢ , we obtain Equation 7.21 for the dis- solved oxygen concentration in the venous blood: C CH C PH C oxygen SAT oxygen oxygen n n oxygen oxygen n+ () + () é ë ê ê ù û ¢ 50 úú ú =+ ¢() - venous oxygenHbO arterial oxygenCC q G¢ (7.21) For the given values of q, G¢oxygen, and CCoxygenHbO arterial +( )¢ , Equation 7.21 can be solved for the dis- solved oxygen concentration (Coxygen) in the blood leaving the tissue, which in this case is an islet of Langerhans. Once we have obtained the value of Coxygen, then the concentration of oxygen bound to hemoglobin, CHbO¢ , can be found from Equation 7.20. The pO2 of the exiting blood is then given by Henry’s law, i.e., Equation 7.1. The following example illustrates these calculations. Example 7.4 Calculate the change in blood oxygenation within an islet of Langerhans. Perform the calcula- tions under conditions of normal blood perfusion for basal and stimulated levels of glucose. Also find the critical blood perfusion rate to maintain the exiting pO2 at 20 mmHg under con- ditions of basal and stimulated levels of glucose. Solution Equation 7.21 allows us to make these calculations. Since this equation is nonlinear in Coxygen, an implicit root-finding method is needed to solve for Coxygen in the venous blood. For the case of basal glucose stimulation, the venous dissolved oxygen concentration is found to be 102.7 μM. The corresponding value of the exiting pO2 from Equation 7.1 is 76 mmHg, and the fractional saturation of the hemoglobin from Equation 7.14, or Figure 7.4, is 0.925. The exiting oxygen levels under stimulated glucose conditions are found to be 86.7 μM with a pO2 of 64 mmHg and a fractional saturation of 0.89. In both of these cases, we observe a modest decrease in oxygen levels in the blood exiting the islet. This is because the islets are highly perfused with blood. The critical perfusion rate is defined as the blood flow rate to the tissue that just maintains a critical pO2 level, e.g., 20 mmHg. Hence, we solve Equation 7.21 for the value of the blood perfusion rate, i.e., q. We then find that the critical blood perfusion rate for an islet is 0.28 mL cm−3 min−1 under basal glucose conditions. A similar calculation shows that the critical blood perfusion rate is 0.50 mL cm−3 min−1 under stimulated glucose conditions. 363 Oxygen transport in biological systems 7.8 Oxygen transport in blood oxygenators, bioartificial organs, and tissue engineered constructs This discussion on oxygen transport is also of critical importance in the design of blood oxygenators (see Section 9.5), bioartificial organs (Colton, 1995, 2014), and engineered constructs used for tissue engineering (Radisic et al., 2006; McMurtrey, 2016). In one type of bioartificial organ proposed for the treatment of diabetes, therapeutic cells such as the islets of Langerhans, or other insulin-secreting cells, are sandwiched between two permselective membranes that are surrounded by vascularized tissue or adjacent to a polymer matrix material that has been vascularized by the host. The permselective membrane has a porous structure at the molec- ular level such that small molecules like oxygen, key nutrients, and the therapeutic agent are readily permeable; however, the components of the host immune system cannot cross the membrane. The cells are therefore said to be immunoprotected.* In tissue engineering applications,† cells are placed within porous polymeric constructs that in many cases can be represented as thin disks. In these applications, key nutrients are brought to the cells primarily by diffusion, and in most cases, the critical species that affects the design is the transport of oxygen. The following discussion will first look at an oxygen mass balance for a blood oxygenator. We will then focus on calculating the oxygen gradient in thin planar or one-dimensional disks that contain cells with the goal of providing sufficient oxygen to the cells. In general, the oxygen gradient will depend on the cell density in the region of interest, the viability of the cells, and the metabolic activ- ity of the cells. 7.8.1 Oxygen mass balance for a blood oxygenator These concepts can also be used to determine the amount of oxygen transported to blood in medi- cal devices such as blood oxygenators. In this case, a steady-state oxygen mass balance says that the amount of oxygen transported into the blood is equal to the difference between the amount of oxygen in the blood leaving and entering the oxygenator. Hence, \u0000m QC CC Coxygenblood oxygenHbO out oxygenHbO in =+() -+()é ë ù û ¢¢ (7.22) In this equation \u0000moxygen is the amount of oxygen transported to the blood Qblood is the blood flow rate through the oxygenator Example 7.5 illustrates the application of Equation 7.22. Example 7.5 Blood travels through a membrane oxygenator at a flow rate of 5000 mL min−1. The entering pO2 of the blood is 30 mmHg and the exiting blood pO2 is 100 mmHg. Calculate the amount of oxygen transported into the blood in μmol s−1. * We will discuss immunoprotection in greater detail in Chapter 11. † Tissue engineering is discussed in Chapter 10. 364 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Solution First, we need to find the amount of oxygen that is dissolved in the blood at 30 mmHg and at 100 mmHg. This can be found from Henry’s law given by Equation 7.1.

The planar immunoisolation membranes enclose the layer of cells. We will prescribe the pO2 level at the outer surface of the immunoisolation membrane to be some average of the blood pO2 found in the capillaries adjacent to this membrane. A steady-state shell balance for oxygen over a thickness Δx of the cell layer of cross-sectional area S can be written as follows: 0 =- +- + SD dC dx SD dC dx SxT oxygen x T oxygen xx oxygen D GfD (7.23) Coxygen is the oxygen concentration within a given volume of tissue, i.e., the cells and surround- ing interstitial fluid. The product of Coxygen and this tissue volume gives the mass of oxygen in the volume of tissue. Note that the volumetric oxygen consumption rate of the tissue, Γoxygen (assumed constant), is multiplied by the cell volume, i.e., SΔxϕ, to get the amount of oxygen consumed by the tissue in the shell of thickness Δx. The volume fraction of the cells or tissue is given by ϕ. 365 Oxygen transport in biological systems DT is the effective diffusivity of oxygen within the tissue and was defined earlier in Chapter 6, e.g., by Equations 6.43 and 6.45. Since oxygen is lipid soluble, we would expect DT for oxygen in tissue at 37°C to be on the order of its diffusivity in water, i.e., 2.76 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 (Yoshida and Ohshima, 1966). For example, Bentley et al. (1993) give a value of DT for oxygen diffusion in tissue of 2.41 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. For plasma and interstitial fluid, Goldstick et al. (1976) give a value of the oxygen dif- fusivity of 2.18 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, and for blood with a normal hematocrit of 42%, the oxygen diffusivity is 1.62 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. After dividing Equation 7.23 by Δx, and taking the limit as Δx → 0, Equation 7.24 is obtained, where Henry’s law was used to express the oxygen concentration in terms of the oxygen partial pressure, i.e., pO2 = Hoxygen Coxygen: D dpO dx HT oxygent oxygen 2 2 2 =G f (7.24) Since this equation is a second order differential equation, we require the following two boundary conditions in order to obtain the solution for the pO2 profile within the tissue layer: BC xpOpO BC x dp dx x10 20 22 0 2 :, :, == == = d O (7.25) The first boundary condition (BC1) expresses the pO2 level at the interface between the immunoisola- tion membrane and the layer of cells. The second boundary condition (BC2) results from the device symmetry and expresses the fact that there is no net flow of oxygen across the symmetry plane. Equation 7.24 can now be integrated twice and Equation 7.25 can be used to find the integration constants. Equation 7.26 is then obtained for the oxygen profile within the tissue layer: pOx pO H D xxx oxygen oxygen T 22 0 2 2 2 2() =+ é ë ê ù û ú æ è ç ö ø ÷ - æ è ç ö ø = Gfd dd ÷÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú (7.26) pO2 arterial, in pO2 venous, out xδx+∆x Device symmetry plane Tissue Immunoisolation membrane Vascularized tissue region x Figure 7.7 Conceptual model for a bioartificial organ. 366 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering At this point, the value of pOx 2 0= in Equation 7.26 is unknown. In order to determine pOx 2 0= , we need to develop an additional equation that relates the transport rate of oxygen across the immunoisola- tion membrane to the total consumption of oxygen by the cells. This is given by SP H pO pO S m oxygen AVG x oxygen22 0-() = = dfG (7.27) where Pm is the oxygen permeability of the immunoisolation membrane pOAVG 2 is the average partial pressure of oxygen in the blood in the vascularized region adjacent to the immunoisolation membrane, which is assumed to be known Rearranging Equation 7.27 provides the value of pOx 2 0= : pOpO H P x AVG oxygen oxygen m 2 0 2 = =- é ë ê ù û ú Gfd (7.28) Combining this result for pOx 2 0= with Equation 7.26, we can now write the pO2 gradient within the cell layer as pOx pO H P H D AVG oxygen oxygen m oxygen oxygen 22 2 2 () =- é ë ê ù û ú + GfdG fd TT xxé ë ê ù û ú æ è ç ö ø ÷ - æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú údd 2 2 (7.29) The previous equations can now be used for basic calculations on the effect of oxygen trans- port on the design of a bioartificial organ. These calculations are illustrated in the following examples. Example 7.6 Consider a bioartificial organ such as that shown in Figure 7.7. Assume the value of pOAVG 2 is the mean of the arterial and venous oxygen values, i.e., 68 mmHg. Let the cells be the islets of Langerhans, assumed to be spheres with a diameter of 150 μm, with the basal oxygen consumption rate of 25.9 μM s−1. The half-thickness (δ) of the islet layer is 200 microns and the cell volume fraction (ϕ) is equal to 0.15. The islets are suspended within a hydrogel for which the effective oxygen diffusivity, i.e., DT, is estimated to be 1.67 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The oxygen permeability of the membrane (Pm) is equal to 4 × 10−3 cm s−1. Calculate the pO2 profile in the islet layer of the bioartificial organ. Also find the pO2 at the center of the device, i.e., at x = δ. Solution Equation 7.29 can be used to obtain the solution for the given values of the parameters. Figure  7.8 shows a plot of the pO2 profile within the islet layer of the bioartificial organ. 367 Oxygen transport in biological systems The graph shows that for these conditions, the tissue layer is fully oxygenated. The pO2 at the centerline can be found using Equation 7.29 by setting x = δ: pOx pO H P HAVG oxygen oxygen m oxygen oxygen 22 2 =() =- é ë ê ù û ú +d GfdG fd 22 1 68 25 90 74 015 2 11 D pOx mmHg Ms mmHg M T é ë ê ù û ú -() =() =- ´´ ´ -- d mm.. . 0002 0 004 25 90 74 0150 02 1 11 . . .. .. cm cm s Ms mmHg Mcm - -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ - ´´ ´mm ´´ ´´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ =()=- - -- 002 21 67 10 68 14 37 3 52 1 2 . . . cm cm s pO xmmHgmmHgd 4443192..mmHg mmHg= 7.8.3 Oxygen transport in planar tissue engineered constructs Consider a planar tissue engineered construct where the cells are incorporated into the voids formed within a polymeric construct. On the surface of the construct, there can also be a thin membrane to provide mechanical stability to the entire tissue engineered structure. When implanted in the body, this tissue engineered construct will have vascularized tissue adjacent to this membrane. For this polymeric scaffold, we let εscaffold represent the fraction of the total construct volume that is available for the tissue. When performing an oxygen mass balance over a thin shell of the construct of total cross-sectional area S from x to x + Δx, we see that Equation 7.23 still applies; however, each term in that expres- sion needs to be multiplied by εscaffold, and in the end we still get Equation 7.29. Although Equation 7.29 was derived for the case of the bioartificial organ shown in Figure 7.7, we see that it can be generalized to other situations involving tissue engineered constructs. If the tissue construct does not have the membrane on its surface, then the pO2 at the surface of the construct is equal to pOAVG 2 , which is the average partial pressure of oxygen in the blood in the 0 100 200 0 20 40 60 pO2 profile in tissue layerpO2, mmHgpO2 (x) x Axial position, µm Figure 7.8 Oxygen profile in a bioartificial organ. 368 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering vascularized region adjacent to the construct which is assumed to be known. In this case, we then have that pOpO x AVG 2 0 2 = = , and Equation 7.26 gives the pO2 profile within the tissue construct as pOx pO H D xxAVG oxygen oxygen T 22 2 2 2 2() =+ é ë ê ù û ú æ è ç ö ø ÷ - æ è ç ö ø Gfd dd ÷÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú (7.30) 7.8.3.1 In vitro culture of planar tissue engineered constructs The cells in tissue engineered con- structs are often first grown in culture in a bioreactor before implantation. In this case, the tissue engineered construct is immersed within a well-stirred nutrient medium. If this nutrient medium is not sufficiently agitated, then there will also exist a concentration boundary layer in the fluid sur- rounding the cell layer construct. This external mass transfer resistance to oxygen transport can be accounted for by a mass transfer coefficient, km. In this case, we can add an additional resistance to Equation 7.29 like the term for the membrane resistance. Hence, Equation 7.29 becomes pOx pO H Pk Hbulk oxygen oxygen mm oxygen oxyge 22 11 () =- + é ë ê ù û ú +Gfd G nn TD xxfd dd 2 2 2 2 é ë ê ù û ú æ è ç ö ø ÷ - æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú (7.31) where pObulk 2 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the bulk nutrient media solution.

(2004) measured oxygen gradients in tissue engineered cartilaginous constructs. Using a microelectrode, oxygen concentrations were measured as a function of distance into the tissue engineered constructs containing the chondrocytes. In addition, they also deter- mined the chondrocyte distribution as a function of position with the construct. The average number of chondrocytes per cm3 of total construct, i.e., the cell density, 28 days after seeding, is about 1.5 × 108 cells cm−3. The table below summarizes the pO2 levels that were measured within the construct as a function of the distance from the exposed surface of the construct. Depth, μm pO2, mmHg 0 160 250 114 500 95 750 76 1000 61 1250 53 1500 42 1750 38 2000 30 2500 19 369 Oxygen transport in biological systems They also estimated the diffusivity of oxygen in the construct to be 3.8 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. From these data, estimate the oxygen consumption rate of the chondrocytes in μM s−1 assuming the diameter of a chondrocyte is 20 μm. Solution We can use Equation 7.32 to describe the oxygen partial pressure within the construct since the oxygen concentration is given at the surface of the construct. The volume of one cell, i.e., Vcell, is equal to 4.19 × 10−9 cm3 cell−1. Multiplying the cell volume by the cell density, i.e., ρcell, provides the value of the cell volume fraction ϕ. Hence, we have that ϕ = Vcell ρcell and in this case ϕ = 0.63. A regression analysis can then be performed to find the best value of Γoxygen in Equation 7.32 that fits the data in the table. Figure 7.9 shows the results of these calcula- tions. Γoxygen is found to equal 0.037 μM s−1 and we see that Equation 7.32 provides a good representation of the data. It is also important to note that chondrocytes have a very low oxy- gen consumption rate, which helps them survive in the relatively avascular regions of cartilage tissue. Heywood et al. (2006) in a study involving bovine articular chondrocytes reported oxygen consumption rates ranging from 9.6 × 10−16 mol cell−1 h−1 at basal levels of glucose to 18.4 × 10−16 mol cell−1 h−1 at reduced levels of glucose. On the basis of a cell diameter of 20 μm, this equates to a metabolic oxygen consumption rate for chondrocytes of 0.06–0.12 μM s−1, which is of the same order as found here for the data obtained by Malda et al. (2004). Example 7.8 A thin tissue engineered construct of genetically transformed cells is a cylindrical disk 5 cm in diameter. The construct is suspended in a nutrient solution at 37°C, and the disk is rotated at 50 rpm as shown in Figure 5.6. The nutrient solution has a density of 1 g cm−3 and a viscosity of 0.8 cP. The oxygen diffusivity in the nutrient solution was found to be 2.65 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 Depth, µmPartial pressure of oxygen, mmHg Figure 7.9 Measured and predicted oxygen gradients in engineered cartilaginous constructs. 370 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering and the effective diffusivity of oxygen through the construct containing the immobilized cells is 2.3 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The half-thickness of the disk (δ) that contains the cells is 150 μm and the cell volume fraction in the disk is 0.35. The consumption rate of oxygen on a per cell volume basis is 18.5 μM s−1. If the pO2 of oxygen in the bulk nutrient solution is 150 mmHg, estimate the oxygen level at the centerline of the disk (i.e., x = δ). Assume that Henry’s constant for the oxygen in this nutrient solution is equal to 0.71 mmHg μM−1. Solution We can use Equation 7.31 to solve this problem. Since there is no membrane on the surface of the construct, this equation can be written with x = δ as pOx pO H k H D bulk oxygen oxygen m oxygen oxygen T 22 2 2 =() =- - é ë d GfdG fd êê ù û ú (A) We can then calculate the value of km using Equation 5.119 for a rotating disk.

The maximum half-thickness is that value of δ, which makes the pO2(x = δ) a certain limiting value. For example, the pO2(x = δ) cannot be less than zero. This is illustrated in Example 7.9. 371 Oxygen transport in biological systems Example 7.9 A design for a bioartificial liver consists of a thin layer of hepatocytes that are immobilized within a gel-like material that coats the inside surface of hollow fiber membranes. The hepa- tocyte cell fraction in the gel-like layer is 0.40, and these cells consume oxygen at a rate of 29.5 μM s−1. The perfusing fluid is plasma at an average pO2 of 70 mmHg and a temperature of 37°C. The plasma velocity within the hollow fiber is 5 cm s−1, and the plasma has a viscos- ity of 1.2 cP and a density of 1.07 g cm−3. Separate experiments have shown that the oxygen diffusivity within the layer of immobilized hepatocytes is 2.1 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, the diffusivity of oxygen in the plasma is 2.2 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, and Henry’s constant is 0.72 mmHg μM−1. The hollow fibers have an inside diameter of 4 mm and a length of 40 cm. What is the maximum thickness of the layer of hepatocytes that can line the inside surface of the hollow fiber mem- branes assuming that the lowest allowable pO2 within the layer of hepatocytes is 15 mmHg? Since the radius of the hollow fibers is much larger than the expected thickness of the cell layer, you can neglect the effect of curvature. Solution We can solve Equation 7.31 for δ for the given pO mmHg bulk 2 70= and the minimal pO2 in the cell layer of 15 mmHg. Rearranging Equation 7.31, we obtain Gf dG fd oxygen oxygen T oxygen oxygen mm H D H Pk p 2 112é ë ê ù û ú ++ é ë ê ù û ú + OOpO x bulk 22 0 = -() = d This is a quadratic equation, which can be solved for δ.

The only parameter left to find is the mass transfer coefficient, i.e., km. This can be found based on the laminar flow of the plasma in a cylindrical tube using Equation 5.169.

This places severe limi- tations on the thickness of the cell layer in devices that rely solely on diffusion to provide the oxygen needed by the cells (Ehsan and George, 2013). Some research groups are working to either generate oxygen in situ within the bioartificial organ or tissue engineered construct or periodically inject exog- enous oxygen to the device as discussed in Example 11.2 (Ludwig et al., 2013; Neufeld et al., 2013). Another approach for enhancing the delivery of oxygen within these devices is to perfuse a fluid through the layer of cells. This is shown conceptually in Figure 7.10. For an implantable device, a 373 Oxygen transport in biological systems perfusion flow of plasma through the device can be obtained by connecting the device between an artery and a vein and filtering the blood through a microporous membrane. The pressure difference between the artery and the vein will produce a flow of plasma through the device, which will carry with it dissolved oxygen and other nutrients needed by the cells. 7.9.1 A model of convective and diffusive transport of oxygen through a planar layer of cells We can develop a mathematical model for the convective and diffusive transport of oxygen to the cells contained within the structure shown in Figure 7.10. The thickness of the layer of cells is given by δ and the cell fraction is ϕ. The filtration rate of the fluid through the layer of cells, i.e., Qfiltrate, is given by Equation 3.4 for the given effective pressure drop over the layer of cells.

BC1 expresses the fact that the convec- tive rate at which oxygen enters the cellular layer on the feed side of x = 0 has to equal the rate at which oxygen is transported by diffusion and convection within the layer of cells at x = 0. The con- centration of oxygen in the fluid exiting the cellular layer is not known and must be found from the solution to Equation 7.34. BC2 is a requirement on the oxygen profile at x = δ so that the following mass balance condition is satisfied, i.e., v Cv Cfiltrate oxygen out filtrate oxygen x= =d. The solution of Equations 7.34 and 7.35 is facilitated by defining a dimensionless oxygen concen- tration and a dimensionless distance in the cellular layer, where qh d º= º C C pO pO and xoxygen oxygen in in 2 2 . Upon substituting these dimensionless variables for Coxygen and x into Equations 7.34 and 7.35, we get d d v D d dD C d filtrate T oxygen T oxygen in 2 2 2q h dq h fG d - æ è ç ö ø ÷ = é ë ê ù û ú 22 2 q h q hd Pe d d Da-= (7.36) In Equation 7.36 we also have formed two dimensionless groups. The first is the Peclet number (Pe) that is given by Pe v D filtrate T = d and the Damkohler number (Da) that is given by Da DC oxygen T oxygen in= é ë ê ù û ú fG d2 . The Peclet number represents the ratio of the rate of the convective transport of oxygen to the dif- fusive transport rate of oxygen. If the Pe ≫ 1, then convection will dominate the transport of oxygen within the cellular layer. If the Pe ≪ 1, then the diffusive transport of oxygen dominates. The Damkohler number represents the ratio of the rate of oxygen consumption by the cells to the diffusive transport rate of oxygen. If Da ≫ 1, then the cells’ oxygen consumption rate is much higher than the rate at which diffusion can provide the oxygen needed by the cells. In this case, we would expect to see large decreases in the oxygen concentration or pO2 within the layer of cells. On the other hand, if Da ≪ 1, then in comparison, the oxygen consumption rate by the cells is much smaller than the rate at which oxygen can be supplied by diffusion, and we would expect very little change in the oxygen concentration or the pO2 through the layer of cells. Using these dimensionless variables, the boundary conditions in Equation 7.35 become BC Pe d d BC d d 10 1 1 21 0 0 0 1 :, :, h q h q h q h h h h == -+ == = = = (7.37) Since the Pe and Da are constant in the situation we are considering, we can obtain an analytical solution to Equations 7.36 and 7.37.

The same result occurs for Da = 0, meaning that there is no consumption of oxygen by the cells. The exiting oxygen concentration or pO2 can be found from Equation 7.38 by setting η = 1. Hence, qout Da Pe =-1 (7.39) Since θout has to be greater than a minimum critical value, i.e., θcritical, this means that Equation 7.39 imposes a condition on Da and Pe, i.e., Da Pe or Da Pe critical critical£- ££ -10 1qq (7.40) If θcritical = 0, then we see from Equation 7.40 that Da Pe or Pe Da£³1 . Example 7.10 Consider a thin planar tissue engineered construct (see Figure 7.10) with a thickness (δ) of 400 μm. The device is connected between an artery and a vein that generates a plasma filtrate flow with a superficial residence time within the device of 2 s. If the plasma entering the device has a pO2 = 70 mmHg, calculate the pO2 of the plasma leaving the device. The cellular oxy- gen consumption rate is 25 μM s−1, and the effective diffusivity of oxygen through the layer of cells is 2.4 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. Henry’s constant for oxygen is 0.74 mmHg μM−1. The volume fraction of cells in the device is 0.6. If the device could only rely on the diffusion of oxygen, at what distance into the device would the pO2 = 10 mmHg? Solution We can use Equation 7.39 to find the pO2 of oxygen in the plasma leaving the device.

If we let a pO2 = 10 mmHg be the limiting value, then we see that the filtration flow of plasma through the layer of cells provides sufficient oxygen to the cells in the construct since pOout 2 is greater than 10 mmHg. If diffusion is the only mechanism for oxygen transport to these cells, then we can use Equation 7.26 to find the value of δ, which makes the pO2(x = δ) = 10 mmHg.

(2001), Allen and Bhatia (2003), and Mehta and Linderman (2006) describe oxygen transport in microchannel perfusion bioreactor systems. The microchannel bioreactor also serves as a model system for the flow channels that are formed in perfusion bioreactors that are used for the production of tissue engineered constructs. The oxygen concentration within the bioreactor can be controlled by adjusting the flow rate of media thru the device. Figure 7.11 illustrates the parallel-plate microchannel bioreactor used by Allen and Bhatia (2003). Nutrient media flows through the bioreactor with an average velocity equal to V. On the lower sur- face, there is a monolayer of attached cells that consume the oxygen that is in the flowing stream. The entering oxygen concentration is Coxygen in .

However, solute diffusion in the y direction is important in this case. After dividing by ΔxΔy and taking the limit as Δx and Δy → 0, the following differential equation is obtained: V C x D C y oxygen AB oxygen¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ 2 2 (7.42) This is a convective-diffusion equation and describes the transport of oxygen within the parallel- plate microchannel bioreactor. The term on the left-hand side of Equation 7.42 represents the trans- port of oxygen by convection, or the bulk flow of the fluid flowing through the bioreactor, and the term on the right-hand side represents oxygen transport by diffusion in the y direction. Recall that we have assumed that the transport of oxygen in the axial direction (x) by convection is much larger than that transported by axial diffusion. This means that the Peclet number is much larger than unity, or Pe VL D L AB = ≫ 1.

BC2 expresses the fact that the flux of oxygen at the cellular sur- face is equal to the rate of oxygen consumption by the cells. The thickness of the cellular layer along the lower surface is δcell, and ϕ represents the volume fraction of the cells along the lower surface. BC3 says that oxygen is not consumed or lost from the upper surface of the bioreactor. Next, we introduce the following dimensionless variables: xh qºº º x L y h C C oxygen oxygen in,, (7.44) After substituting these dimensionless variables into Equations 7.42 and 7.43, the following dimen- sionless equations are obtained: ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ q x aq hPeh 2 2 (7.45) 378 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering BC BC Da BC 10 1 21 30 0 1 0 :, :, :, xq h q h h q h h h == = ¶ ¶ =- = ¶ ¶ = = = (7.46) The Peclet number (Peh) in Equation 7.45 is based on the flow channel thickness (h) and is defined as Pe Vh D h AB = . Also, in Equation 7.45, we have the geometrical factor, a= L h . The Peclet number, i.e., Peh, in Equation 7.45 represents the ratio of oxygen transport by convection in the x direction to that transported by diffusion in the y direction. The Peclet number based on the length in the direc- tion of flow, i.e., Pe VL D L AB = , is equal to Peh × α. In Equation 7.46, the dimensionless oxygen flux is also known as the Damkohler number, defined as Da h DC oxygen cell AB oxygen in= fG d . Equations 7.45 and 7.46 can be solved analytically using separation of variables. The resulting dimensionless oxygen concentration profile can be shown to be given by Equation 7.47 (Allen and Bhatia, 2003): qx h ha x p ap x ,Da Pe n n Peh n n h () =+ - -+ -() - æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¥ å1 13 6 2 1 2 2 1 2 22 expccosnph() é ë ê ê ù û ú ú (7.47) Equation 7.47 provides the oxygen concentration within the bioreactor at any position given by the dimensionless variables (ξ, η). For large Peclet numbers, the summation term in Equation 7.47 becomes insignificant a short distance into the bioreactor, and this solution can then be approxi- mated by the following result: qx h ha x,Da Peh () »+ - - æ è ç ö ø ÷1 13 6 2 (7.48) Of particular interest is the location along the cell surface where the oxygen concentration becomes equal to zero, i.e., θ(ξcritical, η = 1) = 0.

The flow rate through the bioreactor is 0.5 cm3 min−1, and the inlet pO2 is 76 mmHg. Use the bio- reactor parameters in the table below from Allen and Bhatia (2003).

For the Da we also recognize that ρVmax = Γoxygenϕδcell. Therefore, we can calculate the Da as shown in the next calculation.

Example 7.12 Allen and Bhatia (2003) obtained the following outlet pO2’s (equivalent to the average pO2 at x = L) for their bioreactor discussed in the previous example at various flow rates for an inlet pO2 = 158 mmHg.

The Krogh tissue model is a good place to start before considering more advanced models that are described in the litera- ture (Mirhashemi et al., 1987; Tsai et al., 1990; Lagerlund and Low, 1993; Secomb et al., 1993; Intaglietta, 1997; Li et al., 1997; Vadapalli et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2014). 7.10.1 Capillary oxygenated hemoglobin mass balance Figure 6.12 illustrates a concentric shell of the Krogh tissue cylinder. Considering blood first, the shell balance equation for oxygenated hemoglobin can be written as follows*: 22 22pp pprrz C t rrVC rrVC rrz R HbO HbO z HbO zz DD DD DD D( ) ¶ ¶ =¢ - ¢ + () + ¢ ²¢¢ HbO (7.51) In Equation 7.51, we ignore the particulate nature of blood as well as the mass transfer resistance of the RBC membrane. The blood is assumed to be in plug flow with an average velocity represented by V. Also, note that the hemoglobin is carried along by the RBC at the average blood velocity (V) and accordingly there is no diffusive transport of hemoglobin. RHbO²¢ represents the production rate of oxygenated hemoglobin per unit volume of blood. After dividing by 2πrΔrΔz and taking the limit as Δz → 0, we obtain the following differential equation that describes the mass balance for oxygenated hemoglobin within the blood flowing through the capillary: ¶¢ ¶ + ¶¢ ¶ = C t V C z R HbOHbO HbO²¢ (7.52) 7.10.2 Capillary unbound oxygen mass balance A shell balance for the free or unbound oxygen in the blood is given by the next equation: 22 2 2 pp p p rrz C t rrVC rrVC rz oxygen oxygen z oxygen zzDD DD D D( ) ¶ ¶ =- - + DD C r rzD C r rrD oxygen oxygen r oxygen oxygen rz oxyge ¶ ¶ + ¶ ¶ - + 2 2 p p D D D nn oxygen z oxygen oxygen zz oxygen C z rrD C z rrzR ¶ ¶ + ¶ ¶ + + 2 2 p p D DD D ²¢ (7.53) In addition to the convective flow of oxygen in blood, i.e., the VCoxygen terms in Equation 7.53, we have also included both the axial and radial diffusion of the oxygen, i.e., the * Unlike the shell balances developed in Chapter 6, we will now leave in the accumulation term so that we can consider, if necessary, unsteady-state problems. 382 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering D C z andD C r oxygen oxygen oxygen oxygen¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ terms, where Doxygen is the diffusivity of oxygen in blood. In Equation 7.53, Roxygen²¢ represents the production rate of oxygen per unit volume of blood. Once again, we divide by 2πrΔrΔz and take the limit as Δr and Δz → 0. We then obtain the following dif- ferential equation that describes the mass balance on dissolved oxygen within the capillary blood: ¶ ¶ + ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶C t V C z D rr r C r Coxygen oxygen oxygen oxygenox1 2 yygen oxygen z R ¶ é ë ê ù û ú + 2 ¢¢¢ (7.54) The two reaction rate terms in Equations 7.53 and 7.54 are simply the negative of each other; there- fore, RRHbO oxygen²¢ ²¢=- . This is true since the rate of disappearance of dissolved oxygen in the blood must equal the rate of appearance of oxygenated hemoglobin within the RBCs. We can also make use of the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve to relate CHbO¢ to Coxygen as follows: ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ C t C t C C m C t C HbO oxygen HbO oxygen oxygen HbO ¢¢ ¢ zz C z C C m C z oxygen HbO oxygen oxygen= ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¶ ¶ ¢ (7.55) where m dC dC HbO oxygen = ¢ is the slope of the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve. Equations 7.52 and 7.54 can now be added together, using Equation 7.55 and Henry’s law (Equation 7.1), to express the dissolved oxygen concentration in terms of the pO2. We then obtain Equation 7.56, which expresses the mass balance for the unbound dissolved oxygen within the capil- lary in terms of the oxygen partial pressure. 11 122 2 2 2+( ) ¶ ¶ ++() ¶¶ = ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶¶ m pO t Vm pO z D rr r pO r pO z oxygen 22 é ë ê ù û ú (7.56) 7.10.2.1 The slope of the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve Before we go any further, let us take a closer look at how to evaluate the parameter m. Recall that m dC dC HbO oxygen º ¢ , which is the slope of the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve. Recognizing that Y C C HbO SAT º ¢ ¢ , we then have that m C dY dC SAT oxygen =¢ . From Henry’s law, i.e., pO2 = HoxygenCoxygen, we then get m HC dY dpO oxygenSAT=¢ 2 (7.57) 383 Oxygen transport in biological systems Note that m is also dimensionless.

After dividing by 2πrΔrΔz and taking the limit as Δr and Δz → 0, the following differential equation is obtained for the oxygen mass balance within the tissue region.

BC2 simply states that oxygen cannot leave the capillary in the 384 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering axial direction in either the blood or the tissue by axial diffusion. BC3 says that the oxygen profile is symmetric with respect to the capillary centerline. BC4 assumes the capillary wall has negligible mass transfer resistance* and also expresses the requirement that the oxygen con- centrations and the oxygen flux are continuous at the interface between the capillary and tissue regions. BC1 also says that oxygen cannot cross the boundary of the Krogh tissue cylinder by axial diffusion at the entrance of the capillary. BC5 states that the oxygen profile in the tissue region between capillaries spaced a distance 2rT (the Krogh tissue cylinder diameter) apart is symmetric. Under certain conditions, anoxic regions can develop within the tissue region. These regions will be defined by a critical radius, ranoxic(z), a distance beyond which there is no oxygen in the tissue. If an anoxic region exists, then BC5 becomes BC rr z pO r andpOanoxic60 0 2 2:,= () ¶ ¶ == (7.62) 7.11 An approximate solution for oxygen transport in the Krogh tissue cylinder The solution of the previous equations for the oxygen concentrations within the blood and tissue regions is a formidable problem and requires a numerical solution (Lagerlund and Low, 1993). However, with some simplifications, a reasonable analytical solution can be obtained, which is a good starting point for exploring the key factors that govern the oxygenation of the tissue sur- rounding a given capillary. We can also limit ourselves to a steady-state solution, thereby elimi- nating the time derivatives in these equations. Another useful approximation is to treat m as a constant. Recall that m is related to the slope of the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve and is given by Equation 7.58. An average value of m can then be used in the range of pO2 levels of interest. Since the capillary is much longer in length than the Krogh tissue cylinder radius, we can also ignore axial diffusion within the tissue region. This greatly simplifies the equation for the tissue region, and Equation 7.60 becomes 1 2 rr r pO r H D oxygen oxygen T ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = fG (7.63) Within the capillary, we can ignore axial diffusion in comparison to axial convection, and from Equation 7.56, we obtain Vm pO z D rr r pO r oxygen1 122+() ¶¶ = ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú (7.64) Equation 7.64 is a partial differential equation and is still tough to solve. One approximate approach is to eliminate the radial diffusion term by lumping (i.e., integrating the equation) over the r direction. * Recall that oxygen is lipid soluble and readily permeates the entire surface of the capillary wall. 385 Oxygen transport in biological systems The radial averaging of the capillary oxygen levels is appropriate here since the bulk of the oxygen mass transfer resistance is not within the capillary. Hence, we do not expect steep gradients in the oxygen concentration in the radial direction within the blood.

We can now proceed to obtain an analytical solution for the oxygen levels within the capillary and the tissue region. First, we integrate Equation 7.63 two times and use BC4 and BC5 in Equation 7.61 to obtain pOr,z pO z rH D r r C oxygen oxygen TC 22 2 2 4 1() = () -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú - fG rrH D r r T oxygen oxygen TC 2 2 fG ln æ è ç ö ø ÷ (7.69) Although we ignored axial diffusion within the tissue region, note that the axial average capil- lary pO2 level, i.e., 〈pO2(z)〉, impresses an axial dependence on the tissue region pO2 level. Thus, Equation 7.69 depends on the local capillary oxygen pO2 and is valid so long as pOT 2 0> throughout the tissue region. 386 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering In some cases, part of the tissue region can become anoxic and Equation 7.63 must be solved using the anoxic boundary condition given by Equation 7.62. In this case, the tissue pO2 is given by pOr,z pO z rH D r r C oxygen oxygen TC 22 2 2 4 1() = () -- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú - fG rrz H D r r anoxic oxygen oxygen TC 2 2 () æ è ç ö ø ÷ fG ln (7.70) We can find ranoxic(z) from the additional condition in Equation 7.62 that requires pO2 0= at ranoxic(z). By setting the left-hand side of Equation 7.70 equal to zero and letting r = ranoxic(z), we then obtain the following nonlinear equation that can be solved for ranoxic(z): rz r rz r rz r anoxic C anoxic C anoxic C ()æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ ()æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ - ()æ 22 ln èè çç ö ø ÷÷ += () 2 2 21 4D pO z rH T C oxygen oxygenfG (7.71) Equations 7.69 through 7.70 provide the pO2 level within the tissue region under both nonanoxic and anoxic conditions for a given average capillary pO2 level at axial position z. The capillary pO2 level changes with axial position and can now be found by solving Equation 7.68. The solution of this equation requires that we know the value of D dpO dr T rC 2 . We can get this by dif- ferentiating either Equation 7.69 or 7.70 and evaluating the derivative at rC. On substitution of this result for the nonanoxic case, we obtain dpOz dz H mV r r oxygen oxygen T C 2 2 1 1 () =- +() æ è ç ö ø ÷ - é ë ê ê ù û ú ú fG (7.72) This equation can be integrated to give the following result for the axial change in the capillary oxy- gen partial pressure.

At a given value of z, we can substitute the anoxic version of Equation 7.73 into Equation 7.71 to obtain the axial dependence of ranoxic(z). This would be the radial position for a given z at which the tissue pO2 is equal to zero: rz r rz r rz r anoxic C anoxic C anoxic C ()æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ ()æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ - ()æ 22 ln èè çç ö ø ÷÷ += é ë ê ù û ú - +() 2 2 221 44 1 DpO rH D mr V rT in C oxygen oxygen T CfG aanoxic C z r z ()æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ - é ë ê ê ù û ú ú 2 1 (7.74) 387 Oxygen transport in biological systems Of particular interest are the conditions under which anoxia first begins. Anoxia will first start at the corner of the Krogh tissue cylinder represented by the coordinates z = L and r = rT. This criti- cal tissue pO2 level, equal to zero at the anoxic corner, can be found by first solving Equation 7.73 for the pO2 level in the blood exiting the capillary. Equation 7.69 can then be solved with r = rT to find the value of pO2 at the anoxic corner. One can then adjust various parameters such as V and fG Goxygen oxygen= ¢ until pO2 0= at the anoxic corner. The Krogh tissue cylinder approach assumes that we know the Krogh tissue cylinder radius (rT). In Chapter 6, we showed that the blood perfusion rate can be related to the Krogh tissue cylinder radius, the capillary radius and length, and the average blood velocity. This relationship is given by Equation 6.98, which when solved for rT gives the following equation: r r V q Tc b = (7.75) 7.12 Artificial blood Blood is crucial for our survival and is frequently needed for the treatment of life-threatening injuries, to replace blood loss during surgery, and to treat a variety of blood disorders. The world demand for blood amounts to over 100 million units* of blood per year. Within the United States, a blood transfusion occurs about every 4 s (Lewis, 1997). Blood banking provides in most cases an immediate source of blood to meet these needs. However, blood banking requires an extensive infrastructure for collection, testing for disease, cross-matching, and storage. In addition to poten- tial contamination of the blood supply with infectious agents such as Zika virus, HIV, and hepatitis virus, blood itself can cause hemolytic transfusion reactions. The risks associated with blood trans- fusions include 0.0004%† for HIV infection, 0.001% for a fatal hemolytic reaction, 0.002%–0.03% for contracting the hepatitis virus, and 1% for a minor reaction (Intaglietta and Winslow, 1995). Concern in recent years about the safety of the blood supply has resulted in major efforts to develop a substitute for blood. A blood substitute can replace human donor blood and potentially be used for trauma and surgery, as well as for the treatment of chronic blood disorders that require frequent transfusions. Blood substitutes are also of interest to the military because of the potential for a sig- nificant decrease in the special handling and logistical requirements of human blood on the modern battlefield. An artificial blood must meet the two most important functions of blood given by transfusion. These are the replacement of lost plasma and the ability to transport sufficient amounts of oxygen. Hence, blood substitutes can be categorized as volume expanders, oxygen carriers, or oxygen therapeutics. Blood substitutes, known as volume expanders, are inert aqueous materials that carry no more than dissolved oxygen, and these are used to increase blood volume to replace lost plasma. Examples of volume expanders include donated plasma, Ringer’s solution, and a 5% dextrose solution. * A unit of blood is 1 pint equal to about 500 mL. † 1% is equal to 1 transfusion incident per 100 units transfused. 388 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Blood substitutes, known as oxygen therapeutics, also serve as volume expanders and have the capa- bility to transport significant amounts of oxygen. These materials are designed to mimic the oxygen transport properties of human blood. The most promising oxygen therapeutics tend to be based on the use of compounds with enhanced oxygen solubility, like perfluorocarbons (PFCs) (Castro and Briceno, 2010), or solutions that contain hemoglobin or hemoglobin-like compounds. The solubility of oxygen in solutions of PFCs can be a hundred times higher than that in plasma. Oxygen therapeutics that use hemoglobin are either using solutions containing stroma-free* hemo- globin or camouflaged RBCs. Many products based on these approaches are in clinical trials and utilize some form of hemoglobin, PFCs, or camouflaged RBCs (Scott et al., 1997; Winslow, 1997; Goorha et al., 2003). Both of these general approaches have their advantages and disadvantages and, regardless, a successful oxygen therapeutic must be as readily available as donated blood. Furthermore, these materials need to be universal or compatible across all blood types. They also must have minimal side effects, not cause allergic reactions, and be free of infectious agents. In order to be competitive in the market- place, an oxygen therapeutic should also be relatively inexpensive and have a long storage life. Several products are based on the use of stroma-free hemoglobin and are also known as hemoglobin- based oxygen carriers. The hemoglobin can be derived from a variety of sources. For example, hemoglobin can be of human or bovine origin; it can be derived from bacteria via genetic engineer- ing techniques or by transgenic methods in animals and plants. Hemoglobin, as discussed earlier, consists of four polypeptide chains, two α chains and two β chains. The hemoglobin molecule outside of the RBC is not stable. For example, if hemoglobin is diluted in comparison to its concentration in RBCs, it will spontaneously dissociate into these smaller chains. These lower molecular weight chains are then rapidly removed from the circulation and excreted by the kid- neys. Also, recall that hemoglobin by itself has a very high affinity for oxygen. Therefore, to be effective as a blood substitute, artificial blood based on hemoglobin must chemically modify the hemoglobin in order to improve its stability and to decrease its affinity for oxygen. Therefore, the P50 value obtained for artificial blood based on hemoglobin therefore needs to be comparable to that of normal human blood. PFCs are hydrocarbons in which the bonds between C and H are replaced by the much stronger C and F bonds. These strong C-F bonds give PFCs their chemical inertness (Shah and Mehra, 1996). PFCs also exhibit high oxygen solubility and they are for the most part biocompatible and have a low cost. However, a disadvantage of PFCs is that they are immiscible with water. In order to be used as a blood substitute, they must first be emulsified into tiny droplets typically in the range of 0.1–0.2 μm in diameter. The droplets are also frequently coated with phospholipids derived from egg yolk to stabilize the emulsion. Oxygenated blood carries about 20 mL of oxygen (at 37°C and 760 mmHg) per 100 mL of blood. A pure PFC solution in equilibrium with oxygen at 760 mmHg has an average oxygen solubility of about 50 mL of oxygen per 100 mL of PFC (Gabriel et al., 1996). PFCs also exhibit a linear equilib- rium relationship between the oxygen solubility and the pO2. Unlike blood containing hemoglobin, PFCs do not saturate and they can therefore transport more oxygen by simply increasing the pO2 level in the gas breathed by the patient. Because of their relatively high vapor pressure, a portion of the PFCs is removed from the circulation by evaporation via respiration. * Stroma-free in this case means without the red blood cell and its cellular framework. 389 Oxygen transport in biological systems Artificial blood based on modified hemoglobin or PFCs still face some significant development problems. Key among these problems are gastrointestinal complaints and vasoconstriction (reduc- tion in blood vessel diameter) when using hemoglobin products and flu-like symptoms and throm- bocytopenia (very low quantity of platelets) when using PFCs. This artificial blood also exhibits short lifetimes in the circulation. Modified hemoglobin lasts on the order of 12 h to 2 days, whereas PFCs are removed in about 12 h. In comparison, normal RBCs have lifetimes of about 120 days. Until the lifetimes of these products can be significantly improved, they will only be able to be used for acute situations such as trauma and surgery (Winslow, 1997). Another promising approach that can overcome some of the problems of artificial blood based on modified hemoglobin or PFCs (Scott et al., 1997) is to covalently bind substances like polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the surfaces of intact RBCs. The RBCs appear to be not affected by the presence of the PEG coat. The PEG molecules have the effect of masking or camouflaging the surface antigens on the RBC that lead to the various blood types in the case of human blood or that trigger rejection in the case of animal RBCs. The result is a universal blood type that could allow the use of unmatched human or animal RBCs. The camouflaged RBCs should have a lifetime that is comparable to that of a normal RBC. Example 7.13 Show that oxygenated blood carries about 20 mL of oxygen (based on 37°C and 760 mmHg) per 100 mL of blood. Solution First, we need to calculate the gas density of oxygen at these conditions as shown by the fol- lowing calculation: roxygen P RT mmHg atm mmHg atmL molK K == ´ ´ = -- 760 1 760 0 08206 310 0 11. .00393 1molL - From Table 7.2, oxygenated blood has a total oxygen (dissolved and bound to hemoglobin) concentration of 8620 μM. We can then recast this result in terms of the volume of oxygen as a gas that is dissolved in 100 mL of blood as VM mol oxygen ML blood Lblood mL blood m oxygen =´ ´ ´´8630 1 1000 100 m m m LLblood mL blood mol oxygen mol L oxygen mol oxyge 100 1 10 1 0 0393 6´ ´ m . nn mL oxygen L oxygen mL oxygen mL blood ´ = 1000 21 96 100 . Example 7.14 Based on the solubility of oxygen in a pure solution of PFC, show that Henry’s constant is equal to about 0.04 mmHg μM−1. Also, show that a 40 vol.% PFC emulsion when saturated with pure oxygen at 760 mmHg has the same oxygen carrying capacity as oxygen saturated blood. 390 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Solution As previously discussed, the oxygen solubility in 100 mL of a pure solution of PFC is 50 mL at 37°C and 760 mmHg. Using the density of oxygen at these conditions found in Example 7.13, we can calculate Henry’s constant as H mmHg mL oxygen mL PFC mL PFC L PFC L oxyg oxygen PFC = ´´ 760 50 100 1000 1 1 een mL oxygen mol oxygen L oxygen M oxygen mol oxyg1000 0 0393 10 1 6 ´´ . m een L H mmHgMoxygen PFC - -= 1 10 039. m Since we are given that there is 50 mL of oxygen in 100 mL of a pure PFC solution, then if we have a solution that is 40% by volume PFC, the oxygen carrying capacity is reduced to 20 mL of oxygen in 100 mL of this solution, which is comparable to the oxygen carrying capacity of blood. Example 7.15 An artificial blood-like fluid is flowing at the rate of 250 mL min−1 through the lumens of a hollow fiber bioreactor that contains hepatoma cells on the shell side. Henry’s constant for dissolved oxygen in the aqueous portion of the artificial blood is 0.71 mmHg μM−1. The artificial blood also contains an insoluble PFC material at a volume fraction of 0.60 that forms an emulsion of the PFC in the aqueous phase that has an enhanced solubility for oxygen. Henry’s constant for the PFC material is equal to 0.04 mmHg μM−1, where the μM refers to the volume of the PFC oxygen-carrying material only. The pO2 of the entering artificial blood is 160 mmHg. The exiting pO2 of the artificial blood is 35 mmHg. Estimate the oxygen transport rate to the hepatoma cells in μmol s−1 and in mL of oxygen (37°C and 760 mmHg) per minute. Solution The artificial blood can be considered to be a fluid where oxygen is dissolved in both the water phase and in the PFC emulsion phase that has enhanced oxygen solubility. The dif- ference between the amount of oxygen in the artificial blood entering the bioreactor and leaving is equal to the amount of oxygen transported to the hepatoma cells. So we can use Equation 7.22: \u0000m QC CCoxygenartificialblood aqueous PFC in aqueo=+() -04 06 04.. . uus PFC outC+()é ë ù û06. Note that in the parenthetical terms, the flow rate of the artificial blood is multiplied by the respective volume fraction of the artificial blood that is the aqueous phase or the PFC emulsion phase. The dissolved oxygen concentration in each phase is represented by Caqueous and CPFC. 391 Oxygen transport in biological systems We can then express the dissolved oxygen concentrations in each of these phases using Henry’s law as given by Equation 7.1: QmL s L mL mmHg mmHgM oxygen =´ ´ ´ ´ -250 1 60 1 1000 040 160 071 1min min . . m ---+´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ -´ 11060 160 004 040 35 071 . . . . mmHg mmHgM mmHg mmHgM inm m --- - +´ æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ê ê ê ù û ú ú ú ú ú ´ 11060 35 004 1 . . mmHg mmHg M molL outm m 111 181 m m M Qmol soxygen - -= . Using the density of oxygen at 37°C and 1 atm that was found in Example 7.13, we can find the volumetric flow rate of oxygen that was transported to the hepatoma cells, as shown by the following calculation: \u0000Vmol ss Lmol mol mol moxygen =´ ´´ ´ --81 60 1 0 0393 1 10 1000 11 6.min . m m llL VmLoxygen - -= 1 112 37\u0000 . min Problems 7.1 The only life form that is present on the planet Biophilus is a small, slimy flat worm that is about 200 mm in length and about 20 mm in width. The worm survives through metabolic processes that are limited by the transport of methane present in the planet’s atmosphere. The metabolic rate of methane consumption is estimated to be 15 μM s−1 based on the total flesh volume, i.e., ϕΓmethane. The effective diffusivity (DT) of methane in the flesh of the worm is estimated to be about 2.15 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The concentration of methane in the planet’s atmo- sphere was found to be 0.20 moles L−1, and the molar equilibrium solubility ratio of methane in the flesh of this worm relative to atmospheric methane is 0.10. Estimate the maximum thickness of this flat worm in millimeters. 7.2 Rework Example 7.1 for the case of convection in the medium surrounding the Brockmann bodies and determine the volumetric tissue oxygen consumption rate (Γoxygen, μM s−1) from the data shown in Figure 7.1 for Brockmann bodies. 7.3 Calculate the external mass transfer coefficient (km, cm s−1) for oxygen from the data shown in Figure 7.1. Recall that the flux of oxygen into the spherical Brockmann body by diffusion must equal the oxygen transport rate from the bulk fluid as described by the following equation: D dC dr kC CRT oxygen rR m oxygen bulk oxygen rR Brockmann bo = = =- »() 1 3 ddy oxygenG¢ Show that for the case without convection, the Sherwood number (Sh) is equal to 2. 392 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 7.4 Derive Equation 7.26. 7.5 For the situation described in Example 7.6, determine the critical loading of islets, i.e., the void volume of the tissue space for which the pO2 becomes equal to zero at the centerline of the symmetric islet layer. 7.6 For the results obtained in Example 7.6, determine an estimate of the blood flow rate needed to sustain a total of 750,000 islets. Each islet can be assumed to be 150 microns in diameter. What would be the diameter of such a device? 7.7 For the situation described in Example 7.6, determine the critical oxygen permeability of the membrane, i.e., the value for which the pO2 becomes equal to zero at the centerline of the symmetric islet layer. 7.8 Write a short paper that discusses blood types. 7.9 Derive Equation 7.69. 7.10 Derive Equation 7.73. 7.11 Calculate the oxygen profiles within a capillary and its surrounding tissue for an islet of Langerhans. Assume blood enters the capillary at a pO2 = 95 mmHg. Also calculate the critical blood perfusion rate. Determine the anoxic boundary for a blood perfusion rate of 0.25 mL cm−3 min−1. 7.12 Consider a long and wide planar aggregate or slab of hepatocytes (liver cells) used in a bio- artificial liver. The slab is suspended in a growth medium at 37°C with no mass transfer limi- tations between the slab and the medium. The medium is saturated with air giving a pO2 of 160 mmHg, and Henry’s constant for the oxygen in the medium is 0.74 mmHg μM−1. The cell density in the slab is 1.25 × 108 cells cm−3. Each cell is spherical in shape and 20 μm in diameter. The oxygen consumption rate of the cells may be described by the Michaelis-Menten relation- ship (Equation 7.5) with Vmax = 0.4 nmol (106 cells)−1 s−1 and a Km = 0.5 mmHg. Estimate the maximum half-thickness of the slab of hepatocytes. 7.13 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the localized photoirradiation of dye-sensitized tissue toward the end goal of causing cell death in tumors (Henderson and Doughherty, 1992). The tumor containing the photosensitizer is irradiated by a laser with light of the proper wavelength (around 630 nm) to generate excited singlet molecules of the sensitizer. In the presence of molecular oxygen, the singlet sensitizer forms a very reactive form of oxygen called singlet oxygen, which destroys the tumor. Therefore, sufficient levels of molecular oxygen are needed in the tissue to kill the tumor by PDT. The action of PDT on tissue oxygen levels is like having an additional sink for oxygen that is dependent on the laser fluence rate ϕ0. Foster (1993) states that this PDT-induced oxygen consumption rate can be estimated by the following equation: G mfPDT Mcms mW mW cm= ()´ () -- -014 21 1 0 2., where ϕ0 is the fluence rate. Consider a typical capillary within the tumor undergoing PDT treatment. Assume a capil- lary diameter of 8 μm and a capillary length of 300 μm. The Krogh tissue cylinder radius is assumed to be 40 μm. The cellular oxygen consumption rate is 11.5 μM s−1. The average velocity of blood in the capillary is 0.04 cm s−1. The entering blood pO2 is 95 mmHg. Answer the following questions: a. What is the exiting pO2 of the blood from the capillary with the laser off? b. What is the pO2 in the lethal corner (z = L and r = rT) with the laser off? 393 Oxygen transport in biological systems c. At what fluence rate is the pO2 in the lethal corner equal zero? Note this is the point at which PDT starts to be ineffective for those cancer cells at the outer periphery of the Krogh tissue cylinder. 7.14 Consider the design of a hollow fiber unit for an extracorporeal bioartificial liver. Blood flows through the lumens of the hollow fibers contained within the device at a flow rate of 400 mL min−1. The unit consists of 10,000 fibers and the lumen diameter of a fiber is 400 μm. The blood enters the fiber with a pO2 of 95 mmHg and must exit the device with a pO2 no lower than 40 mmHg. Surrounding each fiber is a multicellular layer of cloned human liver cells. These cells in the shell space have a volume fraction of 20%, and they consume oxy- gen at a rate of 17.5 μM s−1 (based on cellular volume). The hollow fibers are 25 cm in length and the fiber wall provides negligible resistance to the transport of oxygen. Determine the maximum thickness of the layer of cells that can surround each fiber. Carefully state your assumptions. 7.15 A nonwoven mesh of polyglycolic acid (PGA) is proposed to serve as the support for growing cells in vitro for the regeneration of tissue. The PGA mesh is a square pad 1 cm × 1 cm and 0.5 mm thick. The PGA mesh has a porosity of 97% and the edges of the mesh are clamped within a support. The cells were found to consume oxygen at a rate of 2.14 × 10−13 mol cell−1 h−1. Assuming the cells are cultured in a well-perfused growth media that is saturated with air, estimate the maximum number of cells that can be grown within each PGA mesh. Assume the diameter of a cell is about 20 microns. Carefully state your assumptions. 7.16 Blood perfuses a region of tissue at a flow rate of 0.35 mL min−1 cm−3 of tissue. The pO2 of the entering blood is 95 mmHg and the exiting pO2 of the blood is 20 mmHg. Calculate the oxygen consumption rate of the tissue in μM s−1. 7.17 Consider a slab layer of cells being grown within an artificial support structure. The layer of cells is immersed in a well-mixed nutrient medium maintained at a pO2 = 150 mmHg. The cells are known to consume oxygen at the rate of 40 μM s−1. Estimate the maximum half- thickness of the cell layer (cm) assuming the cell volume fraction in the tissue layer is 0.80. 7.18 A tumor spheroid, 400 microns in diameter, is suspended in a very large and quiescent media at 37°C with a pO2 of 120 mmHg. The pO2 at the surface of the spheroid was measured to be 100 mmHg. Estimate the oxygen consumption rate of the cells in the spheroid in μM s−1. Assume Hoxygen = 0.74 mmHg μM−1 and ϕ = 0.15. 7.19 Blood flows through a membrane oxygenator at a flow rate of 5000 mL min−1. The entering pO2 of the blood is 40 mmHg and the exiting blood pO2 is 95 mmHg. Calculate the amount of oxygen transported into the blood in μmol s−1 and in mL of oxygen per minute at 37°C and 1 atm. 7.20 Consider a slab layer of cells being grown between two microporous support membranes. The half-thickness of the cell layer is 125 μm and the cell volume fraction is 0.10. The permeability of oxygen through the support membrane is estimated to be equal to 1.5 × 10−3 cm s−1. The layer of cells is immersed in a well-mixed nutrient medium maintained at a pO2 = 150 mmHg. An oxygen microelectrode placed at the centerline of the layer of cells gives a pO2 reading of 15 mmHg. Estimate the rate at which these cells are consuming oxygen in μM s−1. 7.21 Blood is flowing at the rate of 200 mL min−1 through the lumens of a hollow fiber unit contain- ing hepatocytes on the shell side. The pO2 of the entering blood is 95 mmHg and the exiting pO2 of the blood is 20 mmHg. The volume of hepatocytes on the shell side of the device is estimated to be about 600 mL. Estimate the metabolic oxygen consumption rate of the hepa- tocytes in μM s−1. 394 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 7.22 Consider a slab layer of cells being grown within an artificial support structure. The layer of cells is immersed in a well-mixed nutrient medium maintained at a pO2 = 130 mmHg. The cells are known to consume oxygen at a rate of 10 μM s−1, and the half-thickness of the slab of cells is 35 μm. Estimate the cell volume fraction in the tissue. 7.23 Blood perfuses a region of tissue at a flow rate of 0.50 mL min−1cm−3 of tissue. The pO2 of the entering blood is 95 mmHg, and the exiting pO2 of the blood is 30 mmHg. Calculate the oxygen consumption rate of the tissue in μM s−1. 7.24 Consider a slab layer of cells being grown within an artificial support structure. The layer of cells is immersed in a well-mixed nutrient medium maintained at a pO2 = 140 mmHg. The cells are known to consume oxygen at a rate of 30 μM s−1. Estimate the maximum half-thickness of the cell layer (microns) assuming the cell volume fraction in the tissue layer is 0.80. 7.25 In a tissue engineered vascularized tissue construct, pO2 measurements were taken in vivo in the region equidistant from the capillaries using luminescent oxygen-sensitive dyes. This pO2 value, which is basically at the Krogh tissue cylinder radius, was found to be 10 mmHg, and the average concentration of oxygen in the blood in the capillaries was 100 μM. Histological analysis of the tissue samples indicated that the capillaries were pretty much parallel to each other. The average distance between the capillaries, measured center to center, was found to be 130 μm. The capillaries themselves are 7 μm in diameter, and the rate of oxygen uptake for the cells surrounding the capillaries is estimated to be 30 μM s−1. From these data, estimate the diffusivity of oxygen through the tissue surrounding the capillaries. 7.26 Islets of Langerhans are sequestered from the immune system in a device like that shown in Figure 7.7. The pO2 of the blood in the capillaries adjacent to the immunoisolation membrane is 40 mmHg. The membrane oxygen permeability is 9.51 × 10−4 cm s−1. If the islets consume oxygen at the rate of 25.9 μM s−1, estimate the maximum half-thickness of the islet tissue in centimeters assuming a cell volume fraction in the islet layer of ϕ = 0.05. 7.27 A laboratory-scale bioartificial liver consists of a single hollow fiber that is 500 μm in diam- eter and 25 cm in length. The flow rate of blood through the fiber is 0.2 mL min−1. The blood enters the fiber with a pO2 of 95 mmHg and exits the fiber at a pO2 of 35 mmHg. Surrounding the hollow fiber is a confluent layer of cloned human liver cells that consume oxygen at a rate of 25 μM s−1 (based on cell volume). Assume the hollow fiber wall provides negligible resis- tance to the transport of oxygen. Determine the maximum thickness of the layer of cells that can surround the hollow fiber. 7.28 A laboratory-scale bioartificial liver consists of 10,000 hollow fibers that are 500 μm in diameter and 25 cm in length. The blood enters the fibers with a pO2 of 95 mmHg and exits the fibers at a pO2 of 35 mmHg. Surrounding each of the hollow fibers is a single confluent layer of cloned human liver cells that consume oxygen at a rate of 25 μM s−1. The thickness of the layer of cells is 25 μm. Assume the hollow fiber wall provides negligible resistance to the transport of oxygen. Determine the total flow rate of the blood in mL min−1 needed to provide these conditions. 7.29 Design a planar-disk bioartificial pancreas for the treatment of diabetes, i.e., find the dimen- sions of the device, the thickness, and the radius. Assume that the device will contain a total of 50 million genetically modified human β cells. Each of these cells has a diameter of 15 μm and when packed into the device the cell volume fraction must be 0.85. The immunoisolation membrane has a thickness of 50 μm and a porosity of 0.80. Assume the cells consume oxygen at a rate of 25 μM s−1 and that the pO2 in the blood adjacent to the immunoisolation membrane is 40 mmHg. 395 Oxygen transport in biological systems 7.30 Rework Problem 7.29 assuming there are 500 million cells. 7.31 Generate the cell-surface oxygen concentration profiles in the bioreactor studied by Allen and Bhatia (2003) for an inlet flow rate of 0.5 cm3 min−1 and inlet oxygen concentrations from 90 to 190 nmol cm−3. Other data can be found in Example 7.11. 7.32 Starting with Equation 7.11, derive Equation 7.14, where Y is given in terms of the P50, n, and pO2. Also show how Equation 7.14 can be rearranged to give Equation 7.15. 7.33 Write a short paper that reviews the current state of artificial blood development. 7.34 Blood is flowing at a rate of 250 mL min−1 through the lumens of a hollow fiber unit that con- tains hepatoma cells on the shell side. The pO2 of the entering blood is 95 mmHg. The volume of the hepatoma cells is 500 mL. The hepatoma cells consume oxygen at a rate of 20 μM s−1 (based on the cell volume). Show that the exiting pO2 of the blood is about 37.5 mmHg. 7.35 Consider the oxygen transport within a flat disk-shaped tumor of total thickness 250 μm. The surfaces of the tumor are covered with capillaries such that the oxygen concentration at the surface of the tumor is equal to 120 μM. A microelectrode placed at the center of the tumor showed that the pO2 was equal to 15 mmHg, and a tissue sample indicated that the volume fraction of the tumor cells was equal to 0.45. From these data, estimate the oxygen consump- tion rate of the tumor cells in μM s−1. 7.36 A blood oxygenator for a small child needs to deliver 0.5 mol h−1 of oxygen to the blood. Assuming the blood enters the oxygenator at a pO2 of 40 mmHg and leaves at 95 mmHg, estimate the required flow rate of blood (L min−1) through this oxygenator. 7.37 A thin cylindrical disk of genetically transformed hepatocytes 2.5 cm in diameter is suspended in a nutrient solution at 37°C. The nutrient solution has a density of 1 g cm−3 and a viscosity of 0.0012 Pa s. The oxygen diffusivity in the nutrient solution was found to be 2.5 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The half-thickness of the disk (δ) that contains the cells is 150 μm, and the cell fraction is 0.35. The consumption rate of oxygen on a per cell volume basis by these cells is 18.5 μM s−1. If the pO2 of oxygen in the bulk nutrient solution is 150 mmHg, estimate the RPM that the disk needs to be rotated at so that the oxygen level at the centerline of the disk (i.e., at x = δ) is at least 25 mmHg. Assume Henry’s constant for the oxygen in this nutrient solution is equal to 0.73 mmHg μM−1. 7.38 A laboratory-scale bioartificial liver consists of a small cylindrical tube 8 cm in length. A single layer of hepatocytes lines the interior surface of the tube giving an internal diameter of the tube lumen of 0.02 cm. Nutrient media enters this tube at a flow rate of 0.10 cm3 min−1 at 37°C with an oxygen concentration of 0.225 μmol cm−3. Assuming the hepatocytes consume oxygen at a very fast rate, estimate the oxygen concentration in the nutrient media that leaves the tube. Assume the physical properties of the nutrient media are essentially the same as water, i.e., the density of the nutrient media is 1 g cm−3 and the viscosity is 0.69 cP. 7.39 Blood flows through an organ at a rate of 500 mL min−1. The arterial pO2 of the blood is 70 mmHg and the venous pO2 is 20 mmHg. What is the oxygen consumption rate of the organ in μmol s−1? 7.40 An oxygen-impermeable contact lens is being considered for use as a drug delivery sys- tem to the eye. One concern is an inadequate supply of oxygen to the cells of the cornea. Without the contact lens in place, the oxygen comes from two sources, the aqueous humor (pO2 = 55 mmHg) in contact with the inner surface of the cornea and from the tear layer (pO2 = 155 mmHg) that covers the outer surface of the cornea. Since the cornea is thin with a thickness of 0.6 mm, we can neglect any curvature and consider the cornea to be flat. The diffusivity of oxygen in the cornea is 10−5 cm2 s−1, and the oxygen consumption rate of the 396 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering corneal tissue expressed as ϕΓoxygen is equal to 0.37 μM s−1. Henry’s constant for the oxygen in the aqueous humor and cornea is 0.71 mmHg μM−1. From this information, estimate the pO2 at the interface between the contact lens and the cornea. 7.41 A thin circular disk of genetically transformed gecko hepatocytes 4 cm in diameter is sus- pended and exposed to nutrient media on both of its sides at 37°C. The media has a density of 1.01 g cm−3 and a viscosity of 0.8 cP. The oxygen diffusivity in the media was found to be 2.4 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The half-thickness of the disk (δ) that contains the cells is 150 μm, and the cell volume fraction in the disk is 0.35. The consumption rate of oxygen on a per cell volume basis by these cells is 5 μM s−1. If the pO2 in the nutrient media is maintained at 158 mmHg, esti- mate the oxygen level at the centerline of the disk of cells (i.e., at x = δ) if the disk is rotated at 10 rpm in the nutrient media. Assume Henry’s constant for the oxygen in this media is equal to 0.74 mmHg μM−1. 7.42 A water oxygenator consists of a cylindrical gas-permeable tube that is 1 mm in diameter and 200 cm in length. The water properties are such that its viscosity is close to 1 cP and its density is 1 g cm−3. The tube wall is highly permeable to oxygen and the concentration of oxygen at the inside surface of the tube where the water is flowing is constant along the length of the tube at 5.6 μg cm−3. The diffusivity in the water flowing through the tube is equal to 2.1 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The water is flowing through the oxygenator tube at a flow rate of 2 cm3 min−1. If there is no oxygen in the water entering the oxygenator and the exiting oxygen concentration in the water leaving the oxygenator tube is equal to 4.0 μg cm−3, use these data to find the average mass transfer coefficient in cm s−1. 7.43 For the conditions given in Problem 7.42, make a prediction using a suitable mass transfer coefficient correlation of what the average mass transfer coefficient should be in cm s−1. 7.44 Blood is being used to provide oxygen to one liter of cells growing in a bioreactor. If the blood enters the bioreactor with a pO2 = 85 mmHg and leaves the device at a pO2 of 25 mmHg, estimate what the flow rate of the blood (mL min−1) needs to be if the cells in the bioreactor consume oxygen at a rate 20 μM s−1. 7.45 A thin circular disk of genetically transformed cells 3 cm in diameter is suspended in a nutrient solution at 37°C. The nutrient solution has a density of 1 g cm−3 and a viscosity of 1.2 cP. The oxygen diffusivity in the nutrient solution was found to be 2.2 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, and the effective diffusivity of oxygen through the layer of immobilized cells is 1.9 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The half-thickness of the disk (δ) that contains the cells is 150 μm, and the cell fraction in the disk is 0.35. The metabolic consumption rate of oxygen on a per cell volume basis by these cells is 18.5 μM s−1. If the pO2 in the bulk nutrient solution is 150 mmHg, estimate the oxygen level at the centerline of the disk (i.e., x = δ) if the disk is rotated at 25 rpm. Assume Henry’s constant for the oxygen in this nutrient solution is equal to 0.68 mmHg μM−1. 7.46 A tube that is 1 mm in diameter and 200 cm in length has a solution flowing within it. The vis- cosity of this solution is 0.01 g cm−1 s−1 and has a density of 1 g cm−3. The tube wall is porous to the transport of oxygen, and the oxygen concentration at the surface of the wall in contact with the solution is 175 μM. The diffusivity of oxygen in the solution flowing through the tube is equal to 2.3 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The pressure drop per unit length of the tube is 0.1 mmHg cm−1. The solution entering the tube is free of oxygen. What is the concentration of oxygen (μM) in the solution as it exits the tube? 7.47 Blood is being used as a source of oxygen for cells that are growing in a tissue engineered construct. The design assumes that blood enters the device with a pO2 = 95 mmHg and leaves the device with a pO2 = 25 mmHg. If the cells in the device consume oxygen at a rate 397 Oxygen transport in biological systems of 20 μM s−1 and there are 100 mL of cells, what is the required flow rate of the blood in mL min−1 to meet this oxygen demand? 7.48 A perfusion bioreactor consists of a layer of cells 1.5 mm thick that is supported between two very thin macroporous titanium meshes. A nutrient medium flows through the bioreactor in the direction of the cell layer thickness. The cell volume fraction is 0.35 and the cells consume oxygen at a rate of 21 μM s−1. The effective diffusivity of oxygen within the layer of cells has been estimated to be 2.05 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The oxygen concentration in the fluid that enters this bioreactor is equal to 200 μM. The exiting oxygen concentration of the fluid leaving this bioreactor cannot be less than 25 μM. Estimate the flow rate of the nutrient medium in cm3 min−1. The cross-sectional area of the cell layer normal to the flow of the nutrient medium is 64 cm2. 7.49 A laboratory-scale bioreactor consists of a small cylindrical tube 10 cm in length. A single layer of genetically modified cells lines the interior surface of the tube giving an internal diam- eter of the tube lumen of 0.025 cm. Nutrient media enters this tube at a flow rate of 10 cm3 h−1 at 37°C with an oxygen concentration of 0.25 μmol cm−3. Assuming the cells consume oxygen at a very fast rate, estimate the oxygen concentration (μmol cm−3) in the nutrient media that leaves the tube. The nutrient media has a viscosity of 0.85 cP, and its density is 1 g cm−3. The oxygen diffusivity in the media is 2 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. 7.50 A monolayer of Andromedian qwak cells is being grown on one side of a 4 cm circular disk. The disk containing the cells is in nutrient media maintained at a temperature of 37°C and is spun at a rotation speed of 15 rpm. Oxygen is sparged into the media and the bulk pO2 is esti- mated to be 160 mmHg. Henry’s constant for the oxygen in this media is 0.7 mmHg μM−1. If the monolayer of qwak cells on the disk surface consumes oxygen at a rate of 0.10 nmol cm−2 s−1, estimate the pO2 in mmHg at the surface of the monolayer of cells. The media density is 1 g cm−3, and its viscosity is 0.70 cP. 7.51 A design for a bioreactor consists of a thin layer of cultured cells that are immobilized within a gel-like material that coats the inside surfaces of a rectangular flow channel. Assume that the cell fraction in the gel-like layer is 0.65 and that these cells consume oxygen at a rate of 19.5 μM s−1. The nutrient media is fed to the bioreactor at a temperature of 37°C and at a sufficiently high flow rate that the average pO2 in the media flowing in the bioreactor can be taken as 85 mmHg. The flow channel cross section has a width of 10 cm and a slit thick- ness of 0.2 cm giving a hydraulic diameter of 0.392 cm. The length of the flow channel is 20 cm. The media average velocity within the flow channel is 25 cm s−1, and the media has a viscosity of 0.8 cP and a density of 1.03 g cm−3. Separate experiments have shown that the oxygen diffusivity within the layer of immobilized cells is 1.95 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, and Henry’s constant is 0.72 mmHg μM−1. The oxygen diffusivity in the bulk media is 2.25 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. Estimate the maximum thickness of the layer of cells that can coat the inside surface of the flow channel assuming that the lowest allowable pO2 within the layer of hepatocytes is 18 mmHg. 7.52 An artificial blood is being used as a source of oxygen for cells that are growing on the shell side in a hollow fiber bioreactor. This artificial blood has a linear oxygen dissociation relationship that is given by Y = (0.01 mmHg−1) pO2, where the pO2 is in mmHg and Y, i.e., C /CoxygenSAT¢ ¢ , is the fraction of the oxygen carrier molecules that are saturated. When the car- rier molecules are saturated, i.e., Y = 1, the associated oxygen concentration, i.e., CSAT¢ , is equal to 9000 μM. Henry’s constant for the artificial blood is 0.78 mmHg μM−1. The design assumes that blood enters the device at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 with a pO2 = 90 mmHg and 398 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering flows within the hollow fibers. If the cells in the device consume oxygen at the rate of 20 μM s−1 and there are 100 mL of cells, what is the pO2 of the artificial blood leaving the bioreactor? 7.53 A plasma oxygenator consists of a multitude of hollow fibers. The plasma flows within these fibers at a rate of 1 cm3 h−1 per fiber. The hollow fibers have an internal diameter of 0.02 cm. Air flows through the shell space that surrounds the hollow fibers, and the concentration of oxygen at the inside surface of the hollow fibers is 220 μM. The diffusivity of oxygen in the plasma is 2 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. Estimate how long the hollow fibers must be in order for the exit- ing oxygen concentration to equal 95% of the oxygen hollow fiber wall concentration. You can assume that the viscosity of the plasma is 1.2 cP and its density is 1.024 g cm−3, and the entering plasma contains no oxygen. 7.54 In a packed bed bioreactor, mammalian cells are being grown within a hydrogel that coats the surface of solid spherical particles that are 4 mm in diameter. The volume fraction (ϕ) of the cells in the hydrogel layer that coats the spherical particles is 0.45. These cells consume oxygen at a rate of 25 μM s−1. Nutrient media flows through the packed bed bioreactor at a superficial velocity (V0) of 1 cm s−1, with an average oxygen partial pressure (pO2) of 120 mmHg. If the thickness of the hydrogel layer containing the cells that coats the spherical particles is 100 μm, estimate what the pO2 (mmHg) is at the interface between the hydrogel layer containing the cells and the surface of the spherical particle. The diffusivity of oxygen in the nutrient media is 2.7 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, and the diffusivity of oxygen in the hydrogel con- taining the cells is 2.1 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The density of the nutrient media is 1.01 g cm−3, and its viscosity is 0.7 cP. The nutrient media has Henry’s constant of 0.72 mmHg μM−1. Since the thickness of the hydrogel layer is much less than the radius of the spherical particle, you can neglect the curvature and assume that the oxygen diffusion in the hydrogel layer is one dimensional and planar. 399 Chapter 8 Pharmacokinetic analysis 8.1 Terminology In this chapter, we will focus our attention on some useful techniques in the field of pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetics (PK) is the study of the processes that affect drug distribution and the rate of change of drug concentrations within various regions of the body. These processes are also collec- tively referred to as ADMET for drug adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity. Although pharmacokinetics is of utmost importance in the treatment of diseases using drugs, our major focus will be on using this technique as a tool for understanding the transport processes in drug delivery systems and between an artificial device and the body. We also need to distinguish pharmacokinetics from similar terms. Therefore, pharmaceutics con- cerns the formulation and preparation of the drug to achieve a desired drug availability within the body, and pharmacodynamics is concerned with the time course of the treatment response that results from a given drug. For example, how is the cholesterol concentration in the plasma affected by the daily doses of a particular drug? The actual physiological reason for the response that results from a drug is the subject of pharmacology. 8.2 Entry routes for drugs There are two routes through which a drug can enter the body. The enteral route refers to drugs that are given via the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). All other routes are called parenteral. The enteral route includes drugs that are absorbed via one or more of the following components of the GI tract: the buccal cavity (mouth) and sublingual (beneath the tongue), gastric (stomach), intestinal (small and large intestines), and rectal. Once the drug is absorbed from the GI tract, the drug enters the blood and is distributed throughout the body. It is important, however, to point out that only drugs absorbed from the buccal cavity and the lower rectum enter the systemic circulation directly. Drugs absorbed from the stomach, intestines, colon, and upper rectum enter the splanchnic circulation (abdominal organs or viscera). The splanchnic circulation then takes the drug to the liver via the portal vein, and after leaving the liver, the drug enters the systemic circulation. Since the liver contains many enzymes capable of degrading the drug (metabolism), a significant portion of the drug can be removed during this first pass through the liver before the drug is available to the general circulation. Table 8.1 summarizes all of the other routes for drug administration that are called parenteral. For the most part, drugs given parenterally enter the systemic circulation directly. As the drug is being absorbed into the body, its presence will be noticed within the circulation as its concentration in the plasma portion of the blood changes. Recall that plasma refers to the clear supernatant fluid that results from blood after the cellular components have been removed. If the blood sample is allowed to clot, then the resulting clear fluid is referred to as serum, since the 400 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering clotting proteins have been removed by the clotting process. For the most part, the concentration of a drug in plasma or serum is identical, and no distinction is needed. It is usually only the plasma drug concentration in the body that is known, and this is what is meant when we speak of the concentra- tion of the drug in the body. For the most part, it has been found that the physiological activity of most drugs can be related to the plasma concentration of the drug. Pharmacokinetic modeling is then used to predict and/or adjust the dosing strategy for a particular drug. Plasma drug concentration as measured is usually the total plasma concentration (Ctotal) that includes the concentration of the drug that is bound to plasma proteins (CP) and that which is unbound (CU). Hence, Ctotal = CP + CU. However, the effect of a particular drug and its transport out of the circulatory system is due to the unbound drug concentration. The fraction of unbound drug or fU is defined as f C CC C C U U PU U total = + = (8.1) Now, fU for a particular drug is usually constant, so either CU or Ctotal can be used in a pharmacoki- netic model; however, it is important to make sure you know and understand which concentration you are using. Figure 8.1 illustrates typical plasma drug concentrations as a function of time after their introduction to the body. Curve I illustrates the case where the drug is first slowly absorbed, resulting in increas- ing plasma concentrations, followed by a plateau, and then the plasma concentration decreases as the drug is eliminated by a variety of body processes. Curve II represents a very rapid injection (bolus) of the drug, usually intravenously (IV injection), where we see that the drug quickly reaches its peak plasma concentration near the time of injection, and then is slowly eliminated. Curve III results from a continuous infusion, usually intravenous (IV) or through a controlled release formu- lation. In this case, we see that after a short period of time, the drug reaches a steady-state plasma concentration, since the infusion rate is equal to the elimination rate of the drug. If the infusion is stopped, then the plasma drug concentration falls due to its elimination as shown by the dashed portion of the curve. Table 8.1 Parenteral Routes for Drug Administration Route Result Intravenous (IV) Introduced directly into the venous circulation Intramuscular Within the muscle Subcutaneous Beneath the epidermal and dermal skin layers Intradermal Within the dermis, usually a local effect Percutaneous Topical treatment applied to the skin Inhalation Mouth/nose, pharynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveolar sacs, alveoli Intra-arterial Introduced directly into an artery, regional drug delivery Intrathecal Cerebrospinal fluid, subarachnoid space Intraperitoneal Within the peritoneal cavity Vaginal Within the vagina 401 Pharmacokinetic analysis 8.3 PK modeling approaches Our goal is then to develop mathematical models that can be used to describe profiles of plasma drug concentration such as those shown in Figure 8.1. This will allow for the description of the drug concentration in the body as a function of time. Through pharmacology and pharmacodynamics, the effects of the drug on the body can then be related to the plasma drug concentration. For example, the physiological response to a particular drug often saturates at high drug concentrations (Ctotal) and can be described by the following equation: R RC CC drug total n n total n= + max 50 (8.2) where Rdrug represents the physiological response to the drug, often expressed in terms of a percent or fractional change in some key parameter. Common examples include body temperature, heart rate, glucose levels, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure Rmax is the saturation response at high drug concentrations where Ctotal ≫ C50 C50 is the drug concentration where Rdrug = 0.50Rmax The values of Ctotal in Equation 8.2 result from measurements of the drug concentration or from the solution to a pharmacokinetic model. Pharmacokinetic models will incorporate several unknown parameters that we find by fitting our models to experimental drug concentration data. The development of pharmacokinetic models has generally followed three approaches—the compartmental approach, the physiological approach, and the model independent approach. 8.3.1 Compartmental pharmacokinetic models The compartmental approach assumes the drug distributes into one or more “compartments” in the body, which usually represent a particular region of the body, an organ, a group of tissues, or body fluids. The compartments are assumed to be well mixed, so that the concentration of the drug within the compartment is spatially uniform. Spatial distribution of the drug within the body is accounted for I II III C Time Figure 8.1 Plasma drug concentration following I: absorption, II: rapid intravenous, and III: continuous infusion. 402 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering by the use of multiple compartments. The assumption of well-mixed compartments is usually pretty good since the cardiac output in humans is nominally 5 L min−1 and the blood volume is about 5 L giving an effective residence time for one passage of the drug through the circulatory system of about 1 min. Also, recall that there is a net filtration of several milliliters per minute of the blood plasma forming the interstitial fluid that bathes and circulates around all of the cells in the body. Hence, the mixing time of the body fluids occurs much faster than the observed temporal changes of the drug concentration, which can occur over periods of hours or even days. Since drug distribution occurs over periods of hours, and the body’s fluids are moving over periods of minutes, and mass transfer occurs on the order of seconds, the well-mixed assumption is appropriate. The movement of the drug between the compartments is usually described by simple irreversible or reversible first order rate processes, i.e., the rate of transport is proportional to the difference in the drug concentration between compartments. 8.3.2 Physiological pharmacokinetic models In physiological models, the movement of drug is based on the blood flow rate through a particular organ or tissue and includes consideration of the rates of the mass transport processes within the region of interest. Experimental blood and tissue drug concentrations are needed to define the model parameters. Our Krogh tissue cylinder model developed in Chapter 7 to describe the changes in oxygen levels within the capillary and the surrounding tissue region is an example of a physiological model. In this case, however, the “drug” is oxygen. Since the liver plays a major role in the metabolism and excretion of drugs from the body, much atten- tion has been focused on the development of physiological models to describe liver function (Bass and Keiding, 1988; Niro et al., 2003; van de Pas et al., 2012). Physiologically based pharmacokinetic models can become very complex. For example, van de Pas et al. (2012) describe a physiologically based model for predicting plasma cholesterol concentrations. Their model consists of eight compart- ments, each of which is described by a time-dependent differential equation, along with twenty-one chemical reactions for the various biochemical reactions controlling the disposition of cholesterol. 8.3.3 Model independent pharmacokinetic models The model independent approach does not try to make any physiological connection like the compart- mental approach or the physiological approach. Instead, one simply finds the best set of mathematical equations that describes the situation of interest (Notari, 1987). These models are considered to be linear if the plasma drug concentration can be represented by a simple weighted summation of exponential decays. For example, Equation 8.3 can be used to describe the time course of the plasma drug concentration. C aetotal i n i ti= = -å 1 l (8.3) where the constants λi and ai are adjusted to provide the best fit to the drug concentration data as a function of time. Our focus in this chapter will be on the use of compartmental models to describe pharmacokinetic data like that shown in Figure 8.1. Compartmental models are commonly used and provide a conve- nient framework for building a pharmacokinetic model and are conceptually simple to use (Cooney, 1976; Gibaldi and Perrier, 1982; Welling, 1986; Notari, 1987, Rowland and Tozer, 1995; Tozer and Rowland, 2006; Hacker et al., 2009). 403 Pharmacokinetic analysis 8.4 Factors that affect drug distribution Before we can investigate some simple compartmental models, we must first discuss the following factors that influence how a particular drug is distributed throughout the body. Table 8.2 summarizes these factors, and they are discussed in greater detail in the following discussion. 8.4.1 Drug distribution volumes Recall that Table 3.1 summarized the types of fluids found within the body. Since a drug can only distribute within these fluid volumes, we call these the true distribution volumes. If a drug only distributes within the plasma volume of the circulatory system, then the true distribution volume for this drug is about 3 L. If the drug readily penetrates the capillary walls, then it can also distribute throughout the extracellular fluid volume for a total true distribution volume of about 15 L. If the drug can also permeate the cell wall, then it will also be found within the intracellular fluid spaces, giving a total true distribution volume of about 40 L. The rate at which the drug is distributed throughout these fluid volumes is controlled by the rate at which the drug is delivered to a region of interest by the blood, i.e., the tissue blood perfusion rate, and by the rate at which the drug diffuses from within the vascular system into the extravascular spaces. If the drug is lipid soluble, then its mass transfer across the capillary wall is usually not rate limiting and equilibrium is quickly reached between the amount of drug in the tissue region and that found in the blood. In this case, the distribution of the drug in a particular tissue region is limited by the blood flow and is perfusion rate limited. For lipid-insoluble drugs, the capillary membrane permeability controls the rate at which the drug distributes between the blood and tissue regions. The distribution of the drug is then said to be diffusion rate limited. Drugs are also capable of binding to proteins found in the plasma and extravascular spaces. Albumin is perhaps the most common of the blood proteins that will bind with drugs. Recall that the major difference between plasma and interstitial fluids is the amount of protein that is present. For the most part, plasma proteins have a difficult time diffusing through the capillary wall to enter the extravascular space. Therefore, a drug that binds strongly with plasma proteins will for the most part be limited to just the volume of the plasma, i.e., about 3 L. On the other hand, extravascular proteins or cell-surface receptors that bind strongly to the drug will tend to accumulate the drug in the extravascular space at the expense of the plasma. In this case, the distribution volume of the drug can appear to be larger than the physical fluid volumes. Thus, protein binding of the drug can have a significant effect on the calculated or apparent distribution volumes as the following discus- sion will show. Table 8.2 Factors Influencing Drug Distribution Blood perfusion rate Capillary permeability Drug biological affinity Metabolism of drug Renal excretion 404 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 8.4.2 Apparent distribution volume Most analytical methods measure the total drug concentration (bound and unbound) that is in the plasma. Since this total plasma concentration (Ctotal) is readily measured, the apparent distribution volume (Vapparent) of the drug is simply given by the following equation: V A C apparent drug total = (8.4) where Adrug is the total amount of drug within the body. The amount of drug in the body is typically expressed in units of milligrams (mg), and the concentration of drug in micrograms per milliliter of plasma (μg mL−1), which is the same as milligrams per liter of plasma (mg L−1), resulting in the apparent distribution volume having units of liters (L). It is also important to note that the concentration of drug within any particular tissue region can vary significantly from the concentration of the drug in the plasma. Therefore, although the apparent distribution volume seems to have some physical significance, it really is just a factor having units of volume that when multiplied by the plasma drug concentration provides the total amount of drug in the body at a particular time. 8.4.3 The Oie-Tozer equation for the apparent distribution volume Because of the effect of protein binding, the apparent distribution volume calculated by Equation 8.4 can be vastly different from the true distribution volume, i.e., V, which is related to the volume of the various body fluids. To examine the effect of protein binding on the apparent distribution volume, consider the conceptual model shown in Figure 8.2 (Oie and Tozer, 1979). In their model, unbound drug is free to distribute between three compartments: the plasma (P), the extracellular fluid outside of the plasma (E), and the remainder of the body (R), where the drug is bound to the surface of the Plasma space, VP Extracellular fluid space, VE Unbound drug Bound drug Remainder of the body, VR Protein Cells Figure 8.2 Drug distribution in the body with protein binding. 405 Pharmacokinetic analysis cell by cell-surface receptors, or internalized by the cell by a variety of cellular transport processes. A mass balance on the total amount of drug in the body (Adrug) at any time can then be written as A AA Adrug PE R=+ + (8.5) where AP, AE, and AR represent the total amount of drug in the plasma, the extracellular fluid, and the remainder of the body, respectively. The amount of drug in any of these three compartments is also related to the corresponding concen- tration of total drug (bound and unbound) in a given compartment, i.e., AP = CtotalVP, AE = CEVE, and AR = CRVR, where Ctotal, CE, and CR are the respective total drug concentration in each compartment and VP, VE, and VR are the corresponding compartment volumes. Using these relationships and Equation 8.4, we can rewrite Equation 8.5 as VV V C C V C C apparent PE E total R R total =+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + æ è ç ö ø ÷ (8.6) Ignoring active transport type processes, it is assumed that at distribution equilibrium, the unbound concentration of the drug, i.e., CU, is the same in all of the compartments. In addition, in the extra- cellular fluid compartment, we have that CE = CU + CEB, where CEB is the bound drug concentration in the extracellular fluid. We now define fU as CU/Ctotal, which is the fraction of unbound drug in the plasma, and we also define fUT as CU/CR, which is the fraction of unbound drug in the extracellular space. Both fU and fUT are usually determined experimentally by equilibrating a known amount of a drug with plasma or extracellular fluid and determining from a drug mass balance the fraction of unbound drug. With these relationships, Equation 8.6 becomes VV Vf CC C V f f apparent PE U UEB U R U UT =+ +æ è ç ö ø ÷ + (8.7) Unbound drug in the plasma and extracellular spaces can bind with proteins in the plasma (PP) and extracellular spaces (PE) as described by the following chemical reactions: C PC andC PCUP PB UE EB+Û +Û (8.8) where CPB and CEB represent the concentrations of drug-bound protein in the plasma and extracellu- lar spaces. Assuming that the binding sites on these proteins have the same affinity for the unbound drug, then at equilibrium we can write: K C CP C CP a PB UP EB UE == (8.9) where Ka is the equilibrium or affinity constant for the drug binding to these proteins. The total protein concentration in the plasma (PPT) and extracellular spaces (PET) must be equal to the concen- tration of the respective proteins that are bound to the drug (CPB and CEB) plus the concentration of these proteins that are not bound to the drug (PP and PE). Hence, we can write PC Pand PC PPPBPTE EB ET+= += (8.10) 406 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Solving these equations for PP and PE and substituting this result into Equation 8.9, taking the inverse of this equation, and solving for CEB, we have C C P P EB PB ET PT = (8.11) Recall that PET and PPT represent the total protein concentrations in the extracellular and plasma spaces, respectively. The total amount of drug-binding protein in the plasma and extracellular spaces equals PPTVP and PETVE. RE/I is then defined as the ratio of the total amount of drug-binding protein in the extracellular space to that in the plasma space, so we have that R PV PV EI PT P ET E / = . Therefore, Equation 8.11 can be written as C CR V V EB PB EI P E = / (8.12) Now, we can substitute Equation 8.12 into Equation 8.7 for CEB and obtain VV f VC CV R C V f f apparent U EU PB PE I U R U UT P=+ +æ è ç ö ø ÷ + / (8.13) Recognizing that C C f f PB U U U = -1 , we then obtain what is known as the Oie-Tozer equation: VV Rf V V V R Vf f apparent PE IU P E P EI RU UT =+()+- æ è ç ö ø ÷ +1 // (8.14) From Table 3.1, we have for a 70 kg man that the plasma volume, VP, is ~3 L and that the extracel- lular fluid volume outside of the plasma, i.e., VE, is ~12 L. The intracellular fluid volume represented by VR is in the range of 25 – 27 L. Also, the amount of drug-binding protein in the extracellular fluid space to that in the plasma, i.e., RE/I, is ~1.4. Using these values, Equation 8.14 simplifies approxi- mately to Vf V f f apparent UR U UT =+ +78 (8.15) The above equation shows that if a drug is only distributed within the extracellular fluid space and cannot enter the cells, i.e., VR = 0, the apparent distribution volume of the drug then attains its small- est value and is equal to Vfapparent U min =+78 . If, in addition, the drug is not bound to plasma proteins, i.e., fU = 1, then the apparent distribution volume of the drug is limited to 15 L, which is the extracel- lular fluid volume. On the other hand, if the drug is completely bound (fU = 0), then the distribution volume cannot be less than 7 L, and this corresponds to the distribution volume of albumin, which is found in both the plasma and the extracellular compartments. If the drug enters the cells but is not significantly bound (fU = 1 and fUT = 1), then from Equation 8.15, the apparent volume of distribution is that of the total body water, i.e., 40–42 L. An example of a 407 Pharmacokinetic analysis drug that distributes throughout the total body water is ethanol. Also note that as fUT → 0, Equation 8.15 predicts that the apparent distribution volume will get very large and exceed that of the total body water volume of about 40 L. It is also important to note that for a large molecular weight drug (>60,000 g mol−1), it is very difficult for the drug to diffuse across the capillary walls and leave the vascular system; hence, the distribution volume becomes that of the plasma volume, i.e., 3 L. Equations 8.14 and 8.15 are therefore useful for investigating a variety of factors that affect the apparent distribution volume of a drug. Many of these changes can occur as a result of age, dis- ease, injury, and interactions with other drugs. Also, distribution volumes for drugs generally scale according to body weight, so these volumes can be increased or decreased in a proportional sense by dividing them by 70 kg and multiplying by the actual body weight. Example 8.1 A drug has an apparent distribution volume of 35 L and is found to be 95% bound to plasma proteins. Unbound drug is also found to freely distribute throughout the total volume of water found in the body. Estimate the fraction of unbound drug with the extracellular fluids, i.e., fUT. Solution The value of fU is 1 − 0.95 = 0.05. From Equation 8.15, we can solve for the value of fUT as shown by the following calculation: f fV Vf L L UT UR apparent U = -- = ´ -- ´ = 78 00527 35 78 005 0 0489 . . . 8.4.4 Drug metabolism Once the drug is absorbed and distributed throughout the body, a variety of biochemical reactions will begin to degrade the drug. This breakdown of the drug is part of the body’s natural defense against foreign materials. Metabolism of the drug is beneficial in the sense that it limits the time of drug action and, in some cases, it produces the active form of the drug. These biochemical reac- tions, driven by existing enzymes, occur in a variety of organs and tissues. However, the major site of drug metabolism is within the liver, and other important sites include the kidneys, lungs, blood, and the GI wall. The enzymatic destruction of the drug reduces its pharmacological activity because the active site related to the drug’s molecular structure is destroyed. Also, the metabolites that result tend to have increased water solubility that decreases their capillary permeability and enhances their removal from the body via the kidneys. Drug degradation typically follows the Michaelis-Menten rate model.* This rate model lumps together all of the enzymatic and transport mechanisms that are responsible for the degradation of the drug into a single reaction rate model. The reaction rate for drug metabolism is given by the fol- lowing expression: ¢¢¢ = + R VC KC metabolic total mtotal max (8.16) * A derivation of the Michaelis-Menten model can be found in Section 9.6.3. 408 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering We usually assume that the drug degradation reactions occur either in the linear portion of Equation 8.16, where the drug concentration is much smaller than the value of Km, or in the saturated reaction rate region, where the drug concentration is much larger than Km and the reaction rate is constant at Vmax. Therefore, the rate at which the drug is degraded by metabolic reactions can be represented by ¢¢¢ = ¢¢¢ = Rk Cfor CK RV metabolic metabolic totaltotal m metabolic ≪ maax forC Ktotalm≫ (8.17) where Ctotal represents the total plasma concentration of the drug kmetabolic = Vmax/Km ¢¢¢Rmetabolic represents the rate at which the drug is degraded on a per unit volume basis At low concentrations, we see that the Michaelis-Menten equation, given by Equation 8.16, simpli- fies to first order kinetics, i.e., first order in the total drug concentration. At high concentrations, the Michaelis-Menten equation (cf. Equation 8.16) simplifies to zero order kinetics, i.e., zero order in the total drug concentration. We will use Equation 8.17 later when we write mass balances for the drug using compartmental models. 8.4.5 Renal excretion of the drug The kidneys also have a major role in the elimination of the drug from the body. A part of this elimi- nation process is enhanced by the enzymatic degradation of the drug by the liver and the formation of more water-soluble products. The kidneys receive about 1100 mL min−1 of blood or about 22% of the cardiac output. On a per mass basis, they are the highest perfused organ in the body. Their primary purpose is to remove unwanted metabolic end products such as urea, creatinine, uric acid, and urates from the blood and to control the concentrations of such ions as sodium, potassium, chloride, and hydrogen. The concentrated urine that is formed from the kidneys amounts to about 1.5 L of urine per day. Figure 8.3 illustrates the basic functional unit of the kidney called the nephron. Each kidney contains about one million nephrons, and each nephron contributes to the formation of urine. The operation of the kidney can be explained by considering how an individual nephron functions. The nephron consists of the following major components: the glomerulus contained within Bowman’s capsule, the convoluted proximal tubule, Henle’s loop, the convoluted distal tubule, and finally the collect- ing tubule that branches into the collecting duct. The glomerulus, proximal tubule, and distal tubule have a major role in drug elimination from the kidney. Blood enters the glomerulus via the afferent arteriole and leaves by the efferent arteriole. The glomerulus consists of a tuft of highly permeable fenestrated capillaries, several hundred times more permeable to solutes than the typical capillary. Glomerular filtrate is formed across these capillaries within the Bowman’s capsule due to hydraulic and osmotic pressure differences that exist between the fluids within the glomerular capillaries and the Bowman space (cf. Equation 3.4). The glomerular capillary membrane for the most part is impermeable to the plasma proteins retaining those molecules with a molecular weight larger than about 69,000. The drugs that are bound to plasma proteins therefore cannot be removed from the bloodstream by filtration through 409 Pharmacokinetic analysis the glomerulus. However, unbound drugs with a molecular weight less than 69,000 are readily filtered out of the bloodstream with the glomerular filtrate. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the sum total of all the glomerular filtrate formed per unit time by the nephrons in the two kidneys. This is about 125 mL min−1 or about 180 L each day, which is more than twice the weight of the body. Clearly, this volume of fluid must be recovered, and we find that over 99% of the glomerular filtrate is reabsorbed in the tubules. The filtration rate of unbound drug in the glomerulus is given by the following equation: Unbound drug removalrateGFR Cf GFRC glomerulus UU total=´ =´ ´ (8.18) After the glomerular filtrate leaves the Bowman’s capsule, it enters the proximal tubule that is pri- marily concerned with the active reabsorption of sodium ions and water. Other substances such as glucose and amino acids are also reabsorbed. The proximal tubule is important in drug elimination in that it can also actively secrete drugs from the peritubular capillaries surrounding the proximal tubule. This active transport of the drug is sufficiently fast that even drugs that are bound to plasma proteins will dissociate freeing up the drug for active secretion across the tubule wall. Within the descending portion of Henle’s loop, continued reabsorption of water and other ions occurs primarily by passive diffusion. The ascending loop of Henle is considerably less permeable to water and urea resulting in a very dilute tubular fluid that is rich in urea. Henle’s loop does not play a significant role in regard to drug elimination. The first portion of the distal tubule is similar to that of the ascending loop of Henle in that it continues to absorb ions but is impermeable to water and urea. Within the latter portions of the distal tubule and the collecting tubule, ions and water continue to be absorbed along with acidification of the urine thus controlling the acid-base balance of the body fluids. Afferent arteriole Efferent arteriole Bowman’s capsuleGlomerulus Glomerular filtrate Proximal tubule Descending limb Ascending limb Distal tubule Loop of Henle Collecting tubule Collecting duct Unbound drug Drug secreted from peritubular capillaries Drug reabsorbed into peritubular capillaries Urine Figure 8.3 Basic structure of the nephron. 410 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The reabsorption rate of sodium ions is controlled by the hormone aldosterone. The water permeabil- ity of these distal segments is controlled by antidiuretic hormone providing a means for controlling the final volume of urine that is formed. Drugs can also be reabsorbed within the distal tubule thus affecting the rate of drug elimination from the body. The collecting duct continues to reabsorb water under the control of antidiuretic hormone and does not, for the most part, affect drug elimination. We thus find that the kidney affects drug elimination through the following mechanisms: filtration through the glomerulus, secretion from the peritubular capillaries into the proximal tubule, and reabsorption within the distal tubule. 8.5 Drug clearance 8.5.1 Renal clearance The elimination of drug by the kidney is described by the term renal clearance. The renal clearance is simply the volume of plasma that is totally “cleared” of the drug per unit time as a result of the drug’s elimination by the kidneys. Figure 8.4 illustrates the concept of renal clearance and allows for a math- ematical definition for the case where the only elimination pathway for the drug is through the kidneys. In this figure, a drug is uniformly distributed within a single compartment having an apparent dis- tribution volume Vapparent, and a total plasma concentration represented by Ctotal. CLrenal represents the renal plasma flow rate (typically mL min−1) that is totally cleared of the drug, i.e., Ctotal = 0 in the blood leaving the kidneys. Therefore, by definition, the rate at which the drug is removed from the body by the kidneys is given by CLrenal × Ctotal. We can then write an unsteady mass balance on the drug in the body’s apparent distribution volume assuming that the only elimination pathway for the drug is through the kidneys: V dC dt CL Capparent total renaltotal=- (8.19) Vapparent, Ctotal Body Kidney Ctotal, CLrenalCtotal= 0, CLrenal Solute removal rate=CLrenal ×Ctotal Figure 8.4 Concept of renal clearance. 411 Pharmacokinetic analysis This equation can be integrated to provide an equation for how the drug concentration within the body changes with time starting from an initial total plasma drug concentration Ctotal 0 . C tC eC etotaltotal CL Vt total ktrenalapparent renal() == -() -00/ (8.20) We see that drug elimination by the kidneys can be described as a first order process exhibiting an exponential decay in plasma drug concentration with time. The renal elimination rate constant krenal is related to the renal clearance and the apparent distribution volume by the following equation: k CL V renal renal apparent = (8.21) At any particular time, if Qurine represents the urine volumetric flow rate and Curine is the concentra- tion of drug in the urine, then the drug removal rate from the apparent distribution volume must equal the rate of its appearance in the urine, i.e., CLC QC or CL QC C renaltotal urineurine renal urineurine total == (8.22) This equation then provides a connection between the renal clearance and the flow rate of the urine that contains the excreted drug. Equation 8.22 can be used to calculate the renal clearance if the urine flow rate and the plasma and urine drug concentrations are known. The plant polysaccharide inulin, with a molecular weight of about 6000, is particularly important to mention at this point because its renal clearance can be used to measure kidney function. Inulin does not bind with plasma proteins, is not metabolized by the body, readily passes through the glomerular capillaries, and is neither reabsorbed nor secreted within the tubules. From Equation 8.18 and Figure 8.4, we have that the mass removal rate of unbound inulin across the glomerular capillaries is given by CU × CLrenal = GFR × CU = fU × GFR × Ctotal. Since fU is equal to unity for inulin and CU = Ctotal, this result shows that the rate at which plasma is being cleared of inulin in the kidneys (i.e., renal clearance, CLrenal) is the same as the GFR. Hence, for inulin, CLrenal = GFR. Creatinine, another substance that is naturally found in the body, can also be used to determine the GFR. Creatinine is found in the plasma and is a product of endogenous protein degradation, specifi- cally the breakdown of creatine phosphate in muscles. Creatinine, for the most part, is produced at a fairly constant rate by the body, although its production rate can depend on the muscle mass. So, for example, there will be a difference between males and females in the creatinine production rate, and a body builder is expected to have a higher production rate of creatinine than a normal person. The production rate of creatinine ( \u0000mcreatinine) in the body is about 1.2 mg min−1 in healthy young men and about 1 mg min−1 in healthy young women. Creatinine does not bind with the plasma proteins and, unlike inulin, is secreted by the tubules, which will affect the accuracy of GFR estimation from creati- nine concentrations in the plasma. At steady state, the production rate of creatinine in the body has to be equal to the rate of creatinine appearance in the urine. This is expressed by the following equation where Ctotal is the plasma concentration of creatinine and Curine is the urine concentration of creatinine: \u0000m GFRC QCcreatininetotal urineurine=´ =´ (8.23) 412 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Knowing the urine flow rate and the plasma and urine creatinine concentrations, Equation 8.23 can be used to calculate the GFR. Since the production rate of creatinine is relatively constant, Equation 8.23 also provides a means for calculating the GFR based on a measured concentration of creatinine in the plasma, i.e., GFR m C creatinine creatinine total = \u0000 (8.24) Example 8.2 The normal concentration of creatinine in the blood is about 1 mg 100 mL−1 or 1 mg dL−1. Estimate the GFR for this value of the creatinine concentration. The normal GFR is about 125 mL min−1. Suppose the creatinine concentration in the blood was found to be 8 mg dL−1. What is the GFR now? Solution We can use Equation 8.24 with \u0000mcreatinine equal to 1.2 mg min−1. For a creatinine concentration of 1 mg dL−1, the GFR is 120 mL min−1, which compares favorably with the normal GFR of 125 mL min−1. If the creatinine concentration in the body rises to 8 mg dL−1, then the GFR decreases to a value of 15 mL min−1, which indicates a significant impairment of kidney func- tion and the possible need for hemodialysis. Most drugs, unlike inulin and creatinine, are secreted and reabsorbed in the tubules of the nephron making the calculation of renal clearance for these drugs more complicated. The secretion of the drug may be inferred when the rate of excretion (CLrenal × Ctotal) exceeds the rate of drug filtration by the glomeruli (fU × GFR × Ctotal) or when CLrenal > fU × GFR. Tubular reabsorption of the drug is important whenever the rate of drug excretion is less than the rate of drug filtration or when CLrenal < fU × GFR. 8.5.2 Plasma clearance Plasma clearance (CLplasma) is the term used to represent the sum of all the drug elimination pro- cesses of the body. This includes the two primary ones already discussed, metabolism and renal clearance, and other secondary processes such as sweating, bile production, respiration, and bowel movement. We can write a drug mass balance for the amount of drug in the apparent distribution volume in terms of the plasma clearance as V dC dt CL Capparent total plasma total=- (8.25) where CLplasma = CLmetabolism + CLrenal + CLsweat + CLbile + CLrespiration + CLfeces. We can also define a first order elimination rate constant* for each elimination process as follows: k CL V i i apparent = (8.26) where i = metabolic, renal, sweat, bile, respiration, feces. * First order means that the rate of elimination depends on the concentration to the first power. 413 Pharmacokinetic analysis The total first order elimination rate constant is given by kte and is equal to the sum of the elimination rate constants for all of the elimination processes and is given by kk l V CL CL V te i i apparent i i plasma apparent == =åå (8.27) 8.5.3 Biological half-life The biological half-life (t1/2) of a drug is also a measure of the drug clearance and is the time needed for the drug concentration in the plasma to be reduced by one-half. To obtain the half-life for a drug distributed within a single compartment, we can write Equation 8.25 in terms of the total elimination rate constant, i.e., kte: dC dt kC total te total=- (8.28) We then integrate Equation 8.28 with the initial condition that at t = 0, C Ctotaltotal= 0 . The change in drug concentration with time, taking into account all elimination processes, is then given by C tC etotaltotal ktte() = -0 (8.29) The half-life time, i.e., t1/2, can be found by simply letting Ct C total total () 0 equal 0.5 in the previous equa- tion. When solved for t1/2, the following result is obtained, which also shows how the drug half-life is related to the apparent distribution volume and the plasma clearance: t k V CLte apparent plasma 12 0 693 0 693 / . . == (8.30) 8.5.4 The area under the curve, AUC0→∞ The total area under a Ctotal versus t curve, such as those shown in Figure 8.1, is given the special symbol AUC0→∞ and is a measure of the body’s exposure to the drug. Drug exposure depends on the drug dose and the drug clearance. AUC0→∞ is defined mathematically as follows: AUC Ct dt t total 0 0 ®¥ º ()ò (8.31) 8.5.5 Accumulation of the drug in urine As we discussed earlier, some of the drug will be eliminated by the kidneys and show up in the urine. In some cases, it may be convenient to use additional data on the amount of drug (not its metabolites) found in the urine to supplement a pharmacokinetic analysis. The rate at which the drug 414 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering accumulates in the urine is given by Equation 8.32, where Murine is the mass of drug (unchanged) in the urine at any given time. dM dt kV CCLC urine renalapparent totalrenal total== (8.32) 8.6 A model for intravenous injection of drug Equations 8.28 and 8.29 can also be used to describe how the drug concentration in the body changes with time after a rapid bolus IV injection of a drug. This model is based on a single drug distribu- tion compartment with all the elimination processes lumped into a single first order elimination rate constant, i.e., kte. Equation 8.29 predicts that the drug concentration decreases at an exponential rate with a general shape like that of curve II in Figure 8.1. The initial drug concentration is related to the drug dose (Ddrug) and the apparent distribution vol- ume, as given by Equation 8.33, where we assume that no drug is eliminated during the rapid injec- tion phase of the drug. C D V total drug apparent 0 = (8.33) If the dose and the initial concentration of the drug are known, then Equation 8.33 can be used to solve for the apparent distribution volume of the drug. An expression for AUC0→∞ can be obtained by substituting Equation 8.29 into Equation 8.31, which gives AUC C k D Vk D CL total te drug apparent te drug plasma 0 0 ®¥ == = (8.34) This equation then provides a simple relationship between the total area under the curve, the drug dose, and the plasma clearance. Note that the AUC0→∞, which is a measure of the drug exposure in the body, is directly proportional to the drug dose and inversely proportional to the plasma clearance. We can also substitute Equation 8.29 for the value of the drug concentration in the plasma at any time into Equation 8.32 and integrate that result to obtain the following expression for the mass of unchanged drug in the urine at any time. M t kC V k eurine renaltotal apparent te ktte() = æ è ç ö ø ÷ -() - 0 1 (8.35) After a sufficiently long period of time, i.e., as t → ∞, Equation 8.35 simplifies to provide the total amount of unchanged drug collected in the urine: M kC V k D k k AUCurine total renaltotal apparent te drug renal te == = ® 0 0 ¥¥CLrenal (8.36) 415 Pharmacokinetic analysis Thus, we find a relationship exists between the total amount of drug collected in the urine, the renal clearance, and the total area under the curve. Note that if the only drug elimination pathway is through the kidneys, i.e., krenal = kte, then the total amount of drug collected in the urine is equal to the total drug dose, as it should be. 8.7 Continuous infusion of a drug So far, we have discussed the case of first order drug elimination following a rapid bolus injection of a drug. The drug was assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout a single compartment. In this case, the drug concentration versus time is expected to follow curve II of Figure 8.1. In many cases, a continuous infusion of the drug is given. Here, the concentration of the drug increases and reaches a steady-state level once a balance is reached between the drug infusion rate and the drug elimination rate. The concentration versus time curve for constant infusion follows something like curve III of Figure 8.1. This result is similar to the so-called controlled release drug delivery systems that are commonly used, e.g., to treat motion sickness, for birth control, for extended chemotherapy, for pain management, and to help people quit smoking by delivering nico- tine. The constant infusion of a drug can also be used to provide a steady starting concentration of the drug for pharmacokinetic studies. Figure 8.5 illustrates a single-compartment model for the continuous infusion of a drug. \u0000mdrug repre- sents the drug infusion rate (mg min−1) assumed here to be constant. However, one could generalize this infusion rate to be any arbitrary time varying function. For example, in Section 6.1.2, we devel- oped an analytical solution describing the diffusion of a solute from a polymeric material. In this case, the solute is the drug and the polymeric material is a controlled release device. The mass transport flux of the drug (NAx∣x = L) out of the device was given by Equation 6.31. Hence, \u0000mdrug in Equation 8.37 is given by \u0000m tN Sdrug Ax xL() = = , where S is the surface area of the device in contact with the skin. Referring to Figure 8.5, we can write an unsteady mass balance for the drug in the single compart- ment representing the body as V dC dt mCLC mV kapparent total drug plasma totaldrugapparent=- =-\u0000\u0000 tte totalC (8.37) Vapparent, Ctotal Body Elimination routes Ctotal, CLplasmaCtotal = 0, CLplasma Solute removal rate=CLplasma ×Ctotal mdrug Figure 8.5 Single-compartment model for continuous infusion with first order elimination. 416 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Equation 8.37 can be integrated under the assumption of a constant infusion rate and that the initial drug concentration in the body is Ctotal 0 , which gives C tC e m kV etotaltotal kt drug te apparent ktte te() =+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ -() --0 1 \u0000 (8.38) The general shape of the curve described by this equation is that of curve III in Figure 8.1. For long periods of time, this equation predicts a steady-state plasma drug concentration given by C m kV m CL drug SS drug te apparent drug plasma == \u0000\u0000 (8.39) When the infusion is stopped, then the drug is eliminated according to Equation 8.29, where the initial drug concentration Cdrug 0 is equal to the steady-state drug concentration, i.e., Cdrug SS , arising from the constant infusion. Now the drug concentration decreases as shown by the dotted line of curve III in Figure 8.1. Example 8.3 The following table provides some data for the elimination of radioactive inulin from a 392 g laboratory rat. The animal was given a bolus injection at t = 0 equivalent to 1.01 × 105 cpm (counts per minute, where the radioactivity is directly proportional to the inulin concentra- tion). This was done to hasten the development of a steady-state plasma inulin level. Next, a continuous infusion of inulin was started at the rate of 2.76 × 103 cpm min−1. The inulin infu- sion was then stopped after a total of 80 min. From these data, determine the GFR, the renal elimination rate constant, and the apparent distribution volume for inulin. Inulin Elimination from a Laboratory Rat (Sarver, 1994) Time, min Inulin Concentration, cpm mL−1 0 0 30 849 40 845 60 903 70 888 75 873 80 882 infusion stopped 90 565 100 412 110 271 Solution We see that after about 30 min, a steady-state plasma inulin concentration of about 873 cpm mL−1 is reached. Once the infusion is stopped, the plasma inulin concentration decreases rapidly. As discussed earlier, inulin is only removed by the kidneys, and its renal clearance is the same 417 Pharmacokinetic analysis as the GFR. Therefore, for the case of this experiment with inulin, Equation 8.39 can be rear- ranged to solve for the GFR in terms of the known values of the infusion rate and the steady- state plasma concentration. GFR m C cpm cpmmL mL drug total SS== ´ = - - -\u0000 27610 873 316 31 1 1. min . min For the experimental conditions leading to the data shown in the previous table, the GFR is then calculated to be 3.16 mL min−1. Since the GFR is proportional to body weight, this can be expressed as 0.48 mL h−1 gBW−1. The renal elimination rate constant, i.e., krenal, can be found by performing a regression analysis of the data obtained after the infusion is stopped using Equation 8.29. Note that the time in this equation represents the time since the infu- sion was stopped. The initial concentration is equal to 873 cpm mL−1 and kte is equal to krenal since the only elimination process is that of the kidneys. Note that Equation 8.29 can be linearized by taking the natural logarithm of each side. The regression equation is then given by ln lnCt Ck ttotaltotal renal() =- 0 The intercept is the natural logarithm of the initial concentration, and the slope is the nega- tive of the elimination rate constant. After performing the linear regression, we find that C cpmmLtotal 01860 1= -. and that krenal = 0.038 min−1.

For these data, the apparent distribution volume is about 83 mL. Since the distribution volume is also proportional to the body weight, the apparent inulin distribution volume for a rat can be expressed as 0.21 mL gBW−1. 8.7.1 Application to controlled release of drugs by osmotic pumps There is considerable interest focused on the development of novel drug delivery systems (Verma et al., 2002). Novel drug delivery systems have several advantages including elimination of first-pass metabolism by the liver, minimal discomfort, lower risk of infections, sustained release of the drug, potential for reduced side effects, and better patient compliance, especially for chronic conditions. Osmotic pumps are small implantable devices that can be used to deliver a drug at a constant infusion rate to a specific site in the body for very long periods of time. An example is the DUROS® osmotic pump (Wright et al., 2001) that was developed to deliver the gonadotropin-releasing hormone ago- nist leuprolide for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The DUROS osmotic pump is made from a cylindrically shaped piece of titanium alloy and measures 4 mm in diameter and 45 mm in length. Serum leuprolide levels of about 1 ng mL−1 for long periods of time will reduce serum testosterone levels in humans to below castration levels, which is important in controlling the growth of prostate cancer cells. The device is inserted subcutaneously and is designed to deliver leuprolide at a constant rate for up to 1 year. As shown in Figure 8.7, an osmotic pump like the DUROS is basically a cylindrical device that is capped at one end by a permselective membrane and at the other end by a flow modulator through which the drug is released into the body. Within the device are two chambers separated by a piston. In the chamber between the permselective membrane and the piston, there is an osmotic agent that increases the osmotic pressure of the fluid within the chamber relative to the osmotic pressure of the body fluid that surrounds the device. The osmotic agent in the DUROS osmotic pump is NaCl at amounts much higher than the NaCl solubility. As water from the surroundings flows across the Region 1 Region 2 Osmotic agent Region 3 Fluid w/drug Piston L Region 1 d Flow modulator Permselective membrane Figure 8.7 Osmotic pump drug delivery system. 419 Pharmacokinetic analysis permselective membrane by osmosis, the NaCl dissolves and, because of being in excess, maintains saturation levels and hence a constant osmotic pressure throughout the lifetime of the implant. As water enters the device by osmosis, the fluid volume containing the osmotic agent increases and exerts pressure on the piston, causing the piston to move to the right in Figure 8.7. The movement of the piston then acts on the second chamber that contains a fluid with the drug. The piston movement then forces the fluid containing the drug out of the device through the flow modulator at a rate equal to the rate at which water enters the device by osmosis. The rate at which water enters the device shown in Figure 8.7 from the surroundings is given by Equation 3.4, i.e., QL SP Pin P=-()--()éë ùûÕÕ21 21 (8.40) where the numerical subscripts refer to the regions shown in Figure 8.7 S refers to the surface area of the permselective membrane Since the piston moves very slowly, we can also assume that the pressures in the osmotic agent chamber and the drug chamber are the same, i.e., P2 = P3. If the flow modulator is closed or plugged, then water continues to enter the device by osmosis until the hydrodynamic pressure difference, i.e., (P2 − P1), balances the osmotic pressure difference (Π2 – Π1) stopping the influx of water by osmosis, or PP equilibrium pressure21 21=+ -()ÕÕ (8.41) With the flow modulator open, there must be at steady state some value of the internal pressure, i.e., P2 or P3, which gives a flow rate out of the device that is equal to the rate at which water enters the device by osmosis. This value of P2 can be found by applying Bernoulli’s equation, i.e., Equation 4.81, across the flow modulator as shown by the next equation. PP V hfriction 21 1 2 2rr a =+ + (8.42) In this equation, hfriction represents the frictional losses due to the contraction and expansion of the fluid as it enters and leaves the flow modulator as well as the friction loss as the drug solution flows through the flow modulator of length L and diameter d. Recall that hfriction is given by Equation 4.84. V1 is the velocity of the drug-containing fluid as it exits the flow modulator. The volumetric flow rate of the drug-containing fluid leaving the osmotic pump is given by Q d Vout = p 2 1 4 (8.43) At steady state, one needs to find the value of P2 in Equation 8.42 that makes the Qout calculated by Equation 8.43 equal to the osmotic flow into the device as calculated by Equation 8.40. The drug 420 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering delivery rate, or the drug infusion rate \u0000mdrug in Equations 8.38 and 8.39, is then given by the product of Qout and the drug concentration within the osmotic pump, i.e., Cdrug. \u0000m QCdrug out drug= (8.44) Because the flow rate of the drug from the device is usually so small and occurs over such a long period of time, the pressures within the chambers of the osmotic pump, i.e., P2 and P3, are very close to the pressure of the surroundings, i.e., P1. In addition, the osmotic pressure of the osmotic agent, i.e., Π2, is much larger than the osmotic pressure of the body fluids surrounding the device, i.e., Π1. Hence, for these practical reasons, the values of Qin and Qout are given by the following equation, which results from a simplification of Equation 8.40: QQ LSin out P== Õ2 (8.45) Combining Equations 8.44 and 8.45 results in the following equation for the infusion rate of drug by an osmotic pump: \u0000m LSCdrug Pdrug=Õ2 (8.46) This equation shows that the infusion rate of the osmotic pump is directly proportional to the drug concentration within the device and the osmotic pressure of the osmotic agent that is used. The proportionality constant is the product of the surface area of the permselective membrane and its hydraulic conductance. 8.7.2 Controlled release of drugs from transdermal patches The controlled release of a drug can also be accomplished using a transdermal patch to provide percutaneous drug absorption. In the transdermal delivery of a drug, i.e., a skin drug patch (Panchagnula, 1997), the drug molecules diffuse across the skin and enter the systemic circulation. However, the passive transport of the drug across the skin can be a major problem. Skin acts as a major defense barrier for the body, and most drugs have very low skin permeability, which can limit the ability to achieve therapeutic drug levels in the body. Therefore, transdermal delivery of a drug is best suited for drugs that have high pharma- cological activity (potency) and good skin permeability (lipophilic). Examples where transdermal delivery of drugs is being used include birth control, estrogen replacement and testosterone replace- ment therapies, and the treatment of hypertension, pain, overactive bladder, and motion sickness, and for cessation of smoking. In other cases, as in cosmetics and for various skin lotions, the goal is for the active agent not to penetrate the skin and enter the systemic circulation. In these situations, the approach is to find an effective formulation that minimizes the permeation of the active ingredient across the skin (Wang et al., 2014). The bulk of the resistance for the transport of a drug across the skin as shown in Figure 8.8 results from the stratum corneum (SC) (Mitragotri, 2003). The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of 421 Pharmacokinetic analysis the skin consisting of about fifteen layers of keratin-filled cells (keratinocytes). The spaces between these cells are filled with lipid bilayers. The rate of transdermal transport of a drug across the stratum corneum, i.e., the drug infusion rate, can be described by an equation similar to Equation 6.14, where we treat the stratum corneum as a permeable membrane, i.e., \u0000m PS CP SCdrug SC drug SC drug=-() =0 (8.47) In Equation 8.47 we let PSC describe the permeability of the drug in the stratum corneum S is the total surface area of the transdermal device Cdrug is the average concentration of the drug within the transdermal device The permeability of a drug across the stratum corneum can be measured experimentally using sam- ples of skin (Wang et al., 2014), or it can be estimated as discussed in the next section. It is also assumed that the concentration of the drug at x = δSC is zero since the drug is immediately taken up by the blood supply. The stratum corneum permeability, i.e., PSC, can be described by an equation similar to Equation 6.15: P DK SC SC SC SC = e d (8.48) where εSC represents the volume fraction of the lipid bilayers through which the drug diffuses DSC is the diffusivity of the drug in the lipid bilayer material K C C SC drug x = =0 represents the equilibrium solubility of the drug in the stratum corneum, where CSC is the drug concentration within the stratum corneum In Equation 8.47, the value of Cdrug will change with time as the drug is depleted from the device. In the most rigorous case, we could use Equation 6.30 to calculate the average concentration of the drug within the device at a given time where we also assume that the drug concentration within the device is many times larger than the concentration of the drug within the stratum corneum, thus satisfying the second boundary condition (BC2) in Equation 6.20. Transdermal drug delivery deviceδdevice Keratinocytes δSC Intracellular space filled with lipid bilayers x Stratum corneum Figure 8.8 Transdermal delivery of drugs. 422 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering However, within the transdermal device, we can also make the reasonable assumption that the con- centration profile of the drug at any time is flat since the device is very thin, and diffusion of the drug out of the device is a very slow process because the bulk of the mass transfer resistance for the drug lies within the stratum corneum. Therefore, an unsteady mass balance on the amount of drug within the device at any time can be written as V dC dt PSCdevice drug SC drug=- (8.49) With the initial condition that C Cdrug drug= 0 , Equation 8.49 can be integrated to provide the amount of drug within the transdermal delivery device at any time. C tC edrug drug P t SC device() = - 0 d (8.50) where ddevice deviceV S = is the thickness of the transdermal patch. Equations 8.47 and 8.50 can then be combined with Equation 8.37 to obtain the following differ- ential equation that describes the concentration of the drug within the apparent distribution volume during continuous infusion of a drug by a transdermal delivery system: V dC dt Vk CP SC eapparent total apparent te totalSCdrug PSC devi+= - 0 d cce t (8.51) with the initial condition that at t = 0, C Ctotaltotal= 0 , where Ctotal 0 is the initial concentration of the drug in the body. Equation 8.51 can be easily solved using Laplace transforms (Table 4.4) to give Equation 8.52 for the plasma drug concentration as a function of time: C tC e PSC V ee totaltotal kt SC drug apparent P t te SC device () =+ -- - 0 0 d -- - æ è ç ç ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ ÷ ÷ kt te SC device te k P d (8.52) Note that if the device is very large, i.e., δdevice ≫ 0, or the stratum corneum permeability is very small, then Equation 8.52 simplifies to the previous result given by Equation 8.38 with \u0000m PSCdrug SC drug= 0 . Equation 8.52 can also be used to follow the drug concentration in the body for successive applica- tions of a transdermal patch. In this case, we assume the old patch is removed and then a new patch is applied, and Ctotal 0 is the concentration of the drug in the body when the new patch is applied, with the understanding that t in Equation 8.52 is the time since the new patch was applied. In some cases, a transdermal device is designed with a rate-limiting membrane that is adjacent to the skin (Nachum et al., 2006). This is done in cases where the stratum corneum permeability for the drug is very high, or where there is wide variation in the stratum corneum permeability between dif- ferent skin sites. In this way, the drug transport rate from the device is controlled by the transdermal device and not by any variations in the permeability of the skin. In this case, Equation 8.52 can still 423 Pharmacokinetic analysis be used to describe the concentration of the drug in the apparent distribution volume; however, PSC is now understood to represent the membrane permeability of the drug. If the rate-limiting membrane permeability and the stratum corneum permeability are of the same order of magnitude, then the overall permeability, i.e., PO, is used in Equation 8.52 in the place of PSC, where the overall permeability for the case of a stratum corneum and a device membrane is given by 11 1 PP POSCmembrane =+ . 8.7.2.1 Predicting the permeability of the skin Oftentimes for preliminary design calculations using Equation 8.52, it may be necessary in the absence of experimental values to have an estimate of the permeability of a drug in the stratum corneum (Mitragotri et al., 2011; Moss et al., 2012). Potts and Guy (1992) developed a relatively simple model for the stratum corneum permeability based on the size of the drug molecule, i.e., its molecular weight, MW, and its octanol/water parti- tion coefficient (KO/W). The octanol/water partition coefficient is a commonly used measure of the lipid solubility of a drug. They assumed that the diffusivity of a drug in the stratum corneum depends on the molecular weight of the drug as given by ee b SC SC SC MWDD e= () -0 (8.53) Substituting Equation 8.53 into Equation 8.48 and replacing the equilibrium solubility of the drug in the lipid bilayers (K) with the octanol/water partition coefficient (KO/W), we obtain PK D eSC OW SC SC MW= () - / e d b 0 (8.54) After taking the base ten log (log) of each side, Equation 8.54 becomes loglog log /P SC SC SC OW D KMW= ()é ë ê ê ù û ú ú +- e d ab 0 (8.55) where α is an adjustable constant added to improve the regression analysis and is expected to be on the order of unity. Potts and Guy (1992) then performed a regression analysis using Equation 8.55 on a data set of more than 90 drugs for which the stratum corneum permeability is known. The drugs considered in their data set ranged in molecular weight from 18 to 750 and had octanol/ water partition coefficients, i.e., log KO/W, from −3 to +6. The regression analysis found the values of e d ab D and SC SC ()é ë ê ê ù û ú ú 0 ,, that best represented the data set. Their regression analysis resulted in log. .log ./Pcms KMWSC OW -() =- + ()- 1 63 0710 0061 (8.56) This equation can be expected to yield the predicted values of PSC that are within several fold of the actual values of the stratum corneum permeability for a given drug. 424 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Example 8.4 Estimate the stratum corneum permeability for caffeine. The molecular weight of caffeine is 194, and its octanol/water partition coefficient, KO/W, is equal to 1 (Joshi and Raje, 2002). Solution We use the Potts and Guy equation to estimate the stratum corneum permeability for caffeine as shown below: log. .log .. .

A transdermal diffusion cell in a conceptual sense is similar to mass transfer across a membrane as shown in Figure 6.6. The skin sample is placed horizontally between two compartments with the stratum corneum fac- ing upward. The top donor compartment is where the sample containing the drug is placed. The receptor compartment contains a well-mixed fluid to receive the drug as it diffuses across the skin sample. Samples are taken over time from the receptor compartment to measure the drug concentrations. We can then use Fick’s second law as given by Equation 6.19 to describe the diffusion of the drug through the skin sample: ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ C t D C x A e A 2 2 (8.57) where CA is the drug concentration De is the effective diffusivity of the drug within the skin sample Equation 8.57 can be solved analytically if we assume that initially there is no drug in the skin sample, that the concentration of the drug in the donor compartment remains constant with time, and that the concentration of the drug in the receptor compartment is very low and can be taken as zero. We can then write the initial condition (IC) and the boundary conditions for Equation 8.57 as IC tC x, BC xC ,t KC BC xL C,t A AA donor A :, :, :, = () = = () = = () = 00 0 10 0 20L (8.58) where K is the drug partition coefficient between the drug in the donor compartment and the skin sample. Hence, C KCA x A donor = = 0 . The thickness of the skin sample is given by L. 425 Pharmacokinetic analysis Crank (1975) obtained a solution to Equations 8.57 and 8.58 using the method of separation of variables. The solution for the total mass of drug that has diffused through a skin sample of area S at time t is given by M SLKC Dt Ln Dn t L A A donor e n n e=- - -() - æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¥ å22 1 2 22 2 1 6 2 1 p p exp (8.59) For a skin of a given thickness, Equation 8.59 can be used to fit data of MA/S versus time to find the values of K and De. The drug permeability of the skin, i.e., PSC, is then given by KD L e . As t → ∞, Equation 8.59 simplifies to M S LKC Dt L KD C L tLKC A A donor ee A donor A donor=- æ è ç ö ø ÷ = æ è ç ö ø ÷ - 2 1 6 1 6 (8.60) Equation 8.60 describes the drug permeation through the skin sample at steady state. We see that the cumulative amount of drug that crosses the skin sample increases in a linear fashion with time. Therefore, if we plot data for the cumulative amount of drug versus time, the slope of these data for large times can be used to find the stratum corneum permeability for the drug, i.e., PSC. Hence, P KD L slope C SC e A donorº= (8.61) We can also write Equation 8.60 as M S KD C L t L D PC tt Ae A donor e SC A donor lag=- æ è ç ö ø ÷ =-() 2 6 (8.62) where t L D lag e º 2 6 and is the lag time. The lag time is the time it takes for the drug to just penetrate the skin sample and begin to show itself in the receptor compartment. From Equation 8.62, we see that tlag is the x intercept on a cumulative amount of drug versus time plot and can be used to find the value of De. Example 8.5 Todo et al. (2013) obtained the data shown in the table for the diffusion of methylparaben (MP) across hairless rat skin. MP is a preservative that is found in a variety of cosmetics and other personal care products. The molecular weight of MP is 152.2 and the log (KO/W) is 1.96. The concentration of MP in the donor compartment was 10 mM, or 1522 μg cm−3. From these data, estimate the stratum corneum permeability of MP, the MP effective diffusivity, and the MP partition coefficient. Also, compare the value of PSC obtained to that predicted by Equation 8.56. Assume the resistance to transport of MP across the skin is due to the stratum corneum with a thickness of 15 μm = 0.0015 cm. 426 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Time, h MP Permeated, μg cm−2 1 4.1 2 13.4 3 23.2 4 35.5 5 46.4 6 57.3 7 69.6 8 81.9 Solution Figure 8.9 shows a plot of the data given in the table.

For example, Implanon® (Wenzl et al., 1998) is a nonbiodegradable rod made from ethylene vinyl acetate that contains a core of synthetic progestin etonogestrel (ENG). ENG is a nonestrogen that has a contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation. This implant is 2 mm in diameter and 4 cm in length. When implanted, this device can provide effective contraception for up to 3 years. Assuming the wall of a drug-releasing implant is the controlling resistance for the transport of the drug out of the implant, Equation 6.14 can be used to describe the transport rate of the drug, i.e., \u0000m PS CP SCdrug m implant drug m implant drug=-() =0 (8.63) where Pm is the permeability of the material that contains the drug Simplant is the surface area for drug transport Cdrug is the concentration of the drug within the implant An unsteady mass balance on the amount of a drug within the implant is given by V dC dt PS Cimplant drug m implant drug=- (8.64) 428 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering With the initial condition that C Cdrug drug= 0 , Equation 8.64 can be integrated to provide the amount of a drug within the drug implant at any time: C tC edrug drug P d t m implant() = - 0 4 (8.65) where dimplant is the diameter of the cylindrical implant. Equations 8.63 and 8.65 can then be combined with Equation 8.37 to obtain the following differ- ential equation that describes the concentration of the drug within the apparent distribution volume during continuous infusion of the drug from the implant: V dC dt Vk CP SC eapparent total apparent te totalm implant drug P += - 0 4 mm implantd t (8.66) with the initial condition that at t = 0, C Ctotaltotal= 0 , where Ctotal 0 is the initial concentration of the drug in the body. Equation 8.66 can then be solved using Laplace transforms (Table 4.4) to give Equation 8.67 for the plasma drug concentration as a function of time. C tC e PS C V e totaltotal kt m implant drug apparent P d te m imp () =+ - - 0 0 4 llant te t kt te m implant e k P d - - æ è ç ç ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ ÷ ÷ - 4 (8.67) Equation 8.67 can also be used to follow the drug concentration in the body for the successive appli- cations of a drug implant. In this case, we assume the old implant is removed and then a new one is implanted, with Ctotal 0 as the concentration of the drug in the body when the new device is implanted, with the understanding that t in Equation 8.67 is the time since the new device was implanted. Example 8.6 The in vitro release rate kinetics for a batch of ENG implants gave 75 μg day−1 after 3 months, 55 μg day−1 at 1 year, and 40 μg day−1 after 2 years (Wenzl et al., 1998). From these data, estimate the ENG permeability from the implant assuming the controlling mass transfer resis- tance is the wall of the implant. The device is 2 mm in diameter and 4 cm in length. Solution The mass transfer rate of the drug out of the implant is given by a combination of Equations 8.63 and 8.65, i.e., \u0000m PS CP SC edrug m implant drug m implant drug P d t m implant== - 0 4 Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of this equation, we obtain ln ln\u0000mP SC P d tdrug m implant drug m implant () = ()- æ è ç ö ø ÷ 0 4 (A) 429 Pharmacokinetic analysis This equation says that if we plot the natural log of the drug release rate versus time, the result- ing graph of the data should be linear with a slope, i.e., m, equal to −4Pm/dimplant. After perform- ing a linear regression of the release rate data using Equation A, we find that m = –9.764 × 10−4 day−1. We can then find Pm: P md daycm cm daym implant=- = ´´ =´ -- -- 4 9 764 10 02 4 48810 41 51.. . 8.8 First-order drug absorption and elimination Many drugs are given orally or by injection. Other routes can include the nasal cavity or by inhalation. In all of these cases, the drug is first absorbed and makes its way into the plasma by diffusion where it becomes distributed throughout the body. The plasma concentration of the drug gradually increases and then finally decreases as the elimination processes begin to overcome the rate of drug absorption. Curve I of Figure 8.1 illustrates the general trend of the plasma drug concentration with time during the absorption and elimination phases. Although the drug absorption rate is strongly affected by the dosage form, i.e., solution, capsule, tablet, suspension, it has been found that for the most part, the drug absorption process in many cases can be adequately described by simple first order kinetics. Figure 8.10 illustrates a single-compartment model for the case of first order drug absorption and elimination. Note a separate mass balance equation is needed for the drug whose amount decreases with time due to its absorption into the body. The factor (f) accounts for the fraction of the dose (Ddrug) that is actually absorbable. An amount of the dose equal to (1 − f) Ddrug is assumed to be removed from the body without ever entering the apparent distribution volume. A mass balance on the amount of drug within the apparent distribution volume can be written as V dC dt kA CL Ck AVapparent total adrugplasmatotal adrugapparen=- =- tttetotalkC (8.68) where Adrug represents the mass of the drug remaining to be absorbed ka represents the drug’s first order absorption rate constant Vapparent, Ctotal Body Elimination routes Ctotal, CLplasmaCtotal =0, CLplasma Solute removal rate =CLplasma ×Ctotal kafDdrug Figure 8.10 Single-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination. 430 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering A mass balance on the drug yet to be absorbed, i.e., Adrug, is given by the following equation: dA dt kA drug adrug=- (8.69) When this equation is integrated, recognizing that initially Adrug(t = 0) = fDdrug, then the amount of a drug at any time waiting to be absorbed is given by A tfDedrug drug kta() = - (8.70) This equation can then be substituted into Equation 8.68 to obtain an expression for the total amount of a drug in the plasma as a function of time, assuming the initial concentration of the drug is zero: C t fD V k kk eetotal drug apparent a ate kt ktte a() = - æ è ç ö ø ÷ -() -- (8.71) We see that the concentration of a drug in the plasma is dependent on the first order rate constants for absorption and elimination, i.e., ka and kte. The concentration is directly proportional to the fraction of the drug dose that is absorbable and inversely proportional to the apparent distribution volume. An expression for the time at which the concentration peaks can be obtained by taking the derivative of Equation 8.71 with respect to time, setting this result equal to zero, and solving for the time. This time, called τmax, is given by the following expression: tmax ln= - æ è ç ö ø ÷ 1 kk k kate a te (8.72) Note that the time the maximum concentration is reached is independent of the dose. The corre- sponding concentration at the time of the peak can be found by substituting τmax into Equation 8.71 for the time and simplifying to obtain C fD V k k drug apparent a te k kk te te a max = æ è ç ö ø ÷æ è ç ö ø ÷ - (8.73) We can also find the value of AUC0→∞ by substituting Equation 8.71 into Equation 8.31. Upon integration, the following result is obtained for the value of AUC0→∞: AUC fD kV fD CL drug te apparent drug plasma 0®¥ == (8.74) It is interesting to note that the value of AUC0→∞ does not depend on the absorption rate constant. However, AUC0→∞ is directly proportional to the absorbed dose, fDdrug, and inversely proportional to the plasma clearance. AUC0→∞ is a measure of the body’s exposure to the drug. To complete our mathematical description of the process shown in Figure 8.10, the rate at which the drug enters the urine can be found from Equation 8.32. Substituting Equation 8.71 for the total 431 Pharmacokinetic analysis plasma drug concentration into this equation gives the following result for the amount of a drug in the urine at any given time: M t fD k kk k ke keurine drug renal te ate a kt te ktte a() = æ è ç ö ø ÷ - - -( --1 1 )) é ë ê ù û ú (8.75) After all of the drug has cleared the body, i.e., t → ∞, the amount of drug in the urine is given by M fD k k urinedrug renal te ¥ = (8.76) Note that if the only elimination pathway for the drug is through the kidneys, i.e., krenal = kte, then M fDurinedrug ¥ = . If Equation 8.76 is subtracted from Equation 8.75, then an equation is obtained for the quantity of the drug remaining to be excreted by the kidneys. This equation is of a convenient form for deter- mining the absorption and elimination rate constants from urinary excretion data: M Mt M kk ke keurineurine urine ate a kt te ktte a¥ ¥ --- () = -() -() (8.77) The parameters, i.e., ka and kte, can be determined by performing a nonlinear regression on urinary excretion data in a manner similar to that shown in Example 8.7. Since Murine ¥ is known from the uri- nary excretion data, one can then determine the renal elimination rate constant (krenal) from Equation 8.76 given the dose actually absorbed (fDdrug) and the value of kte. Example 8.7 illustrates the use of the single-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination to describe the plasma concentration of an experimental drug after an oral dose of 500 mg. This example requires that a nonlinear regression be performed to find the three unknown parameters in Equation 8.71, i.e., fD V drug apparent , ka, and kte. There are a variety of mathematical software programs that have routines for solving multiple parameter nonlinear regression problems. It is important to note that many times when performing a nonlinear regression analysis, a unique solu- tion may not be found. In other words, there can be different values of the regression parameters that can fit the data to the same level of accuracy. To extract the values of f and Vapparent from the value of fD V drug apparent requires additional data, such as that obtained from urinary excretion or IV injection studies. Other techniques based on graphical methods may also be used to determine pharmacokinetic parameters as discussed in the following references (Cooney, 1976; Gibaldi and Perrier, 1982; Welling, 1986; Notari, 1987) and in Problem 8.5 at the end of this chapter. Example 8.7 The table below summarizes plasma concentration levels of an experimental drug follow- ing a 500 mg oral dose. From the data provided in this table, determine the pharmacokinetic parameters that describe the absorption and elimination of this drug. The drug was also found to have an absorption factor (f) of 0.8. 432 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Time, min Plasma Drug Concentration, mg L−1 0 0 1 1.5 4 4.5 8 8.2 12 10.5 16 11.5 20 12.5 24 13.2 28 13.1 32 13.0 40 12.5 70 8.5 100 5.9 150 2.5 200 1.4 300 0.3 Solution One of the issues with the nonlinear regression analysis of pharmacokinetic data is obtain- ing suitable initial guesses of the parameters. In this example, we need to find the values of fD V kand k drug apparent ate,, . One approach for guessing fD V drug apparent is to extrapolate the data after the con- centration peak back to the value at t = 0 since this represents in a sense what the initial drug concentration would be if the absorption process was very fast. This is usually facilitated by plotting the log of the concentration data versus time. For the above data, it is then found that fD V mg L25 drug apparent ~ -1. Since, in most cases, the absorption process is many times faster than the elimination process then for times after the peak concentration, the elimination processes dominate. Hence, Equation 8.71 becomes ln lnC fD V k kk kttotal t drug apparent a ate te≫0 » - æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú - Therefore, if the ln(Ctotal) is plotted as a function of time for the data after the peak, the slope of these data is approximately equal to −kte. In this case, an estimate of kte = 0.014 min−1 is found. Since the absorption process is much faster than the elimination process, a value of ka ≈ 10 × kte can be assumed as a starting point. Figure 8.11 shows the results of the nonlinear regression. The open symbols are the data points from the previous table, and the solid line is the resulting best fit of Equation 8.71 to these data. The value of fD V mg L drug apparent = -19 9 1., 433 Pharmacokinetic analysis ka = 0.07 min−1, and kte = 0.015 min−1. From Equation 8.72, the predicted maximum in the plasma drug concentration occurs after 27.9 min, and the peak plasma concentration from Equation 8.73 is 13.1 mg L−1. The fit during the initial absorption phase and the elimination phase is excellent. Since the dose is given as 500 mg and the fraction of the dose absorbed is 0.8, we find that the apparent distribution volume for this drug is V mg mg L Lapparent = ´ = - 08 500 19 9 20 1 1 . . . 8.9 Two-compartment models In many cases, the single-compartment model is not sufficient to represent the time course of the plasma drug concentration. The single-compartment model assumes that the drug rapidly distrib- utes throughout a single homogeneous apparent distribution volume. In fact, the drug may dis- tribute at different rates in different tissues of the body, and it may require an extended period of time before the drug concentration equilibrates between the different tissue and fluid regions of the body. Clearly, this a complex process, and one could envision building a model in which a central compartment representing the plasma is in direct communication with a multitude of other compart- ments representing other tissue and fluid regions of the body. A reasonable simplification of this type of model is the two-compartment model shown in Figure 8.12. A drug is introduced into the central compartment that generally represents the plasma and other fluids in which the drug rapidly equilibrates. The drug then slowly distributes into the 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350400 0 5 10 15 Time, minConcentration, mg L−1 Figure 8.11 A comparison of actual and predicted plasma drug concentrations. 434 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering remaining tissue and fluid spaces represented by a single tissue compartment. The total apparent distribution volume is then equal to the sum of the distribution volume for the plasma and that of the tissue. The constants kpt and ktp represent the rate constants describing the first order transport between the plasma and tissue compartments. Also, kte is the first order rate constant that is used to describe the total of all the drug elimination processes, and these elimination processes are assumed to be associ- ated with the plasma compartment. Also, Equation 8.32 can be used to describe the accumulation of the drug in the urine; however, Vapparent is now the plasma volume, i.e., Vplasma, and Ctotal is the plasma drug concentration, i.e., Cplasma. The two-compartment model has a characteristic biphasic temporal plasma concentration profile that distinguishes it from the single- compartment model. During the early period after the drug absorption, the drug is eliminated at a more rapid pace from the plasma volume due to the combined effects of the usual elimination processes as well as drug absorption by the tissues and fluids of the secondary compartment. After a period of time, the two compartments equilibrate and the drug elimination rate falls off. 8.9.1 Two-compartment model for an intravenous injection First, let us develop a pharmacokinetic model for the case of a bolus IV injection. A separate unsteady mass balance equation for the drug is then written for the plasma and the tissue compartments: Plasma compartment V dC dt kV Ckplasma plasma tp tissue tissuete: =- + kkV Cpt plasma plasma() (8.78) Vplasma, Cplasma Plasma Elimination routes Cplasma, CLplasmaCplasma = 0, CLplasma Solute removal rate =CLplasma ×Cplasma Drug Vtissue, Ctissue Tissue ktpkpt Figure 8.12 A two-compartment model. 435 Pharmacokinetic analysis Tissuecompartment V dC dt kV Ck VCt t pt pp tp tt: =- (8.79) where Vplasma and Vtissue represent the apparent distribution volumes of the plasma and tissue compartments Cplasma and Ctissue represent the total concentrations of the drug within these respective compartments These equations can be solved analytically using Laplace transforms with the following initial con- dition: t = 0, Cplasma = Ddrug/Vplasma, and Ctissue  = 0. The equation for the concentration of the drug within the plasma compartment is given by C t D VA B kB ek Aeplasma drug plasma tp Bt tp At() = -() -() --()é ë ù û -- (8.80) and that for the concentration of the drug in the tissue compartment is then given by C t Dk VA B eetissue drug pt Bt At tissue () = -() -é ë ù û -- (8.81) The constants A and B are given by the following equations in terms of the first order rate constants: A kk kk kk kk B pt tp te pt tp te tp te=+ +()++ +() -é ëê ù ûú ì í î ü ý þ = 1 2 4 1 2 12/ 22 4 2 12 kk kk kk kkpt tp te pt tp te tp te++()-+ +() -é ëê ù ûú ì í î ü ý þ / (8.82) A nonlinear regression of plasma drug concentration data using Equation 8.80 can be performed to obtain the constants in that equation, i.e., Vplasma, A, B, and ktp. The other first order rate constants, kpt and kte, can then be found through the following process. We first multiply A and B in Equation 8.82 to obtain the following result: k AB k te tp = (8.83) Then, A and B in Equation 8.82 are added together to give kA Bk kpt tp te=+()-+() (8.84) Equations 8.83 and 8.84 can then be solved to obtain the values of kte and kpt from the known values of A, B, and ktp. The apparent distribution volume of the tissue compartment can be found by assuming that once the two compartments are at equilibrium, then the derivative in Equation 8.79 is equal to zero 436 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering and the concentrations in the two compartments are the same. Equation 8.79 then simplifies to give the following result for the volume of the tissue space: VV k k tissueplasma pt tp = é ë ê ù û ú (8.85) The overall apparent distribution volume is then equal to Vplasma + Vtissue and is given by VV k k apparent plasma pt tp =+ é ë ê ù û ú1 (8.86) The data in Example 8.8 illustrate how the pharmacokinetic parameters of the two-compartment model for an IV dose can be determined. Other techniques based on graphical methods can also be used to determine pharmacokinetic parameters (Welling, 1986; Notari 1987; Hacker et al., 2009). Oftentimes the graphical approaches can provide reasonable starting values for the parameters in a nonlinear regression. Example 8.8 The data shown in the table below from Putcha et al. (1989) provide the mean plasma con- centration (N = 6) following an IV injection of 0.4 mg of scopolamine. Scopolamine is a drug that is used to alleviate motion sickness. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of the two-compartment model given by Equations 8.80 and 8.81.

We see that the two-compartment model fits these 437 Pharmacokinetic analysis data extremely well. The following table summarizes the results of the regression analysis.

Unsteady mass balance equations can once again be written for each of the compartments. The equation for the tissue compartment is still given by Equation 8.79, and the equation that describes the amount of drug yet to be absorbed (Adrug) is still given by Equations 8.69 and 8.70. The plasma compartment equation is then given by V dC dt kA kV Ck kVplasma plasma adrugtp tissue tissueteptplas=+ -+() mma plasmaC (8.87) 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Time, minConcentration, pg mL−1 Figure 8.13 A comparison of actual and predicted plasma scopolamine levels. 438 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The initial conditions are that at time equal to zero, no drug is present in either compartment. These equations can then be solved using Laplace transforms to obtain the following expressions for the concentration of a drug within the plasma and tissue compartments. For the plasma concentration we have C t fD k V kA kA BA e kB k plasma drug a plasma tp a At tp a () = -() -() -() + -()- --() -() + -() -() -() é ë ê ê ù û ú ú -- BA B e kk Ak Bk e Bt tp a aa kta (8.88) and for the tissue concentration C t fD kk V e kA BA e kB AB tissue drug atp tissue At a Bt a ()= -() -() + -() - -- (() + -() -() é ë ê ê ù û ú ú -e Ak Bk kt aa a (8.89) The constants A and B have the same dependence on kpt, ktp, and kte as the two-compartment IV case and are also given by Equations 8.82. Depending on the type of data one has, Equation 8.88 can be fitted to plasma concentration data to obtain the unknown parameters: fDdrug/Vplasma, ka, ktp, A, and B. In some cases, it may not be possible to resolve the group fDdrug/Vplasma without additional data, perhaps from an IV bolus injection and/or urinary excretion data. Once these parameters have been determined, Equations 8.83 through 8.86 can be used to find the remaining parameters. Other tech- niques based on graphical methods may also be used to determine pharmacokinetic parameters as discussed in the references (Cooney, 1976; Gibaldi and Perrier, 1982; Welling, 1986; Notari, 1987). Example 8.9 illustrates the use of the two-compartment model with first order absorption to describe the mean plasma scopolamine levels following a 0.4 mg oral dose. Example 8.9 The data shown in the table below from Putcha et al. (1989) provide the mean plasma concen- tration (N = 6) following an oral dose of 0.4 mg of scopolamine. Determine the pharmacoki- netic parameters of the two-compartment model given by Equations 8.88 and 8.89.

We see that the two-compartment model fits these data rather well. Note that for the same dose of 0.4 mg, the IV administration of scopolamine resulted in a much higher peak plasma concentration (see Figure 8.13) than obtained when the dose is given orally (see Figure 8.14). Putcha et al. (1989) state that this may be a result of first-pass metabolism in the liver or poor absorption of the drug from the GI tract. Because of this lowered availability of the drug when given orally, we have adjusted the fraction of the drug actually absorbed, i.e., f, to match the apparent distribution volume for scopolamine as found in Example 8.8. The value f was then found to be 0.129. The table below summa- rizes the results of the regression analysis.

Hence, Equation 8.88 still describes the plasma drug concentration, however, with the understanding that k P a SC device = d and fDk PSCdrug aSCdrug= 0 . 8.9.4 Two-compartment model with drug absorption from an implantable device If the drug is delivered within the body from a cylindrical controlled release device with a diam- eter of dimplant and circumferential area Simplant, then we can replace in Equation 8.87 the term, kaAdrug = kfDeadrug kta- with PS Cem implant drug P d t m implant0 4 -æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ . Hence, Equation 8.88 still describes the plasma drug concentration, however, with the understanding that k P d a m implant = 4 and fDk PS Cdrug am implant drug= 0 . 8.10 Superposition principle The pharmacokinetic models we have developed so far are based on a single dose of the drug. In many cases, multiple sequential doses of a drug are given. The superposition principle argues that each drug dose behaves independently of any other dose that is given. The total concentration of a drug at a particular time t is the summation of the concentration at that particular time resulting from each dose that has been administered. Hence, C tC tC tC tCtotal totaltotal totaltotal() = ()+ ()+ ()+ () () () ()12 34 tt()+\u0000 (8.90) where C ttotal i() () is the concentration of the drug from the ith dose at time  t. The C ttotal i() () can be described by the previously developed single-dose pharmacokinetic models. Be careful though in your calculations since the single-dose model equations for a given dose are in terms of the time since that particular dose was given, i.e., t′. Therefore, for the ith dose, t′ = t − ti, where ti is when the ith dose was taken relative to t. Example 8.10 Write the mathematical expression that describes the plasma concentration for a drug given orally in two separate doses. Assume the pharmacokinetics of the drug can be described by a single-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination. Solution The appropriate model is given by Equation 8.71. We let D1 be the first drug dose taken at t1 and D2 is the second drug dose taken at t2. At t = 0, the plasma concentration of the drug is zero. Using the superposition principle, the pharmacokinetic model is given by 441 Pharmacokinetic analysis C tt t fD V k kk etotal drug apparent a ate () =-()æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ - æ è ç ö ø ÷ () q 1 1 ---() --() () -() +-()æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ kt tk tt drug apparent te ae tt fD V 11 2 2 q kk kk ee a ate kt tk ttte a - æ è ç ö ø ÷ -() --() --()22 where θ(t − ti) is the unit step function, which is equal to 0 when t − ti < 0 and equal to 1 when t − ti > 0. Problems 8.1 Derive Equation 8.38. 8.2 Derive Equation 8.71. 8.3 Derive Equations 8.72 and 8.73. 8.4 Derive Equation 8.75. 8.5 The rate constants in Equation 8.71 (ka and kte) can also be found using a graphical technique called “feathering” (Notari, 1987). Note that the plasma concentration in Equation 8.71 is related to the sum of two exponential terms. In most cases, ka is larger than kte; hence, the sec- ond exponential term in Equation 8.71 vanishes for long periods of time. Therefore, for long time periods, Equation 8.71 can be approximated as C t fD V k kk e TL drug apparent a ate ktte() » - æ è ç ö ø ÷ - where C(t)TL is the drug concentration along the terminal line (TL) during the drug elimina- tion phase. From this equation, we see that a plot of ln[C(t)TL] versus time predicts that the concentration data for these times should form a straight line. This region is referred to as the terminal elimination phase. The slope of the terminal line that fits the data during this period of time is then equal to −kte and the intercept is equal to ln fD V k kk drug apparent a ate- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú. We can also use the equation for C(t)TL to form the difference or residual, i.e., residual = C(t)TL − Ctotal(t), with the following result: ResidualC tC t fD V k kk e TL total drug apparent a ate k= () - () = - æ è ç ö ø ÷ - aa t This equation is valid for all values of time starting from time equal to zero. Note for short periods of time, C(t)TL is obtained either by extrapolation of the terminal line or by estimating C(t)TL by the first equation above. For long periods of time, this difference is equal to zero. Now, if a plot is made of the ln [C(t)TL − Ctotal(t)] versus time, the slope is equal to −ka and the intercept is once again equal to ln fD V k kk drug apparent a ate- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ù û ú. With ka and kte now known, fDdrug/ Vapparent can be obtained from the value of the intercept. 442 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Use this feathering technique to obtain the parameters for the data given in Example 8.7. How do these parameters obtained using the feathering technique compare with those obtained from a nonlinear regression? Under what conditions do you expect the feathering technique to be difficult to use? 8.6 Putcha et al.

The result is that you have a terrible headache, unlike any headache you have ever had before. You reach for your bottle of a new headache medicine that claims maximum relief within 30 min and contains a well- known pain reliever. An amazing coincidence is that the exam you are taking includes a problem related to the pharmacokinetics of this pain reliever. You are given the following information: Elimination rate constant = 0.277 h−1 Apparent distribution volume = 35 L Fraction absorbed = 80% Therapeutic range = 10–20 μg mL−1 You plan to take this pain reliever. What dose in milligrams should you take? At what time should you take another dose? How much should you take for the second dose? 8.8 The pharmacokinetics of nicotinamide was reported in humans (Petley et  al., 1995). Nicotinamide, a derivative of the B vitamin niacin, is under investigation as a prevention for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The drug was given orally to eight male subjects with a mean body weight of 75 kg. Two formulations were used, a standard powdered form and a sustained release form. The data below summarize the data obtained for the low-dose studies (standard = 2.5 mg kg−1 BW−1 and sustained = 6.7 mg kg−1 BW−1). Analyze these data using an appropriate pharmacokinetic model.

The antibiotic was delivered by an IV infusion pump for 30 min resulting in an initial plasma concentration of 32.47 μg mL−1. Following the infusion, blood samples were taken over the next 12 h. The initial dose was 500 mg, and 107.7 mg of imipenem was recovered in the dialy- sate fluid (“urine”). The table below summarizes the plasma concentrations.

The molecular weight of testosterone and estradiol are 288 and 272, respectively. The respective values of their octanol/water partition coefficients (KO/W) are 2070 and 7000. The reported value of the stratum corneum permeability for testosterone is 2.2 × 10−3 cm h−1, and for estradiol, the value is 3.2 × 10−3 cm h−1 (Joshi and Raje, 2002). 8.13 Consider the delivery of a drug from a patch applied to the skin. Assume that the patch has a surface area for drug transport of 30 cm2 and a thickness of 0.6 mm, that the concentration of the drug in the patch at any time after it has been applied is given by Cdrug(t), and that the stratum corneum permeability of the drug is given by PSC, which for this particular drug has a value of 3.66 × 10−7 cm s−1. If the initial concentration of the drug in the patch is Cdrug(0) = 25 mg mL−1, how long will it take to reduce the concentration of the drug in the patch to ½Cdrug(0), i.e., 12.5 mg mL−1? 8.14 Alora is a transdermal system designed to deliver estradiol continuously and consistently over a 3- to 4-day period when placed on the skin. Alora provides systemic estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. For a 36 cm2 patch, the release rate of the drug is 0.1 mg of estradiol per day. Clinical trials have provided the following pharmacokinetic data. In one study, following application of the patch, the peak concentration of estradiol was found to be 144 pg mL−1 (1012 pg = 1 g) and the half-life of the estradiol was found to be 1 h. Over an 84 h dosing interval, the plasma clearance for the estradiol from the Alora patch was found to be 61 L h−1. What is the steady-state plasma concentration for estradiol in pg mL−1? What is the apparent volume of distribution in L? 8.15 Deponit is a nitroglycerin transdermal delivery system for the prevention of angina pectoris. The in vivo release rate of the 16 cm2 patch is 0.2 mg h−1. The reported volume of distribution is 3 L kg−1 BW−1 and the observed clearance rate is 1 L kg−1 BW−1 min−1. What is the steady- state nitroglycerin concentration (ng mL−1) in a 70 kg human? What is the elimination rate constant? What is the half-life of nitroglycerin in minutes? 445 Pharmacokinetic analysis 8.16 A pharmacokinetic study of a particular drug taken orally as a single dose provided an AUC0→∞ of 1085.5 ng h mL−1, a Cmax equal to 98.5 ng mL−1, and a τmax of 2.1 h. From these data, deter- mine the values of Vapparent (L), kte (min−1), and ka (min−1). The dose was 80 mg and the entire drug is available, i.e., f = 1. 8.17 Design a skin patch to deliver nicotine. The goal is to have a patch that delivers nicotine for 24 h, then a new patch is added, and so on. Nicotine is somewhat water soluble and has a molecular weight of 162.23 and an octanol-water partition coefficient (log KO/W) of 1.2. The dose of nicotine to be absorbed into the body is 21 mg per 24 h, and the initial concentration of nicotine within the patch is 25 mg mL−1. Assume that the total nicotine content of the patch is 52.5 mg. The volume of distribution for nicotine is 2–3 L kg−1 of body weight, and the aver- age plasma clearance is 1.2 L min−1. Estimate the surface area and the thickness of the patch. Also plot the predicted plasma concentration of nicotine in ng mL−1 over a period of 7 days assuming a new patch is applied every 24 h. 8.18 Krewson et al. (1995) presented the steady-state data in the table for the distribution of the nerve growth factor (NGF) in the vicinity of a thin cylindrical controlled drug release device implanted into the brain of a rat. The polymeric disks containing radiolabeled I125-NGF were 2 mm in diameter and 0.8 mm in thickness. The NGF has a molecular weight of 28,000 g mol−1. Assume that the NGF is eliminated from the brain tissue by a first order process, i.e., the rate of elimina- tion is proportional to the concentration of NGF, i.e., kapparentCNGF where kapparent is the apparent first order elimination rate constant for the NGF and accounts for such processes as metabolism, cellular internalization, or uptake by the brain’s systemic circulation. Then develop a steady-state reaction-diffusion model to analyze these data. The boundary conditions, assuming the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system to be the midline of the polymeric disk, are as follows: C Catx aand CxNGF NGF== == ¥0 0 where a is the half-thickness of the polymeric disk. Estimate the value of the Thiele modulus a k D apparent T æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ that provides the best estimate of the data. DT represents the diffusivity of the NGF in the brain tissue which is estimated to be 4 × 10−7 cm2 s−1. Using this value of DT for the NGF, what is the value of kapparent? Using Equation 8.30, calculate the half-life of the NGF in the brain tissue. How does this value of the NGF half-life compare to the reported half-life of the NGF in brain tissue of about 1 h?

Nicotine gum was developed to help people quit smoking by providing the same amount of plasma nicotine as obtained from cigarettes. Nicotine is absorbed from the gum over a 30 min period after an initial short period of chewing the gum to release the nicotine. Nicotine is then readily absorbed within the buccal cavity. From the data provided in this table, explore how well a single-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination fit these data. Can a better fit to these data be obtained by assuming that the nicotine is released at a constant rate during the initial 30 min period? In your analyses, determine the pharmacokinetic parameters that describe the absorp- tion and elimination of nicotine.

Assume this solution has a density of 1 g cm−3 and a viscosity of 1 cP. The flow moderator from which the solution exits the pump consists of a tube that is 50 mm in length with a diameter of 0.05 cm. An excess of sodium chloride is placed on the side opposite the drug compart- ment, and these compartments are separated by a frictionless piston of thickness 5 mm (see Figure 8.7). At 37°C, a saturated solution of NaCl is formed and the concentration of this solution is 36.6 g NaCl per 100 g of water. The density of the NaCl solution that is formed is 1.186 g cm−3, and there is always enough solid NaCl in this compartment to maintain the saturated state. Assume that the pump has a cylindrical shape made of an alloy of steel and that an osmotic membrane is placed as an end cap on the compartment containing the NaCl. This membrane has a hydraulic conductance, i.e., LP, equal to 6.29 × 10−5 μL day−1 cm−2 mmHg−1, and this membrane completely retains the NaCl solution. From this infor- mation, specify the diameter of the osmotic pump and provide a reasonable estimate of its length. 8.23 Todo et al. (2013) obtained the data shown in the table for the diffusion of methylparaben (MP) across a silicone membrane proposed as an alternative to the use of an animal skin for the prediction of skin permeation. MP is a preservative that is found in a variety of cosmetics and other personal care products. The molecular weight of MP is 152.2.

These devices lie outside (extra) the body (corporeal) and are usually connected to the patient by an arte- riovenous shunt.* In some respects, they may be thought of as artificial organs. Their function is based on the use of physical and chemical processes to replace the function of a failed organ or to remove an unwanted substance from the blood. The patient’s blood before entering these devices is infused with anticlotting drugs such as heparin, to prevent clotting. A variety of ancillary equip- ment may also be present to complete the system. This may include items such as pumps, flow m onitors, bubble and blood detectors, and pressure, temperature, and concentration control systems. It is important to note that these devices do not generally contain any living cells. Devices containing living cells are called bioartificial organs and these will be discussed in Chapter 11. 9.1 Applications A variety of extracorporeal devices have been developed. The best known of these are blood oxygen- ators, which are used in such procedures as open heart surgery, and hemodialysis, which replaces the function of failed kidneys. Other examples include aquapheresis for removing excess water from the body; hemoperfusion, wherein a bed of activated carbon particles are used for cleansing blood of toxic materials; plasmapheresis† to separate plasma from blood as a first step in the subsequent processing of the plasma; immobilized enzyme reactors to rid the body of a particular substance or to replace lost liver function; and affinity columns to remove agents of the immune system that attack the body’s own cells, as in autoimmune diseases and in sepsis. The primary functional unit of extracorporeal devices is typically provided as a sterile disposable cartridge. However, in some cases, considering mounting healthcare costs, the functional unit can be reused many times provided it is cleaned and sterilized between applications. Reused functional units are not shared between patients. Certainly, there is no end to the possibilities for extracorporeal devices. However, whatever the func- tions of the device are, there will be some commonality among them in terms of their construction, use of membranes, and fluid contacting schemes. 9.2 Contacting schemes Most devices, such as blood oxygenators and dialyzers, are typically based on the use of polymeric membranes to create the surface area needed to provide mass transfer between the blood stream and another exchange fluid stream. The membrane is physically retained within the device by a support structure that also creates the flow channels. As illustrated in Figure 9.1 for hemodialyzers, * A shunt is a means of diverting flow, in this case blood from an artery through a device and then back into the body via a vein. † See Problem 6.8 for a discussion and analysis of a membrane plasmapheresis system. 452 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering the membranes are typically arranged as stacks of flat sheets, coils of membrane sheets, or bundles of hollow fiber membranes. Hollow fiber membranes are finding increased use because of their low cost, ease of manufacture, and consistent quality. A variety of contacting patterns between the blood and the exchange fluid are also possible as shown in Figure 9.2. In cocurrent flow, the fluid streams flow in the same direction, whereas, in countercurrent flow, the fluid streams flow in opposite directions. In the cross flow pattern, the fluid streams flow in a perpendicular sense to each other. Immobilized enzyme reactors and affinity columns have the active material, i.e., an enzyme or other ligand, firmly attached to a support particle.

As shown in Figure 9.3, the particles containing the immobilized material can be arranged as a packed bed or the particles can be suspended in a well-mixed device. The complete mixing of the fluid phase and suspended particles can be achieved either by a mechanical impeller or by fluid recirculation. 9.3 Solute transport in extracorporeal devices In many extracorporeal devices, a solute is transported through the blood, perhaps across a mem- brane, and then into an exchange fluid. These transport processes were discussed in Section 6.1.1.7 and illustrated in Figure 6.6 for the case of simple diffusion. Recall that we also defined an overall mass transfer coefficient, i.e., KO, (see Equation 6.17) in terms of the overall mass transfer driving force based on the bulk fluid concentrations of the solute as shown in Figure 6.6. The overall mass transfer coefficient is given by Equation 6.18 in terms of the individual film mass transfer coefficients on the blood and exchange fluid sides and the membrane permeability. Recall that we discussed membrane permeability in much detail in Chapter 6. Membrane permeabil- ity, although best measured experimentally (Dionne et al., 1996; Baker et al., 1997), is defined by Equation 6.15. Also as discussed in Chapter 5, the individual film mass transfer coefficients depend on the physical properties of the fluid and the nature of the flow. They also depend on position due to boundary layer growth, so we usually use length-averaged values of these coefficients in Equation 6.18. 9.3.1 Estimating the mass transfer coefficients Techniques for estimating the individual film mass transfer coefficients for a variety of flow condi- tions were summarized in Section 5.11. For the laminar flow of fluids in a tube, we can use Equation 5.169 or 5.170 to estimate the film mass transfer coefficient. For other flow situations, Table 5.1 provides a summary of useful mass transfer coefficient correlations. Blood flow through extracorporeal devices is typically laminar and, in some cases, the velocity and concentration profiles can be fully developed. Recall from Chapter 5 that the laminar flow velocity (b)(c) Immobilized enzyme or other ligand (a) Figure 9.3 Immobilized enzyme and affinity reactor systems. (a) Packed bed, (b) completely mixed by fluid recycle, and (c) completely mixed by impeller. 454 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering profile is fully developed when z/d > 0.05Re and the concentration profile is fully developed when z/d > 0.05ReSc. Here, z is defined as the axial position in the direction of the flow path, d is the diameter of the tube, Re is the Reynolds number, and Sc is the Schmidt number. For solutes in liquids, the Sc ≫ 1, so the velocity profile will develop much faster than the concentration profile. If the value of z is much less than the length of the flow path in the device, then we can assume that the particular profile, i.e., velocity or concentration, is fully developed within the device. However, if z is larger than the length of the flow path in the device, then the velocity or concentration profile is undeveloped within the device. The exchange fluid will either be in laminar or turbulent flow. Generally, one operates on the exchange fluid side in such a manner that its contribution to the overall mass transfer resistance is negligible. If an estimate of the mass transfer coefficient for the solute in the exchange fluid is needed, then one can use Equation 5.169 or 5.170 if the exchange fluid flow is laminar. For turbulent flow of the exchange fluid, one can consult Table 5.1 or these additional references: Cussler (1984), Bird et al. (2002), and Thomas (1992). 9.3.2 Estimating the solute diffusivity in blood The diffusivity of the solute in blood is given by DT and can be quite different from the solute’s diffusivity in the plasma (Dplasma) alone because of the presence of the red blood cells. The factors influencing mass transfer within blood are summarized in Table 9.1 (Colton and Lowrie, 1981). The rheological behavior of blood is not a very important factor in describing solute transport since at the relatively high shear rates encountered in extracorporeal devices, blood behaves as a Newtonian fluid. Mass transport theories for Newtonian fluids are well developed, and we can make use of these for the special case of blood. The rotation and translation of red blood cells can influ- ence mass transport to some degree; however, these effects can usually be neglected unless sufficient data is available to warrant their inclusion. A complete description of solute transport in blood requires that one knows the solute diffusivity and its red blood cell permeability, its equilibrium distribution between the plasma and the fluid within the red blood cell, and the kinetics of any chemical reaction it may undergo with other solutes, Table 9.1 Factors That Affect Mass Transport in Blood Suspension properties Volume fraction of red blood cells Volume fraction of proteins Red blood cell solute permeability Solute behavior Protein binding kinetics and equilibrium Reactions with other solutes Flow-dependent behavior Rheological properties Red blood cell dynamics Rouleaux formation Migration from the wall Rotation and translation 455 Extracorporeal devices typically proteins, that may be present. Clearly, this is a complex problem. The diffusion and reac- tion of oxygen with hemoglobin is a special case that is important in the design of blood oxygenators and is discussed in Section 9.5. However, for most other solutes, we can treat the blood as a nonreac- tive fluid and assume either of the following two cases applies. First, if the red blood cell permeability for the solute of interest is extremely large, then the solute will diffuse through the blood as if it were a pseudohomogeneous fluid and the solute diffusivity will not be affected by the presence of the red blood cells. For this case, one only needs to know the solute diffusivity in plasma, which can be obtained by estimating the aqueous diffusivity by use of Figure 5.2, followed by a correction for the difference in viscosity between an aqueous solution and plasma using Equation 6.46. Solute diffusion in plasma amounts to an estimated 40% reduction in comparison to the aqueous solute diffusivity. For the second case, the red blood cell may be somewhat permeable to the solute. The solute must therefore diffuse around or through the red blood cells increasing the solute diffusion path and decreasing the solute effective diffusivity. We can use relationships such as those presented in Chapter 6, i.e., Equations 6.43 and 6.45, to describe this situation. Another approach for estimating DT has been described by Colton and Lowrie (1981). They inves- tigated the diffusion of urea in both stagnant and flowing blood. They presented data for the ratio of the solute permeability in blood to that in plasma alone as a function of the hematocrit. These results were then used to develop an expression for the solute diffusivity in nonreactive blood. The diffusion coefficient through blood, i.e., DT, was defined by the following equation for the x-component of the solute flux, which is similar to Fick’s first law: N D dCdx blood T effective=- (9.1) The effective concentration (Ceffective) represents the volume fraction-weighted sum of the solute con- centration in the red blood cell phase (CRBC) and the continuous plasma phase (Cplasma) and is given by C HC HCeffective RBC plasma=+ -()1 (9.2) where H represents the blood hematocrit. Equation 9.2 treats the blood as a continuous pseudo- homogeneous phase, which is a reasonable approximation for an extracorporeal device as long as the region being considered is much larger than the size of an individual red blood cell. Diffusion of solute through just the continuous or plasma phase (H = 0) is given by N D dC dx plasma plasma plasma=- (9.3) Substituting Equation 9.2 into Equation 9.1 for Ceffective and dividing the result by Equation 9.3 pro- vides a relationship for the solute diffusivity in blood in comparison to its value in plasma alone: N N D D HK H blood plasma T plasma RBC=+ -()éë ùû1 (9.4) In this equation, KRBC = CRBC/Cplasma represents the equilibrium partition coefficient for the solute between the red blood cells and the plasma. Average values of KRBC for some typical solutes are summarized in Table 9.2. 456 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Colton and Lowrie (1981) have shown that Equation 9.4 is also equal to the following expression (actually Equation 6.43 with ϕ = H) assuming the red blood cell is impermeable to the solute (Dcell = 0): D D HK H H H T plasma RBC +-()éë ùû = -() + 1 21 2 (9.5) Equation 9.5 can be used to estimate the diffusivity of a solute in blood, i.e., DT. With this background on extracorporeal devices, the following discussion will focus on a descrip- tion and analysis of five representative devices: hemodialyzers, aquapheresis, blood oxygenators, enzyme reactors, and affinity columns. 9.4 Hemodialysis 9.4.1 Background The basic functional unit of the kidney is the nephron (shown earlier in Figure 8.3). Each kidney contains about 1 million nephrons. Only about one-third of these nephrons are needed to maintain normal levels of waste products in the blood. If about 90% of the nephrons lose their function, then the symptoms of uremia will develop in the patient. Uremia results when waste products normally removed from the blood by the kidneys start to accumulate in the blood and other fluid spaces. For example, water generated by normal metabolic processes is no longer removed and accumulates in the body, leading to edema, and in the absence of additional electrolytes, almost half of this water enters the cells rather than the extracellular fluid spaces due to osmotic effects. The normal metabolic processes also produce more acid than base, and this acid is removed by the kid- neys. Therefore, in kidney failure, there is a decrease in the pH of the body’s fluids, called acidosis, which can result in a uremic coma. The end products of protein metabolism include such nitrogenous substances as urea, uric acid, and creatinine. These materials must be removed to ensure continued protein metabo- lism in the body. The accumulation of urea and creatinine in the blood, although not life threatening by themselves, is an important marker of the degree of renal failure. They are also used to measure the effectiveness of hemodialysis for the treatment of kidney failure. The kidneys also produce the hormone erythropoietin that is responsible for regulating the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. In kidney failure, this hormone is diminished leading to a condition called anemia and a lowered hematocrit. If kidney failure is left untreated, death can occur within a few days to several weeks.

II, Brenner, B.M. and Rector, F.C., Jr. (eds.), WB Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA, 1981. 457 Extracorporeal devices Hemodialysis was developed in the 1940s (Kolff, 1947) to treat patients with degenerative kidney failure or end-stage renal disease. Hemodialysis has the ability to replace many functions of the failed kidneys. For example, hemodialysis removes the toxic waste products from the body, maintains the correct balance of electrolytes, and removes excess fluid from the body. Hemodialysis can keep patients alive for several years, and for many patients, allows them to survive long enough to receive a kidney transplant. Nearly 500,000 patients in the United States are currently being kept alive by hemodialysis, and another 200,000 patients have a functioning kidney obtained by transplantation. Figure 9.4 illustrates the basic operation of hemodialysis. Heparinized blood flows through a mem- brane device known as the hemodialyzer. The dialysate or exchange fluid flows on the membrane side opposite the blood. Solutes are exchanged by diffusion between the blood and the dialysate fluid. A variety of membrane configurations are possible, and some of the typical ones were shown earlier in Figure 9.1. A variety of flow patterns for the blood and dialysate have been used, and these are also summarized in Figure 9.2. The membranes were originally made from cellulose and cel- lulose derivatives such as cellulose acetate; however, these have been replaced for the most part by synthetic polymers such as polyacrylonitrile, polycarbonate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyarylether- sulfone, and polyamide (Zelman, 1987; Galletti et al., 1995; Clark and Gao, 2002). The membrane surface area of the dialysis cartridge is on the order of 1–2 m2. Blood flow rates are in the range of several hundred mL min−1 and the dialysate flow rate is about twice that of the blood. 9.4.2 Dialysate composition Table 9.3 compares the species present in normal and uremic plasma with those of a typical dialysate fluid. The composition of the dialysate is based on the need to restore the uremic plasma to the nor- mal state. Note in particular the high levels of urea and creatinine in the uremic plasma. For the most part, the movement of the species in the above table between the uremic plasma and the dialysate is by diffusion. The higher level of HCO3− in the dialysate fluid is used to decrease the acidity of the plasma through its buffering action. Because of the reduced concentrations, the osmolarity of the dialysate is about 265 milliosmolar in comparison to about 300 milliosmolar or so for the plasma. Hence, water will tend to leave the dialysate and enter the plasma by osmosis. Since the patient needs to have excess water removed during dialysis, it is then necessary to maintain the dialysate Blood Anticoagulant (heparin) Dialysate Hemodialyzer Figure 9.4 Hemodialysis. 458 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering pressure below atmospheric pressure in order to develop a transmembrane pressure gradient that is sufficient to overcome osmosis and remove water from the patient. The removal of waste products from the plasma must also be carefully controlled in order to avoid disequilibrium syndrome. If waste products are removed from the blood too fast by dialysis, then the osmolarity of the plasma becomes less than that of the cerebrospinal fluid, resulting in a flow of water from the plasma and into the spaces occupied by the brain and spinal cord. This increases the local pressure in these areas and can lead to serious side effects. 9.4.3 Role of ultrafiltration The rate at which water is removed (ultrafiltration) from the plasma by the pressure gradient across the dialysis membrane can be estimated using Equation 3.4. This equation can be simplified by assuming only the plasma proteins are impermeable. Hence, the following equation is obtained: QL SPPmean plasma=-()DÕ (9.6) where Πplasma represents the oncotic pressure of the retained plasma proteins, about 28 mmHg ΔPmean is the average transmembrane pressure difference, which is given by DP PP PP mean BinB out DinD out= + - +é ë ê ù û ú ,, ,, 22 (9.7) Note that to avoid problems with the calculations, it is best to simply use absolute pressures in Equation 9.7, recognizing that since the dialysate is subatmospheric, its reported gauge pressure will be negative. The pressure drop on the blood side of the hemodialyzer is typically on the order Table 9.3 Composition of Normal and Uremic Plasma and Dialysate Species Electrolytes, mEq L−1 Normal Plasma Uremic Plasma Dialysate Na+ 142 142 133 K+ 5 7 1 Ca++ 3 2 3 Mg++ 1.5 1.5 1.5 Cl− 107 107 105 HCO3− 27 14 35.7 Lactate− 1.2 1.2 1.2 HPO4− 3 9 0 Urate− 0.3 2 0 SO4− 0.5 3 0 Nonelectrolytes, mg dL−1 Glucose 100 100 125 Urea 26 200 0 Creatinine 1 6 0 Source: Data from Guyton, A.C., Textbook of Medical Physiology, 8th ed., W.B.

The mean transmembrane pressure drop is on the order of a few hundred mmHg. The hydraulic conductance, LP, is typically about 3 mL h−1 m−2 mmHg−1. High-flux membranes can have values of the hydraulic conductance as high as 20 mL h−1 m−2 mmHg−1; however, protein deposition on the plasma side of the membrane can reduce this in a linear manner by about 6% per hour (Zelman, 1987). Example 9.1 illustrates the calculation of the ultrafiltration rate in a typical membrane dialyzer. Example 9.1 Using the membrane properties listed in the discussion in Section 9.4.3, calculate the ultra- filtration rate of water in a hemodialyzer with a membrane surface area of 1 m2. How much water is removed after 6 h of dialysis? Assume blood enters the device at 120 mmHg (gauge) and leaves at 100 mmHg (gauge). The dialysate fluid enters at −150 mmHg (gauge) and leaves at −200 mmHg (gauge).

The Q’s represent the volumetric flow rates of the blood (b) and the dialysate (d), and the C’s represent the concentration of a particular solute. The mass transfer rate of solute A across the dialysis membrane is given by the following equation: \u0000m QC QC QC QCAb in b in b out b out d out d out d in d in= -=- (9.8) Qd in, Cd inDialysate Qb in, Cb inBlood x+ ∆x Hemodialyzer Qd out, Cd out Qb out, Cb out x Figure 9.5 Solute mass balance model for a cocurrent hemodialyzer. 460 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The clearance of the dialyzer for a particular solute is defined as the volumetric flow rate of blood (typically mL min−1) entering the dialyzer that is completely cleared of the solute. The dialyzer clearance (CLD) for solute A is then given by the next equation: CL m C D A b in= \u0000 (9.9) The clearances for such solutes as urea, creatinine, and uric acid are on the order of 100 mL min−1. Higher molecular weight solutes show a reduced clearance. The term dialysance is also used to describe the solute removal characteristics of a dialyzer. Dialysance (DB) is defined by Equation 9.10. We see that the solute mass transfer rate is now divided by the maximum solute concentration difference between the blood and the dialysate: D m CC B A b in d in= - \u0000 (9.10) For a single-pass dialyzer, Cd in = 0, and the dialysance is then the same as the clearance. Because of water removal, the inlet and outlet flow rates of the blood and dialysate streams are not equal. This water removal is by ultrafiltration across the hemodialysis membrane and is given by Equation 9.11 in terms of the flow rates of the blood and dialysate streams: QQ QQ Qb in b out d out d in= -=- (9.11) If ultrafiltration is important, then we can use this relationship in combination with Equations 9.8 and 9.9 to derive an expression for the clearance that allows for the examination of the importance of ultrafiltration on the clearance of a given solute. Explicitly including the ultrafiltration flow given by Q, the solute clearance for a particular solute is expressed by the following equation: CLQ CC C Q C C Db in b in b out b in b out b in= -æ è ç ö ø ÷ + æ è ç ö ø ÷ (9.12) Since, in general, the value of C Cb out b in≪ , the contribution of the ultrafiltration flow to the solute clearance is therefore less than the value of Q. As shown in Example 9.1, Q is on the order of 10 mL min−1, and earlier it was stated that the clearance of such solutes as urea is on the order of a 100 mL min−1. Therefore, we can conclude that the effect of ultrafiltration on the clearance of low- molecular-weight solutes is quite small. However, for higher molecular weight solutes, the effect of ultrafiltration may be significant. 9.4.5 Solute transfer We can now develop relationships between solute clearance and the mass transfer characteristics of the membrane dialyzer. In order to perform this analysis, we first must choose one of the contacting patterns shown in Figure 9.2 to describe the flow of blood and dialysate in the dialyzer. Here, we will use the cocurrent pattern as shown in Figure 9.5. We will also assume that the overall mass transfer coefficient is constant within the hemodialyzer. The flow rates of the blood and dialysate are also assumed to be constant, i.e., ultrafiltration is ignored. 461 Extracorporeal devices A shell mass balance for the blood and dialysate can then be written for a given solute as QC QC KW xC C QC QC KW xC C dd x dd xx Ob d dd x dd xx Ob d -= -() -= --() + + D D D D (9.13) The quantity, WΔx, represents the available mass transfer area within the shell volume ΔV of the hemodialyzer. Hence, W is the membrane surface area per unit length of the dialyzer. If L is the length of the dialyzer, then the quantity A = L × W is the total membrane area within the dialyzer. After dividing the previous equations by Δx and taking the limit as Δx approaches zero, the fol- lowing two differential equations are obtained that provide the position dependence of the solute concentration in the dialyzer blood and dialysate: Q dC dx KW CC Q dC dx KW CC b b Ob d d d Ob d =- -() =-() (9.14) Equation 9.14 can be integrated analytically, provided we first can relate Cd and Cb. This can be obtained by adding the previous two equations, multiplying through by dx, and then integrating between the entrance and any arbitrary value of x. The following result is then obtained for the value of Cd in terms of Cb. Note that z ≡ Qb/Qd: C xC zC xCdd in bb in() =- ()-() (9.15) Substituting this equation for Cd in Equation 9.14, we obtain the following differential equation that describes the solute concentration on the blood side. We see that the only dependent variable is the blood concentration: Q dC dx KW zC CzCb b Ob d in b in=- +() -+()é ë ù û 1 (9.16) Equation 9.16 can now be integrated analytically and rearranged to give the following result. This equation is known as the performance equation for a cocurrent hemodialyzer: E D Q CC CC Nz z B b b in b out b in d in T == - - -- +()éë ùû +() = 11 1 exp (9.17) Two additional dimensionless parameters have been defined in the derivation of this equation, the extraction ratio (E), where 0 ≤ E ≤ 1, and the number of transfer units, NT = KOA/Qb. The number of transfer units provides a measure of the mass transfer effectiveness, i.e., the amount of solute transported across the membrane versus the amount of solute that enters the device in the blood. The concentration of a given solute in the blood exiting the dialyzer is then given by C CE ECb out b in d in=-()+1 (9.18) If the membrane area is infinite for a given value of z, i.e., for given values of the dialysate and blood flow rates, then we achieve the maximum possible extraction ratio, i.e., Emaximum = 1/(1 + z). This cor- responds to the best possible performance in a dialyzer for a given set of blood and dialysate flow 462 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering rates and is independent of the solute concentrations. This also implies that the solute concentrations in the exiting blood and dialysate are equal or in equilibrium, i.e., C CCb out d out equilibrium== . For these conditions, the maximum achievable dialysance for any combination of the blood and dialysate flows is also given by DBmaximum = Qb/(z + 1) = QbQd/(Qb + Qd). If z = 0, i.e., the dialysate flow rate is significantly higher than that of the blood, and if the membrane area is also infinite, then we obtain from Equation 9.17 that E = 1. For these conditions, the solute concentration in the blood exiting the dialyzer achieves its lowest possible value, i.e., the value of the solute concentration in the entering dialysate fluid, Cd in. Performance equations for other fluid contacting patterns such as countercurrent, a well-mixed dialysate, and cross flow are summarized in Table 9.4. More advanced multidimensional models for describing the hemodialyzer can be found in Ding et al. (2004, 2005) and Labecki et al. (1996). Example 9.2 Estimate the clearance of urea in a 1 m2 cocurrent and countercurrent hollow fiber hemodia- lyzer. The dialyzer hollow fibers are 25 cm in length, and they have an inside diameter of 250 μm. The wall thickness of the fibers is 40 μm. The void volume (ε) in the hemodialyzer is 50%. Blood flows within the hollow fibers and the dialysate flows in a single pass on the shell side of the device parallel to the fibers. The blood flow rate is 200 mL min−1, and the dialysate flow rate is 500 mL min−1. The membrane permeability, Pm, for urea is 10−3 cm s−1. Solution For the blood flowing through the fibers, the characteristic dimension in the Sherwood num- ber (Sh) is the internal diameter of the fiber.

II, Brenner, B.M. and Rector, F.C., Jr. (eds.), WB Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA, 1981. 463 Extracorporeal devices characteristic dimension in the dialysate Sherwood number is the hydraulic diameter, dH, defined by Equation 5.171 as (Yang and Cussler, 1986) d Cross sectional area Wetted perimeter H = ()4 Assuming the fibers are arranged on a square pitch, the following relationship can be devel- oped to express the relationship between the diameter of the hollow fiber (d), the dialyzer void fraction (ε), and the hydraulic diameter (dH): d dsquare pitchH = - æ è ç ö ø ÷ e e1 The apparent velocity of the dialysate through the void space between the fibers is equal to the dialysate volumetric flow rate (Qd) divided by the cross-sectional area of the void space. The cross-sectional area of the void space is equal to the void fraction (ε) times the cross-sectional area of the dialyzer itself. A little algebra provides the following result for the apparent dialy- sate velocity where Nfiber is the number of hollow fibers in the dialyzer: V Q N d d fiber = -()41 2 e epd The number of fibers in the dialyzer can be found from the given membrane area and the dimensions of a single hollow fiber; hence Nfiber = Amembrane/πdL. After performing the calcula- tions using the performance equations given in Table 9.4 for the cocurrent and countercurrent cases, the predicted urea dialyzer clearance is about 120 mL min−1 for the cocurrent dialyzer and about 133 mL min−1 for the countercurrent case. These urea clearance values are typical of what is observed in actual practice. In comparison, the urea clearance of the two normal kidneys is about 70 mL min−1. In general, the countercurrent dialyzer will provide the higher clearance, everything else being equal. This is because the countercurrent flow pattern maintains a relatively constant mass trans- fer driving force along the length of the dialyzer. The cocurrent pattern provides a larger driv- ing force at the entrance of the dialyzer, but this difference rapidly decreases along the length of the dialyzer, resulting in less overall mass transfer of the solute. Example 9.3 Ding et al. (2004) developed a double porous media model to describe the mass transfer in hollow fiber membrane hemodialyzers. They also provided experimental data using several hemodialyzers to validate their model. For the CT190G hemodialyzer module, the properties are as follows: Effective length 24 cm Membrane area 1.90 m2 Fiber inner diameter 200 μm Fiber outer diameter 230 μm Module diameter 3.5 cm 464 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering In their countercurrent flow experiments on this hemodialyzer module, they used a saline solution for blood and water for the dialysate fluid. The solution properties used were those of water at 37°C. The diffusivity of urea under these conditions is 1.82 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The overall mass transfer coefficient was found by fitting their model to the experimental data obtained for blood (Qb) and dialysate (Qd) flow rates equal to 400 mL min−1, which gave a KO equal to 0.001082 cm s−1. Ding et al. (2004) assumed this value of the overall mass transfer coeffi- cient is a constant in the flow rate ranges studied in their experiments. Using this information, calculate the predicted urea clearance for each of the flow rate conditions shown in the table. Solution For a blood flow of 300 mL min−1 and a dialysate flow of 200 mL min−1, we can calculate the extraction ratio using the countercurrent flow performance equation given in Table 9.4. The value of z is equal to 1.5, and the number of transfer units is given by N KA Q cm scm cm s T O b == ´ = - - 0 001082 19 000 5 411 12 31 ., .

Repeating this calculation for all of the combinations of the blood and dialysate flows given by Ding et al. (2004), we obtain the predicted clearance (CLpred) results shown in the table. Also shown in the table are the experimental clearances (CLexp) and the predicted clearances from their double porous media model (CLDPMM).

The average error between the CLexp and the predicted clearance (CLpred) using the much simpler countercurrent performance equation given in Table 9.4 is 3.96%. 9.4.6 A single-compartment model of urea hemodialysis Urea distributes throughout the total body water for an apparent distribution volume of about 40 L in a 70 kg human. The distribution volume (in liters) can also be estimated to be 58% of body weight (in kg) (Galletti et al., 1995). We can treat the body as a single well-mixed compartment and use the 465 Extracorporeal devices hemodialyzer performance equations to predict how the amount of urea within the body changes with time during hemodialysis. For some solutes, the solute removal from the hemodialyzer is so fast that the rate of solute trans- fer from the extravascular spaces into the plasma will be the rate-limiting step. For these cases, a two-compartment model may be needed to describe the kinetics of solute removal. The follow- ing references provide additional information on hemodialysis: Ramachandran and Mashelkar (1980); Colton and Lowrie (1981); Armer and Hanley (1986); Abbas and Tyagi (1987); Zelman (1987); Lee and Chang (1988); Lee et al. (1989); Shaoting et al. (1990); Capello et al. (1994); Galletti et al. (1995). An unsteady mass balance for urea within the apparent distribution is given by V dC dt mV kCapparent urea urea apparent te urea=-\u0000 (9.19) In Equation 9.19, \u0000murea is the body’s urea generation rate, which is assumed to be a constant value and is on the order of 10 g day−1. It is also assumed that the only elimination pathway for urea is the hemodialyzer. Therefore, Vapparent kte equals the urea hemodialyzer clearance. The solution to Equation 9.19 is given by C tC e m kV eurea urea kt urea te apparent ktte te() =+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ -() --0 1 \u0000 (9.20) where Curea 0 is the concentration of urea in the distribution volume at the start of dialysis. Once hemodialysis is completed, we then assume the kidney has no residual clearance for urea; hence, kte is equal to zero. Equation 9.19 still applies, and we find that during this time, the urea concentration will increase linearly with time after dialysis according to the following equation: C tC m V turea urea endof dialysis urea apparent () =+ æ è ç ö ø ÷ \u0000 (9.21) Example 9.4 Using the urea hemodialyzer clearance value for a countercurrent unit obtained from Example 9.2, calculate the time needed to reduce the urea concentration in the body by 60%. How long can one go before the next hemodialysis? Assume the maximum urea concentration is 75 mg dL−1 and the urea generation rate is 10 g day−1. Solution A 60% reduction in the urea concentration means that C /Curea urea 0 040= . . Other parameters needed to solve the problem are \u0000m gday gsurea == ´ -- -10 11610 14 1.

During the time of hemodialysis, the urea production rate is very low in comparison to the amount of urea removed by dialysis.

This result shows that hemodialysis will be required about 3–4 times per week. 9.4.6.1 Daily home hemodialysis Recently, daily home hemodialysis has become available for some patients. In this case, the treatment time is much shorter than at a hemodialysis center, on the order of two hours, but more frequent, e.g., 5–7 times per week. 9.4.7 Peritoneal dialysis An alternative approach for treating kidney failure is called continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialy- sis (CAPD) (Lysaght and Farrell, 1989; Lysaght and Moran, 1995). Unlike the hemodialysis tech- nique that was just described, CAPD has the advantage of the patient not being severely restricted by the regimen of multiple treatments per week at a hemodialysis center. Rather, the patient is responsible for performing a relatively simple maintenance process that can take place at home or even at work. The use of CAPD is growing rapidly. CAPD was used in about 4% of the total dialysis population in 1979 and now is used in about 15% of the dialysis population. CAPD is based on the addition to the peritoneal cavity of a sterile hypertonic solution of glucose and electrolytes. The peritoneal cavity is a closed space formed by the peritoneum, a membrane-like tis- sue that lines the abdominal cavity and covers the internal organs such as the liver and the intestines. The peritoneum has excellent mass transfer characteristics for a process like CAPD. The peritoneum has the appearance of a fairly transparent sheath that is smooth and quite strong. The surface area (S) 467 Extracorporeal devices of the peritoneum is about 1.75 m2. Its thickness ranges from 200 to over 1000 μm. The surface of the peritoneum presented to the CAPD dialysate solution consists of a single layer of mesothelial cells that is densely covered with microvilli or tiny hair-like projections. Beneath this layer of cells is the interstitium that has the characteristics of a gel-like material. Within the interstitium, there is a rich capillary network providing a total blood flow on the order of 50 mL min−1. The CAPD solution is added and later removed from the peritoneal cavity through an in-dwelling catheter. This process can also be automated such that all fluid exchanges are carried out by a pump- ing unit, even while the patient is asleep. This automated process is called automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). The intraperitoneal CAPD fluid partially equilibrates across the peritoneal membrane with waste products in the plasma. Excess water from the patient’s body is also removed by ultrafiltration across the peritoneal membrane as a result of osmotic gradients. Typically, four 2 L exchanges are made each day with an additional 2 L of water removed as a result of ultrafiltration. The average mass removal rate of a particular solute is given by the following equation: \u0000m VC t CAPD CAPD CAPD CAPD = (9.22) In this equation VCAPD represents the volume of the CAPD solution CCAPD is the final concentration of the solute in this solution The time the solution was in the peritoneal cavity is given by tCAPD. Recall that the clearance of a solute is equal to its mass removal rate divided by the solute concentration in the blood. Therefore, solute clearance during CAPD is given by CL m C VC tC CAPD CAPD blood CAPD CAPD CAPD blood == \u0000 (9.23) Since the CAPD solution is usually completely equilibrated with urea in the plasma, the urea clear- ance is then simply VCAPD/tCAPD. About 10 L of solution is used each day, which equates to a continu- ous urea clearance of about 7 mL min−1. The mass transfer characteristics of CAPD can be described using relationships we have already developed. For example, the ultrafiltration rate is given by Equation 6.69: QSLP RT CCPi blood CAPD i N i = 1 =- -() é ë ê ê ù û ú úåDs (9.24) CAPD usually begins with a solution containing about 4% glucose. The initial ultrafiltration rate for this solution is on the order of 20 mL min−1 and decreases rapidly with time as the glucose, ini- tially in the peritoneal cavity dialysate fluid, is removed by the blood. Since ΔP across the peritoneal membrane is small during CAPD and the osmotic pressure of the initial glucose solution is about 4300 mmHg, then the hydraulic conductance is on the order of 0.15 mL h−1 m−2 mmHg−1. 468 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The solute transport rate for species i is given by Equations 6.69 and 6.70, recognizing that initially significant quantities of solute may be transported by ultrafiltration represented by the first term in Equation 9.25: \u0000 \u0000m CQ PC CSCAPD ii mblood CAPD ii=-() +-()1 s (9.25) Typical values of the reflection coefficient and the permeability-surface area product for several solutes are summarized in Table 9.5. Mathematical models describing CAPD can also be developed to describe the time course of the treatment process. The patient is considered to be represented by a single well-mixed compartment of apparent distribution volume (Vapparent) and a solute concentration in the body (Cbody), which is assumed to be the same as the solute concentration in the blood (Cblood). The CAPD solution in the peritoneal cavity is in a much smaller variable volume (about 2 L at the start) represented by VCAPD and solute concentration CCAPD. The peritoneal membrane separates these two compartments. The peritoneal lymphatic system also removes fluid from the peritoneal cavity (Qlymph) at a rate of about 0.1 to as high as 10 mL min−1. During the initial phases of CAPD, the volume of fluid in the peritoneal cavity will increase due to the osmotic flow of water into the cavity; however, as time progresses and glucose is diluted and removed from the peritoneal cavity, the volume of fluid in the peritoneal cavity will decrease as a result of the lymphatic flow. Models for describing CAPD are reviewed by Lysaght and Farrell (1989). These models range from relatively simple analytical solutions to much more complex models that include the selective trans- port of solutes, ultrafiltration, and the effects of lymphatic flow. These models all require numeri- cal solutions. We will discuss two relatively simple analytical models for CAPD in the following discussion. 9.4.7.1 Constant volume model of CAPD The simplest analytical model neglects ultrafiltration and lymphatic flow and assumes that only the peritoneal dialysate concentration changes with time. This diffusion-only model, with the assumption that VCAPD is constant, limits the use of this approach to the constant volume phase (isovolemic) that occurs about an hour or so after the CAPD Table 9.5 Transport Properties of the Peritoneal Membrane Solute Molecular Weight Reflection Coefficient PmS, cm3 min−1 Urea 60 0.26 21 Creatinine 113 0.35 10 Uric acid 158 0.37 10 Vitamin B12 1,355 5 Inulin 5,200 0.5 4 β2 microglobulin 12,000 0.8 Albumin 69,000 0.99 Source: Lysaght, M.J. and Moran, J., Peritoneal dialysis equipment, in: The Biomedical Engineering Handbook, Bronzino, J.D. (ed.), CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL, 1995, pp. 1923–1935. 469 Extracorporeal devices process begins. For this diffusion-only CAPD model, the solute mass balance equation only needs to be written for the fluid in the peritoneal cavity: dV C dt V dC dt PS CC CAPD CAPD CAPD CAPD m body CAPD () == -() (9.26) This equation is easily integrated to obtain the following equations. In these equations, the initial concentration of the solute in the CAPD solution is given by CCAPD 0 : PS V t CC CC t m CAPD body CAPD body CAPD = - - () æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ ln 0 (9.27) C tC CC PSt V CAPD body body CAPD m CAPD () =- -() - æ è ç ö ø ÷ 0 exp (9.28) Equation 9.27 allows for the determination of the value of PmS, given information on the solute concentrations at a particular time. Equation 9.28 allows for the prediction of the solute concentra- tion in the CAPD dialysate solution as a function of time, assuming the transport properties of the peritoneal membrane are known. 9.4.7.2 A simple CAPD model that includes ultrafiltration A slightly more complex model than the one shown earlier can be developed that includes the effect of ultrafiltration (Garred et al., 1983). However, the solute concentration in the body is still assumed to be constant; the peritoneal mem- brane is not selective, i.e., the reflection coefficients are zero; and lymphatic flow is ignored. The solute balance for the CAPD solution for these conditions can be written as follows: dV C dt PS CC C dV dt CAPD CAPD m body CAPD body CAPD() =-()+ (9.29) The second term on the right-hand side, i.e., (Cbody(dVCAPD/dt)), represents the ultrafiltration flow that carries with it the solute from the body. An integration of this equation still requires knowledge of how VCAPD changes with time. This could be obtained from Equation 9.24; however, an analytical solution would then be difficult to obtain. If one assumes that the initial and final CAPD volumes are known, then this equation can be integrated using an average value of VCAPD to give the next two equa- tions, where VCAPD is the average volume defined as the mean of the initial and final CAPD volumes: PS V t VC C Vt CC t m CAPD CAPD body CAPD CAPD body CAPD = -() () - ()() é ë ln 00 êê ê ù û ú ú (9.30) C tC V Vt CC PSt V CAPD body CAPD CAPD body CAPD m CAPD () =- () -() - æ è 0 0 exp çç ö ø ÷ (9.31) Once again, Equation 9.30 can be used to estimate the mass transport properties of the peritoneal mem- brane from given values of the solute concentrations and volumes at a particular time. Equation 9.31 allows determination of the time course of the solute concentration in the CAPD dialysate solution. 470 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 9.4.8 Aquapheresis Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a very complex chronic disease in which the heart loses its ability to provide a sufficient flow of blood to meet the demands of the body. CHF is usually a result of myocardial infarctions (i.e., heart attack), heart disease such as cardiomyopathy, high blood pres- sure, and problems with the valves in the heart. Symptoms of CHF include shortness of breath (dys- pnea), venous swelling or congestion, coughing, swelling of the lower extremities, and difficulty during exercise. CHF severely affects the quality of life since there are frequent life-threatening episodes where plasma fluid volume increases significantly and fluid accumulates (congestion) in the lungs, peripheral tissues, and abdominal organs such as the liver. Because of the excess fluid in the body (fluid overload), treatment of CHF involves removing the excess sodium and water to achieve a proper fluid balance in the body. This can be achieved by treating the patient with a low-salt diet, restricting fluid intake, and using diuretic drugs, which increase urine production. However, in many cases these treatment methods periodically stop working and the patient requires hospitalization in order to make adjustments to their drug regi- men so that the excess water can be removed and other health issues can be addressed. However, some of these patients with frequent hospitalization have also developed a resistance to diuret- ics, and other means are used to remove the excess water. One approach for these cases is to use aquapheresis. Aquapheresis involves the use of hollow fiber membrane cartridges similar in some respects to those that are used in hemodialysis. However, in aquapheresis the goal is to only remove the excess salt and water. In this case, heparinized blood from the patient is pumped through the hollow fiber membrane cartridge and then returned to the patient. Water and salt are filtered across the membrane by ultrafiltration, and this fluid is collected in a bag and disposed. The flow rate of the water is controlled by the transmembrane pressure differences and by the prop- erties of the hollow fiber membrane. Equations 9.6 and 9.7 can be used to predict the filtration flow of the water as shown in Example 9.1. In aquapheresis, up to 500 mL of water can be removed per hour, and the average rate is about 250 mL h−1. The total treatment time for aqua- pheresis is about 24 h. 9.5 Blood oxygenators 9.5.1 Background Heart surgery oftentimes requires that the heart be stopped or arrested (cardioplegia). Cardioplegia can be achieved by infusing a cold (4°C) cardioplegic solution into the coronary circulation. Once the heart is arrested, blood is no longer pumped throughout the body and the blood is no longer oxygenated by the lungs. Blood flow to the chambers of the heart is also stopped, providing a dry and bloodless field for surgery. Over 700,000 open heart surgeries are performed in the United States every year (Federspiel and Henchir, 2004). Special devices called heart-lung machines or extracor- poreal blood pump-oxygenators (Richardson, 1987; Makarewicz et al., 1993; Galletti and Colton, 1995; Federspiel and Henchir, 2004) have been developed and used for over 50 years (Gibbon, 1954; Iwahashi et al., 2004) to replace the gas exchange function of the lungs and the pumping action of the heart during these open heart surgical procedures. 471 Extracorporeal devices Blood flow to the blood pump-oxygenator is usually collected into a reservoir by a roller or peristal- tic pump from the large systemic veins such as the vena cava or from the right atrium of the heart. This blood is then pumped through the oxygenator and returned to the body via the ascending por- tion of the aorta. Blood flow rates for a particular oxygenator are typically in the range of 0.5–7 L min−1. A mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide also passes through the blood oxygenator at flow rates between 5 and 10 L min−1. In order to meet the metabolic requirements of the body, the oxygenator will need to be able to deliver around 250 mL min−1 of oxygen and remove about 200 mL min−1 of carbon dioxide from the blood. These rates are based on body temperature and atmospheric pressure (BTP, 37°C and 1 atm). In addition, there are also blood suction devices to minimize the loss of blood and to keep the surgical field free of blood. The suctioned blood is collected and filtered before being pumped into the venous reservoir where it is then sent to the oxygenator. Patients are also given heparin to prevent the clotting of blood in the pump-oxygenator flow circuit. In addition, all of the blood-contacting surfaces of the flow circuit are coated with proprietary heparin or anticoagulant formulations to minimize the risk of blood clot formation and to minimize the amount of systemic heparin that is given to the patient. In addition to blood pump-oxygenators for heart surgery, much interest has also focused on the development of intravascular lung assist devices, or ILADs (Vaslef et al., 1989; Jurmann et al., 1992; Makarewicz et al., 1993; Fukui et al., 1994; Hewitt et al., 1998; Guzman et al., 2005), and microfluidic oxygenators to serve as an artificial placenta for newborns with respiratory problems (Rochow et al., 2014). ILADs are being used for the treatment of patients that suffer from adult respiratory distress syn- drome. ILADs consist of a bundle of hollow fiber membranes that are mounted on a catheter and then inserted into the vena cava. Pure oxygen is supplied within the hollow fibers by an external flow control system. Blood flows externally along the outer surfaces of the hollow fibers, and oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged. 9.5.2 Operating characteristics of blood oxygenators There are several important differences between the operational characteristics of the lungs and blood oxygenators. These are summarized in Table 9.6. The blood flow through the blood oxygen- ator is usually the same as that to the lungs since the blood oxygenator must provide the same level of blood oxygenation; that is increasing the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) of the venous blood from about 40 mmHg to the arterial pO2 of 95 mmHg. The capillaries in the lungs present the blood to the alveolar gas as a very thin film of blood with diffusional distances on the order of a few microns. This provides rapid gas transport in a very short time, typically a few tenths of a second. The total surface area available for oxygen transport in the lungs is about 140 m2. In a blood oxygenator, the blood mass transfer film thickness is governed by the number and thickness of the blood flow chan- nels, typically providing oxygen diffusional distances between the blood and the oxygen that are an order of magnitude larger than that found in the lungs. Also the blood contact time in an oxygenator is on the order of tens of seconds. In the lungs, the pO2 of the alveolar air is about 104 mmHg. The average oxygen partial pressure driving force in the lungs is therefore on the order of 40–50 mmHg. Carbon dioxide has a partial pressure (pCO2) of about 40 mmHg in the alveolar space, and its level in the blood varies from 472 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 40 mmHg in arterial blood to 45 mmHg in venous blood. Therefore, the driving force for carbon dioxide transport is only a few mmHg and considerably smaller than that for oxygen. However, this smaller driving force is offset by the much higher permeability of carbon dioxide through the respi- ratory membranes, which is about 20 times that for oxygen. One significant advantage of the blood oxygenator as compared to the lungs is the driving force for oxygen and carbon dioxide transport. In a blood oxygenator, humidified oxygen at atmospheric pressure can be used, resulting in a pO2 of about 713 mmHg [760 mmHg − 47 mmHg (water satu- ration pressure at 37°C) = 713 mmHg]. Also, little or no carbon dioxide is present in this gas, so the driving force for carbon dioxide transport is considerably higher. This results in a considerable reduction in the mass transfer surface area of the blood oxygenator. Therefore, although the trans- port of oxygen is not as efficient within a blood oxygenator, these high mass transfer driving forces allow the resting metabolic needs of the patient to be met using blood oxygenators with mass trans- fer surface areas in the range from 1 to 10 m2. 9.5.3 Types of oxygenators The design goal of a blood oxygenator is to present as large a surface area as possible between the blood and the oxygen-carrying gas stream. Several approaches have been developed to accomplish this, and they are summarized in Figure 9.6 (Iwahashi et al., 2004). Bubble oxygenators were the earliest systems developed for open heart surgery. Bubble oxygenators achieve the required surface area for gas exchange by the production within the blood of numerous small bubbles of gas. These gas bubbles are in direct contact with the blood and are typically several Table 9.6 Operational Characteristics of the Lungs and Blood Pump-Oxygenators Characteristic Lungs Blood Oxygenator Blood flow rate 5 L min−1 0.5–7 L min−1 Pressure head 12 mmHg 0–200 mmHg Blood volume 1 L 1–4 L Blood film thickness 5–10 μm 100–300 μm Length of blood flow channel 100 μm 2–30 cm Blood contact time 0.7 s 3–30 s Surface area for mass transfer 140 m2 1–10 m2 Gas flow rates 7 L min−1 2–10 L min−1 pO2 and pCO2 blood in 40 and 45 mmHg 40 and 45 mmHg pO2 and pCO2 blood out 95 and 40 mmHg 100–300 and 30–40 mmHg Gas pO2 and pCO2 in 149 and 0.3 mmHg 250–713 and 0–20 mmHg Gas pO2 and pCO2 out 120 and 27 mmHg 150–675 and 10–30 mmHg pO2 gradient 40–50 mmHg 650 mmHg pCO2 gradient 3–5 mmHg 30–50 mmHg Sources: Cooney, D.O., Biomedical Engineering Principles, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1976; Galletti, P.M. and Colton, C.K., Artificial lungs and blood-gas exchange devices, in: The Biomedical Engineering Handbook, Bronzino, J.D.

Because these bubbles contact the blood, they induce mechanical stresses on the RBCs, which can damage them. Of particular concern in the operation of bubble oxygenators is the removal of foam and gas bubbles prior to the return of the blood to the patient. This is achieved through the use of filters and defoaming sponges as the blood leaves the oxygenator. The design of bubble oxygenators is complicated by the complex nature of bubble motion. For example, bubbles exist in many different sizes, and they tend to break up and coalesce during their passage through the oxygenator. To avoid the problem with antifoaming and bubble removal, film oxygenators have also been devel- oped. In these systems, a film of blood is created on a surface that may be stationary or rotating. The blood film is then exposed directly to the gas. To increase the mass transfer rates, stationary films often employ irregular surfaces to enhance internal mixing of the blood film. Rotating disks whose bottom surface is in contact with a pool of blood create very thin films that are continuously renewed, resulting in the efficient exposure of the blood to the gas stream. Membrane oxygenators have for the most part now replaced the earlier bubble and film oxygenators. In these systems, the membrane physically separates the blood and gas streams. Membrane systems offer the advantage of minimizing the trauma to the blood that is created in direct contact systems such as bubble and film oxygenators. The membrane and the associated fluid boundary layers, how- ever, do present an additional mass transfer resistance. However, recent advances in membrane technology have resulted in membranes with significant oxygen and carbon dioxide permeabilities. The gas permeabilities for various membrane materials are shown in Table 9.7. Typical units of the thickness normalized membrane gas permeability ⌢ Pm( ) are mL (standard tem- perature and pressure [STP]) μm min−1 m−2 atm−1, where the STP conditions are for the pure gas at 0°C and 1 atm. The volumetric transport rate of gas (mL(STP) min−1) is then given by the following equation: N PMembrane surface area Gaspartial pressure Membr V m = ´()´ () ⌢ D aane thickness (9.32) Gas Blood Gas vent (a) Blood Gas(c) Blood Gas (b) Figure 9.6 Types of blood oxygenators.

The oxygen permeability for a 130 μm thick silicone membrane is about 215 mL (STP) min−1 m−2 atm−1 and that for carbon dioxide is about 1100 mL (STP) min−1 m−2 atm−1 (Cooney, 1976; Gray, 1981, 1984). Recent hollow fiber systems employ hydrophobic microporous polypropylene membranes. Because these membranes are hydrophobic and have very small pores, there is sufficient surface tension to prevent plasma infiltration. Hence, these pores are gas filled, resulting in significantly higher transport rates of oxygen and carbon dioxide than if the pores were filled with liquid. This can be seen by comparing in Table 9.7 the oxygen permeability through a column of air with that through a column of water of the same thickness. Therefore, these microporous hydrophobic membranes have very high gas permeabilities, and in most cases the resistance to the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide across these membranes is negligible in comparison to the resistance offered by the flowing blood. The hollow fiber membranes used in blood oxygenators typically have external diameters in the range of 250–400 μm with wall thicknesses in the range of 20–50 μm. The porosity of these membranes is in the range of 40%–60%, and the pores are typically on the order of 0.1 μm in diameter. These membrane-based systems come in a variety of configurations, e.g., flat plate, coil, and hollow fiber arrangements as shown earlier in Figure 9.1. Blood and gas stream contact- ing schemes can include cocurrent, countercurrent, and cross flow. Cross flow systems typically have the gas flowing through the lumen of the hollow fiber with blood flowing at right angles across the outer surface of the fibers. The cross flow of the blood results in a significant improve- ment in the performance as measured by gas exchange rates (Catapano et al., 1992; Vaslef et al., 1994; Wickramasinghe et al., 2002a,b, 2005; Federspiel and Henchir, 2004; Nagase et al., 2005; Wickramasinghe and Han, 2005).

Mathematical models such as the one shown in this section are also important for the evaluation of preliminary design calculations and for exploring the effects of operating conditions on device performance (Vaslef et al., 1994; Matsuda and Sakai, 2000; Nagase et al., 2005; Wickramasinghe and Han, 2005). The model is developed in a manner similar to that used earlier for hemodialysis; however, now we must make use of techniques developed in Chapter 7 to account for the binding of oxygen with hemoglobin. Figure 9.7 shows the mass balance model where now we assume countercurrent flow of the blood and gas streams. We also assume the total flow rates of these streams are unchanged; hence, Qg and Qb are constant. Cb and Cg are the bulk concentrations of oxygen on the blood (b) and gas (g) sides of the membrane, and Cb ¢ represents the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin. Cbm and Cgm are the corresponding oxygen concentration values at the membrane surface on the blood and gas sides, respectively. A shell balance on oxygen can be written as follows for the blood and gas sides of the membrane of length Δx: QC CQ CC kx CC QC QC k Wbb b x bb b xx bb bm gg xx gg x g b+() -+() =-() -= ¢¢ + + D D D WWx CCgg gmD-() (9.33) In these equations kb and kg are the blood- and gas-side mass transfer coefficients. W is the mem- brane area per unit length of membrane with the subscript denoting either the blood (b) or gas (g) side. This allows the application of this discussion to cylindrical fibers where the area normal to the direction of radial transport changes with radial position. For planar membranes we simply have that Wb = Wg = W.

A value for m can be estimated from Equation 7.57 or 7.58, and in general, m will depend on the local dissolved oxygen concentration or the pO2. Assuming that m is constant and evaluated at the average of the venous and arterial pO2 values, the blood-side equation simplifies to the following result: Qm dC dx kC CWb b bb bmb1+() =- -() (9.35) It is now convenient to convert from the oxygen concentration to the oxygen partial pressure in our description of the mass transfer process. Recall for blood that the partial pressure of oxygen is related to the dissolved oxygen concentration by Henry’s law, i.e., pO2b = HO2Cb. The value of HO2 for blood is 0.74 mmHg μM−1. On the gas side, pO2g = RTCg, using the ideal gas law. Our equations for the blood and gas sides may now be written as Qm dpO dx kW pO pO Q dpO dx kW pO pO b b bb bbm g g gg ggm 1 2 22 2 22 +() =- -() =-() (9.36) These equations can be rewritten in terms of the overall oxygen partial pressure driving force, i.e., pO2g − pO2b, through the definition of the overall mass transfer coefficient, KO, defined by 1 2 K H k W PW RTW kWO O b b STP mL b gg =+ + r (9.37) where ρSTP represents the density of the gas at STP conditions (0°C and 1 atm). The units on KO are typically mol cm−2 mmHg−1 s−1. KO is also now based on the membrane area on the blood side, i.e., Wb, where the log mean area of the membrane is given by W WW W/W L gb gb º - ()ln . As discussed earlier for blood oxygenators using microporous hydrophobic hollow fiber mem- branes, the membrane pores are gas filled and therefore have a permeability that is much larger than the blood-side mass transfer coefficient. Also, the solubility of the gases in blood is very low, which means that the gas-side mass transfer coefficient is also much larger than the liquid-side mass transfer coefficient. This means that the blood-side mass transfer resistance is usually controlling, and Equation 9.37 simplifies to K k H O b O » 2 (9.38) 477 Extracorporeal devices In terms of KO, the blood- and gas-side equations become Qm H dpO dx KW pO pO b O b Ob gb 1 2 2 22 +() =-() (9.39) Q RT dpO dx KpOpOW gg gbb 2 02 2=-() We can now solve these equations to provide an analytical solution to describe the performance of the oxygenator. First, we subtract the gas-side equation from the blood-side equation. This allows us to obtain a relationship between pO2g and pO2b: Qm H dpO dx Q RT dpO dx b O b gg1 0 2 2 2+() -= (9.40) This equation is then integrated from the entrance of the blood stream at x = 0 to any arbitrary value of x to give pOx Q Q RT H mpOx pO pOg b gO bb in g out 2 2 22 21() =+() ()-é ë ù û + (9.41) Now we can substitute this equation for pO2g in the blood-side equation (9.39) to give dpO dx KW H Qm Q Q RT H mpOp bO bO b b gO b 22 2 2 1 11= +() é ë ê ê ù û ú ú +()- é ë ê ù û ú + OO Q Q RT H mpOg out b gO b in 2 2 21-+() é ë ê ù û ú ì í ï îï ü ý ï þï (9.42) This equation can then be integrated to give the following result for the blood-side membrane area (Aoxygen) required for a given change in blood oxygenation: A pO pO oxygen b out b in= + + æ è ç ö ø ÷ a b bg bg ln 2 2 (9.43) where α, β, and γ are given by a= +()Qm KH b OO 1 2 b =+()- Q Q RT H m b gO2 11 (9.44) g= -+()pO Q Q RT H mpOg out b gO b in 2 2 21 The value of α will typically have units of cm2, β is dimensionless, and γ will be in mmHg. 478 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 9.5.4.1 Constant oxygen partial pressure in the gas phase The change in the gas-side pO2 is usu- ally not that great. Also, in an experimental study, the gas flow rate can be set at a high level to keep the pO2 change in the gas phase small. This means that we can treat the pO2 in the gas phase as a constant, i.e., pOpOpOpOg g avg g in g out 2 2 22 1 2 == +(). In this case, from Equation 9.39, we can then write the blood-side oxygen balance as Qm H dpO dx KW pO pO b O b Ob g avg b 1 2 2 2 2 +() =-() (9.45) Integrating Equation 9.45 over the length of the oxygenator gives the following equation for the blood-side membrane area: A ln pO pO pO pO oxygen g avg b in g avg b out= - - æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ a 2 2 2 2 (9.46) where α is given by the expression given in Equation 9.44. 9.5.4.2 Constant oxygen partial pressure in the gas phase and external cross flow of the blood over the hollow fibers Next, we consider an oxygenator where the gas flows within the hollow fibers and the blood flows outside and across in a direction perpendicular to the hollow fibers. We will also assume that the gas flow is sufficiently high that the gas concentrations are constant along the length of the hollow fiber and the controlling mass transfer resistance is in the blood. Figure 9.8 shows the mass balance model.

Next, we assume that m = dC′ b/dCb is a constant, divide through by Δx, and take the limit as Δx → 0; we then get Qm dC dx kW CCb b bb bg1+() =- -() ⌣ (9.48) Replacing the concentrations with the partial pressure of oxygen, we obtain Qm dpO dx kW pO pOb b bb b g avg1 2 2 2+() =- -() (9.49) Integrating Equation 9.49 over the length of the oxygenator gives the following equation for the blood-side membrane area: A Qm k pO pO pO pO oxygen b b g avg b in g avg b out= +() - - æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ 1 2 2 2 2 ln (9.50) 9.5.4.3 Calculation of the blood-side mass transfer coefficient Since the oxygen solubility in blood is low, the mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase is much larger than that on the blood side, and for practical purposes the gas-side mass transfer resistance can be ignored. In addition, for hollow fiber membranes where the pores are filled with the gas, the membrane permeability is also very large. This means that in most cases, the controlling mass transfer resistance resides in the blood and we only need to find kb. The calculation of the blood-side mass transfer coefficient (kb) can be found from correlations that typically have the following general form, i.e., Sh = aRebSc1/3. The Sherwood number in the mass transfer coefficient correlation for kb is defined as kbdH/Dblood, where Dblood is the diffusivity of oxy- gen in the whole blood and dH is the hydraulic diameter. The constants a and b, i.e., in Sh = aRebSc1/3, depend on the geometry and the flow pattern that is used in a particular hollow fiber blood oxygenator. For blood flowing inside the hollow fibers, the mass transfer coefficients for tube flow found in Table 5.1 can be used. For blood in external cross flow over a bed of hollow fibers, Vaslef et al. (1994) found that a ranged from 0.136 to 0.256 and b ranged from 0.751 to 0.832 in the three oxygenators they studied. Federspiel and Henchir (2004) averaged the values for a and b from a variety of correlations for external cross flow of blood in the literature and recommend a value of a equal to 0.524 and a value for b of 0.523. Wickramasinghe and Han (2005) for the cross flow of blood over mats of woven hollow fibers gave values of a and b as 0.8 and 0.59, respectively. Yang and Cussler (1986) in their study found for external cross flow over hollow fibers that a is equal to 0.90 and b is equal to 0.40 when the void fraction in the hollow fiber cartridge was 0.93. When the void fraction in the hollow fiber bundle was 0.30, the values of a and b were found to equal 1.38 and 0.34, respectively. 480 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The Reynolds and Sherwood numbers in the mass transfer correlations for kb are defined as follows, i.e., Re = ρVdH/μ and Sh = kbdH/Dblood, where dH is the hydraulic diameter, given by Equation 5.171, and Dblood is the oxygen diffusivity in whole blood. The average velocity (V) in the Re is the volu- metric flow rate of the blood divided by the open cross-sectional area normal to the flow. For the flow of blood within a cylindrical hollow fiber of inside fiber diameter (d), the average velocity of the blood is just 4Qb/π d2. However, for the external flow of the blood across and perpendicular to a bank of hollow fibers, V is the blood velocity in the space between the hollow fibers. Hence, v is defined as the blood volumetric flow rate (Qb) divided by the open area between the hollow fibers. This open area is equal to the device frontal area (Af) normal to the blood flow multiplied by the hollow fiber module void fraction, εmodule. Hence, we have that V = Qb/εmoduleAf. For the flow of blood within a cylindrical hollow fiber, the hydraulic diameter is the same as the inside fiber diameter (d). However, if the blood is flowing on the outside of the hollow fibers, this will require an understanding of the hollow fiber arrangement in order to calculate the wetted perim- eter of the flow path and the cross-sectional area normal to the flow path. In the case of blood flow across a bank of hollow fibers, the hydraulic diameter can be calculated by the following equation (Wickramasinghe and Han, 2005): d dH module module O= - e e1 (9.51) where εmodule is the void fraction of the hollow fiber module dO is the outer diameter of the hollow fibers The diffusivity of oxygen in whole blood with a % hematocrit of H can be estimated from Equation 9.52 (Katoh and Yoshida, 1972). This equation neglects the binding reactions between the oxygen and the hemoglobin: Dcms Hblood 21 52130 0092 10 --() =-()´.. (9.52) For blood with a 40% hematocrit, the value of Dblood is 1.76 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The diffusivity in the Schmidt number needs to account for the effect of oxygen binding with hemoglobin (Vaslef et al., 1994; Federspiel and Henchir, 2004; Wickramasinghe and Han, 2005). This means that we use an effective diffusivity in the Schmidt number, defined as follows, i.e., Sc = μ/ρDe = ν/De. To understand this phenomenon of how oxygen binding with hemoglobin affects the oxygen dif- fusivity in blood, consider the unsteady diffusion of oxygen across a stagnant layer of blood. We assume that only the oxygen dissolved in the plasma can diffuse since the hemoglobin resides within the red blood cells that are not moving since the blood is stagnant. Performing a shell balance on oxygen over a thin slice of blood from x to x + Δx, we can then write S x C t C t SD C x SD C x blood x blood xx D ¶ ¶ + ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ =- ¶ ¶ -- ¶ ¶ ¢ +D (9.53) In this equation, Dblood is the diffusivity of oxygen in whole blood, which is given by Equation 9.52. The dissolved oxygen concentration is given by C, and C′ represents the concentration of oxygen 481 Extracorporeal devices bound to hemoglobin. Now, assuming the dissolved and bound oxygen are in equilibrium and after dividing by Δx and taking the limit as Δx → 0, Equation 9.53 becomes ¶ ¶ + ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = ¶ ¶ + ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ =+ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ ¶ ¶ = ¢¢ ¢C t C t C t C C C t C C C t Db1 llood C x ¶ ¶ 2 2 (9.54) Note that in Equation 9.54, ∂C′/∂C is the slope of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, which was previously given by Equations 7.57 and 7.58. Letting m = ∂C′/∂C, Equation 9.54 can then be written as follows: ¶ ¶ = + ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ C t D m C x D C x blood e 1 2 2 2 2 (9.55) Hence, we find from this analysis that the effective diffusivity of oxygen (De) in blood that we use in the Schmidt number is given by D D m e blood= +1 (9.56) or in terms of Equations 7.57 and 7.58, we can write the effective diffusivity as D D HC dY dpO D nP HC pO P e blood OSAT blood n OSAT n n = + = + + ¢ ¢ - 1 12 2 50 2 2 1 50 ppOn 2 2 () (9.57) This approach has been found to work well in describing the oxygen mass transfer in blood oxygen- ators (Vaslef et al., 1994). As shown in Example 9.7, we can use the average pO2 of the blood in the oxygenator to determine the value of De from Equation 9.57. In the absence of oxygen binding to hemoglobin, the mass transfer coefficient in the blood k b without( ) would be proportional to (Sc = μ/ρDblood)1/3, whereas when we take the oxygen and hemoglobin bind- ing into account as discussed previously, the blood-side mass transfer coefficient (kb) is proportional to (Sc = μ/ρDe)1/3. The ratio of (kb) to k b without( )is then equal to (Dblood/De)1/3 = (1 + m)1/3.This means that the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in the blood enhances the blood-side mass transfer coef- ficient by a factor of E = (1 + m)1/3. Using Equation 7.58 to evaluate m, we have that kk Ek mk nP HC pO bb without b without b without n OSAT== +() =+ ¢11 13 50 2 / 22 1 50 2 2 13 n nnPpO - +() æ è ç çç ö ø ÷ ÷÷ / (9.58) At an average blood pO2 of 59.5 mmHg in the oxygenator, the value of m is equal to 28.2, which gives, according to Equation 9.58, a blood-side oxygen mass transfer coefficient enhancement fac- tor, i.e., E, of 3, which means that the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin increases the mass transfer coefficient by a factor of 3. 482 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 9.5.5 Analysis of a membrane oxygenator: Carbon dioxide transfer We also need to develop a similar set of equations for the transport of carbon dioxide in the oxygenator. Carbon dioxide can exist in blood in a variety of forms, such as a dissolved gas and in combinations with water, hemoglobin, and other proteins. Like oxygen, the total amount of carbon dioxide in the blood depends on its partial pressure, i.e., pCO2. The carbon dioxide dissociation curve shown in Figure 9.9 provides a relationship between the total amount of carbon dioxide in the blood and its pCO2. The ordinate expresses the volume of carbon dioxide gas as a percentage of the blood volume. The volume percents are based on body conditions (BTP) of 37°C and 1 atm of pure gas. For example, there is about 50 mL of carbon dioxide at BTP in each 100 mL of blood, i.e., 50 vol.%, at a pCO2 of about 42 mmHg. The change in the carbon dioxide concentration for normal blood is very narrow. For example, venous blood has a pCO2 of about 45 mmHg and a corresponding concentration of 52 vol.%. Arterial blood has a pCO2 of about 40 mmHg and a corresponding concentration of 48 vol.%. Figure 9.7 can also be used to write shell balances on the blood and gas sides for carbon dioxide. A set of equations similar to those given by Equation 9.39 are obtained, where m is now equal to zero. Henry’s law is also assumed to describe the relationship between the carbon dioxide concentration in the blood and its pCO2. The overall mass transfer coefficient, KO, is still given by Equation 9.37, recognizing that the physical properties of carbon dioxide are to be used. Hence, for carbon dioxide transport in the blood oxygenator we have Q H dpCO dx KpCO pCO Q RT dpCO dx KpCO pCO W W b CO b Og b gg Og b g 2 2 22 2 2 =-() =- 22b() (9.59) As was done for oxygen, the gas-side equation can be subtracted from the blood-side equation and the result integrated to provide the following expression relating pCO2g to pCO2b: pCO x Q Q RT H pCOx pCOpCOg b gCO bb in g o 2 2 22 2() = æ è ç ö ø ÷æ è ç ö ø ÷ ()-é ë ù û + uut (9.60) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80V (pCO2)CO2 in blood, vol.% pCO2 Carbon dioxide partial pressure, mmHgNormal body conditions Figure 9.9 Carbon dioxide blood solubility curve. 483 Extracorporeal devices This equation may be used in the blood equation (9.59) to obtain the following differential equation for pCO2b: dpCO dx KW H Q Q Q RT H b Ob CO b b gCO 2 2 2 1= æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ - æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú úú ì í ï îï +- æ è ç ö ø ÷æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú pCO pCO Q Q RT H pCO b g out b gCO b in 2 22 2 úú ü ý ï þï (9.61) When this equation is integrated over the length of the oxygenator, the following result is obtained for the blood-side membrane surface area needed for the required carbon dioxide removal: A pCO pCO carbon dioxide b out b in= + + é ë ê ù û ú ¢ ¢ ¢¢ ¢¢ a b bg bg ln 2 2 (9.62) The constants α′, β′, and γ′ are given by the next set of equations and have the same typical units as described earlier for oxygen: ¢ ¢ ¢ = = æ è ç ö ø ÷ - =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ a b g Q KH Q Q RT H pCO Q Q RT H b OCO b gCO g out b gC 2 2 1 2 OO b inpCO 2 2 æ è ç ö ø ÷ (9.63) Example 9.5 shows how to estimate the carbon dioxide Henry’s constant (HCO2). Example 9.5 Show that the observed Henry’s constant for carbon dioxide in blood for the physiological range of pCO2 is about 0.0022 mmHg μM−1. Solution First we define Henry’s constant (HCO2) by the following relationship: pCO2 = HCO2CCO2, where CCO2 is the total concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. Using the values obtained from Figure 9.9 at pCO2’s of 40 and 45 mmHg, we can calculate the corresponding values of HCO2, i.e., H mmHg mmHg vol mmHg vol CO2 40 40 48 0 833() == .% . .% H mmHg mmHg vol mmHg vol CO2 45 45 52 0 865() == .% . .% 484 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The average value of HCO2 in the physiological range of 40–45 mmHg is therefore 0.85 mmHg (vol.%)−1.

Next, we need to find how many moles of carbon dioxide there are in 1 mL of gas at BTP.

Mathematical models, such as the ones developed here or in the papers by Vaslef et al. (1994) and Wickramasinghe et al. (2005), can then be used to correlate the results and provide accurate measurements of the blood-side mass transfer coefficient. A calibrated model can then be used to explore operations under a wide range of operating conditions and assist in the optimal development of the device. For example, Vaslef et al. (1994) and Wickramasinghe et al. (2005) were able to assess the performance of cross flow hollow fiber oxygenators using water and other blood analogues. Subsequent tests using bovine blood provided excellent comparisons between their measurements and model predictions of the oxygen transport rates. The following examples will illustrate the calculation of the membrane area for a countercurrent hollow fiber membrane blood oxygenator and compare measured oxygen transport rates to the pre- dicted values for a cross flow hollow fiber membrane blood oxygenator. Example 9.6 Determine the hollow fiber membrane surface area for a blood oxygenator operating under the following conditions. Assume the fibers are made from microporous polypropylene. The gas membrane permeabilities are then based on diffusion through a stagnant layer of gas trapped 485 Extracorporeal devices within the pores of the membrane. The length of each fiber is 50 cm with a wall thickness of 50 μm. The inside diameter of a fiber is 400 μm. The blood flow rate through the lumen of the fibers in the device is 5,000 mL min−1, and the gas flow rate on the outside of the fibers is 10,000 mL min−1, both at 37°C and 1 atm. The pO2 of the entering blood is 40 mmHg, and the amount of oxygen transported into the blood as it passes through the oxygenator must equal 250 mL min−1 (BTP). The pCO2 of the entering blood is 45 mmHg, and the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the blood must equal 200 mL min−1 (BTP). The entering gas is satu- rated with water (pH2O = 47 mmHg at BTP) and contains a small amount of carbon dioxide in order to decrease the driving force for carbon dioxide transport so that a proper respiratory exchange ratio (R) can be achieved and for the calculated surface areas for oxygen and carbon dioxide to be the same. The respiratory exchange ratio is defined as the ratio of carbon diox- ide output to oxygen uptake and should be equal to 0.8. Estimate the surface area required to deliver 250 mL min−1 of oxygen to the blood and remove 200 mL min−1 of carbon dioxide under these conditions. The gas-side mass transfer resistance can be considered negligible because of the low solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide in blood. As discussed earlier, the permeability of these polypropylene hollow fiber membranes is also very high, resulting in negligible mass transfer resistance. Hence, the bulk of the mass transfer resistance is a result of the boundary layer formed within the blood. Solution The solution algorithm is based on first identifying all of the relevant dimensions and physical properties. There are also three unknowns that serve as iteration variables. The first iteration variable is the membrane area required for oxygen and carbon dioxide transport. The second iteration variable is the average value of the blood pO2 as it flows through the hollow fiber. This value is used to calculate, by Equation 7.58, the value of m, which is the slope of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. The average pO2 is chosen to make the oxygen mass transfer on the gas and blood sides balance. Hence, the amount of oxygen transferred to the blood must equal the amount of oxygen lost from the flowing gas. The third iteration variable is the pCO2 in the incoming gas. This value is adjusted to make the oxygen and carbon diox- ide membrane surface areas, calculated by Equations 9.43 and 9.62, result in the same value. In addition, an overall mass balance on oxygen and carbon dioxide is performed such that their respective transport rates are 250 and 200 mL min−1 at BTP. To achieve these gas trans- port rates, the calculation gives a pO2 of the blood exiting the hollow fibers of 90 mmHg and a pCO2 of 41.55 mmHg. Once the three iteration variables are assumed, i.e., Amembrane, pO b avg 2 , and pCO g in 2 , the calculation approach is then to calculate the value of m by Equation 7.58. From this value of m, the effective diffusivity of oxygen in blood is found from Equation 9.57 using the assumed pO b avg 2 . Next, the number of hollow fibers based on the assumed membrane area is determined, i.e., Nfibers = Amembrane/πdoutsideL, where Amembrane is the assumed membrane area, doutside is the external fiber diameter, and L is the fiber length. Knowing the number of hollow fibers, the average velocity of blood in a given hollow fiber can be found, i.e., Vblood = 4Qblood/Nfibersπd2, where Qblood is the total volumetric flow rate of the blood and d is the internal diameter of a hollow fiber. In this case, the velocity was found in the converged solution to be 23.2 cm s−1. Next, the value of Re and Sc are found, and from these, the blood- side mass transfer coefficient can be found from Equation 5.169. The pO2 in the exiting gas can then be found from Equation 9.41, which in this case is found to be 664.8 mmHg. Next, the surface area of the membrane for oxygen transport is found from Equation 9.43. 486 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering This process is then repeated for carbon dioxide and ends with the calculation of the mem- brane area required for carbon dioxide transport using Equation 9.62. For carbon dioxide, it is found that the exiting pCO2 in the gas is equal to 44.26 mmHg. Following this, the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide transport is calculated from an overall mass balance for the gas and for the blood. The surface areas for oxygen and carbon dioxide transport must also come out to be the same for each respective gas, i.e., Amembrane = Aoxygen = Acarbon dioxide. In addi- tion, the oxygen and carbon dioxide mass balances must be equal between the gas and blood phases. If the solution has not converged in this manner, then adjustments need to be made to the three iteration variables until convergence is achieved. In this case, the membrane area required for oxygen and carbon dioxide transport was found to equal 2.25 m2. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the feed gas was found to be 29.1 mmHg, and the average pO2 used for calculating the value of m was found to be 59.5 mmHg. The respiratory exchange ratio also equals 0.80. Example 9.7 Vaslef et al. (1994) measured the oxygen transport rate in a Sarns SMO1 oxygenator as a function of the blood flow rate. The oxygenator contained hollow fibers with an outer diameter of 290 μm. The blood flowed external and perpendicular to the hollow fibers. The blood was obtained from cows and the properties of the blood were C Mn PmmHgHSat ¢ == ==7800 285291 3750m ,. ,. ,%. The blood entering the oxygenator had an oxygen saturation of about 59%. Pure oxygen at a pO2 of 760 mmHg flowed within the hollow fibers. The total surface area of the hollow fibers available for oxygen transport was 1.87 m2, and the void space, i.e., εmodule, within the oxygen- ator module was 0.576. The frontal area (Af) normal to the blood flow was 36.88 cm2, and the blood flow path was 9.5 cm in length. Calculate the oxygen transport rate for blood flow rates of 1.41, 3.19, and 4.86 L min−1. The measured values of the oxygen transport rates for these blood flows are 113.1, 234.9, and 313.2 mL min−1 (BTP), respectively. Use the mass transfer correlation they developed using water, which says that Sh = 0.136Re0.832Sc1/3. Solution Since the blood is in external cross flow over a bank of hollow fibers, we can use Equation 9.50 to find the change in the oxygenation of blood flowing through the oxygenator. Hence, pOpOpOpOeb out g avg g avg b in Ak Qm oxygenb b 2 22 2 1 =- -() - +() (A) Using this equation to guide our calculations, we have from the problem statement that pOmmHgg avg 2 760= , and we can use the % saturation of the incoming blood to calculate from the Hill equation, for the given values of n and P50, the value of pO mmHgb in 2 33= . Next, we need to calculate the value of kb, and the calculation will be shown for the highest flow rate, which is 4.86 L min−1.

Next, we calculate the Schmidt number, taking into account the oxygen transport enhancement due to oxygen binding with hemoglo- bin. The effective diffusivity of oxygen in the blood is given by Equation 9.57 where the pO2 is based on the average pO2 of the blood in the oxygenator. Since pO b out 2 is not known, we have to first assume a value of pO b avg 2 , calculate De from Equation 9.57, find pO b out 2 from Equation A, and then update pO b avg 2 , which is equal to 1 2 22pO pOb in b out+(). This process is repeated until con- vergence is attained. For pO mmHgb avg 2 52= , we calculate De from Equation 9.57, which gives D D m D nP HC pO PpO e blood blood n oxygenSAT n nn = + = + +() = ¢ -1 1 4 50 2 1 50 2 2 ..110 72 1´ --cm s From this value of De, we obtain a Sc = μ/ρDe = 69,240. Also, in the above calculation we obtain an m = 42.6. From the given mass transfer coefficient correlation, i.e., Sh = 0.136Re0.832Sc1/3, we then obtain a Sh = 22.31.

An enzyme is a protein that acts as a biochemical catalyst and offers great specificity in terms of the types of chemical species or substrates it acts on. For example, Qiao et al. (2011) describe an enzymatic bioreactor to assist in the treatment of leukemia by remov- ing a key cancer cell nutrient, l-asparagine, from the patient’s blood. Enzymes are usually named after the substrate whose reaction is catalyzed. For example, the enzyme that hydrolyzes the substrate urea is called urease. Note that the suffix -ase is usually added to a portion of the name for the substrate the enzyme acts on. 489 Extracorporeal devices Figure 9.3 shows several reactor arrangements that are possible when an enzyme is attached to or immobilized within a solid support. Enzyme immobilization offers several advantages. First, immo- bilization keeps the enzyme out of the bulk solution, which in the case of blood returning to the body, could be harmful or result in an allergic reaction to the foreign protein of the enzyme (Qiao et al., 2011). Second, immobilization offers the potential to reuse an enzyme, which may in fact be quite expensive. Finally, in many cases, the enzyme is stabilized (less labile) when immobilized, retaining its activity for longer periods of time. 9.6.2 Examples of medical application of immobilized enzymes One example where immobilized enzyme reactors have been proposed is in the treatment of neo- natal jaundice (Lavin et al., 1985; Sung et al., 1986). Newborns tend to have higher levels of the greenish-yellow pigment bilirubin than those found in adults. Bilirubin is a natural product derived from red blood cells after they have lived out their lifespan of about 120 days. Bilirubin is formed from the heme portion (the four pyrrole rings) of the hemoglobin molecule after the removal of the iron. The bilirubin binds to plasma albumin for transport to the liver where it is finally excreted from the body in the bile fluids. The fetus’s bilirubin readily crosses the placenta and is removed by the mother’s liver. However, in the period after birth, the infant’s liver is not fully functional for the first week, resulting in increased levels of plasma bilirubin. In some cases, the infant’s bilirubin levels are sufficiently high, result- ing in a jaundiced (yellow) appearance to the skin. High levels of plasma bilirubin can be toxic to a variety of tissues, and in these cases jaundiced infants are commonly treated by phototherapy or blood transfusions. In phototherapy, the infant is placed under a blue light that converts the bilirubin to a less toxic by-product. Phototherapy through the skin is not capable of controlling cases of severe jaundice. However, blood transfusions can replace the infant’s blood with adult blood, effectively diluting the infant’s plasma bilirubin levels. However, blood transfusions pose their own risk, par- ticularly infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. An alternative approach to the treatment of neonatal jaundice is the use of a bilirubin-specific enzyme for the removal of bilirubin from the infant’s blood (Lavin et al., 1985; Sung et al., 1986). The enzyme bilirubin oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of bilirubin according to the following reac- tion stoichiometry: BilirubinO BiliverdinH O+® + 1 2 22 (9.64) Calculations indicate that the amount of oxygen needed to convert all of the bilirubin found in the blood is about 100 times less than the actual oxygen content of blood. Therefore, no external sup- ply of oxygen is needed within the enzyme reactor to carry out this reaction. Biliverdin itself is much less toxic than bilirubin and in fact is further oxidized by bilirubin oxidase to other less toxic substances. Experiments using a water-jacketed reactor (much like that in Figure 9.3a) containing bilirubin oxidase covalently attached to agarose beads showed that plasma bilirubin levels in rats decreased by 50% after 30 min of treatment. The rat’s blood was recirculated through the 6 mL reactor volume at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. Clearly, these results indicate that an immobilized bilirubin oxidase reactor could be an approach for the treatment of neonatal jaundice. It also shows the feasibility of using immobilized enzyme reactors for the specific removal of a harmful substance present in the blood. 490 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Cells found in the liver and other organs carry out a wide variety of life-sustaining enzymatic reac- tions. There is considerable interest in using these cells or their enzymes to treat liver failure and other enzyme deficiency diseases. The discussion here focuses on the use of just the key enzymes. The use of immobilized cells as bioartificial organs, perhaps using liver cells (hepatocytes), is dis- cussed in Chapter 11. However, it is important to recognize that some of the techniques used in this chapter to design immobilized enzyme reactors are directly applicable to systems that employ immobilized cells. Another example of an immobilized enzyme reactor that we will look at in considerably more detail is that for the removal of heparin (Bernstein et al., 1987a,b; Ameer et al., 1999a,b). Recall that hepa- rin is used as an anticoagulant in extracorporeal treatments such as hemodialysis and blood oxygen- ators. Heparin is a large negatively charged conjugated polysaccharide molecule that is produced by many types of cells in the body. By itself, heparin has little anticoagulant activity at the typical concentrations found in blood. However, in some regions of the body such as the liver and lungs, it is produced in greater amounts. Therefore, heparin has an important role in preventing blood clots in the slow-moving venous blood flow entering the capillaries of the lungs and liver. By combin- ing with antithrombin III, it increases by several orders of magnitude the ability of antithrombin to remove thrombin. Thrombin is an enzyme that converts the plasma protein fibrinogen into fibrin, leading to the fibrous mesh-like structure characteristic of a blood clot. Therefore, this synergistic combination of heparin with antithrombin III results in a powerful anticoagulant. Over 20 million extracorporeal procedures using heparin are performed each year, and in about 15% of these, complications due to heparin arise. Certainly, the removal of heparin from the blood before it is returned to the body could significantly improve the safety of these procedures. The enzyme heparinase has the ability to degrade heparin into less harmful by-products, and one could envision an immobilized heparinase reactor for the removal of heparin from the blood returning to the patient’s body. 9.6.3 Enzyme reaction kinetics Our goal now is to develop relationships that can be used to describe the rates or kinetics of chemical reactions that are catalyzed by enzymes. A description of the enzyme reaction kinetics will allow us to develop mathematical models for immobilized enzyme reactors that can be used to analyze experimental data, provide information for scale-up of our devices, and explore the effects of operat- ing conditions on device performance. The heparinase reactor described previously will be used as a model reaction system for these discussions. The successful development of an immobilized enzyme reactor requires knowledge of the enzyme kinetics, an understanding of the effects on the observed reaction rate of reactant or substrate diffu- sion, and a design equation for the specific reactor that is used (Fogler, 2005). Each of these aspects is discussed in greater detail in the following discussion. First, we need to define the kinetics or rate of the enzyme reaction and how it depends on the concen- tration of the substrate (reactant). This usually entails defining the free enzyme kinetics (enzyme in solution and not on a solid support) and the kinetics after the enzyme has been immobilized on the support material. In some cases, immobilization has no effect on the intrinsic activity of the enzyme, i.e., relative to its rate in solution. However, in most cases, the immobilization of the enzyme can significantly alter the kinetics of the conversion process. 491 Extracorporeal devices Generally, the kinetics of enzyme reactions are described by the Michaelis-Menten equation. The Michaelis-Menten equation can be derived by assuming that the conversion of substrate to product occurs in two steps, i.e., StepE SE S StepE SE P 1 2: : +« * * ®+ (9.65) In the first step, the substrate (S) combines with the enzyme (E) to form an enzyme-substrate com- plex (E*S). In the second step, the enzyme-substrate complex (E*S) is converted into product (P) and free enzyme (E), which is then available to recombine with substrate. The rate-controlling step in this reaction process is assumed to be the conversion of the enzyme-sub- strate complex to product as given by step 2 in Equation 9.65. Accordingly, it is therefore assumed that the reaction forming the enzyme-substrate complex, i.e., step 1 in Equation 9.65, is at equilib- rium. The rate of the enzyme reaction is then given by r dS dt dP dt kE SS cat=- == * (9.66) where kcat is a first order rate constant that relates the reaction rate (rS) to the concentration of the enzyme- substrate complex, i.e., E*S. S and P are the respective concentrations of the substrate and the product. From step 1 of Equation 9.65, we can define the enzyme-substrate dissociation constant (recip- rocal of the equilibrium constant) as Km = SE/E*S and then E*S = SE/Km with the result that Equation 9.66 becomes r dS dt dP dt k SE K S cat m =- == (9.67) Letting E0 represent the total concentration of the enzyme, then E0 must equal the sum of the free enzyme concentration, i.e., E, and the amount of enzyme bound to substrate, i.e., E*S. Hence, we can write that E0 = E + E*S. Since E*S = SE/Km, we then have that E = KmE0/(Km + S). Substituting this result into Equation 9.67 then gives us an expression for the rate of the enzyme reaction as r kE S KS VS KS S cat mm = + = + 0max (9.68) where the reaction rate, rS, has units of moles or mass/((reaction volume)time). S represents the sub- strate or reactant concentration in units of moles or mass per volume. Vmax represents the maximum reaction rate for a given total enzyme concentration E0 in Units/(reaction volume); hence, we see that Vmax = kcatE0, and kcat is the reaction rate constant in moles or mass/Units time. Enzyme activity is commonly expressed in terms of Units (U), and for heparinase, a unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to degrade 1 mg of heparin h−1. The actual amount or mass of enzyme needed is dependent on the enzyme purity and is usually reported as so many units of activity per milligram of enzyme. Km is the Michaelis constant and is equal to the substrate con- centration at which the reaction rate is equal to one-half the maximum rate (Vmax). 492 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering It is important to note that at a high substrate concentration, the reaction rate saturates at Vmax because in total there are not enough available free enzyme molecules for the substrate reaction. The reaction rate is then independent of the substrate concentration and is therefore said to be zero order in the substrate concentration, i.e., rS = VmaxS0. At low substrate concentrations (S ≪ Km), the reac- tion rate is linearly proportional to the substrate concentration and is therefore said to be first order in the substrate concentration, i.e., rS = Vmax S1. Example 9.8 The following table of data was obtained (Bernstein et al., 1987b) for the kinetics of heparin degradation by heparinase in solution at 37°C and a pH of 7.4. From these data, determine the values of Km and kcat.

Bioeng., 30, 239, 1987b. Solution Note that it is convenient for this type of analysis to divide the enzyme reaction rate by the corresponding enzyme concentration, thus expressing the rate on a per unit amount of enzyme that is present in the reactor. One unit of heparinase (1 U) is defined as the amount of enzyme required to degrade 1 mg heparin h−1. Hence, we can rewrite Equation 9.68 as R r E kS KS S cat m == +0 493 Extracorporeal devices and this equation can then be inverted and rearranged to give 11 1 R K kS k m cat cat = æ è ç ö ø ÷ + This equation shows that if we plot the data in the table as 1/R versus 1/S, the plot should be linear with an intercept equal to 1/kcat and a slope equal to Km/kcat. This is called the Lineweaver-Burk method for analyzing enzyme reaction data. Using this method on the data in the table for heparin degradation by heparinase, we find that Km = 0.078 mg mL−1 and kcat = 0.891 mg U−1 h−1. As shown in Figure 9.10, we find that the Michaelis-Menten model provides an excellent representation of the heparin degradation kinetics. 9.6.4 Reaction and diffusion in immobilized enzyme systems When an enzyme is immobilized within a supporting structure, the substrate has to diffuse into the material in order to come into contact with the immobilized enzyme. Because the substrate diffuses and then reacts within the support structure, a concentration gradient is established within the sup- port structure, and the reaction rate depends on location. A reaction-diffusion model is therefore needed to describe how the substrate diffuses through the porous support particle and reacts through the action of the immobilized enzyme. The description of the reaction and diffusion process is also dependent on the geometry of the supporting structure for the enzyme, and here we will assume it is spherical. Extensions to other support geometries are straightforward once a given geometry has been examined in detail (Aris, 1957). Diffusion through the support material also requires that we know the substrate diffusivity (DAB) in the bulk or free solution, which is contained within the porous structure of the immobilized enzyme particle. We also need to know how the solute diffusivity is affected by the properties of the support 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 1/S, mL mg–11/R, U h mg–1 Figure 9.10 Lineweaver-Burk plot. 494 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering itself, specifically the porosity, pore size, and tortuosity. For substrates that have molecular dimen- sions that are comparable to the pore size, we will also need to include the effects of steric exclusion and hindered diffusion as discussed earlier in Chapter 6. These factors combine to define the effec- tive diffusivity (De) of the substrate in the support particle, as given by D D e AB r=W e t (9.69) In this equation, ε represents the porosity of the support, τ is the tortuosity of the pores, and ωr rep- resents the reduction of the substrate diffusivity due to the proximity of the pore wall as given by Equation 6.13. Figure 9.11 illustrates a spherical immobilized enzyme particle. Within this porous spherical par- ticle, we define a shell volume of thickness Δr, which contains a uniformly distributed immobilized enzyme. We can write the following steady-state shell balance on the substrate: 4 44 22 2pp prD dS dr rD dS dr rr VS KS e rr e r m+ -= + æ è ç ö ø ÷ D D max (9.70) In Equation 9.70, S is the concentration of the substrate within the fluid-filled pores of the enzyme particle. Also, the enzyme reaction rate is defined in terms of the total volume of the enzyme par- ticle. This equation states that the amount of substrate reacted within the shell volume is equal to the difference in the amount of substrate entering and leaving the shell volume by diffusion. After dividing by 4πΔr and taking the limit as Δr approaches zero, we obtain the reaction-diffusion equa- tion for the substrate in the spherical enzyme particle: D ds dr D r ds dr VS KS e e m 2 2 2 += + max (9.71) The boundary conditions (BCs) are BC r dS dr BC rR SKSbs 10 0 2 :, :, == == (9.72) R r r+∆r Sbs S Pore Immobilized enzyme Figure 9.11 Shell balance on a spherical immobilized enzyme particle. 495 Extracorporeal devices In BC2 of Equation 9.72, K represents the substrate partition coefficient, which may include effects other than simple steric exclusion, e.g., electrostatic attraction or repulsion due to the presence of surface charges on the substrate and the particle. The partition coefficient is defined as the ratio of the substrate concentration on the pore side of the support surface (S) to that on the surface on the bulk side (Sbs) as shown in Figure 9.11. The substrate concentration at the surface of the support (Sbs) may also differ from the bulk substrate concentration (Sb) because of external mass transfer effects. This is discussed later. The solution of Equations 9.71 and 9.72 is facilitated through the definition of the following dimen- sionless variables: s′ = S/KSbs and r′ = r/R. On substitution of this dimensionless substrate concentra- tion and radial dimension, we obtain ds dr r ds dr s s 2 2 22 9 1 ¢ ¢¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ += + f b (9.73) The dimensionless boundary conditions are given by BC r ds dr BC rs 10 0 21 1 :, : ¢ ¢ ¢¢ == == (9.74) Two additional parameters, ϕ and β, also result: f b = é ë ê ù û ú = RV KD SK K me bs m 3 12 max / (9.75) The quantity ϕ is especially important in reaction-diffusion problems and is known as the Thiele modulus. The square of this quantity represents the ratio of the substrate reaction rate to its diffu- sion rate. Its magnitude allows one to determine whether the overall reaction rate is reaction lim- ited (small ϕ, minimal intraparticle substrate concentration gradient) or diffusion limited (large ϕ, significant intraparticle substrate concentration gradient). β is a dimensionless Michaelis constant. Large values of β indicate a zero order reaction, whereas β → 0 indicates a first order reaction. The factor R/3 is the ratio of the support volume (Vp) to its external surface area (Ax). For irregularly shaped particle geometries, we can replace R/3 with this ratio for the particle, i.e., Vp/Ax. Aris (1957) has shown that if Vp/Ax is used as the characteristic dimension for irregularly shaped particles, then the solutions describing the reaction and diffusion in these particles are, for the most part, indepen- dent of the particle shape. 9.6.5 Solving the immobilized enzyme reaction-diffusion model The solution to Equation 9.73 for the dimensionless substrate concentration profile in the immo- bilized enzyme support is usually defined in terms of the effectiveness factor represented by the symbol η. Because of substrate reaction and diffusional effects, the substrate concentration will 496 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering generally decrease in the radial direction as one enters the support. This radial decrease in substrate concentration in the support will result in a decrease in the volume-averaged reaction rate for the support in comparison to the reaction rate that would be possible if the substrate concentration was uniform throughout the support and equal to its surface concentration at the pore mouth. The effec- tiveness factor is used to describe this decrease in the observed reaction rate and is defined by the following expression: h = Observed reaction rate Reaction rate without internal diffuusion effects RD dS dr R VS KS e rR rR m rR = + æ è ç ç ö ø ÷ ÷ = = = = 4 4 3 1 2 3 p p max ++() ¢ ¢ ¢= b f ds dr r1 23 (9.76) It is also important to point out that η, which depends on Sbs, will generally depend on position within the reactor due to consumption of the substrate as it flows through the reactor. Hence, the solution for η will be dependent on the local value of Sbs, which is found by the solution of the reactor design equation for the type of reactor being used. For the special case of a well-mixed reactor, also known as a continuous stirred tank reactor, the substrate concentration is uniform throughout the reactor volume, so there will only be one value of the effectiveness factor, which will depend on Sbs. The effectiveness factor (η) varies from zero, i.e., diffusion limited, with a steep intraparticle con- centration gradient, to one, i.e., reaction limited, with little change in the intraparticle concentration. The determination of the effectiveness factor using the nonlinear Michaelis-Menten rate equation requires a numerical solution of Equations 9.73 and 9.74 for a given value of β. An approximate solution for the effectiveness factor in a spherical enzyme particle for Michaelis-Menten kinetics has been obtained using a new approach known as the homotopy perturbation method, in which Ananthaswamy and Subha (2014) showed that the effectiveness factor in a spherical immobilized enzyme particle exhibiting Michaelis-Menten kinetics can be approximated by h b f b f b f = + + + æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ - é ë ê ê ê ê ê ù û ú ú ú ú ú 11 1 3 1 1 3 tanh (9.77) Ananthaswamy and Subha (2014) also showed that the intraparticle concentration profile is approxi- mately given by ¢ ¢ ¢ = + æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ + æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ s r r sinh sinh 3 1 3 1 f b f b (9.78) 497 Extracorporeal devices Example 9.9 Estimate the effectiveness factor for the case where the Thiele modulus (ϕ) is 6 and the dimen- sionless Michaelis constant (β) is 4. Assume the particle is spherical and the kinetics are described by the Michaelis-Menten model. Solution We can use Equation 9.77 to estimate the effectiveness factor for these conditions: h b f b f b f = + + + æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ - é ë ê ê ê ê ê ù û ú ú ú ú ú = + + 11 1 3 1 1 3 14 6 1 14tanh tanh 336 14 1 36 0 326 ´ + æ è ç ö ø ÷ - ´ é ë ê ê ê ê ù û ú ú ú ú = . The numerical solution presented graphically by Ananthaswamy and Subha (2014) gives a value of η ≈ 0.33. 9.6.6 Special case of a first order reaction If Km > KSbs or β = 0, then the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model becomes that of a first order reac- tion. For a first order reaction, we replace Vmax/Km in the definition of the Thiele modulus with the first order rate constant, i.e., k. Note that for a first order reaction, the effectiveness factor is indepen- dent of the particle surface concentration and hence position in the reactor. 9.6.6.1 Spherical enzyme particle Equations 9.73 and 9.74 can be solved analytically when β = 0, resulting in the following relationship between η and ϕ. Note that the same result is also obtained from Equation 9.77 by setting β = 0: h ff f =- æ è ç ö ø ÷ 11 3 1 3tanh (9.79) where f= Rk De3 (9.80) This relationship between the effectiveness factor and the Thiele modulus for a first order reaction is also shown in Figure 9.12. 9.6.6.2 Cylindrical enzyme particle For a cylindrically shaped enzyme particle, where the length of the particle is much bigger than the radius, we have for the effectiveness factor (Aris, 1957) h f ff = () () I I 1 0 2 2 (9.81) 498 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering and the Thiele modulus is defined as f= æ è ç ö ø ÷ Rk De2 12/ (9.82) where k = Vmax/Km. In Equation 9.81, I0 and I1 are modified Bessel functions of the first kind, of zero order and first order, respectively. 9.6.6.3 Flat plate enzyme particle For a large thin slab of total thickness 2L, we have for the effectiveness factor (Aris, 1957) h f f = ()tanh (9.83) and the Thiele modulus is defined as f= æ è ç ö ø ÷L k De 12/ (9.84) where k = Vmax/Km. Example 9.10 For the conditions in Example 9.9, calculate the effectiveness factor assuming the enzyme reaction described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics can be approximated as a first order reaction. Do this for spherical, cylindrical, and slab geometries. Solution The Thiele modulus is equal to 6, and since we assume the reaction is first order, β = 0. From Figure 9.12, we see that the effectiveness factor is about 0.16. From Equations 9.79, 9.81, and 9.83, we can calculate the values of the effectiveness factor for the sphere, the cylinder, and the slab. 0.1 1 10 100 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 ϕ Thiele modulusη(ϕ)Eﬀectiveness factor Figure 9.12 Effectiveness factor for a first order reaction. 499 Extracorporeal devices As shown in the table, all three values of the effectiveness factor are basically the same, which shows that for these common shapes, and for a first order reaction, the effectiveness factor has the same dependence on the Thiele modulus when the Thiele modulus is defined with a characteristic length of Vp/Ax; hence, f= VA kDpx e// . Enzyme Particle Geometry Effectiveness Factor, η Sphere 0.1574 Cylinder 0.16 Slab 0.167 We also see from Equations 9.79, 9.81, and 9.83 that for large values of ϕ, the value of η approaches 1/ϕ, which in this case for a ϕ = 6 gives an asymptotic η ≈ 0.167. 9.6.7 Observed reaction rate With the effectiveness factor known, we can write the observed reaction rate for the immobilized enzyme as follows: r VKS KKS s bs mbs = + h max (9.85) where Sbs is the substrate concentration at the support surface η accounts for the reduction in the reaction rate due to the internal substrate concentration gradient 9.6.8 External mass transfer resistance The flow of blood or other fluids around the immobilized enzyme support results in the formation of a thin boundary layer of fluid along the surface of the enzyme particle. This boundary layer provides an additional resistance for mass transfer that must be accounted for. An external mass transfer coef- ficient (km) is defined to account for this flow-induced external mass transfer resistance. Conservation of mass requires, for a given particle, that the following steady-state relationship hold between the external mass transfer rate and the reaction rate within the support: 4 4 3 23pp hRk SS R VKS KKS mb bs bs mbs -() = + æ è ç ö ø ÷ max (9.86) This equation can be solved for the substrate concentration on the surface of the particle (Sbs) in terms of the bulk substrate concentration (Sb). Recall it is this surface concentration that is used in the calculation of the effectiveness factor, as discussed earlier. From Table 5.1, the following equation describes the external mass transfer coefficient in packed beds containing immobilized enzyme particles: k V dV D m particle AB0 0 0420 67 117= æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ -- . .. r m m r (9.87) 500 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering This equation is also equivalent to Sh = 1.17 Re0.58 Sc0.33, where Sh = kmdparticle/DAB, Re = ρdparticleV0/μ, Sc = μ/ρDAB, and dparticle is the particle diameter. In Equation 9.87, V0 is the superficial velocity of the fluid, i.e., the volumetric flow rate of the fluid divided by the cross-sectional area of the vessel that contains the enzyme particles. Generally, one will want to operate the reactor in such a manner that the external mass transfer resistance is negligible; hence, in many cases Sbs = Sb. This can be accomplished by high bulk flow rates in the case of a plug flow reactor or intense mixing in a well- mixed reactor. 9.6.8.1 External mass transfer resistance for a first order reaction Now, we will consider the special case of a first order reaction occurring in an immobilized enzyme particle with external mass transfer resistance and internal diffusion limitations (Aris, 1957). We can write for a given enzyme particle of volume (Vp) and external area (Ax) the steady-state reaction rate per volume of particle as \u0000r kA SS V V K KS kKSS mx bbs pm bs bs= -() = æ è ç ö ø ÷ =hh max (9.88) Solving for Sbs, we obtain S S kKV kA bs b p mx = + æ è ç ö ø ÷h h 1 (9.89) The substrate reaction rate can then be written in terms of just the bulk substrate concentration: \u0000r S kKV kA EkKS kK S b p mx b= + = 1 h (9.90) where E is defined as the overall effectiveness factor and accounts for both internal and external diffusion limitations and is given by 11 E kKV kA p mx =+ h (9.91) 9.6.9 Reactor design equations Finally, we need a reactor design equation that, in concert with the earlier information on the enzyme kinetics and diffusional effects, provides a relationship as to how the substrate concentration var- ies within the reaction volume. One usually assumes that either the reaction mixture flows through the reactor packed with the enzyme particles in plug flow (uniform velocity profile in the direction normal to the flow), leading to a change in substrate concentration in the direction of flow, or that the reaction volume is well mixed, resulting in a uniform substrate concentration throughout the reaction volume. 501 Extracorporeal devices 9.6.9.1 Packed bed reactor Figure 9.13 shows a packed bed immobilized enzyme reactor. The entering flow rate of the fluid is Qb, which in biomedical applications can be, e.g., blood or plasma. The bulk substrate concentration entering the reactor is represented by Sb in. A steady-state shell balance can also be performed on a section of the reactor volume (Axs Δx), where Axs is the cross-sectional area of the reactor. It is assumed that the fluid flows through the reactor in plug flow; hence, the velocity does not change with radial position: QS QS xA VKS KKS bb x bb xx Rxs bs mbs -= -() + æ è ç ö ø ÷+D 1 eD h max (9.92) In this equation, εR represents the void volume in the reactor, i.e., the volume of the reactor not occu- pied by the immobilized enzyme particles. Dividing by Δx and taking the limit as Δx → 0, results in the following differential equation: Q dS dx A VKS KKS BC xS S b b Rxs bs mbs bb in =-() + æ è ç ö ø ÷ == - 1 10 eh max :, (9.93) This equation can be solved numerically along with Equation 9.86, which provides the relationship between Sb and Sbs due to the effects of external mass transfer resistance. Since β depends on Sbs (see Equation 9.75), which also depends on x, we will need to evaluate the value of η as a function of x. For the special case where one can assume that η is approximately constant and external mass trans- fer effects are negligible, i.e., Sbs = Sb, Equation 9.93 can be integrated analytically for a reactor of length L to give the following result: K S S KS S ALKV Q m b out b in b out b in Rxs b ln maxæ è ç ö ø ÷ +-() =- -()1 eh (9.94) Oftentimes, the operation of a chemical reactor is defined in terms of the residence time (τ), i.e., the time the reacting fluid spends in the reactor. For a packed bed plug flow reactor, the residence time defined in terms of the reactor void volume is given by t e = AL Q xs R b (9.95) x+∆xx Qb, Sb in Qb, Sb out Immobilized enzyme particle Figure 9.13 Shell balance for a packed bed immobilized enzyme reactor. 502 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering In addition, we can define the conversion of the substrate, i.e., X S/SSb out b inº- ()1 . With these addi- tional definitions, Equation 9.94 can be written as KX KS X KV mS b in S R R ln max 1 1 -()-= - -()eh e t (9.96) For given values of the enzyme kinetics and either the size of the reactor or residence time, Equations 9.94 and 9.96 can be solved for the exiting substrate concentration and the substrate conversion. 9.6.9.2 Packed bed reactor with first-order kinetics and internal and external diffusion limita- tions For the special case of a first order reaction and both internal and external diffusion limita- tions, our steady-state substrate balance from x to x + Δx referring to Figure 9.13 can be written as QS QS xA EkKSbb x bb xx Rxsb-= -() +D D1 e (9.97) where E is the overall effectiveness factor given by Equation 9.91.

Perfect mixing results in a uniform substrate concentra- tion throughout the reactor volume. The exiting concentration of the substrate is also the same as that within the reactor; hence, the concentration throughout the bulk fluid of the reactor is Sb out. A steady-state substrate mass balance provides the following equation that can be solved for the exiting substrate concentration: QS V VKS KKS QSbb in Rreactor bs out mb out bb out=-() + æ è ç ö ø ÷ +1 eh max (9.100) In Equation 9.100 Vreactor is the total reaction volume (1 − εR) is the fraction of this volume consisting of the immobilized enzyme particles 503 Extracorporeal devices Equation 9.100 can be solved, along with Equation 9.86, and a value of the effectiveness factor evaluated at Sbs out, to determine the exiting substrate concentration Sb out. In the absence of external mass transfer effects, i.e., S Sbs out b out= , Equation 9.100 simplifies to S VKS KKS Sb in R R b out mb out b out= -() + æ è ç ö ø ÷ + 1 e e ht max (9.101) which can be solved for the value of Sb out, which will require iteration since η also depends on the value of Sb out. Once again, we have also defined the residence time, i.e., τ, as given by Equation 9.95, with Axs L now equal to Vreactor. 9.6.9.4 Well-mixed reactor with first-order kinetics and internal and external diffusion limita- tions For the special case of a first order reaction and both internal and external diffusion limita- tions, our steady-state substrate balance for the well-mixed reactor becomes QS VEkKSQ Sbb in Rreactor b out bb out=-() +1 e (9.102) Equation 9.102 can then be solved to obtain the substrate concentration exiting the reactor: S QS VEkK Q b out bb in Rreactor b = -() +1 e (9.103) Example 9.11 In one set of data obtained in an immobilized heparinase reactor, the observed heparin con- version was found to be 0.63 for an inlet heparin concentration of 0.2 mg mL−1 (Bernstein et al., 1987b). The heparinase was immobilized on a cross-linked agarose support, and the flow pattern in the reactor was well mixed. The total volume of the enzyme particles, i.e., (1 − εR) Vreactor, in the reactor was 90 mL, and the enzyme loading per enzyme particle was 130 U mL−1. The diffusivity of heparin was found to be 1.2 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. The porosity of the immobilized enzyme particle was 0.92 and the tortuosity was unity. The radius of a heparin molecule is 1.5 nm, and the pores in the enzyme particle have a radius of 35 nm. The partition Mixer Qb, Sb in Qb, Sb out Immobilized enzyme particles Figure 9.14 A well-mixed immobilized enzyme reactor. 504 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering coefficient, K, was found from experiments to be equal to 0.36. The enzyme particle had a radius of 0.0112 cm. The flow rate through the reactor was 120 mL min−1 = 2 mL s−1. The external mass transfer coefficient was estimated to be 0.154 cm min−1 = 0.0026 cm s−1. From these data, calculate the heparin conversion assuming the heparin reaction rate is first order. Include both internal and external diffusion limitations. Use the kinetic parameters for hepa- rinase obtained in Example 9.8, i.e., kcat = 0.891 mg U−1 h−1 and Km = 0.078 mg mL−1, which gives a Vmax = kcat E0 = 115.83 mg mL−1 h−1. Solution We can calculate the exiting heparin concentration from the reactor using Equation 9.103, which also serves as a guide to our solution strategy. The effective diffusivity of heparin within the enzyme particle is first calculated by Equation 9.69, where the value of λ is equal to 1.5 nm/35 nm = 0.043, and from Equation 6.13, we obtain an ωr = 0.91.

From this value of ϕ, we can calculate the effectiveness factor from Equation 9.79 and obtain η = 0.36. Next, we calculate from Equation 9.91 the overall effectiveness factor, which includes internal and external diffusion limitations: E kKV kA scm cm s p mx = + = + ´´ ´ = - - 1 1 1 1 036 0 413 0360 0112 30 0026 1 1h . .. . . 00 334.

The actual heparin conversion was found to be 0.63. The error is therefore 9.52%. The predicted heparin conversion is higher than the observed value. This is most likely due to the use of the soluble heparinase kinetics found in Example 9.8. The immobilization of the heparinase will most likely lead to a modest reduction in kcat. 9.7 Affinity adsorption Adsorption is the process where a solute in a solution literally sticks to the surface of a solid surface. Adsorption creates an adsorbed layer of the solute on the solid surface. Adsorption is not the same as absorption. In absorption, the solute goes into the interior of another substance, which can be a solid or another liquid. There are two types of adsorption known as either physical or chemical adsorption. In physi- cal adsorption, the solute binds to the solid surface through relatively weak physical interactions between the substance and the solid. The adsorbed substance retains its chemical structure. In chem- ical adsorption, chemical bonds are actually formed between the adsorbed substance and the solid material. Adsorption processes can be very selective in terms of the interaction between the solid surface and the solutes found in the solution. For example, in affinity adsorption, another substance known as a ligand is attached to the surface of a solid material by chemical means. The ligand has a very specific binding site for a substance that is found in the solution, as shown in Figure 9.15. Examples of various ligands and the substances they act on that are used in biomedical applications are sum- marized in Table 9.8. The application of affinity adsorption as a blood cleanser for the treatment of systemic blood infec- tions, i.e., sepsis, has also been described (Yung et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2014; Didar et al., 2015). Carrier Ligand Solute Figure 9.15 Ligand and solute binding. 506 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 9.7.1 Affinity adsorption of preformed antibodies An interesting example of the use of affinity adsorption is described in Karoor et al. (2003). As men- tioned in their paper, there is great interest in using animal organs as a means to address the short- age of human donor organs. This use of animal organs is also known as xenotransplantation, and pigs are receiving the most attention because of their adequate supply and the size of their organs is comparable to those in humans. However, the transplantation of animal organs into humans leads to a severe antibody-mediated reaction to the foreign tissue, the first phase of which is known as hyperacute rejection.* For this discussion, antibodies are proteins produced by certain cells of the immune system that bind with high specificity to molecules known as antigens. An antigen is just a chemical entity found in the foreign tissue that the immune system’s antibodies recognize and then bind to. These antibodies, also known as preformed natural antibodies, are found in the recipient of a xeno- transplant, and they bind to the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels of the xenograft. These antibodies that bind to the endothelial cells then activate the complement system, which destroys the transplanted organ within several hours of the transplant. The hyperacute rejection process for the most part involves a particular type of antibody, known as IgM. A few percent of the patient’s IgM antibody population consists of xenoreactive IgM anti- bodies that bind with high specificity to α-galactosyl structures (sugar-like molecules) that are expressed by nonprimate mammalian and New World monkey cells. The selective removal of these α-galactosyl-specific IgM antibodies from the patient prior to a xenotransplantation could eliminate the hyperacute rejection of the transplanted organs. Figure 9.16 illustrates an affinity adsorption system for removing α-galactosyl-reactive IgM anti- bodies (Karoor et al., 2003). Blood either from the body or from a reservoir, in the case of in vitro experiments, flows through a microfiltration hollow fiber membrane cartridge. As the blood flows through the inside of the hollow fibers, plasma is filtered across the hollow fiber membrane wall as a result of the transmembrane pressure difference. Recall that this filtration of blood is also known as plasmapheresis. The exiting blood and the plasma filtrate are then returned to the body or the reservoir. * A brief discussion on the immune system can be found in Section 10.2. Table 9.8 Examples of Ligands and the Substances They Bind With Ligand Substance That Binds with the Ligand Enzyme inhibitor Enzyme Antigen Antibodies Complementary nucleotide sequence Nucleic acids Cellular receptors Hormones Carrier protein Vitamin 507 Extracorporeal devices The pores of these hollow fiber membranes have diameters in the range from 0.2 to 0.5 μm. The diameters of these pores are many times larger than the IgM molecule. The ligand, which in this case is α-galactosyl, was immobilized on all accessible surfaces of the hollow fiber microfiltration membrane, i.e., the inner, outer, and internal surfaces. As the blood and filtered plasma flow through the hollow fiber membranes, the reactive IgM antibodies bind with the α-galactosyl ligands that are bound to the membrane surfaces as shown in Figure 9.15. 9.7.2 Analysis of an affinity adsorption system to remove preformed antibodies We can use a simple, well-mixed single-compartment model to describe how the concentration of reactive IgM changes with time in the body or the reservoir (Karoor et al., 2003). Letting Vreservoir denote the reservoir volume or the IgM distribution volume in the body and Creservoir the IgM concen- tration, we can write the following mass balance on IgM, which expresses the fact that the rate of change of IgM in the body or reservoir must equal the rate at which IgM is being removed from the plasma filtrate flow (Qf) that contacts the α-galactosyl ligand immobilized within the hollow fiber membrane: V dC dt QC Creservoir reservoir freservoirf=- -() (9.104) For the case where all of the IgM is bound to the α-galactosyl ligand as it passes through the hollow fiber membranes, Cf = 0 and the Equation 9.104 can be integrated to give the relative concentration of IgM (given by χ) in the reservoir as a function of time: c= = -C C e reservoir reservoir Qt V f reservoir 0 (9.105) where Creservoir 0 is the initial concentration of IgM.

(2003) show that greater than 90% removal of the IgM anti- bodies, i.e., C Creservoirreservoir/. 0 010< , can be obtained after three volumes of the plasma have been filtered through the affinity adsorption system. In designing an affinity adsorption system, one must be certain that the amount of ligand or solute to be removed, i.e., VCreservoirreservoir 0 , is less than the maximum adsorbed solute capacity that is possible for the membrane system. For a human-scale device to remove xenoreactive IgM antibodies, the reservoir or IgM distribution volume would approximate the volume of plasma in the body, which is 3000 mL. The IgM concentration is about 0.033 mg mL−1, so the total amount of IgM to be removed is on the order of 100 mg. IgM binding capacities for the systems studied by Karoor et al. (2003) had total binding capacities on the order of several hundred mg of IgM. Example 9.12 Karoor et al. (2003) obtained the data shown in the following table for the relative con- centration of IgM as a function of the reservoir volumes filtered. Six hundred nylon hol- low fiber membranes having inner and outer diameters of 330 and 550 μm, respectively, were used. The active length of the hollow fibers was 10.2 cm, and the total luminal surface area was 718 cm2. The filtration flow rate (Qf) was 50 mL min−1, and the reservoir volume was 1200  mL. The initial IgM concentration was 0.019 mg mL−1. Compare the model 509 Extracorporeal devices developed previously for an affinity adsorption system to the results obtained by Karoor et al. (2003).

The blood at the membrane surface has a urea concentration of 1 mg mL−1. Assume the dialysis fluid on the other side of the membrane surface is free of urea. The void volume of the cellulosic membrane is 0.40, and the membrane tortuosity is 2.0. The pores in the membrane have a diameter such that they exclude all molecules larger than a molecular weight of 20,000. 9.3 The following data for the antibiotic imipenem were obtained from six patients suffering multiorgan failure (Hashimoto et al., 1997, see also Problem 8.10). All patients were anuric because of complete renal failure and were on continuous venovenous hemodialysis. The anti- biotic was first delivered by an intravenous infusion pump for 30 min, resulting in an initial plasma concentration of 32.37 μg mL−1. Following the infusion, blood samples were taken over the next 12 h. In addition to the blood samples, drug concentrations in the blood exiting the hemodialysis unit were also taken. The dialysate entering the hemodialyzer was free of drug, and the concentration of the drug in the dialysate leaving the dialyzer was also mea- sured. The blood flow rate through the hemodialyzer was set at 60 mL min−1 and the dialysate flow was set at 20 mL min−1. The hemodialyzer had a total surface area of 0.5 m2. Using this data, develop a model that describes the drug removal process from the patient’s body by the hemodialyzer. Carefully state all of your assumptions. Determine key parameters such as the total body clearance, the dialyzer clearance, and the overall mass transfer coefficient for the dialyzer. Compare your model to the actual data.

The initial glucose concen- tration in the dialysate solution was equal to 1.5 wt.%. Assuming a constant peritoneal fluid volume of 2.4 L, estimate the permeability of the peritoneal membrane for each solute. What thickness of a stagnant film of water is required to give an equivalent permeability for urea and inulin?

The oxygen permeability of this mem- brane is reported (Gray, 1981) to be 1100 mL(STP) min−1 m−2 atm−1 and that for carbon dioxide is reported to be 4600 mL(STP) min−1 m−2 atm−1. What membrane area is needed to deliver 250 mL min−1 of oxygen and remove 200 mL min−1 of carbon dioxide? Carefully state your assumptions. 9.8 Vaslef et al. (1994) measured the oxygen transport rate in a Sarns SMO1 oxygen- ator as a function of the blood flow rate. The oxygenator contained hollow fibers with an outer diameter of 290 μm. The blood flowed external and perpendicular to the hol- low fibers. The blood was obtained from cows, and the properties of the blood were 512 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering C nP mmHg and HSat ¢ == ==7800 285291 3750mM, ., ., %. The blood entering the oxygenator had an oxygen saturation of 38%. Pure oxygen at a pO2 of 760 mmHg flowed within the hollow fibers. The total surface area of the hollow fibers available for oxygen transport was 1.87 m2, and the void space, i.e., εmodule, within the oxygenator module was 0.576. The fron- tal area (Af) normal to the blood flow was 36.88 cm2, and the blood flow path was 9.5 cm in length. Calculate the oxygen transport rate for blood flow rates of 1.41, 3.19, and 4.86 L min−1. The measured oxygen transport rates for these blood flows are 161, 305, and 370 mL min−1 (BTP), respectively. Use the mass transfer correlation they developed using water, which says that Sh = 0.136 Re0.832 Sc1/3. 9.9 Yang and Cussler (1986) considered the design of a human gill using hollow fibers. To support a human, they assumed the artificial gill will have to provide up to 2500 mL min−1 of oxygen at 1 atm and 37°C for moderate levels of activity. Develop your design for the human gill and determine the hollow fiber membrane area that is required. How big is your human gill? What other issues need to be considered for the design of the human gill? 9.10 Calculate the effectiveness factor for an enzyme reaction that follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Assume the Thiele modulus is 4 and β = 2. Compare your result to the value obtained assuming the reaction is first order. 9.11 The following kinetic data (Sung et al., 1986) were obtained for the enzyme bilirubin oxidase at a pH of 7.4 and a temperature of 37°C. The substrate was bilirubin. The enzyme loading in the reactor was equivalent to 0.15 U L−1, where a “Unit” of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 μmol min−1 of bilirubin. Assuming the data follows the Michaelis-Menten rate law, determine the values of Vmax, Km, and kcat.

The enzyme loading in the gel equals 10 U mL−1 of wet gel. Calculate the con- version of bilirubin in a well-mixed reactor containing a total gel volume of 15 mL. The void fraction in the reactor is 70%. Assume the flow rate through the reactor is equal to 1.2 mL min−1 and that the entering serum bilirubin concentration is 200 μM. The value of kcat for these conditions is equal to 4.67 × 10−4 μmol min−1 U−1. Assume the value of Km is unaffected by immobilization or other substances found in serum. 9.13 Fukui et al. (1994) measured the in vitro oxygen transfer rates using an intravascular lung assist device, or ILAD. The membrane oxygenator consisted of microporous polypropylene hollow fibers that were placed within a flexible polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tube. The PVC tube was 30 cm in length with a 20 mm inside diameter. The total surface area of the hollow fibers was 0.3 m2. The blood flows along a straight path outside of the fibers, and the gas flows within 513 Extracorporeal devices the hollow fibers. For blood flow rates of 1, 2, and 3 L min−1, the oxygen transfer rates (BTP) were 60, 120, and 140 mL min−1, respectively. Estimate the number and the diameter of hol- low fibers needed to reproduce their results. 9.14 A series of experiments was performed using various sizes of particles containing an immobi- lized enzyme in order to determine the importance of diffusion within the particles. The sub- strate concentration is much less than the value of Km, so the reaction may be assumed to be first order. In addition, the bulk solution was well mixed and the concentration of the substrate at the surface of the particles is 2 × 10−4 mol cm−3. The partition coefficient was also found to be K = 1. The table below summarizes the data that was obtained: Diameter of the Particle, cm Observed Reaction Rate, mol h−1 cm−3 0.050 0.22 0.010 0.98 0.005 1.60 0.001 2.40 0.0005 2.40 From the data in the above table, determine values of the first order rate constant (k) and the effective diffusivity of the substrate within the particle (De). To assess the validity of the assumptions you make to find k and De, also calculate the effectiveness factor (η), the Thiele modulus (ϕ), and the predicted reaction rate for each particle size. Make a graph that com- pares the predicted reaction rate to the observed reaction rate for each particle size. How does it look? 9.15 A biotech company is designing an immobilized enzyme reactor for the removal of a toxin from blood. The device will be connected to the patient by an arteriovenous shunt. Blood will flow over a packed bed of particles (100 μm in diameter) containing the immobilized enzyme. The following data has been obtained for the toxin enzyme kinetics: K = 1 Vmol cm smax =´ -- -110 93 1 Kmol cmm =´ --110 93 Dcmse =´ --510 72 1 The maximum concentration of the toxin entering the reactor is estimated to be 1 × 10−11 mol cm−3. Estimate the blood residence time within the reactor to obtain a 60% per pass conversion of the toxin in the blood. 9.16 Design a packed bed heparinase reactor to achieve a 70% conversion of heparin. Assume an enzyme loading of 120 U mL−1 of immobilized enzyme and a feed substrate concentration of 0.2 mg mL−1. The flow rate of plasma to your reactor is 120 mL min−1. Use the heparinase kinetics from Example 9.8, and assume a first order reaction. 9.17 Derive the performance equation shown in Table 9.4 for a countercurrent hemodialyzer. 514 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 9.18 Design an aquapheresis cartridge that can remove up to 500 mL h−1 of fluid from the body. Specify the membrane properties such as total membrane area, NMWCO, membrane thick- ness, and membrane porosity that you recommend. How many hollow fibers are required and what are their dimensions in terms of length and diameter? What are the operating pressures for your system and the effective pressure drop across the cartridge? 9.19 Starting with Equation 9.78 show that Equation 9.77 is the effectiveness factor for a spherical enzyme particle for Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 9.20 In one set of data obtained in an immobilized heparinase reactor, the observed heparin con- version was found to be 0.54 for an inlet heparin concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 (Bernstein et al., 1987b). The heparinase was immobilized on a cross-linked agarose support, and the flow pattern in the reactor was well mixed. The total volume of the enzyme particles, i.e., (1 − εR) Vreactor, in the reactor was 80 mL, and the enzyme loading per enzyme particle was 100 U mL−1. The diffusivity of heparin was found to be 1.2 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. The porosity of the immobilized enzyme particle was 0.92, and the tortuosity was unity. The radius of a heparin molecule is 1.5 nm, and the pores in the enzyme particle have a radius of 35 nm. The parti- tion coefficient, K, was found from experiments to be equal to 0.36. The enzyme particle had a radius of 0.0112 cm. The flow rate through the reactor was 120 mL min−1 = 2 mL s−1. The external mass transfer coefficient was estimated to be 0.154 cm min−1 = 0.0026 cm s−1. From these data, calculate the heparin conversion assuming the heparin reaction rate is first order. Include both internal and external diffusion limitations. Use the kinetic parameters obtained in Example 9.8, i.e., kcat = 0.891 mg U−1 h−1 and Km = 0.078 mg mL−1. 9.21 Design a hollow fiber membrane hemodialysis module for daily home use. Assume the patient is connected to the hemodialyzer for only an hour or so each day. 9.22 A “biospleen” is being developed to remove endotoxins from blood. Endotoxins are lipopoly- saccharides (LPS) that are a major component of the outer membranes of pathogenic Gram- negative bacteria. These substances are released as a result of the death of the bacteria during antibiotic treatment, and when present in the blood, they evoke a strong immune response that can lead to septic shock and death. It is proposed to capture these endotoxins by immobilizing mannose-binding lectins (MBLs) on the internal surface of hollow fibers. The endotoxins in the blood flowing through the hollow fibers will be adsorbed from the blood by the MBLs. The proposed flow rate of the blood to the “biospleen” is 50 mL min−1, and there are 5000 hol- low fibers in the device. The inside diameter of the hollow fibers is 200 μm. During the early period of time after the device has been in contact with the blood, the MBLs have a very large capacity for the adsorption of endotoxins that are present in the blood. The binding of the LPS with the MBLs is also assumed to happen very fast relative to the diffusion of the large LPS molecules from the bulk blood to the surface of the hollow fiber where the MBLs are. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the concentration of the endotoxin is zero at the inside surface of the hollow fibers. The LPS endotoxin diffusivity in blood is estimated to be about 5 × 10−7 cm2 s−1. If the length of the hollow fibers in the biospleen is 30 cm, estimate the fractional removal of the LPS endotoxin, i.e., 1 − Cout/Cin, where Cin and Cout are the concentrations of LPS in blood entering and exiting the “biospleen.” Assume the density of the blood is 1.06 g cm−3 and that the apparent viscosity of the blood in these hollow fibers is 2.9 cP. 515 Chapter 10 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine 10.1 Introduction Over eight million surgical procedures are performed each year in the United States for the treat- ment of organ failure or the loss of tissue function as a result of disease or injury (Holder et al., 1997). Organ transplantation has also become a routine and successful treatment method for the replacement of a failed organ. Organs routinely transplanted include the kidneys, heart, lungs, liver, intestines, and pancreas. Part of this success is due to better therapies to prevent rejection episodes, as well as improved techniques for the procurement and storage of whole organs prior to transplant. Organ transplantation has saved and improved the quality of many lives; however, its widespread application is severely limited by a shortage of whole organ donors. In the United States, only a few thousand organ donors are available each year. Yet, over 100,000 people in the United States are on waiting lists for an organ transplant, and over 20 per day of these will die waiting for an organ (Wiles et al., 2016). Certainly, extracorporeal devices such as the hemodialyzer, bioartificial liver (to be discussed in Chapter 11), and the artificial heart (Jarvik, 1981; Spotnitz, 1987; Rosenberg, 1995) and left ventricular assist devices (Griffith et al., 2001) can be used until an organ is available. These devices therefore serve as a bridge to a transplant. The continued development and improvement of these devices will help alleviate the pain and suffering while awaiting an organ transplant. However, these devices come with many limitations and, by themselves, are still not a perfect solution. Many diseases do not involve an entire organ but only certain tissues or cell types lose their function or are damaged, e.g., in osteoarthritis or in a damaged heart valve. In these cases, it may be simpler to restore or regenerate the lost function of the specific tissue or cells than to replace an entire organ. 10.2 Background The transplantation of the cells necessary to replace the lost function of a tissue or an organ is receiv- ing considerable attention and is the basis of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (Cima et  al., 1991a,b; Langer and Vacanti, 1993, Brown et  al., 2000; Ma and Choi, 2001; Palsson and Bhatia, 2004; van Blitterswijk et al., 2008; Harrison et al., 2014; Wobma and Vunjak-Novakovic, 2016). This approach is also known as TERM, which is an acronym for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. TERM is being considered for the treatment of a variety of diseases and medical problems, some of which are outlined in Table 10.1. TERM is a rapidly developing multidisciplinary field that utilizes life science and engineering prin- ciples to construct biological substitutes containing viable and functioning cells for the restoration, maintenance, replacement, or improvement of a tissue function, or even a whole organ (Langer and Vacanti, 1993). The realm of TERM has also been extended in recent years to include the use of 516 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering tissue engineered structures as an in vitro platform for the evaluation and testing of new drugs and as models of diseases such as cancer (Neiman et al., 2014; Beauchamp et al., 2015; Bray et al., 2015; Wobma and Vunjak-Novakovic, 2016). 10.2.1 Cells for TERM The cells that are used in TERM can be harvested from a variety of sources. For example, the cells can be obtained from a human donor (allograft), animals (xenograft), the patient themselves (autograft), or from a genetically engineered cell line (Morgan et al., 1994; Chang, 1997; Zalzman et al., 2003). Stem cells have the potential of being a rich source of cellular material for TERM applications, and there is much interest in the use of both adult and embryonic stem cells. Adult stem cells are found within a variety of tissues in the adult body, and they are the precursor cells that are needed for repairing or rebuilding tissue as a result of injury, disease, or aging (Pittenger et al., 1999). Embryonic stem cells, however, are isolated from what is known as the inner cell mass of the blas- tocyst that later forms the embryo. The isolation of the inner cell mass from a developing embryo for tissue engineering applications, and for the treatment of disease, results in the death of the embryo, and in the case of a human embryo, this has raised ethical issues. For example, is the development from conception to birth the development TO a human being or the development OF a human being (van Blitterswijk, 2008)? This has created a moral dilemma in the sense of whether it is morally justifiable to use embryonic stem cells from human embryos to treat human diseases. Stem cells possess the unique property of pluripotency, which is not found in most other termi- nally differentiated cells. This means that stem cells readily replicate and they have the potential to Table 10.1 Opportunities for TERM Liver diabetes Dental plastic/reconstructive surgery Parkinson’s disease Nerve regeneration Kidney Site-specific delivery of growth factors Chronic pain Cornea Esophagus Skin Ureter Intestine Bladder Trachea Cartilage Bone Muscle regeneration Blood Artificial blood vessels In vitro models for cancer Stem cells Gene therapy Parathyroid Cell production In vitro hematopoiesis Alzheimer’s disease Neurological diseases Heart valves Lymphocytes Spine Retina Whole organs In vitro drug screening Intervertebral disks 517 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine differentiate under the right conditions into other cell types that are found in the body. For example, adult bone marrow has many types of stem cells that can be coaxed to differentiate into about every type of cell found in the body. In addition to stem cells, there are also what are known as progenitor cells, which are further along in the differentiation process than a stem cell. Progenitor cells reside in all kinds of tissues found in the body. Under the right conditions, progenitor cells can differentiate into a more specific cell type; however, they cannot replicate indefinitely like a stem cell. When presented with the proper signals, progenitor cells can therefore replace those cells that are lost as a result of injury or through normal attrition. A particular type of stem cell found both in embryos and in adults is the mesenchymal stem cell. A  mesenchymal stem cell can differentiate to form cartilage, bone, tendons, ligaments, muscle, marrow stroma, and connective tissue (Caplan, 1991; Pittenger et al., 1999). Mesenchymal stem cells are receiving considerable attention because of their potential to provide a cell source for a variety of tissue engineered constructs that can be used in a variety of TERM applications, espe- cially for bone and cartilage repair (Madry et al., 2014; Im, 2016). In many cases, the patient’s own mesenchymal stem cells can be harvested from their own bone marrow and used for these applica- tions (Sart et al., 2014). Another promising stem cell type (Kuroda et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2016) are known as adult human circulating/peripheral blood CD34+ cells. This class of stem cell also includes circulating endothe- lial progenitor cells and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. This type of stem cell has been shown to promote bone regeneration and tissue neovascularization and has potential applications in the treatment of myocardial infarction and various disorders of the liver. A recent promising discovery are the so-called induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, that can be made by genetically reprogramming adult somatic cells to become pluripotent stem cells (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006; Harrison et al., 2014; Beauchamp et al., 2015). iPSCs have properties that are similar to those of embryonic stem cells. Hence, iPSCs also have the potential to overcome the ethi- cal issues associated with the use of tissue derived from human embryos since the pluripotent cells needed for TERM can be obtained from the patient. 10.2.2 The tissue engineering process Transplanted cells have the potential to grow and form larger tissue structures when implanted in the vicinity of existing mature tissue. However, a potential problem is the loose association of the trans- planted cells that provides no guide for attachment, restructuring, and the formation of larger 3D cellular aggregates and tissue structures. Additionally, the transplanted cells cannot survive if they do not have an adequate supply of blood to provide oxygen, nutrients, and a means for waste prod- uct removal. Furthermore, any therapeutic product released by the transplanted cells needs to have access to the host’s vasculature in order for it to be effective. This requires that each transplanted cell be within a hundred microns or so of a capillary. Initially, the existing capillary supply in the tissue surrounding the cellular transplant may not be optimal for the sustained growth of the trans- planted cells. This severely limits the size of the cellular aggregates that can form, unless a means is provided for the formation of a vascular capillary bed (angiogenesis) within the transplanted cells. The goal of tissue engineering is therefore to develop methods and techniques than can enhance the success of cellular transplants. 518 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Figure 10.1 illustrates the basic steps of the tissue engineering process. This process consists of several steps and includes developing a source for the required cells, expanding these cells through in vitro tissue culture, seeding the cells into a scaffold material with the appropriate extracellular matrix (ECM) materials, and providing the resulting constructs with any required mechanical stimulus or molecular signaling molecules to ensure proper differentiation of the resulting tissue. Once these steps have been completed, the tissue engineered construct can be implanted into a patient. 10.2.2.1 Immunoprotection of the transplanted cells In some cases, the transplanted cells in the tissue engineered construct need to be protected from the host’s immune system. This can be a result of the use of foreign cells or the need to protect the cells from an autoimmune response, which occurs in the process leading to insulin-dependent diabetes. This immunoprotection of the transplanted cells from the host’s immune system can be accomplished through the use of an immu- noisolation membrane (Colton, 1995). The immunoprotection concept is illustrated in Figure 10.2. The immunoisolation membrane used to provide immune protection to the transplanted cells is permeable to small molecules, such as required nutrients and the therapeutic agent released by the cells, but impermeable to the larger mol- ecules (antibodies and complement) and cells of the host’s immune system. Immunoprotection of the transplanted cells therefore does not require the use of immunosuppressive drugs or immunomodifi- cation (Lanza and Chick, 1994b) of the cells prior to transplant. Because of this immunoprotection, there is the potential to use cells and tissues from animals (xenografts) or genetically engineered cell lines, which vastly increases the availability of donor tissue. For example, in the development of a bioartificial pancreas for the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes, immunoprotected islets of Langerhans from rats were transplanted into diabetic mini pigs and successfully restored normal blood glucose levels (Neufeld et al., 2013). Several examples of this immunoprotection approach to create what are known as bioartificial organs will be examined in greater detail in Chapter 11. Cells obtained from donor Expand cells in culture Seed the cells onto a 3D scaffold Media In vitro culture of the 3D scaffolds in a bioreactor Implant scaffold in the patient Figure 10.1 The tissue engineering process. 519 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine 10.3 The extracellular matrix Most of the efforts in tissue engineering is now focusing on the use of polymeric support structures or scaffolds for guiding the growth and organization of the transplanted cells into the desired 3D shape (Cima et al., 1991a,b; Goldstein et al., 1999; Oerther et al., 1999; Petersen et al., 2002; Leach et al., 2003; Radisic et al., 2003; Palsson and Bhatia, 2004; Pratt et al., 2004; van Blitterswijk, 2008). These scaffolds can be made from synthetic or naturally occurring polymeric materials. Tissues and even whole organs can also be treated with special chemicals and made acellular leaving behind a natural scaffold for the seeding of new cells (Price et al., 2015). These materials used as scaffolds are either biodegradable or nonbiodegradable and can be formed into a variety of shapes with mechanical properties similar to the tissue they are replac- ing. However, to better understand how polymeric support structures can enhance the growth of transplanted cells, it is necessary to first examine how cells organize themselves within natural tissue structures. Tissues are not only made up entirely of cells but also consist of an extracellular gel-like fluid containing a variety of macromolecules collectively referred to as the ECM (Alberts et al., 1989; Anderson, 1994; Rubin and Farber, 1994; Long, 1995; Naughton et  al., 1995; Hubbell, 1997; Parsons-Wingerter and Sage, 1997; Dee et al., 2002). The major components of the ECM are the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), proteoglycans, collagens, elastic fibers, structural glycoproteins, and the basement membrane. The ECM macromolecules are secreted locally for the most part by specialized cells called fibro- blasts. Several of the most important types of macromolecules found within the ECM are sum- marized in Table 10.2. These materials that comprise the ECM form a unique composition for each type of tissue. These ECM materials are in intimate contact with the cells and hold them together, forming an organized 3D cross-linked mesh-like structure. The ECM gives the tissue its mechanical strength and serves as a pipeline for intercellular signaling. Semipermeable membrane Membrane pore Immunoisolated cells Immune cell Cell product Nutrients like oxygen and glucose Antibodies Figure 10.2 Concept of immunoisolation. 520 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The ECM therefore plays an active role in organizing the tissue since it not only serves to provide for the 3D organization of cells and adjacent layers of tissue but also provides a mechanism for intercellular communication and controls cellular processes such as proliferation, cell migration, attachment, differentiation, and repair. Most mammalian cells are anchorage dependent and possess cell-surface receptors for a variety of these ECM macromolecules. Hence, some of these ECM macromolecules possess so-called attach- ment factors that are responsible for the development, growth, and metabolic functions of cells. The ECM itself has also been used, because of these properties, as a scaffold for tissue engineering applications. This tissue organizing principle of the ECM is shown in Figure 10.3 for the case of epithelial cells that are supported by a layer of connective tissue. Connective tissues (also called the stroma) provide the framework for the formation and organization of most of the larger structures found within the body. The specific functional cells that define a tissue, e.g., the hepatocytes found in the liver, or the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, are called parenchymal cells. Using Figure 10.3 as our guide, the following discussion will focus on a description of the major constituents of the ECM, i.e., the GAGs, collagens, elastin, fibronectin, and aggrecan. Table 10.2 Major Macromolecules of the Extracellular Matrix Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)—forms the ECM gel Collagen—provides strength and organization to the ECM Elastin—provides resilience or elasticity Fibronectin—adhesion of fibroblasts and other cells Laminin—adhesion of cells to the basal lamina Aggrecan—resists compressive loads Epithelium Basement membrane Capillary Macrophage Mast cell Fibroblast FibronectinCollagen fiber GAGs Elastin Aggrecan Figure 10.3 Connective tissue. 521 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine 10.3.1 Glycosaminoglycans GAGs form from long linear polymers consisting of a repeating disaccharide unit. Molecular weights range from several thousand to over a million. GAGs tend to have a large number of negative charges because of the presence of carboxyl and sulfate groups. They are highly extended forming random coil-like structures. Because they are also hydrophilic, they form in combination with the interstitial fluid the hydrated gel-like material throughout which the other macromolecules of the ECM are found. In addition, GAGs bind with growth factors and intercellular messenger molecules known as cytokines. There are four types of GAGs depending on what types of sugars they are made from. They are hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate and heparin, and keratan sulfate. With the exception of hyaluronic acid, they also form what are called proteoglycans through covalent bonds with proteins. 10.3.2 Collagens Collagens are fibrous proteins that are made from three polypeptide chains that form the tough, triple-stranded helical structure of the collagen molecule. The tensile strength of tissues is provided by collagen. Collagens are also the most prevalent protein material found within the ECM, and they have several unique functions. Although more than twenty types of collagen molecules have been identified, there are four that are most important. These are the fibrillar collagens (type I, type II, and type III) and type IV collagen. The first three types of collagen molecules assemble themselves into much larger structures called collagen fibrils that aggregate further to form collagen fibers. Type I collagen makes up about 90% of the col- lagen found in the body. It is found mostly in the skin, tendons, ligaments, various internal organs, and bone. Type II collagen is primarily found in cartilage, and type III collagen is found in blood vessels, as well as the skin. Type IV collagen organizes itself to form sheets within the basal lamina of the base- ment membrane. Fibroblasts have the ability to organize the collagen fibrils they secrete forming sheets or rope-like structures; therefore, they can affect the spatial organization of the matrix they produce. 10.3.3 Elastin Elastin is a hydrophobic glycoprotein molecule that through cross-links with other elastin molecules can form a network of sheets and filaments with the unique property of being elastic, allowing for recoil after periods of stretch. The elasticity is a result of the random coil-like structure of the elas- tin molecule. The elastic nature of elastin is important in blood vessels, the skin, lungs, and uterus. Inelastic collagen fibrils are interwoven with elastin to limit and control the degree of stretching. 10.3.4 Fibronectin Fibronectin is the principal adhesive glycoprotein found within the ECM. Next to collagen, it is the second most prevalent macromolecule found in the ECM. Fibronectin binds to other ECM mol- ecules, such as collagen, and to cell-surface receptors. It therefore has a principal role in the attach- ment of cells to the ECM. Fibronectin is a dimer made up of two subunit chains that are bound together at one end by a pair of disulfide bonds. Along the length of the chains are a series of func- tional domains that can bind to specific types of molecules (e.g., collagen or heparin) or cell-surface 522 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering receptors. The cell-binding domain has a specific tripeptide sequence consisting of the amino acids: arginine (R), glycine (G), and aspartic acid (D), often referred to as the RGD sequence. Peptides containing this sequence will inhibit the attachment of cells to fibronectin through their competition for the RGD binding site on the cell surface. In addition to fibronectin, there are several other ECM adhesion proteins that express the RGD sequence. These include vitronectin found primarily in blood cells. Thrombospondin is secreted by a variety of cells involved in the development of the ECM. It serves to bind together other components of the ECM like fibronectin. Von Willebrand factor is made by megakaryocytes (platelet-generating cells found in the bone marrow). It is stored in circulating platelets. Von Willebrand factor is released by platelets as a result of injury to blood vessels, and this factor then binds to collagen. The platelets then bind to the von Willebrand factor that is also bound to collagen. Fibrinogen is another of the clotting proteins found in the blood. During blood clot formation, fibrinogen is converted to fibrin that forms a mesh-like structure that traps red blood cells and platelets. 10.3.5 Aggrecan Aggrecan is a chondroitin and keratan sulfate proteoglycan that is a key component of the ECM in cartilaginous tissues. It provides cartilage, as well as the intervertebral disk, the ability to withstand compressive loads. 10.3.6 Basement membrane The basal lamina is a continuous mat-like structure of ECM materials that separates specific cells, such as epithelial, endothelial, or muscle, from the underlying layer of connective tissue. The basal lamina consists of two distinct layers, the lamina rara* directly beneath the basal membrane of the specific cells above and the lamina densa† just below the lamina rara. Found below the two layers of the basal lamina is the collagen-containing lamina reticularis that connects the basal lamina to the connective tissue that lies below it. All three of these layers together constitute what is known as the basement membrane (see Figure 10.3). The basal lamina consists primarily of type IV collagen, proteoglycans, such as those formed from heparan sulfate, and the glycoprotein laminin. Laminin is an extremely large protein with a molecular weight of 850,000 made from three long polypeptide chains that form the shape of a cross. It also contains a number of functional domains throughout its structure with sites for binding to type IV collagen, heparan sulfate, and laminin cell-surface receptors. Laminin has a major role in the formation and maintenance of blood vessels. 10.4 Cellular interactions There are three types of interactions involving cells. These interactions may be classified as cell-ECM, cell-cell, and cell-growth factor (Long, 1995). Figure 10.4 illustrates the various interactions of cells with their surrounding environment. Cells interact with other cells, the ECM, and growth factors through cell-surface receptor proteins that are an integral part of the cell membrane. Binding of cell-surface * Under the electron microscope, this layer is translucent to electrons. † Under the electron microscope, this layer is somewhat opaque to electrons. 523 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine receptors to surrounding ECM components such as collagen, fibronectin, and laminin enables the cell to link up to the surrounding matrix. Binding of cell-surface receptors between cells allows them to organize into larger structures such as tissues and organs. Cell-surface receptor interactions with growth factors provide control over a variety of cellular functions through the control of gene expression. There are four types of cell adhesion receptors (Hubbell, 1997). Three of these receptors are mainly involved in cell-cell interactions, and the fourth is involved in both cell-cell and cell-ECM interac- tions. The adhesion receptors used in cell-cell interactions include the cadherins, the selectins, and the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). The receptors involved in cell-ECM interactions belong to a general family of adhesion receptors known as integrins (Horwitz, 1997). 10.4.1 Cadherins Cadherins take part in what is known as homophilic binding, i.e., the binding of a cadherin molecule on one cell with an identical cadherin on another cell of the same type. They do not bind with ECM com- ponents. The cadherin molecule binding is strongly dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca++. 10.4.2 Selectins The selectins are a family of CAMs that are found on the surfaces of endothelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets. They exhibit heterophilic binding between the blood cells and the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels. They are important in the localization of leukocytes to sites of inflamma- tion and tissue injury. The three most important selectins are called GMP-140, endothelial leuko- cyte adherence molecule-1, and leukocyte adhesion molecule-1. Like the cadherins, their activity is dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. 10.4.3 Cell adhesion molecules The CAMs are members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. These receptors bind inde- pendently of extracellular calcium levels. CAMs are involved in recognition of antigens (foreign agents) and cell-cell interactions. Antigen recognition involves both the T-lymphocyte receptor and Cadherins Collagen β1 integrins Fibrinogen Fibronectin Platelets gpIIb/IIIa von Willebrand factorC3biICAM-2ligandGMP-140ELAM-1ICAM-1VCAM-1 LAM-1 LFA-1 Mac-1 Endothelium Leukocyte VLA-4 gp150, 95 Activated leukocyte Figure 10.4 Cellular interactions. 524 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering two special antigen-presenting molecules called major histocompatibility complex classes I and II (MHC I and MHC II). These specialized CAMs will be discussed further in Chapter 11 in the section on immunology. Two other CAMs are important factors in localizing leukocytes to regions of tissue injury. For exam- ple, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 is found on the surfaces of both endothelial cells and leukocytes and binds to the integrin called leukocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) that is found on macrophages and neutrophils. ICAM-2, found on endothelial cells, also binds to LFA-1 and helps to localize neutrophils to sites of injured tissue. Vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 is expressed by endothelial cells as a response to injury or inflammation and also promotes adherence of leukocytes to endothelial cells. 10.4.4 Integrins The integrins (Horwitz, 1997) are a family of adhesion molecules that are involved in both cell-cell interactions and binding with molecules found in the ECM. Integrin molecules are heterodimers consisting of two protein subunits, the α chain and the β chain. There are at least 15 variants of the α subunit and 8 variants of the β subunit. Overall, there are at least 20 different heterodimer αβ integ- rins. The β subunits provide the functional aspects of the dimeric integrin molecule; hence, integrins are classified according to the type of their β chain. The subclasses having the β1, β2, and β3 chains are the most common. The β1 and β3 subclasses are primarily involved in interactions between the cell and the ECM. The β2 subclass involves mostly cell-cell interactions involving leukocytes. β1 integrins are also referred to as very late after (VLA) antigens (Margiotta et al., 1994). VLA antigens are numbered according to the number of the α subunit that forms the heterodimer with the β1 subunit. These subclasses bind with a variety of ECM proteins such as collagen, fibronectin, and laminin. The primary recognition site for β1 integrins is the RGD sequence described earlier. Therefore, this group of integrins is important for the overall organization and function of a variety of cell types. VLA-4 is also a receptor found on leukocytes for VCAM-1 expressed by endothelial cells. Cell-cell interactions, mainly leukocyte to leukocyte, involve mostly the β2 group of integrins. Hence this subclass is known as the “leukocyte” integrins. The common β2 subunit is also known as cluster designation (CD)18, a protein with a molecular weight of 95,000. The most important α subunits, in combination with β2, form the leukocyte integrins known as LFA-1, Mac-1 (macrophage antigen-1), and gp150,95 (a glycoprotein with an α subunit of molecular weight 150,000 along with the β2 subunit protein with a molecular weight of 95,000). These α subunits are also respectively known by the cluster designations CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c. The expression of these integrins on leukocytes is particularly important for defense against bacterial infections. The β3 integrins comprise the platelet glycoprotein receptor, known as gpIIb/IIIa, and the vitronec- tin receptor. Both of these receptors also recognize the RGD sequence of ECM proteins such as vitronectin, fibronectin, thrombospondin, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor. The aggregation of platelets is enhanced by the release of von Willebrand factor. gpIIb/IIIa is calcium dependent and found on the surface of activated platelets. This integrin is important for platelet aggregation and adherence of platelets to the subendothelium. This occurs through binding of this receptor to fibrinogen, fibronectin, vitronectin, and von Willebrand factor. 525 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine 10.4.5 Cytokines and growth factors A variety of cells also secrete soluble proteins known as cytokines. Cytokines serve as intercellular chemical messengers. Many of these proteins are required for the normal development, growth, and proliferation of cells. They are also involved in processes such as inflammation and wound healing and the varied responses of the immune system. Many are mitogens, i.e., they stimulate the prolif- eration of specific types of cells. They are then referred to as growth factors. Growth factors bind to specific receptors on the surface of their target cell and have the ability to induce or direct the action of specific genes in the targeted cell. A variety of growth factors have been identified, and some of the more important of these for TERM applications are summarized in Table 10.3. All of these growth factors also play a key role during the wound healing process, and many are involved in the growth of new blood vessels. Many of these growth factors can also be used to stimulate and accelerate the growth and differentiation of stem cells used in polymeric scaffolds for tissue engineering applications (Babensee et al., 2000). Since many growth factors have short biological half-lives, e.g., the half-life of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is less than 30 min, techniques are being developed for the controlled release of growth factors to maintain a critical level of the growth factor within the tissue engineered construct (Babensee et al., 2000; Spicer and Mikos, 2010; Madry et al., 2014). Growth factors are very potent and their concentrations tend to be very small. For example, Madry et al. (2014) states that for the chondrogenic differentiation of mes- enchymal stem cells (MSCs), the critical concentration of the growth factor TGF-β is about 10 ng mL−1. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a mitogen for cells such as smooth muscle, fibroblasts, and neuroglial. PDGF is stored in platelets and is released after platelet aggregation at the site of injury Table 10.3 Growth Factors Growth Factor Property Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) Mitogen for smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and neuroglial cells; chemotactic signal for immune system cells Epidermal growth factor Mitogen for a variety of cells types, accelerates wound healing Fibroblast growth factors (aFGF and bFGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) Stimulates growth of blood vessels; mitogen for endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) Osteogenic protein (OP) Stimulates growth of blood vessels Induce the formation of bone and cartilage Induce the formation of bone Insulin-like growth factor (INF-I) Stimulates growth of blood vessels Transforming growth factor (TGF-β) Controls cellular response to other growth factors, stimulates chondrogenesis Nerve growth factor (NGF) Stromal cell–derived growth factor (SDF-1) Keratinocyte-derived growth factor (KGF) Epithelial cell growth factor (EGF) Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) Stimulates axon growth Stimulates growth of blood vessels Involved in wound healing Important in wound healing Important in organ regeneration and wound healing Interleukin-2 (IL-2) Stimulates proliferation of T-lymphocytes Interleukin-6 (IL-6) Stimulates proliferation and differentiation of B-lymphocytes 526 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering to blood vessels. Damaged endothelial and smooth muscle cells also secrete PDGF. PDGF is also a chemotactic signal for inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates the growth of a variety of cell types. EGF accelerates the healing of many wounds and stimulates fibroblasts to deposit collagen. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) comes in two forms, acidic (aFGF) and basic (bFGF). bFGF is an order of magnitude more potent than aFGF. FGF and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) stimulate the growth of capillaries, a process called angiogenesis (Folkman, 1985; Folkman and Klagsbrun, 1987). FGF also promotes the growth of fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. These processes affected by FGF also accelerate wound healing. Another angiogenic growth factor is tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which is secreted by activated macrophages during the initial stages of inflammation. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) not only plays a major role in growth but also stimulates angiogenesis. TGF-β can either promote or inhibit the growth of cells by controlling their response to other growth factors. TGF-β has also been shown to be important for the growth and differentiation of MSCs for the repair of damaged articular cartilage (Madry et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2015). Several other important growth factors include nerve growth factor (NGF) that enhances the func- tion of neurons and stimulates axon growth, interleukin-2 (IL-2) that stimulates the proliferation of T-lymphocytes, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) that stimulates the proliferation of B-lymphocytes and their differentiation to antibody-secreting plasma cells. There are also several hematopoietic* growth fac- tors that are specific to the development and differentiation of blood cells. Other growth factors of interest to tissue engineering include stromal cell–derived growth factor (SDF-1), epithelial cell growth factor (EGF), and keratinocyte-derived growth factor (KGF). These three growth factors are important in wound healing and angiogenesis. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) plays an important role in organ regeneration and wound healing, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and osteogenic protein (OP) stimulate the formation of bone and cartilage. A cocktail of growth factors can also be used to enhance the growth and differentiation of the cells within a tissue engineered scaffold. For example, for MSC differentiation and maturation to form cartilage, a combination of IGF, TGF, FGF, and BMP can be used (Shimomura et al., 2014). 10.5 Support structures for tissue engineering applications With this background on how cells organize themselves within the body, we can now address the properties required for a support structure for transplanted cells. Table 10.4 summarizes some of the characteristics that are important to consider in selecting materials to serve as support structures for transplanted cells. A variety of biological and synthetic polymers can be used as biomaterials, and many of these can be used to provide the support structure for transplanted cells. Table 10.5 sum- marizes some of the materials that are being used or being considered for use as support structures in tissue engineering. * Hematopoiesis is the process of blood cell development and differentiation. 527 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine 10.5.1 Biomaterials The biomaterials listed in Table 10.5 are grouped as to whether or not they are biodegradable. Long-term implantation of nonbiodegradable biomaterials poses the risk of localized infection, chronic inflammation, and the development of fibrous encapsulation of the implant. This can com- promise the proper functioning of transplanted cells if they were to reside within the porous struc- ture of these materials. Nonbiodegradable materials, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), PU, and Dacron, are preferred for those applications where their structural integrity is more important than the requirement for them to serve as scaffolds for transplanted cells, e.g., as vascular grafts or structural components of artificial organs. These materials can also be made into a variety of 3D configurations. Other materials such as agarose gel are nonbiodegradable materials that have found widespread use in cell encapsulation and have been proposed as scaffolds in tissue engineering (Park et al., 2010). Biodegradable materials are now attracting significant interest for tissue engineering applications. Biodegradable materials allow the transplanted cells sufficient time to organize the desired 3D struc- ture and develop their own blood supply. The biodegradable polymers are easily hydrolyzed by the body’s fluids and slowly disappear without leaving behind any foreign residues. Examples of bio- logically derived biodegradable polymers include collagen, GAGs, fibrin gels, chitosan, and small intestinal submucosa (SIS). Collagen is one of the ECM materials and can be prepared as fibers (Cavallaro et al., 1994) or as a gel. Collagen is being used in applications such as tissue repair and artificial skin (Morgan and Yarmush, 1997). SIS has many interesting properties and is widely used as a bioscaffold and for the repair of tissues (Le Visage et al., 2006). SIS is harvested from the small Table 10.4 Desirable Properties of Scaffold Structures for TERM Biocompatible Nonimmunogenic Negligible toxicity Locally and systemically The polymer and any of its degradation products Chemically and mechanically stable Processable into a variety of shapes Hollow tubes, sheets, arbitrary 3D shapes Open foam or sponges Woven or nonwoven mesh-like structures High porosity High internal surface area to volume ratio Controllable pore size Promotes cell attachment Promotes angiogenesis Favorable interaction/mobilization of host cells Ability to release active compounds such as growth factors Ability of the cells and ECM materials to interact with the support structure Ability to obtain the desired cellular response 528 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Table 10.5 Materials for TERM Nonbiodegradable Applications Alginates Agarose Food additives, cell encapsulation Cell culture and cell encapsulation, scaffold Cellulose Bone tissue engineering Polydimethylsiloxane or silicone (PDMS) Breast, penile, testicular prostheses, catheters, drug delivery, heart valves, membrane oxygenators, shunts, tubing, orthopedics Silk fibroin Stem cell applications for cartilage and bone Ceramics and bioactive glass Bone repair Polyurethanes Artificial hearts and ventricular assist devices, catheters, intra-aortic balloons, wound dressings Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) Heart valves, vascular grafts, reconstruction, shunts, membrane oxygenators, catheters, sutures, coatings Polyethylene (PE) Artificial hips, catheters, shunts, syringes, tubing Polysulfone Heart valves, penile prostheses, artificial heart Polycarbonate Hard contact lenses Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) Bone cement, fracture fixation, intraocular lenses, dentures, plasmapheresis membranes Poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (PHEMA) Controlled drug release, contact lenses, catheters, coatings, artificial organs Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) Hemodialysis membranes Polyamides (nylon) Hemodialysis membranes, sutures Polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron) Vascular grafts, tissue patches, shunts Polypropylene (PP) Valve structures, plasmapheresis membranes, sutures Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) Tubing, plasmapheresis membranes, blood bags Poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) Drug delivery devices Polystyrene (PS) Tissue culture flasks Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) Blood plasma extender Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) Dental, tissue repair, scaffolds for bioartificial organs Biodegradable Applications Poly(l-lactic acid) (PLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) Controlled release drug delivery devices, sutures, scaffolds for cell transplantation and tissue engineering Collagen Artificial skin, hemostasis, tissue regeneration scaffold GAGs (hyaluronan) Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) Tissue repair, viscoelastic, wound care Bioscaffolds and tissue repair Chitosan Scaffolds for tissue engineering, inhibitors of blood coagulation, cell encapsulation, membrane barriers, contact lens materials Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) Controlled drug release, sutures, artificial skin Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) Implantable contraceptive devices, controlled drug release, surgical staples, scaffolds for cell transplantation and tissue engineering Polyphosphoesters (PPE) Cartilage and bone, nerve and organ regeneration (Continued) 529 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine intestine of pigs and consists of a rather loose scaffold of ECM materials. This scaffold of ECM materials comprises oriented collagen fibers, GAGs, and attached growth factors such as bFGF, VEGF, and TGF-β. PLA, poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) are naturally occurring hydroxy acids. They are biodegradable and have been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in sutures, controlled drug release, and surgical support fabrics (Cima et al., 1991a,b). A great deal of effort is focusing on these materials for tissue engineering applica- tions (Mooney et al., 1994, 1995a,b, 1996; Holder et al., 1997; Kaufmann et al., 1997; Blitterswijk, 2008). They degrade by hydrolysis and form natural by-products. Their absorption rate can also be controlled from months to years (Mooney et al., 1994, 1995a,b; Agrawal et al., 1995). The degrada- tion rate of these materials is dependent on their initial molecular weight, the surface area that is exposed, degree of crystallinity, and, for the case of copolymer blends, the ratio of the hydroxy acid monomers used (Pachence and Kohn, 1997). The resulting structure formed from a biomaterial must be mechanically strong enough to support the growth of the transplanted cells and chemically compatible with the intended duration of use. For example, cells secrete a variety of enzymes that may degrade the polymer used. For a biode- gradable material, this cell-induced degradation rate must be considered during formulation of the biomaterial to achieve the desired degradation rate. In the case of nonbiodegradable materials, they must withstand the cellular attack and not form by-products that are inflammatory or immunogenic and therefore capable of compromising the function of the implant. The material used to form the support structure will also generally be in direct contact with the host’s immune system and connective tissue such as fibroblasts. For any biomaterial, activation of the host’s immune system (Wiles et al., 2016), as well as a fibrotic connective tissue response, will tend to wall off and isolate the transplanted support structure blocking its intended function. The host’s reaction and formation of a fibrotic capsule around the implant is a function not only of the materials used but also depends on the shape and microstructure of the implant. Unlike in vitro tissue culture of cells wherein the cells are usually grown in only two dimensions, the transplanted support structure containing the cells needs to be three dimensional.

Biodegradable Applications 530 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering resulting 3D polymer scaffold must in general have high porosity, significant internal surface area, and a controlled pore size distribution. All of these properties must not compromise the structural strength of the material. 10.5.2 Techniques for making polymeric scaffolds Polymer scaffolds used in tissue engineering applications must be processable into whatever 3D shape is required for the implant. A variety of techniques may be used to process polymer scaffolds. These include methods such as fiber bonding, solvent casting, particulate salt-leaching, membrane lamination, melt molding, polymer/ceramic fiber composite foams, phase separation, and in situ polymerization (Lu and Mikos, 1996; Thomson et al., 1997; Ma and Choi, 2001). Another popular approach is electrospinning (Teo and Ramakrishna, 2006; Nam et al., 2007, 2008, 2009), which has the ability to easily produce porous structures that are highly interconnected and similar to that found in tissue and the ECM. The pore sizes of these scaffolds can be controlled by adjusting the electrospinning operating conditions such as the voltage, the distance between the spinneret and the grounded collection plate, and the solution viscosity. In addition, the macroscopic porosity can be controlled by combining electrospinning with the salt-leaching technique. Figure 10.5 shows microphotographs of a biodegradable open sponge-like scaffold and a mesh-like structure. Both of these scaffolds exhibit high porosity (>80%) and large pores. The poly(DTE car- bonate) shown on the left in Figure 10.5 was prepared by the salt-leaching technique. The resulting structure has pores in the range 200–500 μm and has been considered for bone regeneration. The PGA nonwoven mesh on the right has fibers 10–50 μm in diameter and has been considered for use in organ regeneration. These materials were shown to interact favorably with the surrounding tis- sue allowing for ingrowth of tissue and the formation of a vascular network throughout the support structure. 600 \u0000m 3521 15 kV 500 \u0000m (b)(a) Figure 10.5 Scanning electron micrographs of polymeric scaffolds for tissue engineering.

With permission.) 531 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine The high porosity of the structures shown in Figure 10.5 is also important for nutrient and product transport. To avoid the presence of nonvascular regions and to optimize implant size, it is important to be able to control the pore size distribution. A high internal-surface-area-to-volume ratio will also provide numerous sites for cell adhesion to the polymer support structure. A high internal surface area also allows for surface treatment of the polymer structure with ECM materials and/or growth factors in order to enhance interaction of the support with the transplanted cells and promote their proliferation and differentiation. The ECM can also be designed using macromolecular analogues with specific properties that enhance the scaffold’s use in tissue engineering applications (Welsh and Tirrell, 2000). In addition, synthetic hydrogels have been proposed that have biomimetic properties* in the sense that these materials have the ability to communicate with cells through the presentation of bound adhesion and growth factors, and they can be remodeled through the action of cellular proteases (Pratt et al., 2004). All of these traditional techniques for making scaffolds for TERM applications have been found to have some limitations, in particular, not being able to form the complex internal architecture found in tissues and organs. This has led to the development of newer techniques for making scaffolds popularly known as 3D printing and bioprinting. 10.5.2.1 3D printing 3D printing of tissue engineering scaffolds is a new approach that is very promising and is therefore receiving considerable attention for a variety of applications in TERM (Derby, 2012; Blakely et al., 2015; Holmes et al., 2015; Sears et al., 2016). These TERM applica- tions of 3D printing build on the significant advances that have been made in the field of rapid prototyping. 3D printing allows for the fabrication of scaffolds with complex shapes and internal architecture that can mimic closely an actual biological tissue or anatomical structure. In addition, during the scaffold design phase, a variety of scaffolds with varying internal architecture can eas- ily be designed and printed allowing for the optimization of the scaffold design for each specific application. In a typical acellular 3D process, the scaffold is made before the cells are added to the construct. The desired scaffold structures are designed using computer-aided design (CAD) software, which then translates the complex geometrical scaffold shape and internal architecture into a file that is then read by the 3D printer. The file format sent to the 3D printer is usually a *.stl, where stl is short for stereolithography, or a *.amf, where amf means additive manufacturing file. A special software in the 3D printer then reads these files and guides the printer to make the scaffold, layer by layer, in what is also known as an additive manufacturing process. There are many types of 3D printers and they generally fall into the following three categories (Sears et al., 2016) that are known as stereolithography (SLA), solid free-form fabrication (SFF), and powder-fusion printing (PFP). SLA uses a laser beam to photopolymerize a liquid resin material contained within a reservoir. The reservoir containing the resin material is lowered as each successive layer of the resin material at the surface is polymerized and hardened to form the desired shape of the scaffold material. SLA is a very promising approach for the 3D printing of scaffolds because there are many biocompatible photopolymers and the technique has a very high spatial resolution, with * Meaning to imitate a biological function or structure. 532 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering the thickness of each layer printed on the order of 20 μm. As an example, Neiman et al. (2014) describe the use of SLA to make open channel hydrogel scaffolds for the in vitro 3D perfusion of hepatocytes. The hepatocytes showed enhanced production of albumin in comparison to the same cells in 2D culture. SFF builds a polymeric scaffold layer by layer by extruding filaments or granules of a polymeric material through a heated nozzle onto a build platform where the extruded material hardens (Lee et al., 2010). SFF printers typically use polymers that can be melted and extruded through a nozzle at temperatures of about 200°C. Some common polymers that are being used include polycarbonate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, and polylactic acid (PLA). For TERM applications of SFF, there are also many biodegradable polymers and hydrogels (Hong et al., 2015) that can be used, and most of these melt at much lower temperatures. For example, polycaprolactone (PCL), which melts at 65°C, has been successfully extruded at a temperature of 125°C to form scaffolds with a honeycomb-like network of regularly sized pores (Zein et al., 2002; Sears et al., 2016). Hong et al. (2015) 3D printed a variety of hydrogel scaffold shapes using a mixture of sodium algi- nate and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The resulting hydrogel scaffolds that were printed using SFF were described as being tough and biocompatible. Hong et al. (2015) state that successful printing of 3D scaffolds using hydrogels is highly dependent on the viscosity of the pre-gel solution. The pre-gel solution should be pseudoplastic having a low viscosity at high shear rates, so it can easily pass through the printer nozzle and then have a higher viscosity at low shear rates so that the printed part can hold its shape. A technique similar to SFF, known as precision extrusion deposition (PED), has also been used to make polymeric scaffolds with a controlled 3D architecture consisting of interconnected pores with a uniform pore size distribution (Yildirim et al., 2008). PED builds the scaffold through layer-by- layer extrusion of the polymer based on a predefined geometry controlled by a CAD program. By giving the PED scaffolds made from polycaprolactone (PCL) an oxygen-based plasma treatment, it was found that cell adhesion was enhanced and cell proliferation increased. PCL has been shown to be particularly suited for bone tissue engineering applications because of its mechanical properties, good biocompatibility, and ability to biodegrade (Yildirim et al., 2010). PFP forms a thin layer of fine granular particles comprised of plastic or metal, which are fused together through the heating action of a laser. The layer is then recoated with more particles, and the sintering process is repeated until the desired shape has been made. In some cases, rather than using a laser, the particles can be fused together using special solvents and adhesives. One advantage of PFP is that the granular particles can be a mixture of different materials. In addition, this technique can use metallic particles of just about any composition to make shapes that have superior strength properties. Hence, there is much interest in this approach for making rigid structures such as bone. Once the scaffold has been 3D printed by one of these methods, it is then seeded with cells and cultured in vitro prior to implantation. In some cases, the scaffold may be implanted right after it is printed, and the patient’s cells in the implant site will infiltrate and take up residence within the scaffold and form new tissue. A particularly exciting clinical example of 3D printing is the bioresorbable airway splint (Zopf et al., 2013) used to treat a life-threatening condition in newborns known as tracheobronchomalacia, 533 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine which causes collapse of the airway. A bioresorbable tracheal splint customized specifically to the anatomy of the patient was designed based on a computed tomographic image of the patient’s air- way. A CAD based on the patient’s airway anatomy was then used to 3D print an airway splint from the biomaterial polycaprolactone (PCL). The institutional review board where this work was performed obtained an emergency-use exemption from the FDA so that this airway splint could be used to save a 2-month-old infant’s life. 10.5.2.2 Bioprinting The term bioprinting is also being used to describe processes that can print in three dimensions all of the components that are found in the tissue (Derby, 2012; Blakely et al., 2015). This means not only the various cell types found in the tissue but also the components of the ECM. In a method analogous to inkjet printers, bioprinting has the capability to strategically place different cell types and ECM materials (bioink) in each layer of the construct as it is created. When using stem or progenitor cells, the cells deposited at specific locations can be subsequently induced to differentiate into the desired cell type. With continued advances in this area, it may even be pos- sible to bioprint entire organs. Bioprinting processes are typically based on the techniques of extrusion printing, laser-assisted bio- printing (LAB), and inkjet printing (Sears et al., 2016). When 3D bioprinting living cells within the scaffold structure, a special consideration needs to be given to ensuring that the cells remain viable during and after the processing steps. Hence, the cell printing needs to be done in an environment that does not overly stress the cells and cause damage to them. Also, there are limitations on the environmental conditions that are used when printing cells. For example, the need for aqueous solu- tions containing nutrient media and temperatures in the range from ambient temperature to 37°C. Extrusion bioprinting is similar in some respect to SFF and uses a pseudoplastic fluid containing a mixture of the cells, ECM materials, and the scaffold biomaterials. The extrusion and subsequent gelation process to form the cellular scaffold must be done in such a manner that the cells are not harmed. One advantage of this approach is that a high cell density within the scaffold can be achieved accelerating the development of the desired tissue structure. Because the material extruded is usually water based with the consistency of a gel or a paste, this approach seems to be better for applications where the resulting softer scaffold structure can be used. LAB uses the energy from a pulse laser to precisely deposit the cells from a solution onto the sur- face of the substrate material. This approach has high precision and resolution, but the laser heating to evaporate the solution from around the cells can damage the cells. In addition, it is not an ideal approach for building large 3D scaffolds; hence, it is better suited as an adjunct to other 3D printing methods. Inkjet bioprinting utilizes the many advances in inkjet printing technology to precisely build up, layer by layer, both cells and other biomaterials to form 3D scaffolds. This technique can deposit with great precision in a predetermined pattern tiny droplets containing the cellular and scaffold materials. The complex 3D structure is then built up layer by layer as material and cells are depos- ited by the inkjets. The advantages of this approach include its inherent speed and the ability to have multiple inkjet nozzles each dedicated to depositing a particular bioink, i.e., a cell type or a particu- lar biomaterial. Hence, there can be a separate nozzle for each cell type, one or more nozzles for each ECM and scaffold material, and perhaps other nozzles for growth factors. All of these materials can be laid down in whatever pattern is desired for the bioprinted scaffold. 534 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 10.6 Biocompatibility and the initial response to an implant In the best of situations, the implanted scaffold structure becomes vascularized by the host during the period of time the transplanted cells are also increasing in number. However, the metabolic demands of the transplanted cells, in some cases, cannot be met by the vasculature that is also developing at the same time within the implant. In these cases, it may be better to first implant the support structure, allowing it to become vascularized, and then to transplant, or seed the cells, at a later point in time (Takeda et al., 1995). This gives the transplanted cells the opportunity to start in a well-vascularized region, thus eliminating any transport limitations due to the metabolic require- ments of the transplanted cells. Prevascularization of the implant can also be enhanced by first seeding the implant with the host’s endothelial cells (Holder et al., 1997). The endothelial cell–loaded scaffolds are believed to enhance vascularization by any or all of the following mechanisms. The endothelial cells can form new cap- illaries, they may provide chemical signals (ECM and growth factors) for growth of blood vessels, and they may merge with the host’s own vascular ingrowth. Immobilization of growth factors on the support material, or within controlled release microspheres, can also be used to facilitate vascular- ization and improve survival of the transplanted cells (Thompson et al., 1988, 1989; Mooney et al., 1996; Madry et al., 2014). The success of a particular scaffold used in a tissue engineering application will also depend on its biocompatibility, which depends in part on the host’s complex immune response (Wiles et al., 2016). The immune system as it pertains to TERM and bioartificial organs will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 11. The immune response comes from the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate immune response to a tissue engineered implant is driven primarily by phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages that recognize the biomaterials as foreign objects. The adaptive immune response has two components, and these are known as the cell-mediated response and the humoral response. The hallmark of the adaptive immune system is specificity and memory. The cell-mediated response primarily involves activated helper and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. The helper T-cells secrete cytokines that stimulate macrophages and B-lymphocytes. The humoral response involves these activated B-lymphocytes that secrete antibodies that bind to specific antigens on for- eign objects marking them for consumption by phagocytes. Biocompatibility is the ability of the biomaterial to not provoke the immune system and to be able to withstand whatever the response is from the host’s immune system. Because of a material’s biocom- patibility, it can perform its intended function with little or no harm being done to the surrounding tissues or in a larger sense to the host. Hence, a biomaterial should not release anything that is toxic; not promote a response by the immune system (nonimmunogenic); if in contact with blood, not cause clots to form (nonthrombogenic); and not cause cancer (noncarcinogenic). How the body responds to a particular biomaterial will also depend on how the biomaterial was processed. For example, the biomaterial’s composition and the presence of contaminants and impu- rities, degree of crystallinity, porosity, surface properties, degradation kinetics, sterility, and wear- ability all play a role in determining the biocompatibility of a given biomaterial. Biocompatibility, however, is not just intrinsic to the biomaterial being used but also depends to a significant degree on the patient. Hence, it is expected that biocompatibility will vary to some degree among patients as a 535 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine result of their general health, age, sex, lifestyle, and sensitivity of their tissues and immune system to the particular biomaterial being used. 10.6.1 The body’s response to an implant The first response after implant of a tissue engineering scaffold will be the adsorption of a variety of proteins and macromolecules on the surfaces of the scaffold material. These molecules will initi- ate a host response that will include both localized inflammatory and immune responses, as well as processes that promote the repair and regeneration of any damaged tissues. In addition, there will also be infiltration of the scaffold by a variety of cell types. All of these processes will determine whether or not the scaffold is successfully incorporated into the host. This process is very similar to what occurs during wound healing and involves three somewhat overlapping phases referred to as inflammation, proliferation, and maturation (Arnold and West, 1991; Hammar, 1993). The inflammation period lasts for several days and involves the arrival of platelets and neutrophils. Activation of the clotting process and release of growth factors (PDGF, EGF, TGF) (Alberts et al., 1982) lead to the formation of a collagen-free fibrin network that serves as a scaffold for the inflam- matory cells. The neutrophils release factors that attract monocytes and also ingest foreign material by phagocytosis. The monocytes also enter the site and are transformed into macrophages and, when fused together, become foreign body giant cells. The giant cells continue to clean up the site remov- ing dead tissue and bacteria and walling off large debris. During the proliferative phase, the macrophages release a variety of factors (PDGF, TGF, EGF, and FGF) that activate the migration and proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells. The fibroblasts release a variety of ECM materials and begin to form a collagen network. The generally low oxygen levels within the site will also stimulate the movement and growth of capillary sprouts from the sur- rounding vasculature. These capillary sprouts are formed from endothelial cells and invade the site of the implant forming a vascular bed. Over a period of weeks, the entire site becomes vascularized and this marks the end of the proliferative phase. The maturation phase involves final remodeling of the site resulting in contraction of the wound and organization of the collagen matrix. This is also a critical time for tissue engineering applications since the reduced oxygen demand of the cells involved in wound healing can result in regression of the vascular supply. 10.7 Cell transplantation into scaffolds Thompson et al. (1988, 1989) in a classic set of experiments were one of the first to show that porous polymeric scaffolds are capable of developing within their confines a neovascularized tissue region that could support the differentiated function of the transplanted cells. They induced the formation of organoid neovascular structures in rats using PTFE fibers coated with collagen and the angiogenesis initiator acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF). The fibers were about 20 μm in diameter, and a bundle or cotton ball–like mass of these fibers was implanted within the abdominal cavity adjacent to the liver. To demonstrate the efficacy of a cellular transplant using the vascularized PTFE support structure, they used as a host for the implant the Gunn rat. Homozygous Gunn rats lack the liver enzyme needed 536 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering for the conjugation of bilirubin. Recall that bilirubin is a product obtained from hemoglobin at the end of a red blood cell’s life span. The conjugated form of bilirubin is readily passed from the liver via the bile and then removed from the body through the feces. Since the Gunn rat cannot conjugate bilirubin, its plasma bilirubin levels are increased significantly from the normal level of <1 mg dL−1. The Wistar rat is genetically identical to the Gunn rat except that it has the ability to conjugate bili- rubin. In their initial set of experiments, Thompson et al. obtained hepatocytes from the livers of the syngeneic Wistar rats. These hepatocytes were then seeded onto collagen-coated PTFE fibers that did not contain the angiogenesis promoter aFGF. This structure was then implanted adjacent to the liver of the Gunn rat. Because the Gunn and Wistar rats are genetically the same, there is no need for immunosuppressive agents or immunoisolation of the transplanted cells. For the first 10 days after implantation, the plasma bilirubin levels remained unchanged as shown in Figure 10.6a. By the 20th day, the plasma bilirubin levels had decreased by about 50%. Shortly (b) (a)Serum bilirubin, mg dL−1Serum bilirubin, mg dL−1 12 10 8 6 4 2 10 8 6 4 2 10 20 30 40 50 Time, days 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 Figure 10.6 Plasma bilirubin levels following transplantation of hepatocytes into Gunn rats. (a) Collagen-coated PTFE support structure with hepatocytes added at time of implantation. (b) Collagen-coated PTFE support structure with aFGF. Hepatocytes added 28 days after implantation. (From Thompson, J.A. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86, 7928, 1989. With permission.) 537 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine thereafter, the plasma bilirubin levels returned to their original high levels and remained there for the remaining days of the experiment. The lack of long-term function of the hepatocytes in these preliminary studies can be attributed to several effects. First, the angiogenesis factor, aFGF, was not used in these first experiments. This resulted in less vascularization of the support structure. Furthermore, the cells were seeded into the support structure at the time of implant. The lack of a good vascular supply at the time of cell seed- ing is clearly not optimal for cell growth and the transport of nutrients and bilirubin. This accounts for the delayed response with regard to any effect on the plasma bilirubin levels. For the first 10 days, the implant was still in the process of tissue ingrowth and the development of a blood supply that is needed for efficient mass transport. It also allowed for the accumulation of bile acids that led to the death of the cells after about 20 days. Clearly, these results show that seeding the cells at the time the support structure is implanted is not the best approach. In their second set of experiments, the collagen-coated PTFE fibers containing adsorbed aFGF were first implanted. After 28 days, a suspension of Wistar rat hepatocytes was seeded into the network of the now vascularized fibers. As shown in Figure 10.6b, we see that the plasma bilirubin levels began to decrease within 1 day. After about 10 days, the plasma bilirubin levels had decreased by about 50%, and at the end of the 120-day experiment, this reduction was >60%. These results strongly suggest that polymeric scaffold structures, through their ability to form their own vascular supply, can be used to sustain the long-term function of transplanted cells. Additionally, it appears from these results to be better to first vascularize the support structure for several weeks before seeding the implant with the transplanted cells. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that transplanted cells carrying a normal gene are able to restore the function lost by the host’s own genetically compromised cells. 10.8 Bioreactor design for tissue engineering Critical to the success of tissue engineering for many applications is the in vitro culturing of cells or tissue within the 3D scaffold. In vitro culturing will allow the cells to establish the desired tissue within the scaffold prior to implantation into the patient. This in vitro culture is facilitated through the use of specially designed bioreactors that provide precise control over the environmental condi- tions that are conducive to the establishment of a viable tissue engineered construct that is ready at the appropriate time for transplantation into the patient (Martin and Vermette, 2005; Mazzei et al., 2010; Schmelzer et al., 2014). The use of these custom-designed bioreactors improves the level of control and facilitates the reproducibility and scalability of the processes used to manufacture a tissue engineered construct. Hence, a bioreactor will provide much better control over the culture conditions than what is achievable in standard 2D tissue culturing techniques. A bioreactor there- fore provides an opportunity for the seeded cells to differentiate and populate the construct and create an ECM. A bioreactor can be designed and customized for the unique 3D shape of a tissue engineered construct and will also provide control of process variables such as temperature, pressure, pH, dissolved oxygen levels, nutrient supply, and waste product removal. In addition, a bioreactor can be designed to provide for mechanical stimulation or conditioning of the construct, which in many cases is crucial for the proper differentiation of the cells (Carver and Heath, 1999; Finlay et al., 2016). 538 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The use of bioreactors also improves control over the manufacturing process, reducing production costs while improving overall product quality. This ensures that the tissue engineered construct meets product specifications and that these products comply with good manufacturing practices and meet the criteria set by regulators such as the FDA. The design of a bioreactor for a specific tissue engineering application involves the consideration of several key factors. First, we need to address how the cells are seeded or loaded into the polymeric scaffold. Cell seeding can be as simple as pipetting a solution containing the cells onto the surface of the construct allowing capillary action to draw this solution of cells into the scaffold structure. A more efficient method of seeding the cells is to pump or perfuse a solution of cells through the pores of the construct. Perfusion seeding of the cells will give a more uniform initial distribution of cells in the construct. Once the cells have been distributed into the scaffold, the bioreactor design must be capable of keep- ing these cells alive. Without the proper distribution* of key nutrients and oxygen throughout the scaffold, there will be regions near the interior where the cells cannot survive resulting in a nonuni- form cell density throughout the scaffold. The deposition of ECM materials like GAGs has also been shown to be dependent on the local oxygen concentration (Obradovic et al., 2000). Oxygen transport therefore is often the limiting nutrient not only for keeping the cells alive but also to ensure that the cells proliferate and establish an ECM. In addition, waste products cannot be allowed to accumulate within the construct since these products can harm the cells. Figure 10.7 illustrates the four basic approaches that can be used for the design of a bioreactor. Static culture techniques simply rely on diffusion to distribute key nutrients and oxygen to the cells, and this approach is similar in concept to a multiwell plate. Static culture has significant internal and external diffusion limitations and, in general, cannot be used as a large-scale tissue engineer- ing bioreactor. Another approach is to eliminate external diffusion limitations by inducing fluid motion over the surface of the construct. This can be accomplished by agitation, which causes a flow of media across the surfaces of the construct. A rotating bioreactor can also achieve a flow of * The transport of oxygen and key nutrients in a bioreactor can be described using the principles outlined in Chapters 5 through 7. Reactor design principles are discussed in Section 9.6.9. Media Static culture Media Agitation Media Rotation Media Perfusion Microflow channel Construct Cells Media Figure 10.7 Bioreactor configurations. 539 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine the media across the surfaces of the construct and eliminates any damage to the constructs by the agitator. Although agitation or rotation can eliminate external diffusion limitations, there can still be significant internal diffusional barriers* that can affect the viability and the properties of the tissue in the interior regions of the construct. Hence, bioreactors for tissue engineering applications may need to provide some means of perfusing the innermost regions of the construct with the nutrient media. Perfusion of the construct with the culture medium results in the convective transport of these nutrients into the innermost regions of the construct, which is much more efficient than what can be obtained by diffusion alone. Perfusing the construct with the culture medium will therefore improve the transport of oxygen and key nutri- ents (Tilles et al., 2001; Allen and Bhatia, 2003; Kitagawa et al., 2005; Zhao and Ma, 2005; Mehta and Linderman, 2006; Lee et al., 2010; Gardel et al., 2014; Schmelzer et al., 2014). As shown in Figure 10.7, perfusion bioreactors provide for a convective flow of the nutrient media over the surface of a very thin layer of cells.† This involves designing the porous structure of a scaf- fold with nutrient channels to ensure that the culture media is uniformly distributed to all the regions of the construct (Mehta and Linderman, 2006). These microflow channels can be designed into the porous construct using 3D microfabrication techniques (Lee et al., 2010; Park et al., 2010). This will ensure that key nutrients and oxygen can reach those cells located in the most interior regions of the construct. In addition, the perfusion medium can also be loaded with oxygen carriers such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs) (Radisic et al., 2004, 2005). As discussed in Section 7.12, PFC solutions overcome the low solubility of oxygen in water with the result that significantly more oxygen can be transported. In many applications, the cells that are loaded into the construct must be exposed to the proper bio- mechanical environment in order to differentiate properly (Gemmiti and Guldberg, 2009; Mathes et al., 2010; Shaikh et al., 2010; Finlay et al., 2016). This is known as mechanical or physical con- ditioning of the cells as they grow and differentiate in the in vitro environment of the bioreactor. For example, it is well known that cells can respond to a variety of forces that are caused by fluid flow, pressure, and dynamic loading. Hence, cells can respond to forces related to shear, strain, pressure, and mechanical loads. In many cases, it is therefore necessary to incorporate these physi- ological forces into the operation of the bioreactor so that the cells differentiate into the desired tis- sue. Examples where mechanical conditioning has been shown to be important include the tissue engineering of blood vessels, heart valves, tendons and ligaments, cartilage, bone, oral tissues, and intervertebral disks. Example 10.1 A construct for a tissue engineering application consists of a polymeric scaffold that incorpo- rates cylindrical flow channels so that the culture media can be perfused through the construct during in vitro culture. Each flow channel in the scaffold is 300 μm in diameter, and the length of each flow channel is 25 mm. Surrounding and concentric to each flow channel is a cylindri- cal volume of tissue whose thickness is 50 μm. The tissue in the construct consumes oxygen at the rate of 10 μM s−1 based on the total scaffold volume in the region that contains the tissue. * See Sections 9.6.4 through 9.6.8 for a discussion on internal diffusion and reaction phenomena in porous materials. In this case, the enzyme kinetics will be replaced by the cellular kinetics for a particular substrate of interest. † See Sections 7.9.1 and 7.9.2 for a discussion of oxygen transport in perfusion bioreactors. 540 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The pO2 of the culture media entering the flow channels is 150 mmHg. Estimate the flow rate of the media per flow channel (cm3 h−1) so that the pO2 in the tissue region is greater than 20 mmHg. Also calculate the pO2 of the media leaving the flow channel. Assume that the Henry’s constant for the nutrient media is 0.74 mmHg μM−1 and the oxygen diffusivity in the tissue surrounding the flow channel is 2.41 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 (Bentley et al., 1993). Solution The cylindrical flow channels within the construct are similar in concept to the Krogh tissue cylinder discussed in Section 6.4. In this case, oxygen is just a dissolved solute in the culture media, so we do not have to take into account the binding of oxygen with hemoglobin as was done when we have blood. We can therefore use Equation 6.82 to describe the oxygen concen- tration in the tissue region that surrounds each flow channel in the construct.

Also the flow channel is in intimate contact with the surrounding tissue, so L and Pm are both equal to zero. The overall mass transfer coefficient (KO) is then equal to the mass transfer coefficient (km) for the media in the flow channel. Using Henry’s law (pO2 = HoxygenC) to replace the oxygen concentration with the pO2, the previous equation becomes pOr ,L pO RH Vr rr L RH r T in A oxygen c Tc A oxygen c 22 2 22 2 () =- -() - max max kk rr RH D rr RH r Dm Tc A oxygen T Tc A oxygenT T 22 22 2 42 -()+-()- maxmax ln rr r T c æ è ç ö ø ÷ This equation can then be solved for the average velocity of the culture media in a flow chan- nel recognizing that km depends on the unknown value of V. The value of V is adjusted until the pO2 in the lethal corner equals 20 mmHg. The analysis of this problem shows that the flow is laminar and that the concentration profile in the media flowing through the flow channel is not fully developed, so Equation 5.169 is used to calculate the mass transfer coefficient. When Equation 5.169 is used in the previous equation, the required average velocity of the media flowing in the flow channel is found to be 0.129 cm s−1, which gives a volumetric flow rate of media per flow channel of 0.327 cm3 h−1. From Equation 6.80, the exiting pO2 of the media can be found as shown below: pO mmHg mmHg MM scm cm s out 2 11 12150 074102 5 0 129 0 015 =- ´´ ´ -- - .. .. mm ccm cm pOmmHg out 2 22 2 2 0020 015 38 5 .. . -() = 541 Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine Problems 10.1 Consider a bioreactor for growing a cornea. Within this bioreactor, glucose diffuses from a well-stirred bulk liquid solution across a thin hydrogel layer and then the glucose diffuses and reacts within a multilayer of epithelium, which lies on top of the hydrogel layer (Perez et al., 1995). The epithelium consists of N layers of cells, each cell hc in thickness. The cells consume glucose at a first order volumetric rate given by k1C, where C is the local concentra- tion of glucose and k1 is the first order rate constant. The surface of the cells exposed to the gas phase above is a no flux boundary for glucose, and C will therefore attain its minimum value at that interface (Cmin). Calculate the fractional drop C C b min æ è ç ö ø ÷ in the glucose concentration from the bulk liquid medium (Cb) to the outermost epithelial surface (Cmin).

Topics covered in your presentation should include a description of the clinical need, the methodology used, results that have been obtained (in vitro, in animals, and the status of any human clinical trials), the potential clinical impact, potential market impact, safety issues, and additional development needs. 10.4 Design a tissue engineered system for the delivery to the systemic circulation of human growth hormone (hGH). hGH has a molecular weight of 22,000 g mol−1.

The production rate of hGH from these cells is about 2500 10 24 6 ng cells h . The plasma concentration of hGH should be maintained at about 10 ng mL−1. Assume hGH has a half-life in the body of about 2.3 h. Describe your system for delivering hGH and carefully state all assumptions. How many cells will be required for the delivery of the hGH? 10.5 Write a paper that addresses some of the ethical issues associated with tissue engineering. 542 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 10.6 Redo Example 10.1 assuming the scaffold construct is perfused with culture media containing an insoluble PFC material at a volume fraction of 0.60. The PFC material forms an emulsion that has an enhanced solubility for oxygen. The Henry’s constant for the PFC material is equal to 0.04 mmHg μM−1, where the μM refers to the volume of the PFC oxygen-carrying material only. The Henry’s constant for dissolved oxygen in the aqueous portion of the artificial blood is 0.85 mmHg μM−1. 10.7 Radisic et al. (2006) measured the oxygen gradients in cultured constructs containing cardiac tissue. The scaffolds were made from collagen sponges that were thin round disks nominally 1.8 mm in radius and 1.8 mm in thickness. In addition to measuring the oxygen gradient within these constructs, they also measured the cell viability, which was found to decrease exponentially with depth (z) according to the following equation, δ(z) = ae−bz, where δ(z) is the live cell density at position z. Assuming that the oxygen concentration only depends on the scaffold radius and depth, show that the oxygen concentration within the scaffold is given by the following equation: D rr r C r C z Vz C KC V oxygen oxygen 1 2 2 ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + ¶ ¶ æ è ç ö ø ÷ = () + = max md aaxae C KC bz oxygen - + The boundary conditions (BCs) for the above equation are based on known measurements of the oxygen concentration at the top, side, and bottom surfaces of the scaffold and are given by BC Cr,C BC Cr,L C BC CR,z C BC C r top bottom top r 10 2 3 4 : : : : () = () = () = ¶ ¶ =00 0 ,z = Boundary condition 4 expresses the fact that the oxygen concentration is symmetric about the centerline of the scaffold along the z axis. In the above equation, Doxygen is the effec- tive diffusivity of oxygen within the scaffold, C is the concentration of oxygen, and it was assumed by these researchers that the oxygen consumption can be described by the Michaelis- Menten equation. Hence, Vmax is the maximum oxygen consumption rate per cell. Koxygen is the Michaelis constant and is the concentration of oxygen where the oxygen consumption rate is equal to one-half of Vmax. The following table summarizes the values of key parameters that were reported in their study.

(1995) presented the steady-state data in the table below for the distribution of NGF in the vicinity of a thin cylindrical controlled drug release device implanted into the brain of a rat. The polymeric disks containing radiolabeled I125-NGF were 2 mm in diameter and 0.8 mm in thickness. NGF has a molecular weight of 28,000 g mol−1. Assume that the NGF is eliminated from the brain tissue by a first order process, i.e., the rate of elimination is proportional to the concentration of NGF, i.e., kapparent CNGF where kapparent is the apparent first order elimination rate constant for NGF and accounts for processes such as metabolism, cel- lular internalization, or uptake by the brain’s systemic circulation. Then develop a steady-state reaction-diffusion model to analyze these data. The boundary conditions, assuming the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system to be the midline of the polymeric disk, are as follows: C Catx aand CxNGF NGF== == ¥0 0 where a is the half-thickness of the polymeric disk.

The treatment of a disease or medical problem using this approach requires the availability of the appropriate cells and the creation of an artificial support structure or scaffold to contain them. The cells may be obtained from a variety of sources, e.g., from an expanded population of the host’s own cells (perhaps genetically modified), from other compat- ible human donors, from animal sources, or even from genetically engineered cell lines. The cells to be transplanted are then seeded into a polymeric scaffold or construct. The scaffold can then be placed within a bioreactor and then implanted in the patient at the appropriate time. However, with the exception of autologous cells, one of the major obstacles that must be overcome is the rejec- tion of the transplanted cells by the host’s immune system. The transplanted cells will be destroyed quickly by the host’s immune system unless they are immunologically similar to the host’s own cells (Benjamin and Leskowitz, 1991). Immunosuppressive drugs can be used to suppress the host’s immune system and prolong the func- tion of transplanted cells that are a relatively close match to the host. However, immunosuppressive drugs have potent side effects, and in the case, e.g., of transplanting the islets of Langerhans, or their β cells, to treat insulin-dependent diabetes, these drugs may result in a situation where the cure is worse than the disease. Genetically engineered cell lines, in addition to their possibly being rejected by the host’s immune system, also pose additional risks that need to be considered. For example, the direct implantation of an immortal (usually of tumor origin) cell line can lead to the unchecked growth of the implanted cells. There is also the risk of these cells moving and proliferating at a site other than the desired site, and they can change to a potentially hazardous form with the loss of their original therapeutic function. In some applications, the full potential of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine will be limited unless techniques can be developed to either restrict the host’s immune response or somehow modify the transplanted cells to make them more acceptable to the host’s immune system, i.e., immunomodification (Lanza and Chick, 1994b). 11.2 Some immunology The immune response to foreign materials (antigens) such as transplanted cells is primarily an adaptive response consisting of a cell-mediated component and a humoral component (Benjamin and Leskowitz, 1991; Gray, 2001). The major cellular components are the B-lymphocytes and the T-lymphocytes. The B-lymphocytes, or B cells, form in the bone marrow and, when properly acti- vated by antigens, form proteins called antibodies that comprise the active agents of the humoral component of the immune system. The T-lymphocytes originate in the thymus and come in two basic types, the CD4+ (helper) T cells and the CD8+ (killer or cytotoxic) T cells. 546 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The immune system is activated by its intimate contact with foreign molecules called antigens (antibody generating). Antigens must possess foreignness, meaning the antigen is unlike anything the immune system has seen before. Immature B- and T-lymphocytes that react against self-antigens (e.g., the body’s own proteins) are eliminated during their maturation phase in the bone marrow or the thymus. This is known as the clonal deletion theory. Thus, the mature B and T cells are self- tolerant and do not normally react against the body’s own tissues. Antigens generally have molecular weights >6000 g mol−1 and possess some degree of molecu- lar complexity. In fact, there can be many sites along the surface of such large molecules that are immunogenic.* These sites are referred to as epitopes. Fortunately, many synthetic polymers used as biomaterials, although of high molecular weight, do not possess a sufficient amount of molecu- lar complexity to provoke an immune response. Lower molecular weight materials, although not immunogenic by themselves, can associate, e.g., with larger carrier molecules, like a protein, to give an immune response directed at the lower molecular weight compound. In this case, the lower molecular weight compound is referred to as a hapten. 11.2.1 B-Lymphocytes Each B cell has a unique antibody receptor on its surface that only recognizes a specific antigen. The B cell inventory within an individual is capable of producing as many as 100 million distinct antibodies. This allows the immune system to respond to almost any known or unknown antigen. If a specific B cell comes into contact with its corresponding antigen, it becomes activated through a process that we shall later see also involves the CD4+ or helper T cells. The activated B cell then begins to reproduce, rapidly increasing the number of B cells that are specific for a given antigen. This expanded collection of B-lymphocytes with a given specificity is referred to as a clone of lym- phocytes. This selection by the antigen of a specific reactive clone of lymphocytes from a large pool of existing lymphocytes, each with their own unique antigen specificity, is called the clonal selection theory. These B cells then differentiate to form plasma cells that begin to secrete antibodies with the same antigen specificity. 11.2.2 Antibodies Antibodies are proteins and are also called gamma globulins or immunoglobulins. They comprise about 20% of the total amount of protein found in plasma. There are five classes of antibodies that are called IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, where Ig stands for immunoglobulin and the letter desig- nates the antibody class. The basic structure of an antibody molecule consists of a pair of light poly- peptide chains and a pair of heavy polypeptide chains held together by disulfide bonds, as shown in Figure 11.1. Conceptually, the antibody molecule is Y shaped, with each light chain paired in the upper branches of the Y with the heavy chains that form the Y structure. The molecule consists of three fragments. Two of these fragments are identical and reside at the top of the Y, and each of these binds with antigen. These fragments are referred to as Fab, for fragment antigen binding. The base of the Y is * An immunogen is a molecule that can induce a specific response of the immune system. An antigen refers to the ability of a given molecule to react with the products of an immune response, e.g., the binding of an antigen to an antibody. In this discussion, we will assume that antigen and immunogen are synonymous. 547 Bioartificial organs called the Fc fragment, for fragment crystallizable. The Fc fragment does not bind with antigen but is responsible for the biological activity of the antibody after it binds with antigen. The Fc fragment is referred to as a constant region in terms of its amino acid sequence since it is the same for all anti- bodies within a given class. Since the Fab fragments bind to antigen, their structure is highly vari- able in order to provide the multitudinous shapes or conformations required for antigen specificity and recognition. The specific antigen binding characteristics of the Fab fragments is determined by their unique sequence of amino acids. Although an activated B cell (or plasma cell) makes antibod- ies with only a single antigen specificity, it can switch to make a different class of antibody, while still retaining the same antigen specificity. IgG is the major immunoglobulin in the body and is found in all the fluid spaces in the body. It consists of a single Y-shaped molecule with a molecular weight of about 150,000 g mol−1. IgG has several important biological properties that are found in some of the other antibody classes as well. Because of its ability to bind two antigens per IgG molecule, IgG can cause the clump- ing or agglutination of particulate antigens such as those of invading microorganisms. These large antibody-antigen complexes are then readily phagocytized by phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. In the case of smaller soluble antigens, this cross-linking of antigen and IgG leads to much larger complexes that become insoluble and precipitate out of solution and are then phagocytized. IgG is also capable of binding to a variety of epitopes found on the surfaces of invading cells. The cell then becomes covered with IgG molecules that have their Fc fragments sticking out. Many phagocytic cells have surface receptors for the IgG Fc fragments allowing the phagocyte to bind to, engulf, and then destroy the invading organism. IgG is therefore an opsonizing antibody (opsonin is a Greek word that means to prepare for eating) since it facilitates the subsequent “eating” of the invading microorganism or cell by phagocytic cells. The Fc receptor on an IgG molecule bound by the Fab fragments to a cellular antigen also binds to specific receptors on so-called natural killer lymphocytes (NK cells). The NK cells will then be attracted to and destroy the invading cell by the release of toxic substances called perforins (Ojcius et al., 1998). Perforins form channels in the cell membrane of the target cell, making them leak and resulting in the death of the cell. This process is called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cyto- toxicity, or ADCC. Antigen binding site Heavy chain Light chain Fab fragment Fc fragment, biological activity S-S SS S S Figure 11.1 Structure of an antibody. 548 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering IgG is also capable of neutralizing many toxins by binding to their active site. Viruses are also neu- tralized in a similar manner. In this case, the IgG molecule binds and blocks sites on the virus’s sur- face coat that is used by the virus for attachment to the cells it normally invades. IgG, when bound to antigen, is also capable of activating the complement system. The complement system consists of a group of protein enzyme precursors that when activated undergo an amplifying cascade of reactions that generate cell membrane attack complexes (MACs) that literally punch holes through the cell membrane. This results in the lysis and death of the targeted cell. IgA is found primarily in the fluid secretions of the body, e.g., in saliva, tears, mucous, and gastro- intestinal fluids. It is found in a dimeric form, i.e., it consists of two Y-shaped antibodies linked at the base of the Y. The molecular weight of this antibody is about 400,000 g mol−1. Its primary role is as a defense against local infections where it stops the invading microorganism from penetrating the body’s epithelial surfaces that line the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. It does not activate the complement system. IgM forms a planar star-like pentamer and consists of five antibody molecules joined together at the base of the Fc fragments. Its molecular weight is about 900,000 g mol−1, and it is found mainly in the intravascular spaces. It has only five antigen binding sites because the restricted pentameric struc- ture does not allow the Fab fragments to be open fully. Therefore, large antigens bound to one Fab will block the adjacent Fab. IgM is a very efficient agglutinating antibody since its large structure provides for binding between epitopes that are widely spaced on the antigen. IgM is also an excel- lent activator of the complement system. IgM is also found on the surface of mature B-lymphocytes where it serves as the specific antigen receptor. IgD is also present primarily on the cell surface of the B-lymphocytes and is believed to be involved in the maturation of these cells. It exists as a single antibody molecule and therefore has a molecular weight of about 150,000 g mol−1. Not much is really known about this antibody, although, it does seem to play a role in B cell activation and also activates basophils and mast cells stimulating them to make antimicrobial agents. Finally, IgE also exists as a single antibody molecule and has a molecular weight of about 200,000 g mol−1. The Fc fragment of the IgE molecule binds with high affinity to specific receptors found on mast cells and basophils. Mast cells are found outside of the capillaries within the connective tissue region (see Figure 10.3). Mast cells are involved in the process of inflammation and are responsible for the secretion of heparin into the blood as well as histamine, bradykinin, and serotonin. Basophils are a type of white blood cell or granulocyte that mediates the inflammation process through release of these same substances. When antigen binds to two adjacent cell surface-bound IgE molecules, the cell (mast or basophil) becomes activated and releases a host of potent biologically active compounds such as his- tamine. These agents are responsible for the dilation and increased permeability of the blood vessels. In normal situations, these changes facilitate the movement of the immune system components, such as white blood cells, antibodies, and complement, into localized sites of inflammation and infection. However, in people with allergies, a particular antigen, in this case called an allergen, stimulates the IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils, leading to the unwanted effects of an allergic reaction. 11.2.3 T-Lymphocytes The T-lymphocytes are the other major cell type that forms the basis of the cell-mediated immune response. The T cells are characterized by the presence of an antigen-specific T cell receptor, or TcR. 549 Bioartificial organs The TcR consists of an antigen-recognizing molecule called Ti in close association with another polypeptide complex called CD3. The T cells, unlike the B cells, are not, however, activated by free antigen. T cell activation requires that the antigen be presented by other cells such as macrophages or other B cells. These cells that present antigen to the T cells are collectively called accessory cells or antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The APCs ingest and breakdown the polypeptide antigen into much smaller fragments. These fragments then become associated with special molecules called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). There are two major types of MHC molecules, called MHC class I and MHC class II. Recall that these molecules belong to the class of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). The MHC class I molecule is expressed by almost every nucleated cell found in the body. The MHC class II molecule is only found in specialized APCs such as B cells and macrophages. The MHC molecule forms an antigen binding area in the shape of a cleft or pocket. This pocket can accept polypeptide antigens consisting of up to 20 amino acids. The complex of small antigen and MHC is then transported to the surface of the cell where the antigen is presented for recogni- tion by the TcR. The T cell therefore only recognizes antigen in combination with the MHC molecule. T cell antigen recognition is shown in Figure 11.2. On the left side of this figure, we see a foreign material such as a dead virus, a cancer cell, a microorganism, or a large polypeptide being ingested and broken down by an APC. The antigen, in combination with an MHC class II molecule, is then transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation. On the right side of this figure, we see a live virus infecting the cell. As the virus takes over the operation of the cell to increase the number of viruses, many of the viral peptides that are produced are transported to the cell surface by MHC class I molecules for antigen presentation. The presence of antigen and MHC class I will then be recognized by the T cell. However, in either case, the TcR by itself has a low affinity for antigen bound to MHC. To facilitate the recognition and binding of the TcR with the antigen/MHC complex, there exist two important accessory molecules called CD4 and CD8 that also serve to distinguish between the two principal types of T cells. (b)(a) Foreign material Antigen Antigen and MHC class II Virus Viral antigen Antigen and MHC class I Figure 11.2 Presentation of antigen by MHC class I and II molecules. (a) Antigen-presenting cell and (b) virally infected cell. 550 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering T cells that have the CD4 molecule are known as CD4+ or helper T cells, whereas those that have the CD8 molecule are known as CD8+ or cytotoxic T cells. CD4+ T cells only recognize antigen that is bound to the MHC class II molecule on the surface of an APC (see Figure 11.2a). The CD8+ T cell can only recognize antigen that is bound to the MHC class I molecule on the surface of all other nucleated cells found in the body as shown in Figure 11.2b. This is called MHC restriction, i.e., the response of CD4+ T cells is restricted to only that antigen bound to MHC class II molecules, whereas the response of CD8+ T cells is restricted to only that antigen bound to MHC class I molecules. 11.2.4 Interaction between APCs, B cells, and T cells With this background, we can now examine the cooperative relationship that exists between the APCs, B cells, and T cells during the immune response. First, let’s consider the interaction between a resting CD4+ T cell, an APC, and a B cell. This is illustrated in Figure 11.3. The first step involves the ingestion by an APC of an antigen that, in this example, contains both a B cell epitope and a T cell epitope. The APC could be a macrophage that engulfs the antigen, or a B cell that internal- izes the antibody-antigen complex. The T cell epitope is then expressed on the surface of the APC in combination with an MHC class II molecule. A CD4+ T cell that has a Ti-CD3 receptor that is specific for this particular antigen then binds with the antigen/MHC class II complex. Note that the CD4 molecule stabilizes the binding of the antigen/MHC complex with the TcR. This binding of the CD4+ T cell and the antigen/MHC class II complex constitutes the first signal for the activation of the CD4+ T cell. This is then followed by the release of a second signal by the APC of a soluble substance called interleukin-1 (IL-1) that is also essential for T cell activation. IL-1 is a small protein with a molecular weight of 15,000 g mol−1 that belongs to a class of substances called lymphokines. Lymphokines are cellular messengers that have an effect on other lymphocytes and are a subcategory of a broader class of intercellular messengers called cytokines. The CD4+ T cell then becomes activated and begins to secrete its own interleukins, specifically IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5. Foreign material Antigen APC B cell Proliferates, differentiates, and secretes antibodies CD4+ T cell proliferates Ti-CD3-CD4 receptor complexIL-1 IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 Antigen-MHC class II Figure 11.3 Interaction between APC, CD4+ T cell, and the B cell. 551 Bioartificial organs IL-2 induces the CD4+ T cell to proliferate, rapidly forming a clone of CD4+ T cells that are reactive to the specific antigen presented by the APC. IL-4 then activates the B cells, and IL-5 induces the activated B cells to proliferate in number, forming a clone of B cells. It is important to note that binding of antigen with the B cell receptor is not sufficient for the B cell to become activated and then differentiate to antibody-secreting plasma cells. The B cell must become activated through the process shown in Figure 11.3, which also involves the CD4+ T cell. Additionally, the B cell need not bind with the same epitope that activated the T cell. Hence, the activated B cell may release antibodies with a different epitope specificity. Since the CD4+ T cell is responsible for the activation of the B cell, it is referred to as the helper T cell. The activated CD4+ T cell also secretes other lymphokines, such as γ-interferon, that serves to attract and activate mac- rophages and NK cells and inhibits viral replication. Figure 11.4 illustrates how the CD8+ T cell becomes activated. Here, we see that the CD8+ TcR binds with the antigen/MHC class I complex presented, e.g., by a virally infected cell. Once again, the CD8 molecule stabilizes the interaction between the TcR and the antigen/MHC complex. This binding of TcR and antigen/MHC complex represents the first signal. In order for the CD8+ T cells to proliferate, i.e., form a clone of CD8+ T cells and become activated, it also must receive a second signal that is provided by the IL-2 that is released as a result of the activation of the CD4+ T cell shown in Figure 11.3. The activated CD8+ T cell will then kill any cell that expresses the appropri- ate combination of antigen and MHC class I. The activated CD8+ T cell accomplishes this cellular destruction through the release of special molecules called perforins that destroy the cell membranes of the target cell. Because of their role in cell death, the CD8+ T cells are also known as cytotoxic T cells or killer T cells. 11.2.5 The immune system and transplanted cells The previous discussion illustrates the complexity as well as the coordination that exists between the different components of the immune system. The immune system through an elegant process is capa- ble of recognizing self from non-self. Our interest here is to prevent or restrict the action of the immune Virus Antigen-MHC class I CD3-Ti-CD8 receptor complex IL-2 from active CD4+ T cell CD8+ T cell proliferates and secretes perforins Virally infected cell Figure 11.4 Activation of CD8+ T cells. 552 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering system toward the transplanted cells. The immune system response to transplanted cells involves a combination of effects resulting from antibodies, complement, macrophages, B cells, and T cells. Antibodies recognize the foreign antigens presented by the transplanted cells and induce the destruc- tion of the transplanted cells through the activation of the complement system and NK cells by the process of ADCC. The rejection of the transplanted cells also occurs by a T cell response against the MHC molecules that are expressed by the transplanted cells. The transplanted cells contain foreign MHC class I and class II molecules. The foreign MHC class II molecules are present on passenger leukocytes and macrophages that are present in the transplanted tissue. The foreign MHC class II molecules are sufficiently similar to the host’s own combination of antigen/MHC class II complex to trigger the activation of the CD4+ T cells. This is also true for the foreign MHC class I molecules, leading to the activation of the host’s CD8+ T cells. The activation of these T cells and the antibody- producing B cells then leads to the destruction of the transplanted cells. 11.3 Immunoisolation A promising method for restricting the host’s immune response is to immunoisolate the transplanted cells (Lanza et al., 1995; Zielinski et al., 1997; Gray, 2001; Ludwig et al., 2013; Neufeld et al., 2013). This concept was shown earlier in Figure 10.2. Figure 11.5 presents a more detailed view of immu- noisolation showing the possible pathways for the rejection of the transplanted cells (Colton, 1995). Immunoisolation can be accomplished through the use of a specially designed polymeric membrane that prevents the passage of the major components of the immune system, i.e., the immune cells, antibodies, and complement. Immunoisolation membrane Membrane pore Immunoisolated cells Immune cells T, B, and macrophages Antigens Antibodies Complement components Cytokines Figure 11.5 Pathways for rejection of immunoisolated cells involve both humoral and cellular components of the immune system. 553 Bioartificial organs The immune response occurs as a result of antigens shed by the transplanted cells. These antigens may be products secreted by the functioning cells or materials released by the death of the trans- planted cells. These antigens will cross the immunoisolation membrane and, when recognized and presented by the host’s immune system, lead to the cellular and humoral immune responses dis- cussed earlier. To restrict the passage of cells such as lymphocytes and macrophages, the pores or spaces within the immunoisolation membrane must be no larger than a micron or so. Recent evidence indicates that blocking the entry of the cellular component of the immune system is sufficient to prevent the rejec- tion of allografts (Colton, 1995). This is of special interest for applications involving allogeneic cells for gene therapy (Chang et al., 1993; Liu et al., 1993; Hughes et al., 1994; Al-Hendy et al., 1995; Chang, 1997, Zalzman et al., 2003). However, openings that restrict the entry of immune cells will still allow the passage of antibodies and complement, which must be blocked for the successful use in a bioartificial organ of xenoge- neic cells. Therefore, the solute permeability characteristics of the immunoisolation membrane are critical for achieving the successful immunoisolation of xenogeneic transplanted cells. This requires that the membrane have significant permeability to essential small molecular weight solutes such as oxygen, glucose, growth factors, and molecular carriers such as albumin and transferrin.* The membrane also must be permeable to waste products and to the therapeutic product, e.g., in treat- ment of diabetes, this would be insulin. On the other hand, the membrane must have negligible permeability to the humoral components of the immune system, i.e., antibodies, complement, and various cytokines and lymphokines. As we discussed earlier, antibodies have molecular weights ranging from 150,000 to 900,000 g mol−1. Naturally occurring antibodies of the IgM class exist in the host and are reactive against the MHC of xenografts. In addition, antibodies produced from autoimmune diseases such as diabetes would be expected to bind to antigens on donor islets of Langerhans. In the absence of immune cells, antibody binding to antigens on the surface of the transplanted cells is usually not sufficient to damage the cells. However, if both antibodies and complement are present, then the transplanted cells can be destroyed by complement activation and formation of the MAC (Iwata et al., 1996). The complement system is activated by two different routes called the classical pathway and the alternative pathway. The classical pathway requires the formation of antigen-antibody complexes for its initiation, whereas the alternative pathway does not. The alternative pathway becomes acti- vated in response to the recognition of large polysaccharide molecules present on the surface of the cell membranes of invading microorganisms. As far as the immunoisolation of transplanted cells is concerned, the classical pathway is of most interest for this discussion. The activation of the classical pathway involves nine protein components known as C1 through C9. C1 is the first component to become activated and requires the binding with antigen of either two or more adjacent IgG antibodies or a single IgM antibody. C1 consists of three subunits called C1q, C1r, and C1s. Their molecular weights are respectively 400,000, 95,000, and 85,000 g mol−1. The C1q sub- unit is the first subunit activated, and it binds with the Fc fragment of the bound antibodies. Its activa- tion then activates the C1r subunit which then activates the C1s subunit which activates C4 and so on. * Albumin carries fatty acids and transferrin carries iron. 554 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering As we discussed earlier, in the absence of immune cells, the binding of antibody with antigen is not sufficient to damage the transplanted cells. The destruction of the antibody-laden cell will require the presence and activation of complement. Since the C1q subunit must bind with either IgM or several IgG to start the cascade of complement reactions, the immunoisolation membrane must be capable of preventing the passage of the C1q molecule. C1q has an interesting molecular shape as shown in Figure 11.6. The critical dimension of C1q is the span of the six projections from the cylindrical base, which is about 30 nm. Because of the presence of proteins coating the walls of the pores in the immunoisolation membrane, the maximum pore size allowable for blocking C1q is on the order of 50 nm (Colton and Avgoustiniatos, 1991; Colton, 1995; Zielinski et al., 1997). Several other issues with regard to immunoisolation also need to be considered. The immunoisola- tion membrane may be capable of preventing the passage of immune cells and complement C1q. However, the activation of the immune cells by antigens released by the transplanted cells will also result in the release of such lymphokines as IL-1 and other cytotoxic agents such as nitric oxide, per- oxides, and free radicals. These substances can be toxic to the transplanted cells. Lymphokines have small molecular weights, typically around 20,000 g mol−1, and because of their small size may pass through the immunoisolation membrane. Several studies, however, have shown that immunoisolated cells were not affected by the presence of IL-1 (Zekorn et al., 1990). Substances such as IL-1, and other highly reactive species, may be consumed by other reactions before they can penetrate the immunoisolation membrane to any significant distance (Colton, 1995). In addition, many bioartifi- cial organs operate at very low tissue densities in order to provide for the effective oxygenation of the transplanted cells. The reduced tissue density results in a lower concentration of shed antigens and hence a reduced concentration of humoral agents. The shed antigens could also cause the host to undergo a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction* or to suffer from antibody-mediated hypersensitivity reactions.† Lanza et al. (1994) examined these issues by transplanting immunoprotected canine and porcine islets into rats. The islets were encased * A result of a significant release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine causing severe hypotension and bronchiolar constriction.

However, there was no evidence of any other pathological effects of these antibody-antigen immune complexes. Subsequent studies using immunoprotected human islets in human patients with diabetes (Scharp et al., 1994; Shiroki et al., 1995) have shown that the immunoisolation membrane can protect against not only the allogeneic immune response but also against the autoimmune components responsible for the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). 11.4 Permeability of immunoisolation membranes Figure 11.7 presents permeability data obtained on a hollow fiber immunoisolation membrane for a variety of solutes of different molecular weight (Dionne et al., 1996). This particular membrane was made from a copolymer of acrylonitrile and vinyl chloride. The permselective membrane consists of a thin skin on either side of a much thicker spongy wall region that provides overall structural strength. The thickness of the spongy wall was about 100 μm, and these membranes were similar to those that were successfully used in preliminary tests to immunoisolate human islets in patients with diabetes (Scharp et al., 1994). These membranes had a reported nominal molecular weight cutoff of 65,000 g mol−1. Notice how the permeability of this membrane at first decreases gradually as the solute molecular weight increases. As the solute molecular weight continues to increase, the permeability decreases much more rapidly. This can be explained by recalling our equation for solute permeability given by Equation 6.15. The size of low molecular weight solutes is much smaller than the pores in the membrane. For these solutes, steric exclusion (K) and solvent drag (ωr) effects caused by the pore wall are negligible. The decrease in permeability is therefore directly related to the decrease in sol- ute diffusivity, which according to Equations 5.40 and 5.41, is inversely proportional to the solute radius, or the one-third power of the solute molecular weight. This is also shown as the dashed line in Figure 11.7. As the solute size reaches a critical fraction of the membrane average pore size, steric exclusion and solvent drag become more important, and the solute permeability rapidly decreases with increasing solute molecular weight. These data also clearly show the problem of defining the nominal molecular weight cutoff (NMWCO) for the membrane. There does not exist a molecular weight above which the solute permeability drops to zero. Surprisingly, we see that even very large molecules, here at the extreme represented by a molecular weight of about 440,000 in Figure 11.7, have a measurable permeability. Therefore, a membrane’s molecular weight cutoff is very subjective and dependent on the definition that one chooses to apply. For example, some membrane manufacturers define the molecular weight cutoff on the basis of the 90% retention of a given solute after so many hours of dialysis. Others base it on the ultrafiltration of a solution in which a particular solute is 90% retained. Although the exact nature of the pores or openings within the membrane is not known, descriptions such as those based on the hydrodynamic pore model developed in Chapter 6 (see Equation 6.12) provide a useful framework for understanding the transport of various solutes and also provide a means for correlating data. The data shown in Figure 11.7 can therefore be used to obtain an esti- mate of the average pore size in the membrane. This is shown in the following example. 556 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Example 11.1 Using the solute permeability data shown in Figure 11.7, determine the average size of the pores in the membrane. Recall that the membrane is 100 μm thick. The table below summa- rizes the physical properties of the solutes that were used. Use the hindered diffusion model developed by Bungay and Brenner (1973) to describe the effect of the pore size on the diffu- sion of the solute. This equation is used, rather than the Renkin model given in Equation 6.12, because the Bungay and Brenner equation is generally valid for the entire range of the ratio of solute to pore size, i.e., 0 ≤ a/r ≤ 1. The Renkin equation is only valid for a/r < 0.4 and may not provide a correct description of the diffusion of larger molecules in comparably sized pores. In the Bungay and Brenner model, ωr = 6π/Kt in the permeability equation given by Equation 6.15. Kt is given by the following equation. In this equation, a is the molecular radius and r is the pore radius: K a r z a r zt n n n n n=- æ è ç ö ø ÷ +- æ è ç ö ø ÷ é ë ê ê ù û ú ú + - ==åå 9 4 21 11 2 52 1 2 0 4 p / ++ æ è ç ö ø ÷3 a r n with z1 = −1.2167, z2 = 1.5336, z3 = −22.5083, z4 = −5.6117, z5 = −0.3363, z6 = 1.216, and z7 = 1.647.

Therefore, the observed permeability is given by the following equation assuming the two skins are equivalent in their resistance to mass transfer: 12 1 P DK L D L m skin AB skin skin sponge AB sponge sponge r =+ e t e t w The porosity of the sponge is assumed to be about 0.8, and the tortuosity of the sponge is assumed to be unity. The nonlinear regression analysis is based on two variables, the pore radius (r) and a parameter α. The parameter α accounts for the group e t skin skin skinL for which the individual values of the parameters are not known. Since the permeability values vary over several orders of magnitude, it is appropriate to define the objective function for the regres- sion analysis in terms of the natural logarithm of the permeabilities. Hence, we write the sum of the square of the errors for the nonlinear regression analysis as follows for the data points ranging from i = 1 to N: SSE r, PP i, r, i N mi mcalcaa() = ()- ()()é ë ù û =å 1 2 ln ln The result of the regression analysis is shown in Figure 11.8 and provides an estimated pore diameter of 14.2 nm. 0 2 4 6 1.104 1.105 1.106 1.107 1.108 1.109 0.001 Permeabilities vs molecular radius Solute radius, nmPm, cm s–1 Pi Pcalc (i, α, r) ai, ai Figure 11.8 Measured and predicted permeabilities in an immunoisolation membrane. 558 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 11.5 Membrane Sherwood number The solute permeabilities shown in Figure 11.7 can also be compared to the permeability the solute would have in an aqueous layer that has the same thickness as the membrane itself. Therefore, we can write the following equation that expresses the ratio of these respective permeabilities: P P P D L PL D D D Sh m aqueous layer m AB m AB e AB m= === (11.1) We see that this ratio of permeabilities is equivalent to defining a Sherwood number for the mem- brane, i.e., Shm, that represents the ratio of the effective diffusivity, i.e., DP Lem= , of the solute through the membrane to that of the aqueous solute diffusivity. This process has the effect of elimi- nating membrane thickness (L) as a variable when correlating membrane permeability data. The data shown in Figure 11.7 are replotted as the membrane Sherwood number versus solute molecular weight in Figure 11.9. We see that for low molecular weight solutes, the membrane Sherwood number is relatively constant. In this example, it is about 0.68. As the solute molecular weight is increased and the solute size becomes comparable to that of the pores, the membrane Sherwood number begins to decrease rapidly. 11.6 Examples of bioartificial organs Bioartificial organs contain living tissue or cells that are immunoisolated by polymeric mem- branes with the properties discussed earlier. These devices are also known as hybrid artificial organs since they consist of both artificial materials and living tissue or cells. Bioartificial organs are being considered for the treatment of a variety of diseases, such as diabetes, liver failure, and kidney failure, and neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s disease; for the control of pain; and for the delivery of a variety of therapeutic products secreted by genetically engineered cell lines.

(Data from Dionne, K.E. et al., Biomaterials, 17, 257, 1996.) 559 Bioartificial organs For diabetes, the bioartificial organ contains insulin-secreting and glucose-responsive cells that secrete, minute by minute, the appropriate amount of insulin needed to maintain blood glucose levels within a very narrow range (Scharp and Marchetti, 2014; Bartlett et al., 2016). Bioartificial livers and the bioengineered kidney (Attanasio et al., 2016) attempt to replace all of the physiologi- cal functions of these complex organs. The treatment of neurological disorders involves the use of specialized genetically engineered cells that secrete neuroprotective and neuroactive products such as dopamine, nerve growth factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or brain-derived neu- rotrophic factor. Immunoprotected cells that secrete pain-reducing neuroactive compounds such as β-endorphin are being considered for the treatment of pain resulting from cancer. Genetically engi- neered cell lines can also be used to treat a variety of other diseases. Examples include providing a specific hormone (e.g., growth hormone), replacing missing clotting factors in hemophilia (factor VIII or IX), and providing needed enzymes in such diseases as adenosine deaminase deficiency that results in severe combined immunodeficiency disease. More details about these specific applica- tions of bioartificial organs may be found in the list of references. In the following discussion, we will look at bioartificial organ replacements for the endocrine cells of the pancreas, the liver, and the kidney as representative systems. 11.6.1 The bioartificial pancreas The focus of much of the research and development on bioartificial organs has been on the treatment of IDDM, or type I diabetes, with a bioartificial pancreas. This is because IDDM is a chronic disease with many serious complications such as blindness, kidney disease, gangrene, heart disease, and stroke, which lead to a poorer quality of life for those afflicted with this dis- ease. IDDM is caused by an autoimmune process (Notkins, 1979; Atkinson and MacLaren, 1990) that destroys the insulin-secreting β cells found within the islets of Langerhans. The islets of Langerhans are scattered throughout the pancreas and represent about 1%–2% of the pancreas mass. Both environmental (viruses or chemicals) and hereditary factors are also involved in the development of type I diabetes. Type I diabetes therefore represents a major health problem in the United States. Over 1.5 million people in the United States have this disease, and an addi- tional 30,000 cases are diagnosed each year in that country alone. The cost of healthcare for patients with IDDM is tens of billions of dollars each year. Although a pancreas transplantation can eliminate the need for exogenous insulin, this approach is limited by the shortage of donor organs and the complications and side effects associated with the required immunosuppressive drugs. Insulin is a small protein (6000 g mol−1) and the key hormone involved in the regulation of the body’s blood glucose levels. In diabetes, insulin is no longer produced by the β cells found in the islets of Langerhans. In the absence of insulin, glucose levels in the blood exceed normal values by several times. This is a result of the body’s cells not being able to metabolize glucose. Without the ability to use glucose as an energy source, the body responds by metabolizing fats and proteins with a corresponding increase in the body fluids of ketoacids such as acetoacetic acid. This excess acid results in a condition known as ketoacidosis, which, if left untreated, can lead to death. The conventional treatment for IDDM involves the daily administration of exogenous insulin to replace the insulin that is no longer produced by the patient’s β cells found within the islets of Langerhans. This results in the almost normal metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. However, even with exogenous insulin, the patient’s blood glucose levels are not controlled as well 560 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering as normal. The healthy islet β cells are able to regulate the release of insulin in such a manner so as to maintain blood glucose levels within a narrow range, about 80–120 mg dL−1. Insulin injections are not capable of providing such close control because of the difficulty of properly timing the injec- tions and the inherent insulin transport delays from the site of injection. The abnormally high blood glucose levels, or hyperglycemia, in patients treated with exogenous insulin is now believed to be the primary cause of the long-term complications of diabetes (American Diabetes Association, 1993). These elevated blood glucose levels lead to protein glycosylation that damages the microvasculature and other tissues in the body. Methods have recently been developed that allow for the isolation of mass quantities of the islets of Langerhans from the pancreas of humans and from large mammals such as pigs, thus providing a potentially unlimited supply of donor islet tissue (Ricordi et  al., 1988, 1990a,b; Warnock et al., 1988, 1989; Inoue et al., 1992; Ricordi, 1992; Lanza and Chick, 1994a; Lacy, 1995; Lakey et al., 1996; Maki et al., 1996; Cheng et al., 2004; Grundfest-Broniatowski et al., 2009; Ludwig et al., 2013; Neufeld et al., 2013; Scharp and Marchetti, 2014). The use of these allogenic or xenogeneic cells without immunosuppression requires that they be immunoisolated in a device such as a bioartificial organ. Transplanting the donor islets without immunoprotec- tion is only warranted in those cases where the patient is already receiving immunosuppressive therapy, e.g., as a result of a kidney transplant to treat end-stage renal disease. In an otherwise healthy patient with diabetes, immunosuppressive drugs and their attendant problems would not be needed if the islets were immunoisolated. The immunoisolation of the islets would not only protect them from the host’s normal response to foreign tissue but also from those agents of the immune system that caused the original autoimmune destruction of the patient’s own cells. These immune system memory cells are still capable of responding to the antigens that resulted in the original destruction of the patient’s own islets and could possibly destroy the donor islets or donor β cells. Immunoisolation requires the use of an immunoisolatory membrane that has the following prop- erties. First, it must be biocompatible and have a solute permeability profile that allows for the efficient transport of small molecules such as oxygen, key nutrients, and insulin. In addition, the immunoisolation membrane must exclude immune cells and immunoactive molecules. Because of the limitations on oxygen transport, the transplanted cells need to be within a hundred microns or so of the capillaries, which serve as the oxygen source, or there needs to be a means of providing an oxygen source (Ludwig et al., 2013; Neufeld et al., 2013). The insulin-secreting cells and the immunoisolation membrane also need to be easy to assemble and sterilize before implantation in the patient. Since there is the possibility that the device can lose function over time, there either needs to be a means to resupply the device with more insulin-secreting cells or the device needs to be easy to remove from the body so that a new device can be implanted. The goal of the bioartificial pancreas is therefore to utilize the glucose regulating capability of healthy donor islets to provide improved blood glucose control in patients with type I diabetes. This approach should minimize the complications of the disease and improve the quality of the patient’s life. Because of the advances in genetic engineering, there is also the possibility of using geneti- cally engineered β cells (Efrat, 1999; Zalzman et al., 2003; Tatake et al., 2007) instead of the islets of Langerhans. Genetically engineered β cells that can respond to changing glucose levels with the appropriate insulin response will ensure a consistent source of cellular material for use in a bioarti- ficial pancreas. 561 Bioartificial organs 11.6.1.1 Bioartificial pancreas approaches A variety of approaches have been described over the years for the bioartificial pancreas, and most of these have been tested extensively in animals. An excellent review of these devices can be found in the early papers by Colton and Avgoustiniatos (1991), Mikos et al. (1994), Lanza et al. (1995), and Colton (1995), as well as in more recent reviews by Scharp and Marchetti (2014), Song and Roy (2016), and Bartlett et al. (2016). A series of books related to islet transplantation and the bioartificial pancreas have also been published (Ricordi, 1992; Lanza and Chick, 1994c). These devices can be broadly classified into the following three categories: intravascular (with and without ultrafiltration), microencapsulation, and macroencapsulation. These approaches are illus- trated in Figure 11.10. Of concern in any of these approaches for a bioartificial pancreas are the ability of the device to be readily fabricated and seeded with islets or cells, their stability and reliability over an extended period of time, and their cost. These issues also relate to the overall biocompatibility of the device. Specifically, device toxicity, immune system response, the potential for fibrotic encapsulation, and for intravascular devices, the potential for thrombosis. Furthermore, the devices must be capable of maintaining the long-term viability of the donor tissue and have the proper mass transfer character- istics to normalize blood glucose control. This requires a proper understanding of the critical role of oxygen transport (Colton, 2014), along with the mass transfer properties of the immunoisolation and the device itself. 11.6.1.2 Intravascular devices The intravascular devices (Figure 11.10a and b) (Chick et  al., 1977; Moussy et  al., 1989; Lepeintre et  al., 1990; Sarver and Fournier, 1990; Maki et  al., 1991, 1993; Petruzzo et al., 1991; Sullivan et al., 1991; Lanza et al., 1992a,b,c,d,e, 1993) involve a direct Blood flow Artery Vein (a) Islet of Langerhans (c) (d) (b) Arterial blood Ultrafiltrate (uf) Venous blood Figure 11.10 Approaches for a bioartificial pancreas: (a) intravascular without UF, (b) intravascular with UF, (c) microencapsulation, and (d) macroencapsulation. 562 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering connection to the vascular system of the host via an arteriovenous shunt. Blood flows through the lumen of small polymeric hollow fibers or in the spaces between flat membrane sheets. Adjacent to the blood flow path, and protected by the immunoisolation membrane, are the islets. An advantage of this type of device is that the convective flow of the blood provides the potential for better mass transfer rates than what can be obtained by simple diffusion from the tissue surrounding the device. The close contact with a sizable flow of blood also offers the potential for good tissue oxygenation. In some cases, an ultrafiltration flow (UF) of plasma (Figure 11.10b) from the arterial side can flow through the immunoisolation membrane and enter the region that contains the islets (Reach et al., 1981, 1984). Recent advances in ultrathin silicon nanopore membranes have brought about a renewed interest in the intravascular approach (Fissell et al., 2009; Song et al., 2016). This UF then leaves the islet compartment and reenters the venous blood, much like the Starling flow found in capillaries. The UF has the potential of greatly enhancing the transport of oxygen to the transplanted cells (see Section 7.9.1and Example 7.10) as well as improving the glucose-insulin kinetics of the device. The primary disadvantages of the intravascular approach are the surgical risk associated with device implantation, connection to the host’s vascular system, the potential to form blood clots, and the complexity of the surgery needed for device removal at a later time. One of the first pioneering experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of the intravascular approach for a bioartificial pancreas was performed by Chick et al. (1977). A rat with chemically induced diabetes was connected ex vivo to an intravascular device containing cells obtained from neonatal rats. The device used in these experiments consisted of a bundle of 100 hollow fibers with diameters less than 1 mm and a fiber length of 11 cm. The fibers had a nominal molecular weight cutoff of about 50,000 g mol−1. After connection of the animal to the ex vivo intravascular device, there followed a rapid decrease in blood glucose levels reaching normalized values of 110–130 mg dL−1 (considered normal for a rat) after about 6 h. After the removal of the device, blood glucose levels rapidly increased and returned to their diabetic levels. These results indicated the feasibility and the potential of the bioartificial pancreas for the treatment of IDDM. A particularly serious problem with devices that contained numerous hollow fiber membranes was the formation of blood clots in the entrance and exit header regions of the device. These regions of the device, where the bloodstream is either expanding or contracting, tend to form secondary flows or swirls that induce the formation of blood clots. In an effort to minimize the formation of blood clots, without the use of anticoagulants such as hepa- rin, a device with a single coiled hollow fiber membrane tube was developed by Maki et al. (1991). This device consists of an annular-shaped acrylic chamber 9 cm in diameter and 2 cm thick. The chamber contains a 30–35 cm length of a coiled hollow fiber tube with an inner diameter of 5–6 mm and a wall thickness of 120–140 μm. The hollow fiber tube was connected at each end to polytetra- fluoroethylene arterial grafts that provided the connection of the device to the vascular system by an arteriovenous shunt. The larger bore size of the single hollow fiber tube eliminates the thrombosis observed in smaller bore hollow fiber tubes and in the header regions of the device described earlier. Low-dose aspirin therapy was also found to contribute to long-term patency through aspirin’s ability to prevent platelet activation. 563 Bioartificial organs The hollow fiber membrane had a nominal molecular weight cutoff of about 80,000 g mol−1. A cavity surrounded the coiled hollow fiber membrane and provided a 5–6 mL volume for the placement of the islets of Langerhans. This device was evaluated in pancreatectomized dogs using allogeneic canine islets and xenogeneic bovine and porcine islets. The device was implanted within the abdominal cavity and anastomosed to the left common iliac artery and the right com- mon iliac vein. This device was able to demonstrate improved blood glucose control for varying periods of time using both allo- and xenogeneic islets (Lanza et al., 1992a,b,c,d,e). For example, in a dog implanted with a single device containing about 42,000 canine islet equivalents,* prior to device implantation, this particular dog had a fasting blood glucose level of 230 mg dL−1 and required about 16 U day−1 of insulin.† After implantation, no exogenous insulin was provided for the 280-day period of the experiment. During the first 140 days, the fasting blood glucose was nearly normal and averaged 116 mg dL−1, which compares favorably to the value of 91 mg dL−1 observed in normal dogs. After 140 days, glucose control began to deteriorate over the rest of the experiment. Results obtained with xenogeneic implants containing porcine islets in this device were also very encouraging (Maki et al., 1996). Prior to receiving porcine islets, one particular dog had a fasting blood glucose level of 479 mg dL−1 and required 39 U day−1 of insulin. After this dog received 216,000 EIN of porcine islets, fasting blood glucose averaged 185 mg dL−1 and exogenous insulin averaged about 10 U day−1. This device failed after 271 days of operation. An analysis of the por- cine islets after device removal did not show any evidence of immune cell infiltration. These tests therefore presented clear evidence that xenogeneic porcine islets could be protected from the host’s immune system using immunoisolation membranes. The only major complication in the use of these devices in dogs was vascular thrombosis. However, this clotting problem may be unique to dogs because of their known hypercoagulability. 11.6.1.3 Microencapsulation The microencapsulation approach (see Figure 11.10c) involves the placement of one or several islets within small polymeric capsules (Sun et al., 1977, 1996; Altman et al., 1986; Gharapetian et al., 1986; Sugamori and Sefton, 1989; Lum et al., 1991; Soon-Shiong et al., 1992a,b, 1993; Lanza et al., 1995, Tun et al., 1996). The microcapsules are then injected within the peritoneal cavity. The diameter of the microcapsule is typically in the range of 300–600 μm. Other microencapsulation approaches include immunoprotective surface or conformal coatings of the islets, which results in a much thinner layer of polymer material that encloses the islets (Pathak et al., 1992). Microencapsulation provides diffusion distances on the order of 20–200 μm and very high surface areas per volume of islet tissue. Accordingly, the small size of a microcapsule provides good dif- fusion characteristics for nutrients and oxygen, which improves islet or cell viability. This also provides for a good glucose-insulin response that offers the potential for normalization of blood glucose levels. The microcapsules usually consist of the islet or cellular aggregates immersed within a hydrogel material with another eggshell-like layer that provides the immunoisolation characteristics and * The equivalent islet number (EIN) is defined as the number of islets 150 μm in diameter that are equivalent in volume to a given sample of islets. † Insulin dose is based on U(nits) of insulin where 1 U of insulin = 34.7 μg of insulin. 564 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering mechanical strength. A wide variety of polymer chemistries have been described for the hydro- gel and the immunoprotective layer, and some of these are described in the following references: Gharapetian et al. (1986, 1987), Sefton et al. (1987), Douglas and Sefton (1990), Matthew et al. (1993), Lanza et al. (1995), and Sun et al. (1996). Of particular concern in selecting the microcapsule chemistry is the formation of a fibrotic capsule around the encapsulated islet. Fibrotic capsule formation can severely limit the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen, resulting in the loss of islet or cellular function. The success of the microencapsula- tion approach is therefore strongly dependent on choosing membrane materials that minimize this fibrotic reaction. An example of the microencapsulation approach was described by Soon-Shiong (1994) and demon- strated in large animals and several human patients. They used an alginate-poly-l-lysine encapsula- tion system. Alginates are natural polymers composed of the polysaccharides mannuronic acid and guluronic acid. Soon-Shiong (1994) showed that the high mannuronic acid residues in the alginate are responsible for the fibrotic response. Mannuronic acid was shown to induce the lymphokines IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor, which are known to promote the proliferation of fibroblasts and lead to fibrotic capsule formation. By reducing the alginate’s mannuronic acid content and increasing the guluronic acid content (>64%), they were able to minimize the fibrotic response. The higher gulu- ronic acid content also provided another benefit. It was found that alginates with higher guluronic acid contents were mechanically stronger. These modified alginate microcapsules were evaluated in a series of nine spontaneously diabetic dogs. Three of the dogs received free unencapsulated islets, and the other six dogs received encap- sulated islets. The donor islets were obtained from other dogs, and each recipient received their quantity of islets by an intraperitoneal injection. The islets were provided at an average dose of about 20,000 EIN kg−1 of body weight. Exogenous insulin was stopped four days prior to islet injection, and the plasma glucose levels at that time averaged 312 mg dL−1. The first day after receiving the islets, the blood glucose levels were reduced to an average of 116 mg dL−1 in those animals that received encapsulated islets and aver- aged 120 mg dL−1 in those receiving free islets. The rejection of the unprotected free islets occurred rapidly with hyperglycemia returning in about 6 days. The animals receiving encapsulated islets exhibited normoglycemia for periods of time ranging from 63 to 172 days, for a median period of 105 days. The failure of the encapsulated islets was attributed to membrane failure as a result of the water-soluble nature of the alginate system. Sun et  al. (1996) developed a microencapsulation system for islets using alginate-polylysine- alginate microcapsules. Most microcapsules contained only a single islet and had diameters in the range of 250–350 μm. Preclinical studies were done using microencapsulated porcine islets implanted into spontaneously diabetic cynomolgus monkeys. Seven monkeys receiving an average of 16,100 EIN kg−1 body weight were insulin independent for an average of 289 days. The shortest duration of control was 120 days and the longest 803 days. Prior to receiving the islets, fasting blood glucose levels averaged 353 mg dL−1. Following the transplant, fasting blood glucose lev- els averaged 112 mg dL−1. During the experiments, blood samples from the animals were tested repeatedly for the presence of antiporcine islet antibodies. No antibodies were detected, confirm- ing the presence of an effective immunoisolation of the porcine islets. Diabetic control animals also received unencapsulated islets. However, normal glucose levels were only maintained for 565 Bioartificial organs about 9 days after which the islets were destroyed by the host’s immune system with a return to pretransplant diabetic levels of the blood glucose. The results obtained from using the microencapsulation approach are very promising. However, there still are some technical difficulties with this approach that must be overcome. The strength and integ- rity of the microcapsules needs to be improved to provide long-term functioning and viability of the islets. The aggregation of the microcapsules is also a problem as this affects their mass transfer characteristics and impacts glucose control and islet survival. The total volume for the smaller micro- capsules of Sun et al. (1996) is modest. For example, using their monkey results and assuming a 70 kg patient, a total of 1.1 million EIN would be required (16,100 EIN kg−1 body weight). With one islet per 300 μm diameter microcapsule, this amounts to a total bead volume of only 16 mL. The loss of islet function with time can be compensated for by the injection of fresh microcapsules. The retrieval of the small microcapsules could be difficult if this should be necessary after their introduction. 11.6.1.4 Macroencapsulation Macroencapsulation (see Figure 11.10d) involves placing numer- ous islets within the immunoisolation membrane structure. Typical approaches involve the use of hollow fibers that encase the islets (Altman et  al., 1986; Lacy et  al., 1991; Lanza et  al., 1991, 1992b,c,e), a much larger flat bag-like structure (Inoue et al., 1992; Gu et al., 1994; Hayashi et al., 1996), thin polymeric hydrogel sheets (Storrs et al., 2001), or a thin scaffold laminated to a thin immunoisolation membrane (Grundfest-Broniatowski et  al., 2009). Their larger size and smaller number also make retrieval less of a problem in comparison to microcapsules. The major limitation of the macroencapsulation approach is that oxygen needs to diffuse over rela- tively large distances from the surrounding tissue and then through the layer of islets within the device itself (see Figure 7.7 and Example 7.6). The design challenge is to provide enough islets in a single device to achieve normoglycemia in the patient while being able to provide sufficient oxygen transport to keep the islets alive (see Problems 7.29 and 7.30). This oxygen diffusion limitation means that the islet volume fraction within the device is rather small. This makes planar designs for these devices rather thin, which provides for better oxygen transport to the islets. However, the device radius can be rather large to provide enough volume to hold the required dose of islets for normoglycemia. This means that several devices may be needed to treat diabetes in humans. The membranes used for macroencapsulation must not only possess the needed immunoisolation permeability requirements but, because of their larger size, must also provide sufficient mechanical strength to maintain their integrity. This is a difficult objective since the membrane wall must be thin for diffusional purposes, and this may compromise overall strength. In many cases, it has been found that thin-walled hollow fiber membranes were prone to breaking (Lanza et al., 1995). The rupture of the membrane wall will result in the rejection of the islet tissue and loss of function. As is the case for microcapsules, membrane chemistry is an important factor in minimizing the formation of fibrous tissue around the implant. Most of the early attention given to the macroencapsulation technique has been focused on the use of hollow fibers. A trade-off exists on the selection of the fiber diameter. A large diameter fiber will result in a shorter overall length but can lead to diffusional limitations. The lack of oxygen transport and the accumulation of waste products can therefore result in a central core of necrotic tissue. On the other hand, a small fiber diameter, while improving the mass transport characteristics, can result in an incredibly long fiber length. This longer length increases the probability of breakage and makes the implantation of the fibers more difficult. 566 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering An example of the use of hollow fibers as a vehicle for the macroencapsulation of the islets of Langerhans has been reported (Lanza et  al., 1991, 1992b,c,e, 1995). This particular system has been studied in some detail in both rats and dogs using a variety of sources for the islets. The islets were enclosed within semipermeable hollow fiber membranes that were 2–3 cm in length and had an internal diameter of 1.8–4.8 mm. The membrane wall thickness ranged from 69 to 105 μm, and the membrane had a nominal molecular weight cutoff of 50,000–80,000 g mol−1. Depending on the fiber diameter, approximately 9–50 fibers were implanted within the peritoneal cavity of each rat. When these fibers contained bovine islets (20,000 EIN) and they were implanted in the peritoneal cavity of rats whose diabetes was induced chemically using the drug streptozotocin (STZ), the dia- betic state was reversed within 24 h after implantation. In some cases, normoglycemia was main- tained for 1 year. However, the wider bore membranes (4.5–4.8 mm ID) that were retrieved after several months were found to contain a necrotic core as a result of oxygen transport limitations. Viable islets were only found to exist within a 0.5–1 mm layer along the membrane wall. Some of the late failure of the implants was also attributable to membrane breakage as a result of the thin membrane wall. Similar results were obtained using canine islets contained within the same hollow fibers and implanted within the peritoneal cavity of diabetic BB/Wor rats (Lanza et al., 1992c). This type of rat develops autoimmune diabetes with a pathology similar to that found in humans. The canine islet xenografts provided normoglycemia in these rats for more than 8 months. This is an important result since it shows that the immunoisolation membrane protected the islet xenografts from the host’s normal graft rejection response, as well as from the autoimmune disease process that produced the original diabetes. The protection of the islets from the autoimmune disease process is important in order to successfully treat human patients with diabetes. The hollow fiber macroencapsulation of islets was also tested in pancreatectomized dogs. Lanza et al. (1992a,b,c,d,e) summarized the results obtained for two dogs that were insulin-free for at least 70 days after receiving islet allografts contained within these fibers. Each dog received between 155 and 248 fibers containing a total of about 300,000 EIN. This equates to a total fiber length of about 500 cm. The dogs had an average weight of about 17 kg, providing an islet loading of nearly 20,000 EIN kg−1 of body weight. For a 70 kg human, the total number of islets would therefore be about 1.4 million EIN, or a total fiber length on the order of 2100 cm (70 ft). Storrs et al. (2001) have described a macroencapsulation approach known as the islet sheet. In their approach, a mixture of highly purified alginate with a reinforcing polymeric mesh is sandwiched between acellular alginate layers. The resulting flat sheet construct is then allowed to gel. The ultra- thin acellular alginate layers are highly cross-linked and form the immunoisolation barrier. The thickness of the immunoisolation barrier is about 50–75 μm. The islet sheets are typically 250 μm thick with an active width of 3 cm and a length of 7 cm. The thinness of the islet sheets provides for excellent transport of oxygen and allows for an islet volume fraction of up to 40%. Because of the high tissue density, it is estimated that 10 sheets containing 400,000 islet equivalents would be needed to treat a human with diabetes. In these early studies on the islet sheet, a pancreatectomized beagle dog that received six islet sheets was able to maintain normal fasting glucose levels for 84 days. Recently, in order to overcome the oxygen transport limitations, investigators have proposed devices with rechargeable internal supplies of oxygen (Ludwig et al., 2013; Neufeld et al., 2013) or a means 567 Bioartificial organs such as the electrolysis of water to generate oxygen in situ (Wu et  al., 1999). The macroencap- sulation approach described in Neufeld et  al. (2013) allows for the daily recharging of a central cavity with oxygen. The device they evaluated in minipigs was a round disk 68 mm in diameter with a thickness of 18 mm. Oxygen levels in the gas chamber over a 24 h period varied between 1011 mmHg at the time of charging and decreased to about 300–500 mmHg after 24 h as a result of oxygen consumption by the islets and diffusion into the surrounding tissue. When this device was loaded with rat islets, it restored normoglycemia in chemically induced (STZ) diabetic minipigs during study periods up to 70 days. This result demonstrates that the immunoisolation concept can protect xenogeneic islets and that the periodic supply of oxygen is beneficial to islet function and viability. In some cases, tissue engineering has been used along with the macroencapsulation approach (Hill et al., 1994; Sarver et al., 1995). Adjacent or integral to the immunoisolation membrane is a thin layer of a porous scaffold material that becomes vascularized by the host after implantation. The use of tissue engineering allows control over the environment adjacent to the immunoisolation mem- brane. Therefore, any fibrotic response to the implant can be minimized, and through the growth of an adjacent layer of vascular tissue, intimate contact with the host’s vasculature can be obtained. This has the potential to improve the viability and long-term functioning of the transplanted tissue. Example 11.2 Consider a bioartificial pancreas with an internal gas chamber for the periodic recharging of the device with oxygen. Assume the partial pressure of oxygen in the tissue space surround- ing the implanted device, i.e., pO2B, is 68 mmHg and the partial pressure of oxygen in the gas chamber, i.e., pO2GC, is 500 mmHg. Let the cells within the device be the islets of Langerhans with an oxygen consumption rate of 25.9 μM s−1. The thickness of the islet layer in the region between the gas chamber and the immunoisolation membrane is 200 μm, and the islet cell volume fraction is 0.80. The islets are suspended within a hydrogel for which the effective oxygen diffusivity, i.e., DT, is estimated to be 1.67 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The oxygen permeability of the immunoisolation membrane, i.e., Pm, is 4 × 10−3 cm s−1. Calculate the pO2 at the inter- face between the islet layer and the immunoisolation membrane, i.e., at x = δ, where δ is the thickness of the cell layer as measured from the interface between the cell layer and the gas chamber. Assume Henry’s constant for oxygen is 0.74 mmHg μM−1. Solution Equation 7.24 can be used to describe the oxygen transport within the islet layer: D dpO dx HT oxygen oxygen 2 2 2 =G f (A) The boundary conditions (BCs) are as follows: BC xpOpO GC10 22:,== BC xD dpO dx PpOpOT x m x B2 2 22:,=- =-() = =d d d 568 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering BC1 states that the oxygen partial pressure at the interface between the gas chamber and the islet layer is equal to the value in the gas chamber. BC2 states that the flux of oxygen leaving the islet layer at x = δ must equal the flux of oxygen across the immunoisolation membrane. The solution to Equation A can be shown to be given by pOx H P x PH PP oxygen oxygen T m oxygen oxygen TT 2 2 22 () = æ è ç ö ø ÷ - + Gf d Gf PP H PP PpOpO PPm oxygen oxygen Tm m GC B Tm() + +() + -() +() é ë ê ê ù û ú Gf d 22 úú +xpO GC 2 where the oxygen permeability in the islet layer, i.e., PT, is defined as DT/δ. Solving for the pO2 at x  = δ in the previous equation, we obtain pO2(δ) = 110.9 mmHg. This example is a rework of Example 7.6 where we found the minimum partial pressure of oxygen in the islet layer to be about 20 mmHg for a cell volume fraction of 0.15. With an in situ source of oxygen, we can increase the islet layer cell volume fraction to 0.80 with a minimum oxygen partial pressure of about 111 mmHg. This clearly shows the vast improvement in the oxygen supply that can be gained by providing an in situ oxygen source when using the macroencap- sulation approach. 11.6.2 Number of islets needed One issue confronting all of the devices discussed thus far concerns the amount of tissue required to achieve normoglycemia in a human patient with diabetes. The previously mentioned studies in rats and dogs have used islet loadings on the order of 20,000 EIN kg−1 body weight. This is considerably higher than the benchmark study reported by Warnock et al. (1988). They found that the threshold islet loading for treating pancreatectomized dogs corresponded to ≈4.3 μL of islet tissue kg−1. This equates to about 2500 EIN kg−1. It is important to point out, however, that these were unencapsulated autologous islets that were implanted within the liver or the spleen. These islets had no artificial mass transfer resistance to overcome and no host immune response that would lead to rejection. This result most likely defines the lower limit on islet loading. Certainly, improvements in the mass transfer characteristics of the devices discussed so far could lead to islet loadings more on the order of 5,000–10,000 EIN kg−1. Based on the results presented in diabetic minipigs by Neufeld et al. (2013), they predict that a human device would require 300,000–500,000 islets. These investigators state that this would require the implantation of two devices, each 68 mm in diameter, or a single elliptical device with 500,000 islets (about 7,000 EIN kg−1) measuring 110 × 70 × 18 mm. Overall device size is dependent on the amount of tissue needed, as well as on the device mass transfer characteristics for nutrients, oxygen, waste products, and the therapeutic agent itself. The mass transfer characteristics therefore are a critical factor in defining the islet tissue loading within the device itself. The results presented so far demonstrate the potential of the bioartificial pancreas as a method for treating diabetes. Long-term islet survival within the device will be the key to the success of the bioartificial pancreas. Islets have the potential to function for many years as evidenced by the fact that, unless they become diseased, they exist for as long as the life span of the animal they are found in. Therefore, islets should be capable of surviving within a bioartificial pancreas for many years. 569 Bioartificial organs Islet survival is a function of many variables, including the amount of trauma they experience dur- ing their isolation and purification; the device mass transfer characteristics for nutrients, oxygen, and waste products; the integrity of the membrane immunoisolation system; and finally the host’s response to the implant. This latter factor determines the nature of the physiological environment in the vicinity of the implant. Certainly, the formation of a region of undervascularized fibrotic tis- sue will not provide the conditions needed for the long-term functioning and survival of the islets. Because of questions concerning the long-term viability and functioning of the islet tissue, it may be necessary to periodically recharge the patients with islets. A bioartificial pancreas that has the ability to be reseeded would certainly offer an advantage. 11.6.3 Islet insulin release model The design of a bioartificial pancreas also requires an understanding of the insulin release rate from an islet or insulin-producing cells and its dependence on plasma glucose levels. Islets that have been isolated from a pancreas or genetically engineered cells are usually challenged in culture with a step change in the glucose concentration. The glucose challenge is used to assess islet or cell viabil- ity, the insulin release rate, and glucose responsiveness. When challenged in this manner, islets or insulin-secreting cells release insulin in a biphasic fashion (Grodsky, 1972). Figure 11.11 illustrates the insulin response of rat islets (Nomura et al., 1984) to a rapid ramp increase in the glucose concentration from an initial value of 80 mg dL−1 to a final value of 200 mg dL−1. Initially, the islets respond to the rate of change of the plasma glucose concentration, resulting in a maximum of the first-phase insulin release rate within a few minutes of the glucose challenge. Following this, the second-phase islet insulin release rate is proportional to the difference between the plasma glucose concentration and its fasting value of about 80 mg dL−1. We see that this second- phase release rate is relatively constant once the glucose level has achieved a steady-state value. A mathematical description of the islet insulin release rate during a glucose challenge can be obtained through the application of control theory. Nomura et al. (1984) have shown that the dynamics of the glucose-induced secretion of insulin can be expressed as the sum of the proportional response to 0 20 40 0 0.5 1 1.5 Time, minµU islet−1 min−1 Figure 11.11 Rat islet insulin secretion rate.

(1984) insulin release model for the rat islet perifusion data shown in Figure 11.11. 571 Bioartificial organs Solution A nonlinear regression analysis finds the values of T1 = 10.11 min, T2 = 1.88 min, Cp = 6.26 × 10−4 μU dL mg−1 min−2 islet−1, and Cd = 0.011 μU dL mg−1 min−1 islet−1 best fit the data shown in Figure 11.11. Figure 11.12 shows that the Nomura model provides an excellent fit to the islet insulin release data. The actual in vivo response of islets depends not only on glucose levels but also depends in a signifi- cant way on the levels of other nutrients such as amino acids and gastrointestinal hormones.* These latter substances, in the presence of rising glucose levels, can almost double the insulin secretion rate of an islet. However, no quantitative framework is available to describe the effect of these addi- tional secretagogues on the insulin secretion rate. Under physiological conditions, the variation in plasma glucose levels is less pronounced than a glucose challenge test on islets and the biphasic insulin release pattern is not as evident. In fact, the insulin secretion rate under these conditions displays a strong sigmoidal dependence on the blood glucose levels (Guyton, 1991; Sturis et al., 1991). The insulin secretion rate for the human pancreas saturates at a value of about 200,000 μU min−1 when the glucose concentration reaches 300 mg dL−1. Since the human pancreas contains about 1 million islets, this saturation insulin release rate is 0.2 μU islet−1 min−1. Sturis et al. (1991) represented the insulin secretion rate under physiological conditions as a sigmoi- dal function of the plasma glucose concentration. The following equation proposed by Sturis et al. (1991) can then be used to describe the in vivo insulin response of an islet: r G islet B = +- +() 0 209 13 33 66 . exp. .

For a normal glucose concentration of 100 mg dL−1, Equation 11.7 gives a basal insulin release rate of 0.0077 μU islet−1 min−1. At 300 mg dL−1, the islet insulin release rate is 0.2 μU islet−1 min−1. 11.6.4 Pharmacokinetic modeling of glucose and insulin interactions Although device testing in experimental diabetic animals provides conclusive proof of a device’s efficacy and potential, mathematical models are also useful tools for investigating the myriad param- eters that affect device performance. Mathematical models also provide the opportunity to perform scale-up studies. For example, they allow for the critical examination of the results obtained in small laboratory animals and the extrapolation of these results to understand how the device may perform in humans. Several physiological pharmacokinetic models of glucose and insulin metabolism have been described (Guyton et al., 1978; Sorenson et al., 1982; Berger and Rodbard, 1989; Sturis et al., 1991, 1995; Li et al., 2006; Makroglou et al., 2006; Buchwald, 2011). These models can be combined with an islet glucose-insulin response model, and a device model, to assess quantitatively the level of glucose control that can be achievable (Smith et al., 1991). The pharmacokinetic model for glucose and insulin metabolism proposed by Sturis et al. (1991, 1995) is particularly attractive because of its relative simplicity and its ability to represent the exper- imentally observed temporal oscillations of insulin and glucose levels (Kraegen et al., 1972). The secretion of insulin in humans has been found to exhibit two distinct types of periodic oscillations: a rapid oscillation with a period of 10–15 min and a longer or ultradian oscillation with a period of 100–150 min. The rapid oscillations are of small amplitude (insulin <1–2 μU mL−1 and glucose <1 mg dL−1) and may be the result of an intrinsic pacemaker in the islets. The ultradian oscilla- tions exhibit a much larger amplitude and are self-sustained when the stimulus is continuously pre- sented, e.g., by a constant infusion of glucose or by continuous enteral glucose feeding. On the other hand, the ultradian oscillations are damped when the glucose stimulus is presented as a discrete event, e.g., by either a meal or ingestion of a fixed quantity of glucose. Figure 11.13 presents a block diagram of the Sturis et al. (1991) model for describing the interac- tions between glucose and insulin. This model is based on four negative feedback loops involv- ing interactions between glucose and insulin: (1) elevated glucose levels stimulate the secretion of insulin, and the resulting increase in insulin levels decreases the endogenous production of glucose, which then has the effect of lowering glucose levels; (2) elevated glucose levels stimulate the secre- tion of insulin, and the resulting increase in insulin levels enhances glucose utilization, which also has the effect of reducing glucose levels; (3) rising levels of glucose inhibit production of glucose; and (4) increasing levels of glucose stimulate its utilization. These four loops control the amount of glucose and insulin in the body. However, because of the nonlinear and dynamic interaction between glucose and insulin, the amounts of these substances in the body are never at a stable equilibrium. The model also includes two time delays, which are important for describing the observed oscil- latory dynamics. The first delay affects the suppression by insulin of glucose production or the recovery of this process when insulin levels decrease. The second delay considers the fact that the biological action of insulin correlates better with the concentration of insulin in an interstitial com- partment that equilibrates slowly with the plasma insulin concentration. 573 Bioartificial organs The three main variables in the model are the concentration of glucose in the plasma (GB, mg mL−1), the concentration of insulin in the plasma (IB, μU mL−1), and the concentration of insulin in the inter- stitial fluid (IIF, μU mL−1). There are also three additional variables that are introduced to account for the delay between the plasma insulin level and its effect on glucose production (x1, x2, x3 with time lag τd). A total of six differential equations are needed to describe the state of the system as a function of time (here in minutes). These equations are as follows: V dI dt rG NE II IV dI dt E I V Bi B isletB islets BIF BBi p IF B IF = () --()- =- t II V I V dG dt rt fG fG fI f IF IF IF i Bg B GinB BIF æ è ç ö ø ÷ - = ()- ()- () ()+ t 23 4 553 11 21 23 2333 3 x dx dt IV xdx dt xx dx dt xxBBi dd d () = - = - = - tt t ,, (11.8) The insulin secretion rate of an islet, rislet, was given earlier by Equation 11.7 and is multiplied by the number of islets in the pancreas (Nislets). The insulin that is released by the islets in the pancreas distributes in the plasma space of volume given by VBi, and it also enters the interstitial fluid space represented by the distribution volume VIF. The insulin transport rate into the interstitial fluid is proportional to the difference in the insulin concentration in the two compartments and is described by a rate constant E. Insulin is degraded within the plasma space by a first order rate process with a time constant given by τp. Interstitial insulin enhances glucose utilization as described by the function f4(IIF), and interstitial insulin is also degraded with a time constant of τi.

Physiol., 260, E801, 1991.) 574 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Glucose is assumed to distribute throughout a single compartment (VBg) and affects its own utiliza- tion through the functions f2 and f3. Glucose utilization represented by f2 is insulin independent, whereas f3 is multiplied by an additional term f4 that is dependent on the interstitial insulin con- centration. The functions f2 (mg min−1) and f3 × f4 (mg min−1) are given by the following equations: f G f fG I V B B IF IF 2 34 72 16 94 10 90 11 772 1 =- -()éë ùû ´= ´ +- + exp. exp. ln Etti æ è ç ö ø ÷ æ è ç ö ø ÷ + æ è çç ö ø ÷÷ + é ë ê ê ê ù û ú ú ú 776 4 . (11.9) Insulin also inhibits the production of glucose by the liver (f5) via a process that is dependent on a time delay (τd) between the appearance of insulin in the plasma and its inhibitory effect on glucose production.

(11.10) Glucose can enter the body in an arbitrary time-varying fashion as given by the function rG in(t) (mg min−1) in Equation 11.8. For example, the glucose input function for a meal, or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), can be described by the following equation that describes the absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. In this equation, D (mg) represents the total amount of glucose ingested, ka (min−1) is the absorption rate constant, and ke (min−1) is the elimination rate constant: r tDk k kk eeGine a ae kt ktea() = - æ è ç ö ø ÷ -() -- (11.11) Table 11.1 summarizes the values of all the parameters used in the model of Sturis et al.

(eds.), AIP Press, 1995. 575 Bioartificial organs 11.6.5 Using the pharmacokinetic model to evaluate the performance of a bioartificial pancreas We can now use the Sturis et al. (1991) pharmacokinetic model outlined in Section 11.6.4, along with an insulin release model for an islet, to explore the level of glucose control that is possible with a bioartificial pancreas. There are two basic types of tests that can be used to measure the level of glucose control. One stringent measure of glucose control that is frequently used is called the k-value. The k-value represents the slope of the least squares fit of the logarithm of the plasma glucose concentration plotted as a function of time for the 50 min following the intravenous admin- istration of a dose of glucose. This glucose dose is typically 0.5 g kg−1 of body weight and is referred to as an intravenous glucose tolerance test, or IVGTT. Following the glucose dose for the IVGTT, plasma glucose levels rapidly rise within a few minutes to levels exceeding 300 mg dL−1 from the initial fasting level of around 80 mg dL−1. The rate of glucose decay following an IVGTT is indicative of the glucose and insulin responsiveness of the patient’s pancreas. The k-value is expressed in units of % min−1. If the k-value following an IVGTT is less than 1% min−1, then the patient is assumed to have diabetes. Normal k-values range from about 2 to 3% min−1. A bioartificial pancreas would need to provide a k-value greater than about 1.5% min−1 to be considered effective at controlling blood glucose lev- els in a patient with diabetes. This somewhat lower than normal k-value is acceptable because the IVGTT provides a major glucose challenge that is not normally observed following a meal. The OGTT involves the oral administration of a beverage containing 50 g of glucose. Glucose levels greater than 140 mg dL−1 2 h after administration of the glucose may be indicative of diabetes. The simulation of blood glucose and insulin levels following an IVGTT or an OGTT using the pharmacokinetic model outlined above is straightforward. Assume that the islets are macroencapsu- lated within a thin sheet and that the immunoisolation membrane of the bioartificial pancreas is the controlling mass transfer resistance for glucose and insulin transport. As shown in Figure 11.14, two well-mixed compartments are used to define the distribution of glucose and insulin within the device and the rest of the body. The distribution of insulin also includes an additional interstitial fluid compartment to account for the delay in its action, as discussed earlier. Unsteady mass balances for glucose and insulin can now be written for each of the compartments.

The initial conditions for the solution of the above equations for either an IVGTT or an OGTT are based on fasting levels. Fasting plasma glucose levels are typically about 80 mg dL−1. Assuming negligible consumption of glucose by the tissue in the bioartificial pancreas, one may reasonably assume that the initial glucose concentration in the bioartificial pancreas is the same as that found in the rest of the body. However, since the IVGTT glucose dose is rapidly distrib- uted throughout the body distribution volume, in comparison to the length of time required for its subsequent removal, we assume that at t = 0 (+), the plasma glucose level is given by the equation below: Gt Gfasting mg/kgbw body weight,kg V BB Bg =+() = ()+ ()´() 0 500 (11.16) Fasting plasma insulin levels are about 10 μU mL−1. During the fasting period, we assume that the bioartificial pancreas is at a steady-state equilibrium with the rest of the body as far as insulin is concerned. Accordingly, the islet insulin secretion rate based on the fasting glucose concentra- tion must match the rate of insulin removal from the body. The steady-state solution of the set of 577 Bioartificial organs compartmental insulin equations provides the following relationships for the initial insulin concen- tration in each of the compartments: I Nr G V V V V E I I B islets isletB i IF Bi i IF p IF i IF B 0 00 0 0 1 1 1 = () ´ - + = t t t t 111 00 00 tiIF IF IB isletislet B mI m EV V II Nr G PS + æ è ç ö ø ÷ =+ () (11.17) The solution of Equations 11.12 through 11.17 provides the temporal change in the plasma glucose concentration following the administration of either an OGTT or an IVGTT to a patient with a bio- artificial pancreas. The above equations can be easily modified to evaluate the glucose control for a variety of bioartificial pancreas approaches. The following example illustrates a prediction of the plasma glucose levels using a bioartificial pancreas following an OGTT. Example 11.4 Estimate the glucose concentrations following an OGTT using islets that are macroen- capsulated between two immunoisolation membrane disks. A total of 50 g of glucose is taken orally. In Equation 11.11, the glucose absorption rate constant is 0.042 min−1 and the glucose elimination rate constant is 0.0083 min−1. Base the calculation on a 70 kg patient receiving a total of 750,000 EIN. Assume the islet insulin secretion rate is given by Equation 11.7. The half-thickness of the islet chamber is 75 μm. The void volume within the islet  chamber must be at least 65% for sufficient oxygen transport. The immu- noisolation membrane permeabilities for glucose and insulin are based on the membrane developed by Baker et al. (1997), i.e., 4 × 10−4 cm s−1 for glucose and 8 × 10−5 cm s−1 for insulin. Solution Figure 11.15 provides the solution for the glucose and insulin concentrations as a function of time. Note the damped ultradian oscillations of the glucose and insulin concentrations with time. The bioartificial pancreas provides a glucose and insulin response that is very similar to that observed in normal patients (Kraegen et al., 1972), which shows that the bioartificial pancreas has the potential to restore normoglycemia in patients with diabetes. The size of the device is 18 cm (7 in.) in diameter and only several millimeters in thickness. Rather than one large unit, several smaller units could be implanted. For example, four units each 9 cm (3.5 in.) in diameter would be equivalent. Membranes with better glucose and insulin permeabilities would result in a smaller device. 578 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 11.7 The bioartificial liver The liver is a very complex organ that performs a variety of life-sustaining functions (Yarmush et al., 1992; Galletti and Jauregui, 1995; Davidson et al., 2010). These functions include detoxifying the blood, regulating glucose levels, and making a variety of proteins. The human liver weighs about 1500 g and is highly vascularized. From Table 7.3, we see that the liver receives over 25% of the cardiac output. The liver blood supply comes from two major sources. These are the hepatic artery and the portal vein. The portal vein collects the venous drainage from the spleen, the pancreas, and the intestines. The portal vein input from these regions passes through the liver before entering the rest of the systemic circulation. The liver therefore has the ability to detoxify potentially harmful substances that are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The basic functional cellular units of the liver are called the hepatocytes. Each hepatocyte is about 25 μm in diameter, and there are close to 250 billion of them in the human liver, accounting for 75% of the liver volume. The hepatocytes are metabolically very active and provide an incredible variety of functions. Their role in carbohydrate metabolism includes the storage of excess glucose as glycogen and the release of this stored form of glucose (glycogenolysis) when blood glucose levels are low. In addition, the liver converts other sugars such as galactose and fructose to glucose. If blood glucose levels are low and the glycogen stores are also depleted, then the liver performs a process known as gluconeogenesis wherein glucose is synthesized from amino acids. The liver also plays a major role in fat metabolism. The liver is principally responsible for the body’s ability to derive energy from fats. The liver can also convert excess carbohydrates and proteins into fat, synthesizes cholesterol and phospholipids, and forms the lipoprotein carrier molecules. The lipoproteins are responsible for transporting cholesterol, phospholipids, and fats to other tissues throughout the body. Cholesterol and phospholipids are important components of cellular mem- branes. The liver has an extremely important role in protein metabolism. These functions include the deamination of amino acids as a prelude to their use as an energy source, or their conversion to carbohydrates or fats. The deamination of amino acids produces large amounts of ammonia. The liver converts the ammonia into urea, which is then excreted by the kidneys. Without this function, ammonia levels in the blood rapidly increase, leading to hepatic coma and death. 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 50 100 150 200 Blood glucose levels, mg dL−1 Time, min Zn,0 Zn,0 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 50 100 Blood insulin levels, µU mL−1 Time, min Zn,3 Zn,4 . 100 Figure 11.15 Predicted glucose and insulin levels in a bioartificial pancreas following an OGTT. 579 Bioartificial organs With the exception of the gamma globulins (immunoglobulins or antibodies), practically all of the plasma proteins are made in the liver, the most important being albumin. The liver also makes most of the substances found in the blood that are responsible for the clotting of blood. These include fibrinogen, prothrombin, and most of the other clotting factors. The liver also provides storage for a variety of nutrients such as vitamins and iron, which is stored as a protein complex called ferritin. The hepatocytes, because of their high enzyme content, also provide a major role in the detoxification and conjugation of a variety of materials such as drugs, environmental toxins, and hormones that are produced elsewhere in the body. These by-product materials are water soluble and are excreted in the bile or by the kidneys. The liver has the unique capability of being able to regenerate itself following tissue damage. This is extremely beneficial, considering the role it plays in detoxifying materials from the gastrointestinal tract. However, if the tissue damage rate exceeds the liver’s ability to regenerate, then liver failure results, leading to a life-threatening situation. Liver failure accounts for over 60,000 deaths each year in the United States. There are principally two types of liver failure: cirrhosis and fulminant hepatic failure. Cirrhosis of the liver accounts for over half of the deaths due to liver disease. In cirrhosis, fibrotic tissue forms in place of the damaged liver tissue severely compromising the liver’s ability to regenerate. Common causes of cirrhosis include alcoholism and chronic hepatitis. Fulminant hepatic failure is a rapidly progressing failure of the liver that can lead to death within several weeks of onset. It can be caused by chemical and viral hepatitis. Liver failure causes a variety of life-threatening abnormalities, including the accumulation of ammonia or bilirubin in the plasma and decreased levels of albumin and clotting factors. There is also a buildup of toxins and overactivity of the hormonal systems that are believed to lead to a condition known as hepatic encephalopathy that can cause irreversible brain damage, coma, and death. The only long-term and relatively successful treatment method for liver failure is transplantation. However, liver transplantation is severely limited by the shortage of donor organs. Many patients therefore die before a liver becomes available, or they succumb shortly after the transplant because of the complications and brain damage associated with liver failure. 11.7.1 Artificial liver systems The treatment of liver failure by artificial means has been the focus of considerable research. Table  11.2 provides a summary of some of the artificial liver systems that have been evaluated (Yarmush et al., 1992). The primary goal of these artificial liver systems is to provide a means to maintain the patient in a stable state until a liver transplant is possible, or in some cases, artificial Table 11.2 Artificial Liver Systems Hemodialysis Cross circulation Hemoperfusion Extracorporeal perfusion Immobilized enzymes Cross hemodialysis Plasma exchange Hepatocyte hemoperfusion 580 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering liver support can provide the liver the chance to regenerate and the patient can return to a normal life without a transplant. The difficulty in developing an artificial liver is the multitude of functions the liver performs. Initially, it was thought that the best approach is to minimize the buildup of toxins. Accordingly, efforts focused on such approaches as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, and immobilized enzyme reac- tors for the removal of these materials. The hemodialysis systems were similar to those used in kidney dialysis, with the exception that they used membranes with a higher molecular weight cutoff to allow the passage of the larger- sized toxic materials. This approach was still not effective at removing large protein-bound toxins. Hemoperfusion employed beds of activated carbon that adsorbed the toxic molecules (Ding et al., 2014). A particular problem with this approach is its nonspecificity, removing beneficial substances as well. Immobilized enzyme reactors used liver enzymes to provide for a more specific removal of the toxic molecules. The major difficulty is providing a complete set of liver enzymes. These three approaches also suffered from the disadvantage that they do not restore any of the synthetic func- tions of the liver. Other approaches that were used attempted to both reduce the level of toxins and restore substances normally synthesized by the liver. These methods included plasma exchange, cross circulation, extracorporeal perfusion, and cross hemodialysis. Plasma exchange involves replacing the patient’s plasma with donor plasma. Provided the exchange rate is sufficiently high, this approach can replace the lost liver function. However, the major limitation is the large amount of donor plasma needed and the increased risk to the patient of viral infections. Cross circulation involved connecting the patient’s circulation to that of another human. In this way the healthy liver is shared. However, the risk to the human donor limits the widespread use of this approach. The extracorporeal perfusion of the patient’s blood through a xenogeneic liver has also been tried. Some success with this approach has been achieved using pig and baboon livers. However, the liver function degrades quickly as a result of the host’s immune rejection response. Cross hemodialysis attempts to minimize the host’s immune response to the donor liver by perfusing the donor liver with a separate supply of blood. This blood is then sent through a hemodialyzer where it is contacted across a dialysis membrane with the patient’s own blood. In this way toxins are removed and synthetic substances are added to the patient’s blood. The hemoperfusion of liver tissue has also been tried. Liver tissue pieces are directly contacted with the patient’s blood. Frozen or freeze dried dead tissue was comparable in activity to fresh tissue indicating that only those few layers of cells near the surface of the fresh liver pieces are adequately oxygenated. The dead tissue still contained enzymes with some residual activity. 11.7.2 Bioartificial livers The hemoperfusion of liver tissue pieces is not capable of providing optimal conditions for the long-term function of the liver tissue. In the absence of an intact vasculature, the mass transfer resis- tances within the liver pieces are just too large for simple diffusion to overcome. Recently, attention has been focused on the development of bioartificial livers that are based on the use of isolated hepa- tocytes (Jauregui et al., 1997; Allen et al., 2001; Legallais et al., 2001; Nose, 2001; Patzer, 2001; Sauer et al., 2001; Kobayashi et al., 2003; Davidson et al., 2010; Lee and Cho, 2012). The use of iso- lated hepatocytes in a properly designed bioartificial liver has the potential to mimic the synthetic, 581 Bioartificial organs metabolic, biliary excretion and detoxifying functions of a normal liver. Isolated hepatocytes are not as severely affected by mass transfer limitations, and furthermore, they can be immunoprotected. The challenge is to design the bioartificial liver so that the isolated hepatocytes can maintain their differentiated functions and continue to detoxify the blood, regulate glucose levels in the body, and synthesize proteins. Isolated hepatocytes have been proposed for both implantable and extracorporeal systems. Implantable systems are based on the tissue engineering concepts discussed in Chapter 10 and involve the encapsulation of the hepatocytes in a manner similar to the techniques already dis- cussed for islets (Cai et al., 1988; Cima et al., 1991a; Johnson et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1994, Powers et al., 2002). The hepatocytes can come from primary sources such as from human donors as well as animals like the pig and the rabbit. Alternatively, cell lines based on hepatic tumors and immortalized cells have also been developed. In addition, stem cells and progenitor cells have the potential, given the proper signals, to differentiate into hepatocytes (Lee and Cho, 2012). The mass of hepatocytes that is needed to treat liver failure is estimated to be on the order of 10%–40% of the original liver mass (Yarmush et  al., 1992; Rozga et  al., 1994; Davidson et  al., 2010). At the low end of this range, this amounts to 25 billion cells or a cellular volume on the order of 200 mL. Attachment to a support structure, or encapsulation of this quantity of cells, while still maintaining a reasonable device volume, is a major obstacle with implantation approaches. For example, for hepatocytes attached to microcarriers,* the estimated total volume is 500 mL. For microencapsulation within a polymeric capsule, this volume is 2500 mL, whereas macroencapsula- tion in hollow fibers yields a volume that is estimated to be 1300 mL. Because of these size constraints, extracorporeal bioartificial livers are an attractive approach for providing temporary liver function until an organ is available for transplantation or the patient’s liver can regenerate. The patient’s blood or plasma flows through an external circuit that provides contact with the hepatocytes. The hepatocytes can be presented to the patient’s blood or plasma in a number of ways. The simplest is as a suspension of cells. However, this provides no immunoprotection, and like most mammalian cells, hepatocytes do better if they are attached to something. In some cases, the suspension of cells can be placed within the shell space of a hemodialyzer and separated from the blood or plasma stream by a dialysis membrane. Although this approach provides immunopro- tection, the low molecular weight cutoff of the dialysis membrane severely limits the molecular sizes that can be detoxified or synthesized. Other approaches involve perfusing the patient’s blood or plasma through columns packed with microcarrier-attached hepatocytes, or hepatocytes encapsu- lated within polymeric beads. Hepatocytes attached to microcarriers, however, provide no immuno- protection. Hollow fiber units have also been proposed. In these systems, the hepatocytes are within the shell space and attach themselves to the outer surface of the hollow fibers. Blood or plasma flows through the lumen of the hollow fibers. One major limitation of the membrane-based approaches discussed so far involves the significant mass transfer resistance created by the presence of the membrane. Solute transport through the membrane and into the space containing the hepatocytes is by diffusion only. This not only limits the supply of * A microcarrier is a small particle about 200 μm in diameter, sometimes coated with ECM materials, that provides for cell attachment and formation of a confluent monolayer of cells. 582 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering essential nutrients and oxygen to the hepatocytes but also limits the detoxification and biosynthesis rates of the hepatocytes as well. To overcome these membrane diffusional limitations, some bioar- tificial livers incorporate the perfusion of plasma through the region that contains the hepatocytes.* 11.7.3 Examples of extracorporeal bioartificial livers Figure 11.16 illustrates one approach that provides three distinct compartments (Nyberg et al., 1992, 1993a,b). The first compartment consists of a gel-like collagen matrix that traps the hepatocytes within the hollow fiber lumen. The second compartment consists of the space within the lumen of the hollow fiber that results after the contraction of the original collagen suspension containing the hepatocytes. The third compartment is the shell space that surrounds the hollow fibers. The hollow fibers have a nominal molecular weight cutoff of 100,000 g mol−1 and immunoprotect the hepato- cytes from the patient’s immune system. In operation, the patient’s blood flows through the shell space. Substances to be detoxified readily diffuse through the hollow fiber membrane and into the collagen gel that contains the hepatocytes. Similarly, substances produced by the hepatocytes diffuse across the membrane and are carried away by the blood to the patient. Of particular note in this system is the presence of the space within the lumen that is formed after the gel contracts. This space provides an additional flow path that allows the simultaneous perfusion of the hepatocytes with specific nutrients, growth factors, and hormones that are needed to maintain their differentiated function and viability. Extracellular matrix (ECM)-type materials can also be incorporated into the gel that contains the hepatocytes. In this way, the hepatocytes can be presented with an optimal culture environment while performing their liver support functions. In one particular test, this bioartificial liver was evaluated in vitro over a period of 7 days. Approximately 5 × 107 cells were loaded into the device. Hepatocyte function was evaluated on the basis of albu- min production, oxygen consumption, and lidocaine clearance. It is important to point out that unlike the bioartificial pancreas, there is no single measure of differentiated hepatocyte function. * See Section 7.9 on perfusion bioreactors.. 3.

Bioeng., 41, 194, 1993b.) 583 Bioartificial organs However, albumin was steadily produced during the 7-day period at rates comparable to that seen in static cultures. Furthermore, oxygen consumption remained relatively constant following an initial decline over the first two days of culture. This initial decrease in the oxygen consumption, although possibly being related to cell death, was also considered to be a result of the increased metabolic demands on the hepatocytes as a result of the trauma during their isolation and placement in a new environment. The cytochrome P-450 system (Hantsen, 1998) is a major pathway for the biotransformation in the liver of many substances and is an important function that must be provided by a bioartificial liver. Lidocaine clearance can be used as a measure of oxidative metabolism provided by the cytochrome P-450 system. Lidocaine clearance in this bioartificial liver was relatively constant, and the presence of lidocaine metabolites demonstrated that lidocaine biotransformation was occurring. Electron micrographs after 7 days of operation showed the presence of differentiated viable hepatocytes. Figure 11.17 illustrates an extracorporeal bioartificial liver system known as HepatAssist that con- sists of several integrated components (Giorgio et  al., 1993; Rozga et  al., 1993, 1994; Jauregui et al., 1997). A plasmapheresis unit is first used to form a plasma stream from arterial blood. This plasma stream feeds into a high flow plasma recirculation loop that forms the core of the bioartificial liver support system. Within the recirculation loop, plasma first enters a column loaded with acti- vated cellulose-coated charcoal. The activated charcoal column is used to enhance the detoxification capability of the overall system and to protect the hepatocytes from any toxic materials found in the patient’s plasma. The detoxified plasma then enters a membrane oxygenator. This ensures an adequate supply of oxygen to maintain the viability and function of the hepatocytes. The oxygenated plasma then flows through the hollow fiber module that contains the hepatocytes. The plasma flows through the hollow fiber lumens, and the hepatocytes are in the shell space that surrounds the hollow fibers. Plasma exiting the hollow fiber cartridge is then recombined with the cellular components of the blood and returned to the patient’s body. Encapsulated liver cells in the space surrounding the hollow fibers Blood from patient Plasmapheresis system Activated carbon column Plasma Oxygenator Bioartificial liver Blood to patient Figure 11.17 Components of the HepatAssist bioartificial liver. (From Jauregui, H.O. et al., Extracorporeal artificial liver support, in: Principles of Tissue Engineering, Lanza, R.P., Langer, R., and Chick, W.L. (eds.), R.G. Landes Co., 1997, pp. 463–479.) 584 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering The hepatocytes within the bioartificial liver cartridge are attached to collagen-coated microcar- rier beads that occupy the shell space. About six billion porcine hepatocytes are used. The hollow fibers have large pore sizes (0.2 μm) that allow for significant fluid convection through the hollow fiber membrane as a result of the transfiber pressure drop. From the fiber entrance to its midpoint, there is a significant flow of plasma out of the hollow fiber and into the shell space that contains the anchored hepatocytes. From the fiber midpoint to the fiber exit, this flow reverses itself and reenters the fiber lumen. This is much like the Starling flow phenomena discussed in Chapter 3 for capil- laries. This convective flow into the shell space passes freely between the microcarrier beads that contain the hepatocytes on their surfaces. This convective flow through the shell space provides for very efficient contacting of the plasma solutes and the hepatocytes, and far surpasses what is achiev- able by diffusion alone. One limitation of the approach shown in Figure 11.17 is the lack of complete immunoisolation of the xenogeneic porcine hepatocytes. Plasma perfusion eliminates the cellular components of the immune system; however, antibodies and complement will readily flow across the membrane and into the shell space that contains the hepatocytes. However, the treatment time proposed for this device is relatively short, and the patient is immunosuppressed in anticipation of a liver transplant. So the trade-off between a high transmembrane flow resulting in good mass transport and the resul- tant permeability to the humoral components of the immune system seems appropriate. Certainly, longer-term use of this device will require improved methods of immunoisolation that do not com- promise the mass transport properties of the hepatocyte bioreactor. Figure 11.18 illustrates the extracorporeal liver assist device, or ELAD (Sussman et al., 1992; Kelly and Sussman, 1994). This is a hollow fiber device that uses a cloned human cell line in place of hepatocytes. The cell line is derived from a hepatoblastoma and selected for liver-specific functions.

(From Sussman, N.L. et al., Hepatology, 16, 60, 1992. With permission.) 585 Bioartificial organs These cells exhibit the ability to synthesize protein, urea, and glucose and are capable of detoxifying substances via the cytochrome P-450 system. The use of a human cell line provides an unlimited supply of cells and minimizes the immune problems that may result from the use of xenogeneic hepatocytes. The ELAD is seeded with 2 g of cells and is placed in culture until 200 g of cells are obtained. This quantity of cells is capable of producing therapeutic levels of plasma proteins. For example, 5 g of albumin are produced each day, which is about one-half the normal daily production rate of a healthy adult human liver. Blood flows from the patient’s vein through a standard hemodialysis pump. The blood exiting the pump is mixed with heparin to prevent blood clots and then passes through the lumen of the hollow fibers of the ELAD device. A portion of the blood flowing through the hollow fibers forms a plasma ultrafiltrate that perfuses the shell space where it comes into direct contact with the cells. The ultra- filtration of the blood allows the delivery of higher molecular weight solutes at rates significantly higher than that possible by diffusion alone. The ultrafiltrate, then passes through a 0.45 μm filter before it is returned to the patient. An evaluation of this device in dogs with fulminant hepatic failure provided rapid improvement in blood chemistry. There was also a rapid rise in plasma human albumin and α-fetoprotein levels following the connection of the device. Factor V-dependent clotting times showed a corresponding rapid decrease. After 48 h of treatment, the dogs with fulminant hepatic failure have sufficiently recovered that they can be disconnected from the device. Compared to control animals that die, the treated animals regenerated their own livers. To overcome some of the transport limitations of the bioartificial liver devices described above, a novel approach has been developed that uses three separate hollow fiber membrane bundles (Sauer et  al., 2001; Schmelzer et  al., 2009). As shown in Figure 11.19, the hepatocytes are distributed throughout the complex 3D extracapillary space formed by these three sets of hollow fiber bundles. Two sets of these hollow fiber bundles contain hydrophilic membranes with a NMWCO of about Air Medium Medium Hepatocytes Hollow fibers Figure 11.19 A bioartificial liver comprising three bundles of hollow fiber membranes. (From Schmelzer, E. et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng., 103, 817, 2009.) 586 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering 300,000 g mol−1. One end of each bundle is closed off, thus making the plasma that enters the biore- actor in the first hollow fiber bundle flow into the extracapillary space before exiting the bioreactor through the second hollow fiber bundle. The hollow fibers in the third bundle are hydrophobic and are used to supply oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. The unique arrangement of these three hol- low fiber bundles provides a means for plasma perfusion of the extracapillary space containing the hepatocytes while also providing for the efficient transport of oxygen. This bioartificial liver con- taining human hepatocytes has been successfully used as a bridge to transplant in patients suffering from liver failure. Example 11.5 As part of the design of a bioartificial liver, there is a hollow fiber membrane cartridge that first treats the plasma with a mix of immobilized enzymes to remove any toxic components that are in the plasma. The plasma to this device comes from a plasmapheresis unit that separates a portion of the plasma from the patient’s blood. The immobilized enzyme particles are in the shell space that surrounds the hollow fibers. The plasma therefore flows within the hollow fibers. The plasma flow rate to the device is 250 mL min−1, and there are 6500 hollow fibers in the device. The inside diameter of the hollow fibers is 400 μm. These fibers are microporous and have a very high solute permeability. The enzyme loading in the shell space is quite large, and the enzyme reactions may be considered to be very fast in comparison to the mass transfer processes. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the concentration of any toxic material in the plasma is zero at the inside surface of the hollow fibers. For a target toxin having a molecular weight of 300 g mol−1, the diffusivity of this solute in the plasma would be about 4.6 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. If the hollow fibers are 25 cm in length, estimate the fractional removal of this toxin from this device. Assume the density of the plasma is 1.024 g cm−3 and the viscosity is 1.2 cP. Solution We assume the plasma flow is evenly distributed to the hollow fibers. Also, that the conversion of the toxic material is the same for each fiber. Hence, we can focus on just one hollow fiber. The plasma flow rate for each fiber is therefore equal to 6.41 × 10−4 cm3 s−1. From this value of the flow rate, we find that the average plasma velocity within the hollow fiber is 0.51 cm s−1. Using this average velocity, we calculate a Re = 1.74, which means the plasma flow is laminar within the hollow fiber. We also find that the Sc = 2604. We can calculate the change in the toxin concentration within the hollow fiber using Equation 5.160 with CAS = 0: C C kL Vd A out A in m averagetube =- æ è ç ö ø ÷exp 4 Next, we calculate km using Equation 5.169 and obtain Sh = 4.36 and km = 5.01 × 10−4 cm s−1.

Patients with end-stage renal disease can be treated for many years either by hemodi- alysis or by the newer technique of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. However, these are not permanent solutions, and these patients ultimately require a kidney transplant in order to survive. The mortality on an annualized basis for hemodialysis patients with end-stage renal disease is about 13%, whereas in age-matched patients that receive a kidney transplant, the annual mortality is 4% (Fissell et  al., 2001). This data shows that a normal or transplanted kidney provides physiologic functions that are not provided by hemodialysis. The kidney not only provides a filtration and waste removal function but also provides several other important functions that are important to the metabolic, immune, and endocrine systems of the body. For example, erythropoietin is released by specialized cells found in the kidney in response to hypoxia. Erythropoietin is a major stimulus for the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Uremic patients therefore suffer from anemia. Low blood pressure causes the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular cells that are found in the kidney. Renin initiates the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, that results in an increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin II also acts on the kidneys, decreasing the excretion of both salt and water. This expands the extracellular fluid volume with the result that the blood pressure is increased. The kidneys are also responsible for the con- version of vitamin D into a substance* that promotes the absorption of calcium from the intestine. Without this substance, the bones become severely weakened because of the loss of calcium. These other very important functions that are performed by the healthy kidney are therefore compromised as a result of kidney failure. As shown earlier in Figure 8.3, the functional unit of the kidney is called the nephron. Recall that it consists of two major components, the glomerulus and the renal tubule. The glomerulus is respon- sible primarily for the selective ultrafiltration of waste products from the blood. It must perform this waste removal function and at the same time retain essential blood components such as albumin. The glomerular filtrate that is formed then passes through the various segments of the renal tubule. The specialized segments of the renal tubule regulate the amount of urine that is formed and its final solute composition. The renal tubule cells therefore have the ability to control both the fluid reabsorption rate and the transport rate of an individual solute. This is accomplished in such a man- ner so as to maintain homeostasis with regard to the body’s fluid volume and overall composition. Because of the chemical sensing and selective transport ability of the renal tubule, it is unlikely that this sophisticated function could ever be reproduced artificially. Accordingly, artificial kidneys or hemodialyzers will primarily function at the level of simply removing waste products by dialysis. A bioartificial kidney has the potential of reproducing many of the homeostatic, regulatory, and endocrine functions that are performed by the healthy kidney. This would far surpass the filtration function of existing dialysis systems and allow blood purification to occur in a more physiologic fashion. A bioartificial kidney consists of two main components, an artificial glomerulus and a bio- artificial renal tubule (Ip and Aebischer, 1989; Fissell et al., 2001; Humes et al., 2004). The artificial * 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. 588 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering glomerulus can be fabricated from polymeric membranes or the newer silicon nanopore membranes that have a high hydraulic conductance (Fissell et al., 2009, 2013). The transmembrane pressure gradient can be controlled to provide the desired bulk flow rate of plasma across the membrane. This bulk flow, or ultrafiltration of the plasma, will also provide for significant convective transport of solutes across the membrane. The convective transport of all solutes will be essentially the same up to the molecular weight cutoff of the membrane. This is especially important for the larger size solutes where much more can be removed by convection than by simple diffusion. The artificial glomerular membranes can be configured as hollow fibers or in the case of silicon nanopore mem- branes as flat sheets. The major requirement being that the membrane arrangement is conducive to the production of a significant ultrafiltration (UF) flow. Several problems still need to be addressed with regard to the fabrication of an artificial glomeru- lus. These include uncontrolled bleeding as a result of anticoagulation, a decreased ultrafiltration rate over time as a result of protein deposition in the membrane, and the challenge of developing a nonthrombogenic membrane. One exciting possibility for overcoming the clotting tendency of most polymeric materials is to cover the blood-contacting surfaces with a monolayer of autologous endothelial cells. Endothelial cells form the blood-contacting lining of the body’s blood vessels and in the absence of injury are responsible for preventing the blood from clotting. The bioartificial renal tubule would consist of viable renal epithelial cells supported within a tubular structure such as a hollow fiber membrane. These renal tubule cells can be obtained from the renal proximal tubule since it is this section of the renal tubule that reclaims the majority of the water, salt, glucose, amino acids, and other species that are filtered from the glomerular capillaries (Fissell et al., 2001). Another possibility for creating a renal tubule is to use renal tubule stem cells (Cieslinski and Humes, 1994; Humes and Cieslinsi, 1992). Stem cells are a class of highly proliferative cells that give rise to cells that have a differentiated function. The resulting differentiated cells provide the ultimate physi- ologic structure and function found in the body’s tissues and organs. Perhaps the best-known class of stem cells is the pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells (PHSC) (Koller and Palsson, 1993) that are responsible for the formation of all the differentiated cells found in blood. The differentiated cells arising from the PHSC consist of the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. In many cases the terminally differentiated state of the cell is incapable of reproducing. Therefore, the stem cell has the responsibility of producing and replacing those terminally differentiated cells that have become damaged or injured for a variety of reasons. For example, renal tubule stem cells would regener- ate renal tubules following their injury. In the presence of the proper growth factors, renal tubule stem cells have the capability to form tubule-like structures in culture. The isolation and culture of human renal tubule stem cells could therefore be an important source of tissue for the formation of bioartificial renal tubules. Figure 11.20 shows the extracorporeal hemoperfusion system described by Fissell et al. (2001) and Humes et al. (2004). In experiments performed on nephrectomized dogs, venous blood is pumped through a standard hollow fiber dialyzer or hemofilter (artificial glomerulus). The ultrafiltrate that is formed on the shell side of the hemofilter is then pumped through the luminal space of a hollow fiber cartridge (artificial proximal tubule), which they called the renal assist device (RAD). The blood leaving the hemofilter flows through the extracapillary space of the RAD. Proximal tubule cells line the luminal surface of the hollow fibers in the RAD providing for reabsorption into the blood of about 589 Bioartificial organs 50% of the hemofilter ultrafiltrate. The ultrafiltrate flow to the RAD cartridge is controlled by adjust- ing the pressure difference between the luminal and extracapillary sides of the RAD cartridge. The luminal effluent from the RAD cartridge is the urine, and the blood leaving the extracapillary space of the RAD cartridge is returned to the body. The system shown in Figure 11.20 is currently being evalu- ated in clinical trials in humans with acute renal failure and multiorgan failure (Humes et al., 2004). There is also much interest in the production of whole kidneys using tissue engineering concepts (Attanasio et al., 2016; Poornejad et al., 2016). These approaches use organ-shaped scaffolds that are made from whole kidneys that have been stripped of their cells using special detergents leaving behind a biologically derived scaffold, ECM components, and vasculature that can then be reseeded with the appropriate types of cells. The goal is to bioengineer a functional whole kidney. 11.9 Design considerations for bioartificial organs The design of a bioartificial organ is based on the mass transfer principles outlined in Chapters 5 through 7 as well as the reactor design principles described in Section 9.6. The design of a bioar- tificial organ must provide sufficient cell mass to effect the desired physiological response in the patient. Furthermore, the proposed design must allow for the efficient transport of key nutrients and the removal of any waste products. In most cases, the limiting nutrient is oxygen and the device design must be capable of transporting oxygen to all of the cells (Davidson et al., 2010). Example 11.6 A perfusion bioreactor is being designed to contain hepatocytes for the treatment of liver fail- ure. The bioreactor will consist of thin rectangular microflow channels with the hepatocytes encased within a gel-like material that coats the surfaces of the walls of the microflow channel.

(From Fissell, W.H. et al., Ann. NY Acad. Sci., 944, 284, 2001; Attanasio, C. et al., Tissue Eng., 22, 330, 2016.) 590 Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering Assume the cell fraction of the hepatocytes in the gel-like layer is 0.65 and that the pO2 of the perfusion fluid flowing through the microflow channel is 95 mmHg. The gel itself has a negligible effect on the diffusivity of oxygen, and the hepatocytes consume oxygen at the rate of 35 μM s−1. What is the maximum thickness of the gel-like layer of hepatocytes? Assume the value of HO2 is 0.74 mmHg μM−1. Solution The situation that is described is similar to the discussion found in Section 7.8 for oxygen transport in tissue engineered constructs and bioartificial organs. In this case, we can use Equation 7.26 to describe the oxygen profile in the cell containing gel-like material that coats the walls of the flow channel. This equation can be solved for the maximum thickness (δ) assuming the pO2 is 0 mmHg at the interface between the gel layer and the wall of the flow channel, i.e., at x = δ. Equation 7.26 can then be written as shown below: pOpO H D x oxygen oxygen T 22 0 2 2 1d Gf d () =+ é ë ê ù û ú -() = Assuming the perfusion fluid has a negligible change in pO2 and that there is no mass trans- fer resistance between the flowing perfusion fluid and the surface of the gel-like material, then pO2x = 0 = 95 mmHg. The diffusivity of oxygen in the tissue is assumed to be equal to 2.41 × 10−5 cm2 s−1(Bentley et al., 1993). Solving the previous equation results in a value of δ = 165 μm. Problems 11.1 Prepare a paper and presentation that describes a specific application of a bioartificial organ. Include a description of the clinical need, the approach used, results that have been obtained (in vitro, in animals, and the status of any clinical trials), the potential clinical impact, the potential market impact, safety issues, and additional development needs. 11.2 In Example 11.1, the hindered diffusion model of Bungay and Brenner (1973) was used to estimate the effective pore size of the hollow fiber immunoisolation membrane based on the measured solute permeabilities. This hindered diffusion model provides at best a semiquanti- tative description of the membrane’s solute permeability. Discuss factors that may impact the ability of the hindered diffusion model to describe solute permeability data in immunoisola- tion membranes. 11.3 Baker et al. (1997) developed an immunoisolation membrane by incorporating a high water content polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel into a thin disk-shaped microporous polyethersul- fone (PES) filter. The PES filter had a thickness of 150 μm, a porosity of 81%, and a mean pore size of 0.2 μm. The hydrogel formed in the pores of the microporous membrane was found to contain 86% water by weight. The 0.2 μm pores of the microporous membrane should block the cellular components of the immune system, and the PVA hydrogel through control of the PVA cross-linking can be tailored to control the passage of high molecular weight solutes. The table below summarizes the physical properties of the solutes that were used and their measured permeability in this composite membrane. 591 Bioartificial organs Solute Molecular Weight Solute Radius, nm D × 106, cm2 s−1, 23°C Pm × 108, cm s−1 Glucose 180 0.36 6.38 40,000 Vitamin B12 1,355 0.75 3.10 16,000 Inulin 5,500 1.41 1.65 8,000 Lysozyme 14,500 1.92 1.22 80 Myoglobin 16,890 1.9 1.21 70 Chymotrypsinogen 25,000 2.24 1.04 60 Ovalbumin 45,000 2.73 0.851 25 Albumin 69,000 3.55 0.655 4 IgG 160,000 5.35 0.434 4.5 Blue dextran 2,000,000 9.26 0.251 0.5 Source: Baker, A.R. et al., Cell Transplant., 6, 585, 1997. What is the effective pore size of the composite membrane based on the hindered diffusion model? An alternative model for solute diffusion through this composite membrane can be based on the methods outlined in Chapter 6 for gels. In this case, the solute moves through a random fibrous network consisting of the cross-linked polymer chains of the PVA hydrogel. Use Equations 6.47 and 6.48 to describe the solute permeability results. 11.4 It is estimated that perhaps as many as 500,000 patients with diabetes could benefit from a bioartificial pancreas. Assuming that each patient needs about 1 million islets and that the islets need to be replaced each year, then about 1000 pancreatic islet isolations need to be performed each day to meet this demand for islets. Prepare a report that describes a process for the massive isolation of islets of Langerhans from the pancreas of a large mammal such as a dog or a pig. Be sure to describe any safety issues. The references should first be consulted for an assessment of the current state of islet isolation methods for a single pancreas. 11.5 Derive an expression for the steady-state islet insulin secretion rate based on the Nomura et al. (1984) model. 11.6 Derive Equations 11.5 and 11.6 for the islet insulin release rate following a step change in the glucose concentration. 11.7 The following perifusion data was obtained by Lakey et al. (1996) for canine islets of Langerhans. The islets were challenged with glucose that was initially at 50 mg dL−1 fol- lowed by a prompt increase to 500 mg dL−1. Use the Nomura et al. (1984) islet insulin release model to describe these data.

(1991, 1995) pharmacokinetic model for glucose and insulin to describe an OGTT for a normal person. How do the normal person glucose and insulin profiles com- pare to those obtained in Example 11.3 using a bioartificial pancreas? 11.9 Repeat Example 11.3 assuming a 70 kg patient receives an IVGTT. What is the k-value? 11.10 Repeat Example 11.3 assuming the islets are macroencapsulated in the hollow fibers described in Example 11.2. These hollow fiber membranes have a nominal external diameter of 950 μm. What is the entire length of fibers needed? 11.11 For the device described in Example 11.3, the oxygen permeability of the membrane is esti- mated to be 0.001 cm s−1. Show that the maximum volume fraction of the islets is 0.35. 11.12 Repeat Example 11.3 assuming the half-thickness of the device is 350 μm. The membrane oxygen permeability is estimated to be 0.001 cm s−1. How are the glucose and insulin profiles affected by a change in device thickness? What volume fraction of islets is allowable based on oxygen transport limitations? 593 References Abbas, M. and V.P. Tyagi. 1987.
