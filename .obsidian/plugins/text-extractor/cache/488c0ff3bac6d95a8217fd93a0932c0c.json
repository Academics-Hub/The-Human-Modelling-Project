In contrast, the Laplace transform of f (t) can exist even if f (t) → ∞ as t → ∞, provided f (t) is of exponential order, because the factor e −st ensures convergence for Re(s) suﬃciently large. On the other hand, if Re(s) > 0, then the factor e −st would prevent convergence if t were allowed to go to −∞, which is why the Laplace integral starts at t = 0. Most formulae for Laplace transforms have analogues for Fourier transforms, with minor alterations. They can be proved by adapting the Laplace transform proofs. Alternatively, they can be obtained directly from the above relation between F and L2. One simpliﬁcation is that the formula for the transform of a derivative does not involve values of the function at t = 0: since f (t) and its derivatives must tend to zero as t → ±∞, it follows that the extra terms simply disappear. *Fourier transform convolution must be deﬁned slightly diﬀerently, and we shall denote it by ∗2: (f ∗2 g)(t) = ∫ ∞ −∞ f (x)g(t − x) dx, where the integral goes from −∞ to ∞, instead of from 0 to t. However, it leads to a similar formula, if a factor √ 40 (iii) F ( f ′′(t)) = −ω2F (ω) (iv) F (tf (t)) = i d TSF Chapter 3 41 between 0 and ∞, with σ = 1 being the case where the function and its transform are identical. (Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle is based on this result.) Sine and Cosine transforms For real-valued functions that are either even or odd, the inverse and forward transform formulae can be simpliﬁed by putting e ±iωt = cos ωt ± i sin ωt, and using the properties of integrals of even or odd functions. For a real-valued even function f (t), we obtain the result that at points of continuity f (t) = √ 42 11. If Fc and Fs denote the Fourier cosine and sine operators, respectively, acting on real-valued functions deﬁned for t ≥ 0, show that (assuming the transforms exist) Fc(f ′′(t)) = −ω2Fc(f (t)) − √ TSF Chapter 3 43 where D = d 44 from −∞ to ∞, then a Fourier transform is the only possibility. If the function is deﬁned between 0 and ∞, then either a sine transform or a cosine transform can be used, depending on the boundary conditions. The solution will be given in the form of an inverse transform, that is, as an integral, not as an explicit function. However, this is an advantage if Laplace transforms would lead to a solution that cannot be inverted by means of tables. Except for the last step, the method is essentially the same as with Laplace transforms: • Transform the partial diﬀerential equation, using formulae from Questions 4(ii) and 11 to write down transforms of second derivatives. • Solve the resulting ordinary diﬀerential equation, using the boundary conditions or properties of Fourier transforms to evaluate the arbitrary constants (in terms of the transformed variable). • Use Fourier inversion to write down the solution in the form of an integral.
