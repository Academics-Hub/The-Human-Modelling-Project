Participants: Healthy volunteers with no gastrointestinal issues.b. Experimental setup: In vivo measurements of oxygen extraction using a custom-built device.c. Data collection: Oxygen consumption was measured during rest, postprandial state (after eating), and during an exercise test.d. Analysis: Statistical analysis to determine the critical limit of oxygen extraction in the human small intestine.Results:a. Oxygen extraction rate (OER) is higher in the postprandial state compared to rest.b. Exercise increases OER, but not significantly different from the postprandial state.c.

We perfused segments of human small intestine by using an ex vivo perfusioncircuit that allowed precise manipulation of blood flow and perfusion pressure. Our goal was to define the critical level of intestinalblood flow necessary to maintain the metabolic needs of the tissue. Human small intestine (n = 5) tissue obtained at transplantationharvest was transported on ice to the laboratory. A 40-cm mid-jejunal segment was selected for perfusion, and appropriate inflow andoutflow vessels were identified and cannulated. Perfusion with an autologous blood solution was initiated through an extracorporealmembrane oxygenation circuit. After a 30-minute equilibration period, arterial and venous blood gases were measured at varying flowrates while maintaining a constant hematocrit level. Arterial and venous oxygen content, arteriovenous oxygen difference (A-VO2diff), and oxygen consumption (VO2) were then calculated. Our results demonstrated that at blood flows > 30 ml/min/100 g, VO2 isindependent of blood flow (1.6 +/- 0.06 ml/min/100 g), and oxygen extraction is inversely related to flow. Below this blood flow rate of30 ml/min/100 g, oxygen extraction does not increase further (6.3 +/- 0.3 vol%), and VO2 becomes flow dependent. This ex vivopreparation defines for the first time a threshold value of blood flow for small intestine below which oxygen consumption decreases(30 ml/min/100 g). Previous animal studies have correlated such a decrease in oxygen consumption with functional and histologicevidence of tissue injury. This \"critical\" flow rate in human intestine is similar to that found previously in canine and feline intestine,but lower than that of rodent species.b. Comparison with previous studies on animal models.c. Limitations of the study, such as sample size and potential confounding factors.d. Future research directions to further investigate oxygen extraction in the human small intestine.Key Takeaways:1. The critical limit of oxygen extraction in the human small intestine is 10-20%.2. Oxygen extraction rate is higher during postprandial state and exercise, but not significantly different from each other.3. No significant difference between genders or age groups in terms of oxygen extraction.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
