Pericardial sinus Transverse sinus Oblique sinus Layers of the heart wall Blood supply & innervation Arterial supply • Pericardiacophrenic arteries • Internal thoracic arteries • Musculophrenic arteries • Inferior phrenic arteries • Thoracic aorta Venous drainage • Azygous system of veins • Internal thoracic veins • Superior phrenic veins Innervation Phrenic nerves: sensory fibers that control pain sensation, Sympathetic trunks: vasomotor fibers. Parasympathetic: Vagus nerve THE HEART Position • Heart lies in the middle mediastinum. • Behind the body of sternum and the 2nd to 6th costal cartilages • 1/3rd of the heart lies to the right • 2/3rdto the left of the midline. • It lies opposite to T5- T8 vertebrae in supine position • T6 – T9 vertebrae in erect position. Four borders • Superior: is formed by the two atria. • Right: Right atrium • Inferior: Mainly by right ventricle and slightly by left ventricle. • Left: mainly by left ventricle, partly by left auricle a Surface Formed by Sternocostal RA, RV, LV, Left auricle Posterior 2/3rd by LA &1/3rd by RA Diaphragmatic 2/3rd by LV &1/3rd By RV Abbreviations RA: Right atrium RV: Right Ventricle LA: Left atrium LV: Left ventricleSurface Markings: Borders of heart Border Upper (Superior) R 3rd CC on RS of sternum to 2nd IC space LS of sternum Lower (Inferior) Sternal end of R 6th CC to midclavicular line in L 5th IC space Right Extends from R 3rd CC to near R 6th CC Left L 2nd IC space to midclavicular line in L 5th IC space Abbreviations CC: costal cartilage IC: Intercostal L: Left R: Right The Grooves of the heart ✓ Atrioventricular sulcus (coronary sulcus): separates atria from ventricles. ✓ Anterior interventricular sulcus: separates right and left ventricles on the sternocostal surface. ✓ Posterior interventricular sulcus: separates right and left ventricles on the diaphragmatic surface. Internal partitions divide the heart into four chambers (i.e. two atria and two ventricles) and produce surface or external grooves referred to as sulci. External Heart: Anterior ViewExternal Heart: Posterior ViewChambers of the heartThe Right atrium • 3 openings ✓ SVC ✓ IVC ✓ Coronary sinus • Right auricle Internal features • Anterior: roughened (Pectinate muscles) • Posterior : smooth (embryological origin: Sinus venosum) • SA Node (pace maker): Located at the superior extent of cristae terminalis , near opening of SVC • Cristae terminalis (separates anterior part from posterior part • Fossa ovalis (remnant of foramen ovale • Limbus fossa ovalis ( prominent margin around fossa ovalis) • Opening of coronary sinus • Tricuspid valve (atrioventricular valve: 3 cusps- between RA & RV) The Left atrium • Left auricle • Pectinate M. • Pulmonary veins • Bicuspid valve The VentriclesThe Ventricles Ventricles are the discharging chambers of the heart Papillary muscles and trabeculae carneae muscles mark ventricular walls • Separated by an interventricular septum Contains components of the conduction system • Right ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonary trunk • Left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta ✓ Thicker myocardium due to greater work load ✓ Pulmonary circulation supplied by right ventricle is a much low pressure system requiring less energy output by ventricle ✓ Systemic circulation supplied by left ventricle is a higher pressure system and thus requires more forceful contractions RIGHT VENTRICLE LEFT VENTRICLE The walls are thinner The walls are 3 times thicker Trabeulae carneae are coarse and few Trabeulae carneae are fine and numerous Has three papillary muscles Has 2 papillary muscles Chordae tendinae are few and short Chordae tendinae are more and long Atrioventricular orifice is guarded by tricuspid valve Atrioventricular orifice is guarded by bicuspid valve Conical cavity shorter Conical cavity longer Moderator band No moderator band Differences between the right and left ventricle. Moderator band/Septomarginal trabecula Specialized trabecula in RV that extends from right side of the ventricular septum to base of anterior papillary muscle. It carries right branch of bundle of His. Pulmonary & Systemic circulationThe Heart ValvesThe Heart Valves Heart valves ensure unidirectional blood flow through the heart ✓ Composed of an endocardium with a connective tissue core ✓ Two major types ✓ Atrioventricular valves ✓ Semilunar valves ✓ Atrioventricular (AV) valves lie between the atria and the ✓ ventricles R-AV valve = tricuspid valve L-AV valve = bicuspid or mitral valve AV valves prevent backflow of blood into the atria when ventricles contract Chordae tendineae anchor AV valves to papillary muscles of ventricle wall Prevent prolapse of valve back into atrium The Semilunar Heart Valves ✓ Lead into the large arteries ✓ Formed from 3 moon-shaped cusps 1) Aortic Semilunar Valve 2) Pulmonary Semilunar Valve The Semilunar Heart Valves • Semilunar valves prevent backflow of blood into the ventricles Have no chordae tendinae attachments • Aortic semilunar valve lies between the left ventricle and the aorta • Pulmonary semilunar valve lies between the right ventricle and pulmonary trunk • Heart sounds (“lub-dup”) due to valves closing “Lub” - closing of atrioventricular valves “Dub”- closing of semilunar valves Heart valve Location of valve Site for auscultation with stethoscope Aortic valve: Obliquely, posterior to sternum at level of 3rd intercostal space. 2nd right intercostal space, sternal border Pulmonary valve: 3rd costal cartilage at left side of sternum. 2nd left intercostal space, sternal border Tricuspid (right AV) posterior to body of sternum at right 3rd or 4th intercostal spaces 5th left intercostal space sternal border Mitral (left AV) posterior to sternum, at 4th left costal cartilage 5th left intercostal space midclavicular line END OF PART 1 Thanks for listening","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
