{"path":"Physiology/Physiology Slides/Lipid Metabolism.pdf","text":"Hello PHSL 2004A Class of 2023. I am Eliton Chivandi [P.G. Dip. Health Sci. Edu., BSc. Hons., MSc., PhD; Room: 7M09 ], an Associate Professor in the Wits School of Physiology. I look forward with excitement to facilitating you through this section of the course. WELCOME TO THE LIPID NUTRITION & METABOLISM SECTION Introduction: This section of the course is made up of 5 lectures, 1 reinforcement session and 1 tutorial. The reinforcement session will combine a discussion on content covered for both ENERGY METABOLISM and LIPID METABOLISM. Questions for the tutorial are attached at the end of the your “Energy Metabolism” and “Lipid Metabolism” lecture content slide series. The quiz, which contributes towards your formative assessment and year mark for each of the sections (Energy Metabolism and Lipid Metabolism) will be posted online as per the timetable. Lectures and Content Delivery Approach: The five lectures will cover content on 5 major sub-sections, that is, “Whole Body Overview of Lipid Metabolism”, “Lipids: Nutrition, Properties, Function & Nomenclature”, “Catabolic Processes in Lipid Metabolism”, “Anabolic Processes in Lipid Metabolism” and “Lipid Transport.” Content will be delivered in a series of VOPPs which will be uploaded on the ULWAZI. You will also have access to hard copy (printed) and uploaded PDF of the lecture slides. Please go through and revise the content; write down any points that you need further clarity on for us to engage on such points/questions during the reinforcement session. Quiz: It is encouraged that you go through the section lecture content and actively participate during the reinforcement sessions before attempting the quiz. Please observe the quiz upload, open and submission dates. It is best that you work through the quiz questions a little in advance so that you do not have to be pressured to submit at the last minute. Tutorial: Tutorial questions are attached at the end of your “Energy Metabolism” course pack. Additional MCQs are also attached at the end of the lipid metabolism lecture slides. I have deliberately given these in advance so that you prepare in order for us to have fruitful engagement during the tutorial. Discussion: I will frequently check the “Discussion Forum of Ulwazi.” Should you have any questions I encourage you to post them on this platform so that everybody benefits and we avoid duplication of the same questions. I will endeavour to check the “discussion forum on Ulwazi” once daily during the course lectures and provide answers to posted questions. I urge you to also have a constant look on the forum. I trust that you will enjoy the “Energy Metabolism” lecture series. All the best. 1 1. Overview 2. Definitions and Chemical Structures 3. Digestion, Absorption, Storage and Transport 4.

THE ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS, linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, ARE REQUIRED IN DIET. Dietary Sources of Fats: • fats such as butter, lard (meat fat) • oils such as sunflower, olive, canola, peanut oil • foods such as meat, cheese, nuts, soya beans, oily fish (salmon, tuna, sardines) Metabolic Sources of Fats: • fatty acid synthesis in the liver (from glucose via acetyl-CoA) - lipogenesis • cholesterol synthesis in the liver • triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis in adipose tissue (from fatty acids and glucose) LIPIDS: NUTRITION 7 Physical Properties: • consist mostly of CARBON AND HYDROGEN (hydrocarbons). • usually liquid at body temperature • insoluble in water Physiological Functions: • energy production • energy storage • insulation • substrate for the synthesis of phospholipids • Substrate for the synthesis of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) - signaling molecules LIPIDS: GENERAL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES & PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS 8 CLASSES OF LIPIDS a. Fatty Acids (FAs): • FAs are a hydrocarbon chain with a carboxyl (COOH) group at one end • most have an even number of carbon atoms in the chain (usually 12-24) • the general name for the carbon chain is an ‘acyl’ group which (acyl) refers to any length of carbon chain i.e. acyl-CoA Stearic acid – an 18 carbon fatty acid Fatty acids are AMPHIPHILIC – have both HYDROPHOBIC and HYDROPHILIC properties b. Saturated Fatty Acids (SFAs) Hydrophilic end Hydrophobic end 9 Cis- and trans- Arrangement Trans oleic acidCis oleic acid c. Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs): Oleic acid – an 18 carbon monounsaturated fatty acid Points o Note: • 95% of unsaturated fatty acids are in the cis- conformation • Trans- fatty acids increase the risk of heart disease 10 d. Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs): Linoleic acid – an 18 carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid Points to Notes – Saturated Versus Unsaturated Fats: • saturated FAs are preferred in energy metabolism • unsaturated FAs are important STRUCTURALLY and for HORMONE synthesis • UNSATURATED FAs are associated with DECREASED blood cholesterol • SATURATED FAs are associated with INCREASED blood cholesterol • the ratio of unsaturated:saturated FA in the diet should be about 3:1 11 FATTY ACID NOMENCLATURE β • the 2nd carbon from the carboxylic acid group is the α-carbon & the 3rd is the β-carbon • when naming FAs counting is from the OMEGA (ω) carbon – the last carbon in FA. • therefore above FA is CisC18:4ω3,6,9,12 Stearic acid: C18:0 Cis Oleic acid: CisC181ω9 Linoleic acid: CisC182ω9,12 12 ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS (EFAs) Human DESATURASES can insert double bonds in a saturated FA up to, but not further than 8 carbons from the COOH. β No NoNo yes If an unsaturated fatty acid is required with double bonds further than 9 carbons from the COOH group, it must be obtained in the diet. The EFAs are needed to synthesise the EICOSANOIDS, for examples prostaglandins and thromboxanes. 13 ESSENTIAL FATTY ACID DEFICIENCY: SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS https://teach.lanecc.edu/yuia/225lectures/05b/l5byui.html EFAs Deficiency Signs • dry scaly rash – dermatitis • growth stunting in infants and children • increased susceptibility to infection • poor wound healing • impaired cognitive development Possible EFAs Deficiency • Picture on the left depicts child with EFAs deficiency • Possible cause: feeding of FAT-FREE FORMULA or FAT-FREE MILK or had INTESTINAL DISEASES preventing fat absorption • On the right same child after getting EFAs 14 + 3 X fatty acids (acyls) Glycerol esterification hydrolysis TAGs are the STORAGE FORM OF FATTY ACIDS, they are found in ADIPOCYTES A triacylglycerol TRIACYLGLYCEROLS (TAGs)/TRIGLYCERIDES 15 Monoacylglycerol (MAG) Diacylglycerol (DAG) Glycerol Triacylglycerol (TAG) F a t t y a c i d F a t t y a c i d F a t t y a c i d Glycerol F a t t y a c i d F a t t y a c i d Glycerol F a t t y a c i d O H O H O H OTHER TYPES OF ‘ACYL’GLYCEROLS 16 • The most common lipid in the diet is triacylglycerols • Triacylglycerols consist of 3 fatty acids joined to glycerol by ester bonds. • Triacylglycerols are hydrophobic • Glycerol has 3 hydroxyl groups, which make it hydrophilic • Fatty acids consist of a carboxyl group, which is hydrophilic, and a variable length CH tail, which is hydrophobic • Fatty acids are AMPHIPHILIC (both hydrophilic & hydrophobic). • Fatty acids are unsaturated if they have double bonds, which may be cis or trans. • Essential fatty acids, LINOLEIC ACID and ALPHA LINOLENIC ACID, have cis double bonds in the ω-3 and/or ω6 position. • They are essential in the diet because humans cannot insert double bonds >9 carbons from the COOH group.

Points to Note: • The end product of β-oxidation is acetyl-CoA • All the reactions of β-oxidation take place within the mitochondrial matrix 26 Transport of Fatty Acids into the Mitochondrion On entry to the cell from blood, FFAs are converted to fatty acyl-CoA in the cytoplasm. Fatty acyl-CoA is then transported into the mitochondrial matrix via the carnitine palmitoyl transporters (CPT-I and CPT-II) cytosol β-oxidation acetyl-CoA Malonyl CoA- Insulin + FAs FA synthesis Regulation: Malonyl-CoA inhibits CPT-1 27 β-oxidation of Fatty Acids in Mitochondria In β-oxidation, 2 carbons at a time are cleaved from fatty acyl-CoA to yield: • acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) and • a fatty acyl-CoA with 2 less carbons C16 FA re-enters β-oxidation C18 fatty acyl-CoA C16 fatty acyl-CoA + acetyl-CoA NADH2 FADH2 CoA C16 fatty acyl-CoA C14 fatty acyl-CoA + acetyl-CoA NADH2 FADH2 CoA And so on….. The final C4 Fatty Acyl-CoA yields 2 x acetyl-CoA, 1 x NADH2 and 1 x FADH2 28 Complete Oxidation of an C18 Fatty Acid: A Summary There are 7 rounds for a C18 fatty acid. Each round generates: 1 x FADH2, 1 x NADH2 and 1 x Acetyl-CoA Last round (C4 FA) generates: 1 x FADH2, 1 x NADH2, and 2 x Acetyl-CoA Therefore: 8 x FADH2 = 16 ATPs 8 x NADH2 = 24 ATPs 9 x Acetyl CoA = 108 ATPs TOTAL energy production per molecule of a C18 FA = 148 ATPs. 29 KETONE SYNTHESIS – KETOGENESIS I • Ketone Synthesis occurs in the liver • acetyl-CoA is the substrate used in ketone synthesis • A high rate of β-oxidation results in the accumulation of acetyl-CoA which is then used for ketogenesis 2 acetyl-CoA (2C) Acetoacetate (4C) CO2 + Acetone (3C) β-hydroxybutyrate (4C) Ketone bodies 2 CoA recycled Blown off at lungs (Fruity breath) Excreted in urine 30 KETONE SYNTHESIS: II acetyl-CoA oxaloacetate fatty acids Ketogenesis increases when blood glucose is low. Why? Low blood glucose results in glucagon-mediated dependency on fatty acids for energy. Increased glucagon inhibits the reaction between OAA & acetyl- CoA to form citrate & also bleeds from the Krebs cycle OAA as a gluconeogenic substrate. The large amounts of acetyl-CoA from FAs is used to synthesise ketones glucagon glucose + + X  ketones CoA 31 Notes Regarding Ketogenesis: Points to Note: • Ketogenesis increase in FASTING and STARVATION, UNCONTROLLED DIABETES MELLITUS (particularly type-1), and EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL intake • Ketones are acidic and excess ketones cause ketoacidosis (or ketosis) NB: In fasting and starvation there is glucagon mediated dependency on free fatty acids for energy (increased acetyl-CoA). In type-1 DM, there is NO INSULIN SUPPRESSION of glucagon & alcohol metabolism generates acetate which is a precursor of acetyl-CoA • When glucose is in short supply, ketones can be used by the CNS to regenerate acetyl-CoA acetoacetate acetoacetate-CoA 2 acetyl-CoA TCA cycle • Therefore the CNS can use ketones as an alternative fuel source when glucose is low CoA CoA 32 HEPATOCYTE intestine chylomicron lipoprotein lipasefatty acid triacylglycerol adipocyte with lipid droplet albumin-fatty acid fatty acid fatty acyl-CoA acyl-carnitine -oxidation acetyl-CoA TCA cycleketones CNS CO2 & ATP acetyl-CoA TCA cycle CO2 & ATP lipolysis ketogenesis acyl-CoA mitochondria blood LIPID CATABOLISM: A SUMMARY Conversion of TAGs to Energy: Lipolysis – fatty acid oxidation in liver – products to TCA and ETC – ATP or acetyl CoA – ketone bodies used by brain and nervous tissue which has mitochondria, but cannot metabolize FAs 33 •When blood glucose decreases, decreased insulin and increased glucagon & adrenaline stimulate lipolysis of TAGs in the adipose tissue by hormone sensitive lipase. • Free fatty acids are released into the blood, bind to albumin and are transported to the liver and other tissues. • Inside the cells fatty acids are combined with co-enzyme A to form acyl-CoA. • Acyl-CoA cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane. Therefore it is converted to acyl-carnitine (by carnitine-palmitoyl transferase 1, CPT1). Inside the mitochondrion, acyl-carnitine is converted back to acyl-CoA (by CPT2). • In the mitochondrion acyl-CoA is catabolized by -oxidation and converted to acetyl-CoA. • Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle for energy metabolism. • Under certain conditions, acetyl-CoA saturates the TCA cycle in the liver and excess acetyl-CoA is converted to ketone bodies.

They are provided (from glucose) by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate shunt respectively. • Acetyl-CoA is produced in the mitochondria whereas enzymes for fatty acid synthesis are in the cytosol. Therefore acetyl-CoA is converted to citrate (first step of the TCA cycle) and transported out of the mitochondrion. Citrate is cleaved to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate re- enters the mitochondrion as pyruvate. • Acetyl-CoA is combined with CO2 to form malonyl-CoA. This is the rate-limiting step of fatty acid synthesis. The enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is activated by insulin and citrate. ACC is inhibited by glucagon, adrenaline and long chain fatty acyl-CoA. • Fatty acid elongation starts with acetyl-CoA, which is condensed with 2 carbons of malonyl-CoA and reduced by NADPH. The addition of 2 carbons from malonyl-CoA is repeated until the chain is 16 carbons long. This gives palmitate/palmitic acid.

In adipose tissue TAG synthesis in adipose tissue requires glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate not glycerol. This is obtained from glucose via glycolysis. FATTY ACIDS synthesised in the liver are then used to synthesise TAGs in the liver 41 http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/LIVEHTML/LIVER011.html This is the external surface of a normal liver. The color is brown and the surface is smooth. A normal liver is about 1200 to 1600 grams. This liver is enlarged and has a pale yellow appearance, seen both on the capsule and cut surface. This uniform change is consistent with fatty metamorphosis (fatty change).

Insulin Statins (anti-cholesterol pharmacotherapy) + - Cholesterol Contd.. 43 Occlusion of coronary artery HYPERCHOLESTEROLAEMIA 44 • Fatty acid synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm, mostly in the liver, usually when excess carbohydrate energy is available. • Acetyl-CoA is transferred from the mitochondrion to the cytoplasm via the oxaloacetate shuttle, which involves conversion to citrate followed by regeneration of acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm. • Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the rate limiting production of the 3-carbon, malonyl-CoA, which is stimulated by citrate and insulin. It is inhibited by glucagon (low glucose), adrenaline and long chain fatty acyl-CoA (product inhibition). • Fatty acid synthase catalyzes transfer of 2-carbon fragments from malonyl-CoA to the nascent (growing) fatty acid chain, starting with acetyl-CoA, until there are 16 carbons (palmitate). • Triacylglycerol synthesis requires activation of glycerol to glycerol-phosphate. Adipose tissue lacks glycerol kinase, so it requires glycolysis to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate which is used fro TAG synthesis. • Cholesterol is synthesized, mostly in the liver, by condensation of acetyl-CoA. The rate-limiting step is production of mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase, which is stimulated by insulin and inhibited by glucagon, cholesterol and the “lipid lowering” statin drugs. • Triacylglycerol synthesized in the liver is packaged into VLDL for transport to peripheral tissues, where lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzes it to fatty acids and glycerol. Lipoprotein lipase is stimulated by insulin in adipose tissue. However, in muscles, which use fatty acids for energy production, lipoprotein lipase activity is increased by low glucose levels and adrenaline. VLDL remnants return to the liver.

VLDL 25-30 TAGs and cholesterol (from liver) Transport of TAGs from liver to adipose tissue and peripheral cells. LDL 20-25 Cholesterol and phospholipids Transport of cholesterol from liver to periphery. HDL 9-12 Cholesterol and phospholipids Transport of cholesterol from periphery to liver. 48 The Apoproteins (Apolipoproteins) The apoproteins are synthesised in the liver and they act as: • hydrophilic ‘solubilisers’ of lipid droplets. • signalling proteins for the interaction of lipoproteins with enzymes and receptors that bring about the transfer of lipoproteins, or the lipids they contain, into the cells Some Important Apoproteins: Apoprotein (Apo) Lipoproteins Main function ApoB-100 LDL Recognised by the LDL-receptor on cells of the periphery. The LDL receptor brings about the uptake of the lipoprotein particle into the cell i.e. cholesterol move into cells. ApoC-1 and ApoC-11 All lipoproteins Recognised by lipoprotein lipase which then hydrolyses the TAGs in the lipoprotein to form FAs and glycerol in the cell ApoE VLDL, chylomicrons Recognised by the LDL receptor. ApoA-1 and ApoA-11 HDL Recognised by hepatic ‘scavenger receptors’ which bring about the uptake of cholesterol from HDL into the hepatocyte. The cholesterol is then excreted. 49 An example of lipoprotein metabolism: The Metabolism of chylomicrons (Adapted from Meissenberg and Simmons, Principles of Medical Biochemistry (2nd ed.) Fig 25.3, p464) C, free cholesterol; CE, cholesterol ester; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; PL, phospholipid; TG, triacylglycerol; FAs, fatty acids Adipocyte FAs TG glycerol 50 CHOLESTEROL: THE “GOOD AND BAD CHOLESTEROL” • Total cholesterol = cholesterol content of HDL and LDL cholesterol • HDL is ‘GOOD CHOLESTEROL’ because it removes cholesterol from the periphery and takes it to the liver for excretion. More is ‘better’. • LDL is ‘BAD CHOLESTEROL’ because it transports cholesterol from the liver and deposits it in the periphery. More is ‘worse’. • Ideally the ratio of total [cholesterol]:[HDL] should be approx. 3:1, for example, if total cholesterol = 5 mmol/l then [HDL] should be approx. 1.6 mmol/l Normal total cholesterol should be less than 5 mmol/l An increased blood cholesterol indicates an increased risk of cardiovascular disease 51 THE LIPOPROTEINAEMIAS Type Sign Features I Increased chylomicrons A rare deficiency in lipoprotein lipase activity. II Increased LDL A genetic deficiency in the LDL receptor. Relatively common in South Africa, particularly among people of Afrikaans descent. IV Increased VLDL Common. Associated with type-II diabetes mellitus. A group of potentially severe conditions relating to errors in lipoprotein metabolism. They are often genetic. 52 THE EICOSANOIDS The essential fatty acids Points to Note: The essential fatty acids are found in cells as components of membrane phospholipids. They are cleaved off these phospholipids before being converted into these eicosanoid precursors. The eicosanoids are the prostaglandins, prostacyclins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes. They are synthesised from precursors made from the essential fatty acids.
