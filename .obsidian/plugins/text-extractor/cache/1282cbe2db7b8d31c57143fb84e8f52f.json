ATP What is blood? • Fluid • circulates in vessels • consists of: • Plasma • Water, electrolytes (HCO3-) • Nutrients (glucose, lipids, micronutrients) • Proteins (albumin, inactive clotting factors & anticoagulants) • Hormones, • Waste products (urea, uric acid, bilirubin) • “Cells” red blood cells platelets white blood cells Cellular components of Blood 3 different functions of “cells” - Red blood cells (RBC): transport O2 - Platelets: form clots and prevent bleeding - White cells (leucocytes): immunity= defense of self against external organisms (parasites, virus, bacteria) or abnormal self cells (tumors and old or damaged cells) (discussed in immunology) - Polynuclear: neutrophil, basophil, eosinophil - Mononuclear: lymphocytes and monocytes Red blood cell (erythrocyte) RBC lymphocyte Platelet Origins of different blood cells • Embryo and Foetus • Liver and spleen Blood Production site(s) • Adult life: bone marrow • Bone marrow: in all bones, but in particular • flat bones (iliac bones, sternum, ribs, vertebrae) • proximal portions of long bones (tibia, humerus, femur) Modified from Sherwood Fundamentals of Physiology Fig. 11-13, p. 312 Platelets ErythrocytesGranulocytes Monocytes Lymphocytes Lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues Monocyte precursors Granulocyte precursors Erythrocyte precursors Megakaryocyte precursors Common myeloid progenitor Pluripotent haematopoietic stem cell In bone marrow In blood T lymphocyte Monocyte/macrophage Neutrophil Eosinophil Basophil B lymphocyte Common lymphoid progenitor Haematopoiesis (blood cell synthesis)Production of Different Blood Cell Types in Words • All blood cells are made in red bone marrow. • All blood cells are derived from pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells, also called haemocytoblasts. • In addition to replicating themselves, pluripotent haematopoietic stems cells produce partially differentiated daughter cells that are common myeloid progenitor cells or common lymphoid progenitor cells. • Common lymphoid progenitor cells divide and differentiate to ultimately generate T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, which are important in the “adaptive” immune system. • B lymphocytes make antibodies, which are proteins that bind to pathogens, foreign proteins and damaged cells and proteins as part of the immune response. • Common myeloid progenitor cells divide and differentiate to produce precursor cells for generating red blood cells (erythrocytes), granulocytes, monocytes and megakaryocytes. • Granulocytes include neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils, which are important for fighting infections by different types of pathogens. • Monocytes mature to become macrophages, which phagocytose pathogens and damaged or old cells of the body, including erythrocytes. • Megakaryocytes give off cell particles, called platelets, which are important for blood coagulation (clotting) in combination with clotting factors in the plasma.

(What happens to blood cells if a person has a deficiency of folate or vitamin B12?) • Synthesis of haemoglobin requires the micronutrient, iron. (What happens to blood cells if a person has a deficiency of iron?) • Erythrocytes die after ~120 days in the blood. Clinical Case • A 50-year old man has had kidney disease for years of years and it getting worse. • When he comes to the clinic, his skin is pale, he is out of breath and tires very easily. • How could his kidney disease explain his symptoms? Regulation of Erythropoiesis (red blood cell synthesis) If there are too many RBCs (polycythaemia): - Enough oxygen present, but - Increased blood viscosity - Decreased flow (blood clots and other problems) If there are too few RBCs: - Too little oxygen delivery - Decreased metabolism - Tissue cell death How do we tell the bone marrow to increase or decrease synthesis of RBCs? RBC oxygen and erythropoietin Modified from Sherwood Fundamentals of Physiology Fig. 11-3, p. 301 EPO stimulates RBC synthesis Kidney More RBCs carry more oxygen low oxygen detected More oxygen decreases EPO secretion Erythrocytes Erythropoietin 3 4 5 1 2 Regulation of red blood cell synthesis EPO secreted Red bone marrow Erythropoietin (EPO) • Erythropoietin is the main hormone that stimulates erythrocyte (red blood cell) production. • Made in the KIDNEY (90%) and liver (10%). • Too little oxygen in the blood leads to low tissue oxygenation (hypoxia). • Hypoxia of the kidneys stimulates erythropoietin production. • EPO is produced in cells bordering renal arterioles that are immediately sensitive to O2 changes in RBCs. • Release of EPO from kidney stops once tissue oxygenation is back to normal. • Increased EPO release can be elevated for long periods of time to sustain long periods of exposure to hypoxia (e.g. in high altitude). • If erythropoietin cannot be produced: lower stimulation of erythrocyte production  anaemia. Regulation of Erythropoiesis by Erythropoietin Haematopoietic stem cells Common myeloid progenitors Unipotent stem cells Erythroblasts Erythrocytes Enucleation Erythropoietin (EPO) stimulates cell division/replication of RBC precursors only DNA synthesis Proerythroblasts Reticulocytes Other growth factors stimulate cell division/replication to increase all blood cells Increased release of reticulocytes into blood (~5 days) Insufficient erythropoiesis results in anaemia Factors that decrease tissue oxygen (cause hypoxia) and stimulate production of Erythropoietin (EPO) • Anaemia = below-normal O2-carrying capacity of the blood, characterized by a low haematocrit and/or low haemoglobin. • Poor blood flow: e.g. heart failure, low blood pressure, haemorrhage. • Pulmonary disease: decreased O2 entry from lung to blood. • High altitude: O2 in the air is decreased. Function of Red Blood Cells and Haemoglobin Synthesis & Metabolism Blood Ursula Mariani, Blood Forum Email: Ursula.mariana@wits.ac.za Red blood cells (erythrocytes) • Whole blood allowed to stand or centrifuged separates into: • cellular components (at the bottom of the tube) • leukocytes on top of erythrocytes • plasma (on top of the tube). • Cellular component (mostly red blood cells) = 45-55% (in Johannesburg) of the whole blood sample volume  Percentage volume of RBCs in blood = Haematocrit. = ~5 x 1012 RBCs/litre of Blood (~5 million million/l) (more in men than women) (compare with ~5 x 109/litre WBCs= ~5 thousand million/l) Essentials of physiology 4th edition– L Sherwood Erythrocytes • No nucleus (cannot replicate) • No organelles (no protein synthesis, no oxidative metabolism) • Enzymes are present for anaerobic glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (anti-oxidant), converting CO2 to H2CO3 (carbonic acid, carbonic anhydrase) • Disk-like biconcave shape Erythrocytes: important properties • Biconcave disk shape provides a large surface area for O2 to diffuse into the cell. • Shape enables O2 to diffuse rapidly to the whole cell. • Very flexible “loose” membrane allows RBCs to deform and squeeze through vessels less than 3 μm in diameter (RBC diameter = 7.8 μm) • RBCs contain haemoglobin. • 12 – 16 g/decilitre of blood (1/10 litre) = 120 to 160 g/l Why does haemoglobin need to be “packaged” inside cells? 1 Haem + 1 globin polypeptide chain (alpha or beta) = 1 subunit of haemoglobin 1 molecule of haemoglobin contains 4 haemoglobin subunits 1 molecule of haemoglobin contains : -4 haems -4 polypeptide chains -4 Fe++ 2 alpha chains + 2 beta chains  haemoglobin A Fe2+ protoporphyrin pyrrole Succinyl -CoA Haem (porphyrin + Fe2+) Haemoglobin SynthesisHaemoglobin https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1GZX_Haemoglobin.png#/media/File:1GZX_Haemoglobin.png Α-globin chains (red) β-globin chains (blue) Haem rings (green) Iron (orange) What happens in iron deficiency? What happens to haemoglobin when RBCs die? • Lifespan of an erythrocyte ~120 days • Membranes become fragile and break when erythrocytes go through small vessels in the spleen (3 μm vs. 8 μm of diameter). • When the cells break, free haemoglobin is bound by a plasma protein, haptoglobin. • Macrophages phagocytose haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex. Fe2+ is released from haemoglobin & stored for reuse. Porphyrin is converted to BILIRUBIN (yellow pigment). Erythrocyte and Haemoglobin Breakdown Fe2+ Picture By Stefcho2 - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9872836 Haem = red/bluish-red Bilirubin = yellow • Bilirubin is released into the blood • Bilirubin is then transported to- and metabolized by- the liver and intestines. Erythrocyte and Haemoglobin Breakdown What happens if there is excessive breakdown of RBCs? to: plasma haptoglobin plasma bilirubin • Plasma haptoglobin concentration decreases. • Liver’s capacity to metabolise bilirubin is exceeded and bilirubin accumulates in blood and tissues  skin and mucosa and eye conjunctivae become yellow (icteric) jaundice https://www.healthunbox.com/en/jaundice/ http://cp4x3a.xara.hosting/jaundice.htm Function of Haemoglobin Blood Ursula Mariani, Blood Forum Email: Ursula.mariana@wits.ac.za How does Haemoglobin (Hb) Bind Oxygen? HAEM • 98% of O2 in blood is bound to Hb • 1 molecular oxygen (O2) binds to Fe2+ in each haem group. • 4 O2 + Hb --> Hb(O2)4 • Binding is non-covalent and reversible • Fe2+ is not oxidised (to Fe3+) (methaemoglobin). • O2 binds to Hb easily (tightly) in the pulmonary capillaries (high [O2]). • O2 is released easily in the capillaries of the peripheral tissues (low [O2]). • When O2 is bound to Hb  blood appears red (arteries) • When O2 dissociates from (leaves) Hb  blood appears blueish (veins) How does Hb bind O2 tightly in the lungs, then release it easily in the tissues? • Each subunit of Hb can exist in two different protein conformations, one with low affinity for (looser binding of) O2 and 1 with higher affinity for (tighter binding of) O2. • The low affinity conformation is favoured (stabilised) when O2 is not bound and the high affinity conformation is favoured when O2 is bound. • I.e. binding of O2 changes the conformation of the subunit from the low affinity conformation to the high affinity conformation. • Binding of O2 to one or two subunits of the four subunits of Hb favours the conversion of all four subunits to the high affinity conformation. • This increases the binding affinity of the “empty” subunits for O2 and more O2 binds. (So the Hb molecule is “full”.) O2 O2 O2 O2 O2 O2 O2 O2 O2 No O2 bound, all subunits low affinity conformation O2 binding changes to high affinity conformation O2 binding favours high affinity conformation of empty subunits O2 binds more to high affinity conformation subunits Cooperative Binding of Oxygen to Haemoglobin (Hb) • Cooperative binding allows Hb to bind lots of O2 in the lungs (high [O2], high affinity) and release it in the tissues (low [O2], lower affinity, easier to “let go”).Figure modified from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hb_saturation_curve.png Cooperative Binding of Oxygen to Haemoglobin (Hb) Concentration of oxygen% Hb subunits with oxygen bound P50 O2 concentration in lungs O2 concentration in tissues • CO2 binds to the globin (not haem) and stabilises the low affinity conformation of Hb  increased CO2 in tissues increases release of O2. • H+ (hydrogen ions/protons) bind to negatively-charged amino acids of the globins and stabilise the low affinity conformation of Hb  tissues produce lactic acid during anaerobic respiration and RBCs convert CO2 to carbonic acid. Binding of H+ from both acids increases release of O2 from Hb in the tissues. • 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) binds to the globins and stabilises the low affinity conformation of Hb  2,3-BPG is produced by RBCs in hypoxia and increases release of O2 from Hb in the tissues. Other things that bind to Haemoglobin (Hb) also affect Oxygen Binding Affinity diagram modified from https://derangedphysiology.com/mai n/core-topics-intensive-care/arterial- blood-gas- interpretation/Chapter%204.0.5/facto rs-which-influence-affinity- haemoglobin-oxygen ↓ pH (↑H+ ions, Bohr effect) ↑ CO2 (Haldane effect) ↑ 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3BPG, low oxygen, anaemia, high altitude) ↑ body temperature Favour low affinity Hb conformation, decrease Hb-O2 affinity, right-shift curve, O2 comes off. ↑ pH (↓H+ ions) ↓ CO2 ↓ 2,3BPG ↓ body temperature Favour high affinity Hb conformation, increase Hb-O2 affinity, left-shift curve, O2 stays bound.

Binding of H+ from both acids increases release of O2 from Hb in the tissues. • 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) binds to the globins and stabilises the low affinity conformation of Hb  2,3-BPG is produced by RBCs in hypoxia and increases release of O2 from Hb in the tissues. • CO (carbon monoxide) binds to haem iron with higher affinity (more tightly) than O2 , preventing O2 binding and stabilises the high affinity conformation preventing O2 release  cell death due to lack of O2 and ATP. • NO (Nitric oxide): binds to haemoglobin in the lungs, then dissociates in peripheral tissues  dilates the arterioles  more O2 gets to tissues. Other things that bind to Haemoglobin (Hb) affect Oxygen Binding Affinity Summary Erythrocytes and Haemoglobin • Erythrocytes make up ~50% of blood volume. • Their biconcave disk shape is optimised for transfer of O2, with no organelles, only a small number of enzymes (glycolysis, antioxidant & carbonic anhydrase) and a large amount of haemoglobin. • Haemoglobin consists of four subunits, each made up of a globin polypeptide (alpha or beta) and a haem that consists of a porphyrin ring and ferrous (Fe2+) iron. • One molecule of oxygen (O2) binds non-covalently to each Fe2+ ion in the haem. • Binding of O2 to one subunit of haemoglobin allosterically increases O2 binding by the other subunits in the molecule. • Binding of CO2, H+ and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and increased temperature allosterically decrease haemoglobin binding affinity for O2, stimulating release of O2 in peripheral tissues, whereas higher pH and lower CO2 concentrations in the lungs increase affinity for O2 and increase haemoglobin binding of O2. • Most CO2 produced by peripheral tissues is converted carbonic acid (H2CO3) and transported as HCO3- in the plasma, while only a small amount is transported bound to haem. • CO is toxic because it binds to haemoglobin more tightly than O2, preventing O2 binding and stabilises the high affinity conformation preventing O2 release.

Hypoxia stimulates erythropoietin secretion. Erythropoietin stimulates erythropoiesis. If kidneys and bone marrow function correctly  erythropoiesis will be hyperstimulated • Hyperstimulation increases reticulocytes circulating in the blood (>1-2%) • This is called a regenerative anaemia • When bone marrow cannot increase reticulocyte synthesis (i.e. when renal function, erythropoiesis or Hb synthesis is decreased) reticulocyte counts are normal or low. • This is called a non-regenerative anaemia reticulocytes How do we Measure Anaemia? Anaemia caused by decreased erythrocyte production Peripheral: kidneys produce insufficient erythropoietin (EPO) (chronic renal disease) Central: the bone marrow cannot produce cells even when erythropoietin (EPO) is high = Non-regenerative: decreased cell replication causes decreased reticulocytes • Lifespan of erythrocytes: 120 days • Lifespan of platelets: 11- 20 days • Lifespan of white cells: 1- 4 days • Blood cells need to be replenished constantly • Cells must reproduce VERY rapidly • Nucleotides (with bases A, C, G & T) are needed • Nutrients are needed to synthesise nucleotides (vitamin B12 and folate) Decreased Red Cell Production Decreased RBC synthesis Kidney failure Fewer RBCs carry less oxygen low oxygen detected Decreased EPO secretion Red bone marrow Peripheral causes of Decreased Red Cell Production • Kidney disease  decreased ability to synthesise and secrete erythropoietin (EPO) • Lack of erythropoietin  decreased erythropoiesis • Decreased erythropoiesis  fewer reticulocytes • Fewer reticulocytes  fewer RBCs • RBCs have normal size (MCV) and normal Hb content (MCH and MCHC). •  Anaemia is normocytic, normochromic and non-regenerative (low reticulocyte %). • Vitamin B12 and folates (folic acid) are essential for DNA synthesis (thymidine triphosphate, T of the A, G, C, T bases of DNA) • Too little folate or B12 too little new DNA  erythrocyte precursor cells cannot divide to form erythroblasts  •VOLUME (SIZE) of the erythrocyte increases  increased MCV = macrocytic •Fewer reticulocytes released  decreased reticulocyte % = non- regenerative •erythrocyte number decreases •cells become oval shaped and red blood cell membrane is fragile  haemolysis  fewer cells and jaundice •More cells need to be made, but B12 and folate deficient  leads to decreased haematocrit and decreased haemoglobin  anaemia So even though there is more haemoglobin per erythrocyte, the decreased number of erythrocytes/litre of blood decreased haemoglobin/dl of blood and decreased haematocrit (= anaemia) Decreased Erythropoiesis due to B12/folate deficiency • Vitamin B12 must be obtained from food (mostly animal-based foods and bacteria) • Vitamin B12 is absorbed bound to protein called Intrinsic Factor which is made by the stomach. • In pernicious anaemia, patients develop ANTIBODIES against Intrinsic Factor  too little Intrinsic Factor in the gastric glands too little absorption of Vitamin B12 • Takes up to 5 years to deplete large stores of vitamin B12. = Non-regenerative macrocytic anaemia Vitamin B12 Deficiency & Pernicious Anaemia • Folate (vitamin B9) in green vegetables, fruits, liver and meats (but destroyed by HEAT). • Folate deficiency can be caused by malabsorption e.g. alcoholism, GIT disease, pregnancy, cancer or chemotherapy = non-regenerative macrocytic anaemia Folate/Folic acid Deficiency Anaemia • Leukaemia cells divide very rapidly and invade bone marrow • Toxins damage bone marrow cells and cause fibrosis • Cell invasion and fibrosis decrease the number of haematopoietic stem cells • Fewer erythroblasts are produced fewer reticulocytes  fewer erythrocytes  normocytic normochromic anaemia • decreased reticulocytes = non-regenerative anaemia • Usually, decreased production of all blood cells: • fewer normal white cells • fewer platelets Decreased Cell Division and Replication due to Leukaemia or Toxins Anaemia Caused by Decreased Haemoglobin Synthesis Iron deficiency Anaemia of chronic disease Genetic: Thalassemia = Non-regenerative Blood Ursula Mariani, Blood Forum Email: Ursula.mariana@wits.ac.za Decreased Haemoglobin Synthesis Haematopoietic stem cells Common myeloid progenitors Unipotent erythroid stem cells Erythroblasts Erythrocytes Enucleation Haemoglobin starts to be made Reticulocytes move into blood vessels = ~1% of red cells Final maturation in blood vessels Iron is required for haemoglobin synthesis Proerythroblasts Reticulocytes RNA • If haemoglobin cannot be made, each erythrocyte will be smaller.

They bind to specific “foreign” molecules, called antigens, and stimulate removal of the antigen by the immune system. • Blood group antigens are modified sugar molecules (α-N – acetylgalactosamine or α-D-galactose) that are attached or NOT to the surfaces of red blood cells (and other cells), depending on the ABO genes that the person inherits. • OR • Blood group antigens are proteins that are present or NOT in the membrane of red blood cells (not other cells) depending on rhesus genes. • Erythrocytes of blood type O have neither A nor B antigens. • Erythrocytes of blood type A have A antigen • Erythrocytes of blood Type B have B antigen • Erythrocytes of blood type AB have both A and B antigens • Presence of antigens is determined genetically.

Anti-Blood Group Antibodies • We make antibodies against antigens NOT PRESENT on our own erythrocytes. • Shortly after birth. • Antibodies are Immunoglobulin M (IgM) – bind ten antigen molecules. IgM A A A A AA AA A Anti-A antibodies B B B B B BB Anti-A antibodies A A A A AA AA A Group A people make antibodies against B antigens = anti-B antibodies Group O people make antibodies against A and B antigens = anti-A and anti-B antibodies B B B B B BB Anti-A antibodies A AA AA A AB B B B BB Group AB people make NO ABO blood group antibodies A AA AA A AB B B B BB NO antibodies • Usually antibodies are made only after exposure to antigen. • But, anti-A and anti-B antibodies are made in the first months of life. • Symbiotic intestinal bacteria have (sugar) molecules similar to A and B antigens. • Bacteria stimulate development of B-lymphocytes that make anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies. • If antigens are present on own cells = self, B-lymphocytes making the matching antibodies are destroyed. • If antigens are NOT present on cells = NON-self, B-lymphocytes making the matching antibodies are retained and antibodies continue to be made. Peculiarity of Anti-ABO Blood Group Antibodies • Group O - both anti-A and anti-B antibodies  attack cells with A and/or B antigens  can receive only Group O. No antigens  not attacked by anti-A or anti-B antibodies  “universal” donor. • Group A - anti-B antibodies  attack cells with B antigens  can receive Group A or Group O. A antigens are attacked by anti- A antibodies  can donate to Group A and AB. • Group B - anti-A antibodies  attack cells with A antigens  can receive Group B or Group O. B antigens  can donate to Group B and AB. • Group AB - no antibodies  Universal transfusion acceptors (can take transfusions of packed red cells from groups A, B, AB and O). A and B antigens  Can only give to group AB. What does this mean for blood transfusions? What does this mean for blood transfusions? • E.g. Group A person transfused with AB blood • Group A person’s anti-B Antibodies will recognize the B antigen on the AB erythrocyte as foreign/non-self. • The Anti-B Antibodies will coat the B antigens of the AB erythrocytes Transfused Group AB erythrocyte Receiver’s Anti-B antibodies Recipient’s Group A erythrocyte What happens in a mismatched transfusion? A A A A AA AA A Group A people make anti-B antibodies A AA A A A AB B B B B B B B BB B • Antibody coating signals the immune system – destroy and remove. • Recipient's antibody recognition of foreign antigen causes a transfusion reaction: 1. Erythrocytes agglutinate (join together) – IgM has 10 binding sites. 2. Destruction of antibody-coated erythrocyte by immune system (lysis by complement system = haemolysis, and phagocytosis) Agglutinated red cells What happens in a mismatched transfusion?What happens in a mismatched transfusion? • Clumping of erythrocytes leads to mini ‘strokes’ (blocked capillaries)  disseminated intra-vascular coagulation • Massive destruction of erythrocytes  massive release of intracellular haemoglobin  renal toxicity  acute renal failure • Antigen-Antibody reaction stimulates cascades of pro-inflammatory messengers  “cytokine storm”  fever •  death or severe damage (stroke, renal failure). • The D antigen is a membrane protein in erythrocytes • People who have the D antigen are Rhesus positive (Rh+) • People who don’t have it are Rh negative (Rh-) • Anti-D antibodies are only produced in Rh- people after exposure to Rh+ blood • 1st exposure  sensitization • 2nd exposure  antibodies bind the Rh+ red blood cells  haemolysis of Rh+ cells Rhesus Blood Group System Why is the Rhesus blood group important? Blood Ursula Mariani, Blood Forum Email: Ursula.mariana@wits.ac.za Mother Rh- and fetus Rh+ Rhesus Blood Group System Mother Rh- and foetus Rh+ • Foeto-placental barrier prevents foetal red blood cells from entering maternal blood • BUT maternal antibodies can enter the foetus. • 1st pregnancy of Rh- mother  maternal immune system does not “see” foetus’s blood before the birth • Birth  maternal blood comes into contact with foetal Rh+ red cells • Mother develops Anti-Rh antibodies • Next pregnancy with Rh+ foetus  mother’s anti-Rh antibodies react will foetal RBCs during pregnancy  haemolysis  erythroblastosis foetalis or haemolytic disease of the newborn •  haemolytic anaemia and severe jaundice in the second (and any subsequent) baby  terminal heart failure or mental damage Rhesus Blood Group System • 2 variants of the Rhesus D gene. • D variant/allele makes a protein that is expressed in the RBC membrane  the D antigen  Rh+. • d variant/allele makes a protein that is NOT expressed  NO antigen  Rh-.

Haemostasis • Definition: prevention of blood loss/stopping blood • If vessel is severed, haemostasis is achieved by 1- vascular spasm 2- formation of platelet plug 3- fibrin clot formation (coagulation) 4- eventual growth of fibrous tissue into the blood clot to permanently close the hole in the vessel and removal of the clot Primary Haemostasis Secondary Haemostasis Clotting must be rapid, but limited & reversible Vascular Spasm • Rupture of vessel  wall of vessel contracts, sticks together • Contraction results from • nervous reflexes initiated by pain • local smooth muscle spasm (main factor) • local humoral factors from traumatized tissues and blood platelets (Thromboxane A2) • Smaller vessels: platelets mainly responsible for vasoconstriction by releasing Thromboxane A2 and forming a “plug” • Spasm lasts several hours  time to form platelet plug and fibrin clot. • Fragments from big megakaryocyte cells in the bone marrow • Also called thrombocytes, but no nucleus • Contain 1. Actin and myosin (molecules for shape change, secretion and platelet contraction) 2. Residual Golgi apparatus which synthesizes enzymes 3. Mitochondria for energy metabolism 4. Enzymes that synthesize prostaglandins (thromboxane A2) 5. Granules containing ADP & serotonin 6. Growth factors for endothelial cell growth Formation of platelet plug - Platelets • Platelet membrane 1. Glycoproteins • Complex I binds to injured endothelium (exposed collagen & injured endothelial cells), but not normal endothelium. • GPIIb/IIIa binds fibrinogen (fibrin clot formation) 2. Phospholipids activate clotting factors 3. Receptors for activator molecules • Dead platelets are removed by macrophages, particularly in the spleen. Formation of platelet plug - Platelets What do platelets do when we bleed? Vessel wall Platelets Collagen Von Willebrand factor Formation of the platelet plug - Activation • Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a long soluble plasma protein that is secreted by endothelial cells of blood vessels. • Vessel injury exposes collagen in interstitial tissue. • von Willebrand factor in the plasma binds to exposed collagen and changes conformation. • Platelets bind to directly to collagen and to collagen-bound von Willebrand factor. • Binding to collagen and von Willebrand factor activates the platelets. • Platelets are also activated by: • thromboxane A2 • ADP • serotonin • thrombin • Where do these activators come from? Vessel wall Platelets TxA2, ADP, serotonin Vessel wall Platelets Collagen Von Willebrand factor Formation of the platelet plug - Activation fibrin Platelet – not activated Activated platelet Activated platelets: • change shape – many filopodia (sticky spikes) • “catch” other platelets to form a loose “plug”. • produce and secrete thromboxane A2, which activates more platelets. • release ADP and serotonin, which activate more platelets. • change the conformation of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, enabling it to bind fibrinogen, which joins platelets together. • display membrane phospholipid (phosphatidylserine), which activates clotting factors IX and X. Formation of the platelet plug - Activation fibrin On the surface of activated platelets: • Factor X (bound to phospholipid and factor V) converts prothrombin to thrombin, which • activates more platelets • converts fibrinogen to fibrin, a mesh that traps cells, including RBCs. Platelet activation and aggregation is a chain reaction (positive feedback). How do we stop it? • Platelets become tightly bound to each other through fibrin and von Willebrand factor and then contract to form a tight/firm plug = clot. Platelet-limiting factors and anti-platelet pharmaceuticals • Smooth surface and glycocalix layer of healthy endothelial cells prevent platelet binding • Undamaged endothelial cells secrete prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO). • Both inhibit platelet activation and aggregation  the clot does not extend beyond the injured zone. • Both stimulate vasodilation  counteracts vasospasm, increases blood flow. • ASPIRIN inhibits synthesis of thromboxane A2  decreased platelet activation • Clopidogrel (Plavix®) blocks ADP binding to platelets  decreased platelet activation Formation of platelet plug - Pathophysiology Multiple injuries of micro-vessels Platelets plug small breaks  sufficient to stop blood loss. • Lack of platelets  micro-injuries are not plugged micro-bleeds are visible as red spots (purpura) in the skin. • Lack of Von Willebrand factor  bleeding gums and nosebleeds Platelets form a loose “wall” (only bricks), sufficient for small breaks. For bigger breaks, fibrin is needed to “cement” the bricks. Physiological (cell-based) Coagulation How do we make the fibrin part of the clot? Pathophysiology of Blood Disorders, 2nd Ed, H.F.

When the fibrinogen protein is cut by thrombin (FIIa) it becomes insoluble and forms fibres, called fibrin, which is the clot. Blood coagulation – the clotting factors • Five clotting factors VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIa and XIIIa require Ca2+ as a cofactor. (Blocking Ca2+ prevents coagulation in blood collection tubes.) • Two protease clotting factors, IXa and Xa require platelet phospholipid for full activity. • Three protease clotting factors VIIa, Xa and IXa require clotting “co-factor” proteins. • The cofactor proteins are, respectively, tissue factor (TF, FIII  TF/FVIIa), FVa (FVa/FXa) and FVIIIa (FVIIIa/FIXa). Blood coagulation – the clotting factorsCoagulation pathways • Clotting proteins are inactive in plasma to avoid spontaneous clots and tissue factor is absent. • Vessel trauma  exposure of tissue factor and sequential activation of the pro-coagulation factors  coagulation pathways  fibrinogen becomes fibrin • 3 different coagulation pathways form fibrin, 1 physiological, 2 “biochemical”. • Cell-based coagulation pathway occurs in healthy, living people. • Extrinsic coagulation pathway: started by addition of tissue factor from outside the blood vessel, measured by prothrombin time (PT). • Intrinsic coagulation pathway: requires only factors normally present inside the blood vessel, started by addition of negative charge, measured by partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

Priming/amplification (on the surface of the platelet) • Thrombin cuts and activates FV, FVIII and FXI at the platelet surface, which provides the phospholipid “cofactor”. • Thrombin also helps activate the platelets (see platelets slides). • The activated platelet and its attached clotting factors are now ready to make lots of fibrin. Propagation (on the surface of the platelet) • FIXa (from “initiation”) binds to the platelet via FVIIIa and the FVIIIa-bound FIXa complex cuts many FX to form many more FXa. • FXIa also cuts FIX to make more FIXa, each of which can make many more FXa. • FXa combines with FVa on the platelet. • Each platelet-attached FVa/FXa complex cuts lots of prothrombin to produce lots more thrombin (FIIa). • The large amount of thrombin can convert lots of soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin to form a large (but relatively unstable) clot in between the platelets of the platelet plug. • Thrombin also cuts factor XIII and FXIIIa covalently joins the fibrin molecules to form a stable mesh that can “catch” blood cells and further grow the clot. • Thrombin continues to increase amounts of FVa, FVIIIa and FXIa, leading to more FXa, more thrombin and more fibrin clot. • Thus a very small signal can induce a very big and fast response.https://ahdc.vet.cornell.edu/sects/coag/test/Ddimer.cfm Fibrin Formation and Crosslinking Covalent bond between D peptides of different fibrin molecules https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=- ulGunQMGpQ&list=PLkv9qVBSWseFg4CZy7jtl5 pBoqReWmoXA&index=67 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr1Pgb3r _cU&list=PLkv9qVBSWseFg4CZy7jtl5pBoqReW moXA&index=68 Blood Ursula Mariani, Blood Forum Email: Ursula.mariana@wits.ac.za Once the clot is formed: Platelets in the clot contract (actin & myosin)  pulls the edges of the ruptured vessel closer together.  fluid is squeezed out of the clot = serum (plasma minus fibrinogen and clotting factors trapped in the clot) Platelets secrete growth factors  Fibroblast cells grow around and into the clot  Scar tissue forms (1-2 weeks)  Fibroblasts become endothelial cells  Clot is removed (fibrinolysis) Clot Retraction and Fibroblast Invasion https://ahdc.vet.cornell.edu/sects/coag/test/Ddimer.cfm plasminogen plasmin Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) FibrinolysisFibrinolysis and Dissolution of the Clot • Plasminogen is a plasma zymogen (inactive proteolytic enzyme), produced by the liver. • Plasminogen binds to fibrin during clot formation. • Damaged endothelial cells slowly secrete another protease, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). • When tPA binds to fibrin it becomes activated. • Activated tPA cuts plasminogen to give the active enzyme plasmin. • Plasmin cuts fibrin into many pieces that are released into blood. • This removes the clot and opens the vessel so that blood can flow again. • D-dimers are fibrin fragments containing the cross-links between 2 different fibrin monomers. • Increased concentrations of D-dimers in the blood show that a clot is being broken down. • As the fibrin dissolves, macrophages (and other WBCs) phagocytose the clot debris, including RBCs  bilirubin ……yellow bruises… Vessel injury  blood oozes out of the vessel.
