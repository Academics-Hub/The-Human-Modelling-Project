It is a compound tubulo-alveolar gland consisting of both serous and mucous secretory end- pieces. The majority of the secretory end-pieces of this gland however are serous in nature. THE SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND Connective Tissue Septum - Divides the gland into lobes Interlobular Duct Connective Tissue Capsule Interlobular Duct Blood Vessel Adipose Tissue Intralobular Ducts THE SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND Connective Tissue Septum Interlobular Duct Blood Vessel Striated Ducts (Intralobular Ducts) Mucous Secretory End-pieces Serous Secretory End-pieces THE SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND Interlobular Duct Blood Vessel Mucous Secretory End-pieces - Each end-piece consists of several tubular shaped mucous secretory cells - These cells have a flattened basally placed nucleus Serous Secretory End-pieces - Each end-piece consists of several pyramidal shaped serous secretory cells - These cells have a spherical basally placed nucleus Serous Demilunes Zymogen Granules - Found in apical cytoplasm of serous secretory sells Myoepithelial Cell THE SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND Striated Ducts Intercalated Duct Connective Tissue Septum Adipose Tissue Striated Duct Striated Duct Intercalated Duct Serous Secretory End- pieces THE LIVER • Slide 23 Stain: H&E Note: This section is a small part of a lobe of the liver. THE LIVER Connective Tissue Capsule Portal Tract Containing the Containing the Portal Triad Liver Parenchyma - Cords of hepatocytes separated by sinusoids THE LIVER Connective Tissue Capsule Portal Tract Containing the Portal Triad Central Vein Classic Liver Lobule - Roughly hexagonal in shape with a central vein at its midpoint. - The “white space” between the cords of cells are the sinusoids - The sinusoids drain into the central vein - The Portal tracts are located at the edges of hexagon Sinusoid Hepatocytes Branch of Hepatic Artery Branch of Portal Vein Branch of Bile Duct Portal Triad THE LIVER Central Vein Sinusoid - Lined by Endothelium and Kupffer Cells Hepatocytes Binucleated Hepatocytes Kupffer Cells Endothelium Endothelium Haemosiderin (brownish-yellow particles) Bile Canaliculi THE LIVER – PORTAL TRIAD Branch of Hepatic Artery - Lined by Endothelium Branch of Portal Vein - Lined by Endothelium Branch of Bile Duct - Lined by Simple Cuboidal Epithelium Branch of Hepatic Artery Connective Tissue Branch of Portal Vein THE PANCREAS • Slide 17 Stain: H&E Note: Only the exocrine component of the pancreas will be studied in this section. The endocrine component will be examined later when you study the Endocrine System.
