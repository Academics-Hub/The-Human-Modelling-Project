Devices such as pacemakers and implantable deﬁbrillators have used electrodes fabricated from Pt and alloys of Pt and iridium for several decades with minimal adverse effects [4]. Similarly, the cochlear implant, which is one of the most successful and widely used neural prostheses to date, has used a confor- mal electrode array with exposed Pt contacts for almost 30 years [1]. Despite this history of success, the next stage of development in neural interfacing electrodes needs to address issues such as increas- ing impedance observed over longer-term implan- tation and the resulting need for higher energies to elicit equivalent neural responses. For devices under development, such as the implantable bionic eye, the need for signiﬁcantly more electrodes arranged in a high-density array to achieve effec- tive restoration of function places stringent design requirements on both the electrode material and the fabrication method. Proposals for alternate electrode materials or coatings tend to focus on improving the interface between the electrode and neural tissue, and sup- porting the design and fabrication of denser, more complex electrode conﬁgurations. Conducting polymers (CPs) have been proposed as an alternative or an adjunct to metal electrodes for a range of biomedical applications from bio sensors to cochlear implants [5–7]. Their unique physical and mechanical properties offer closer matching with that of neural tissue compared with metal electrodes. Added to this, the chemical and electri- cal properties of CPs are associated with excellent biological performance [6,8,9]. However, there are still many challenges to overcome before these materials can be approved in commercial medical devices. Although electrical properties have been optimized in CPs during the period since their discovery, the trade-off between electrical and mechanical properties and their ultimate perfor- mance in a biological environment remains a key barrier to their application in biomedical implants. Conducting polymer components & fabrication Conducting polymers can pass electronic charge owing to their molecular structure, in which the polymerized backbone is comprised of alternat- ing single and double bonds. This bond arrange- ment produces a low-energy state and introduces a conduction band [10]. The polymer can be transformed into a conductor by oxidative dop- ing, where an electron is removed from the weaker ‘p’ system of the double bond, producing a free radical and a spinless positive charge known as a polaron. Upon further oxidation, the free radical Laura Poole-Warren †, Nigel Lovell, Sungchul Baek and Rylie Green †Author for correspondence Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia Tel.: +61 293 853 905 Fax: +61 296 632 108 l.poolewarren@unsw.edu.au Bioelectrodes for neural recording and neurostimulation are an integral component of a number of neuroprosthetic devices, including the commercially available cochlear implant, and developmental devices, such as the bionic eye and brain–machine interfaces. Current electrode designs limit the application of such devices owing to suboptimal material properties that lead to minimal interaction with the target neural tissue and the formation of ﬁbrotic capsules. In designing an ideal bioelectrode, a number of design criteria must be considered with respect to physical, mechanical, electrical and biological properties. Conducting polymers have the potential to address the synergistic interaction of these properties and show promise as superior coatings for next-generation electrodes in implant devices.

Devices 7(1), (2010)36 Review Poole-Warren, Lovell, Baek & Green of the polaron is removed, creating a new spinless defect called a bipolaron. Eventually, with continued doping, continuous bipo- laron bands can be formed along the CP backbone. On application of a potential across the CP, the main mechanism of conduction is the movement of charge carriers between localized sites or between bipolaron states (shown in FIGURE 1). Ion movements in or out of the ﬁlm are dependent on dopant charge and motility. Although bipolarons are known to be the main source of charge carriers, the precise mechanism of charge transport through CPs is not fully understood [10]. It is important to consider that most CPs are highly disordered and that charge transport can occur not only along the polymer chains but also between chains and complex boundaries established by the presence of multiple phases. While no CP has been approved for use in implantable medi- cal devices, CP-mediated biosensors have been utilized in ex vivo diagnostics, and a number of CP-coated bioelectrodes have been investigated. In general, CPs are used as coatings rather than stand-alone electrodes, and the fabrication approach used typically aims to produce micrometer-thickness ﬁlms on metal electrodes. Polymerization of CPs can be mediated via either chemical or electrochemical methods [11]. Chemical polymerization proceeds via many different routes, such as addition reactions stimulated by radicals, cations or anions; or condensation reactions [12]. These CPs can be tailored to include a great variety of modiﬁcations, but the processing time is signiﬁ- cantly longer than electrochemical polymerization and entails the use of strong oxidants, such as ferric chloride. Additionally, the resulting ﬁlms often have diminished electrical properties in com- parison with electrically deposited ﬁlms and, thus, may require post- fabrication doping to increase conductivity [11]. As such, chemical polymerization techniques have found limited application in the modiﬁcation of neural electrodes. Electropolymerization can be performed on the electrode intended for coating, and consequently, no further processing is required, making it a superior technique for neuroprosthetic appli- cations [11]. Typical fabrication of CPs for neural implants involves oxidative electrochemical polymerization of CP monomers in an aqueous electrolyte solution consisting of the dopant anions in an appropriate solvent. Electrodeposition is usually carried out in a three-electrode (i.e., working, counter and reference electrodes) system. Upon oxidation, CP monomers form radical cations that simultaneously bind anionic dopants and polymerize to form homo- geneous CP ﬁlms on the working (anode) electrode. The efﬁcacy of a CP-coated bioelectrode is highly dependent on the two main constituents of the CP backbone, the monomer and dopant. Monomers based on heterocyclic aromatics, such as 3,4-ethyl- enedioxythiophene (EDOT) and pyrrole, have been widely used for a range of biomedical applications owing to their environmental stability (thermal and oxidative), electrochemical stability, bio- compatibility, conductivity (10–200 S/cm) and ease of synthe- sis. Polypyrrole (PPy) is the most common CP utilized in neural probe applications owing to the aqueous solubility of the pyrrole monomer; however, PPy has shown limited electrical response after repeated redox cycles because of the formation of structural defects along its backbone [6]. Hence, PPy may not be suitable for chronic neural probe applications. Recently, polymer variants of poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) have been increasingly investi- gated for their superior electrochemical conductivity and stability, and ability to be tailored for altered function ality [6,13–16]. One limitation of PEDOT is the poor water solubility of the EDOT monomer, which researchers have overcome by employing a two- part acetonitirile and water solvent. However, for biomedical applications, a purely aqueous system is desirable for both bio- compatibility and the incorporation of biological signaling factors to mediate cell responses. As such, water-soluble EDOT deriva- tives, such as hydroxymethylated-3,4-ethylenedioxylthiophene (EDOT-MeOH), have been developed [14–16]. Common dopants for biomedical CPs are sodium salts of aro- matic sulfonates, such as paratoluene sulfonate (pTS) and poly- styrene sulfonate (PSS). These large amphiphilic dopants have been shown to produce CPs with high conductivity, chemical stability, desirable mechanical properties and thermal compat- ibility in a wide range of applications [17–21]. When incorporated in an electrochemical deposition, aromatic sulfonates are water soluble but hydrophobic enough to orient the CP chain parallel to the electrode [18]. Consequently, the resulting CP has well-ordered structure with high conductivity and desirable environmental sta- bility [6,18]. In addition, several sulfonate-doped ﬁlms have been shown to be biocompatible both in vivo and in vitro [8,22,23]. Alternative dopants & biological additives In neural prostheses, CPs can be biofunctionalized to control the neural cell response in the initial period following implantation. PEDOT and PPy ﬁlms doped with conventional sodium sulfo- nates are biocompatible but lack the biofunctionality to achieve cell interaction and adhesion. The provision of controlled release of growth factors has been shown to increase the cell numbers interfaced with the electrodes. Bioactive polymeric anions, including laminin pep- tides [16,24–28], hyaluronic acid [29,30], silk ﬁbronectin [27], hep- arin [30–34], ATP [35–38], polymeric amino acids [39], phosphate- buffered saline [39,40], collagen [40] and other biomolecules [21,41,42], have been used to dope CPs. These dopants provide biological cues and have been shown to be compatible with a variety of CPs, as summarized in TABLE 1. To maintain the integrity of biomolecules, CPs for neural implants are fabricated under biofriendly conditions with neutral-pH aqueous electrolytes at low oxidation potentials. As an alternative to doping, biological entities have been incorpo- rated into CPs through entrapment, physical adsorption and cova- lent bonding. Entrapment is a simple and reproducible technique that occurs in parallel with CP doping. In addition to the doping anions present in conventional electrolytes, biological inclusions, which are usually large, weakly charged polymeric molecules, are added to the monomer solution. The biomolecules are introduced into the polymer during polymerization and immobilized within the CP matrix. Neurotrophins and anti-inﬂammatory drugs have been incorporated by this process, including NGF [7,25,40,42], neu- rotrophin-3 (NT-3) [8,43,44] and dexamethasone [45]. These active molecules have been combined with a variety of dopants and poly- mer systems, as summarized in TABLE 2. Drug release can occur either www.expert-reviews.com 37 ReviewDevelopment of bioactive conducting polymers for neural interfaces passively by diffusion or actively by utilizing the oxidation–reduc- tion properties of the CP. Passive diffusion can be an effective way of providing drugs to a biological system. The chemical structure of the constituent components of the CP will be the dominant factor in determining the rate of release. A more controlled mecha- nism involves the application of an electrical stimulus to produce an electrical potential, where dopant anions become mobile and entrapped biomolecules are then carried out of the polymer matrix with the dopant ion ﬂux [43]. The physical adsorption process involves surface immobiliza- tion of biomolecules by weak electrostatic interaction between the cationic polymer matrix and the anionic biomolecules in the CP–biomolecule solution interface. Although the process is very straightforward, this technique offers minimal control over the concentration and stability of the adsorbed molecule. Biomolecules can also be covalently attached to CPs through functional links. While covalent attachment is not as simple as the other immobilization techniques, the signiﬁcantly stronger bond provides better control over the stability and the localization of the biomolecules on the polymer surface. However, covalent attachment tends to increase the steric effect of the CP backbone and reduces the electrical conductivity of the conjugated poly- mer. Nonetheless, a number of biomolecules listed in TABLE 3 have been covalently attached to CPs, including NGF bound to PPy through polyallylamine-azido linker [46], through N-hydroxyl succinimidyl ester linker, and polylysine and laminin bound to poly-l-glutamic acid [39]. The method of polymer modiﬁcation inﬂuences the amount of biomolecule required during fabrication to ensure biofunctional- ity. Generally, a higher concentration of a molecule needs to be incorporated within CPs to provide similar bioactivity to that achieved by molecules supplied directly to the biological environ- ment. Irreversible oxidation during electrochemical polymeriza- tion or post-process chemical modiﬁcation has been shown to degrade the biomolecules in the electrolyte solution and limited the efﬁciency of electrodeposition, and this may degrade the mechanical and electrical performance of the polymer. Application of conducting polymers to medical devices Conducting polymers can potentially meet the complex and syn- ergistic design criteria to produce an optimal electrode surface for neuroprosthetic medical devices. Neuroprostheses aim to artiﬁ- cially replace a damaged or lost biological functionality. They fall into two broad categories: stimulating devices that evoke neural responses in biological tissue; and recording electrodes that trans- duce signals from the neural system for use in either controlling external devices or in mapping the electrophysiological state of excitable tissue. Typical stimulating devices include the cochlear implant and bionic eye, whereas recording electrodes are used most commonly in brain–machine interfacing (BMI) and neuromus- cular control of external prosthetic devices. These devices require connection with excitable tissue via bioelectrodes, through which stimulation and recording of bioelectric activity is performed. Bioelectric activity arises from the intrinsic properties of the cell membranes of excitable cells forming the functional organ systems of the body. Examples of such excitable cells include the neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems, cardiomyocytes form- ing the muscle and the specialized conduction systems of the heart, Figure 1.

Despite their vastly different roles and functions within the body, excitable cells share the common characteristic of being able to be excited. They are all able to receive and respond to appropriate stimuli, be it electrical, mechanical or chemical in nature. In the most general terms, a biopotential electrode is a transducer, which, in the case of neural recording, converts ionic currents (carried by ions in solution) in physiological media (tissues and organs of the body) into electronic currents (carried by electrons) in metallic conductors, suitable for detection, ampliﬁcation and ana lysis by an instrument. In the case of neurostimulation, the transduction process is reversed and an electrical current is converted into an ionic current that depolarizes the cells surrounding the electrode. The electrode material interactions with the surrounding biologi- cal environment during the initial period following device implan- tation are critical in determining the quality of communication formed between the target cells and the bioelectrodes [11,47–49]. As such, bioelectrodes are fundamental to the long-term performance of neuroprosthetic devices, and surface modiﬁcations, such as bio- active CPs, are an important area of research for both developmental devices and next-generation commercial devices [11,50]. Cochlear implant The cochlear implant is a commercially available implant that has, for several decades, restored hearing percepts to patients suffering from sensorineural deafness, which occurs through loss of or dam- age to the cochlea hair cells [11,50]. The stimulating portion of the implant is a ﬂexible electrode array that is placed within the cochlear structure. The application of electrical waveforms stimulates the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), effectively bypassing the dam- aged or lost hair cells [11]. In this device, Pt electrodes provide an effective neural-stimulation platform. However, next-generation devices are being developed to address current limitations in patient sound perception. Current cochlear implant research aims to provide a wider range of perceived frequencies to improve speech recognition in a noisy environment, music appreciation and binaural tasks, such as sound- source localization [51–53]. A key barrier to achieving this aim is the need to produce higher densities of microelectrodes, allowing smaller numbers of cells to be stimulated at different locations along the cochlear, producing a wider range of sound percepts. Conventional cochlear implant-fabrication techniques produce Pt electrodes with a relatively smooth surface, which limits the maximal charge that can be supplied to neural cells as the size of the electrodes is reduced. Surface modiﬁcation, such as laser roughening of the electrodes, has been shown to both improve the permissible stimulation para- meters and also beneﬁt cell integration [49]. However, the stimulation parameters delivered via Pt electrodes are predominantly restricted by the safe charge-injection limit of 100–250 µC/cm 2, above which electrode dissolution and evolution of toxic ions can occur [54]. As such, Pt may not be an optimal material for producing high-density microelectrode arrays in the cochlear implant. CPs provide an alter- native electrode coating, as they have a greatly increased charge- transfer surface area per geometric area compared with Pt. PEDOT has been reported to increase the available charge density by up to two orders of magnitude, to 198 mC/cm 2 [24]. Studies have shown that stimulation rate and electrode place- ment can inﬂuence the threshold, the maximum acceptable loud- ness level, and dynamic range for electrical stimulation in cochlear implant users [52,53]. Perimodiolar placement of new-generation cochlear implants position the stimulating electrodes within close proximity to the SGNs. These cochlear implants have been shown to signiﬁcantly improve patient outcomes owing to the minimized distance between electrodes and target cells [49,51–53]. Several groups have hypothesized that control of surface properties coupled with the supply of trophic factors can create an intimate connection between electrodes and SGNs at the neural interface [8,43,49]. Additionally, it has been shown that supply of appropriate biomolecules can protect SGNs from further degeneration, which is often seen in patients with sensorineural deafness [8,43]. CPs are a potential carrier for trophic factors and have been identiﬁed as having surface character- istics optimal for neural cell attachment [8,24,43,55]. Electrode designs that support improved communication with the target SGNs will directly affect the permissible stimulation parameters and chronic performance of cochlear implants. Richardson et al. have shown that coating cochlear electrodes with PPy loaded with neurotrophin, NT-3, can lower the interfacial impedance and improve SGN survival during the initial period Table 2.

Chronic studies have not shown an ongoing improvement in performance when compared with stan- dard Pt electrodes. However, these studies used only conventional cochlear stimulation parameters, and the increased capacity for charge delivery expected for CP electrodes has not been explored. Bionic eye The bionic eye is a developmental neurostim- ulation device that is intended to provide a perception of sight to blind patients. There are a number of approaches used to achieve sight percepts through electrical stimulation at different locations within the mammalian visual system. The most popular approach is stimulation of the neural retina, which requires less signal pro- cessing than the alternate approaches, which include stimulation of the optic nerve, optic chiasm and vision cortex [56–58]. Stimulation of the retina, via retinal prostheses, is only achievable for patients with a functional neural path between the retina and vision cortex. This encompasses people with degenerative retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. A critical issue in designing a commercial retinal-stimulation device is the construction of the high-density electrode array to interface with the retinal tissue [11]. Such arrays must be ﬁxated in close proximity to the neural retina. They are typically placed either epiretinally [56], subretinally or in the suprachoroidal space [59]. Despite varying retinal locations, these prostheses are designed to primarily stimulate the retinal ganglion cells, which comprise the innermost cell layer of the retina. While signiﬁcant research has investigated the functional efﬁcacy of retinal ganglion cells in blind patients, it is generally thought that a higher density electrode array will increase the resolution of perceived vision [11,56]. It should be noted that high-density fabrication alone will not be a sufﬁcient criteria to increase visual acuity. Many other factors, including the spread of current from the stimulating electrode site, the proximity of the retinal ganglion cells to any particular electrode, and the stim- ulation paradigm itself, will inﬂuence the psychophysical percep- tion of artiﬁcial vision (FIGURE 2). In order to construct high-density electrode arrays with thousands of electrodes, new technological approaches are required [11]. Laser roughening, iridium oxide alloys and Pt black (Pt powder produced on the surface by electroplating) have all been researched as surface modiﬁcations [60,61]; however, CP coatings offer an alternative to produce microelectrodes with higher charge-storage densities [61]. Additionally, CPs may be more effective in maintaining the degenerative neural tissue of bionic eye recipients, as CPs can be polymerized in the presence of biological signaling factors, which are released following implantation and promote neural cell survival and growth [7,25,43]. Brain–machine interfaces High-resolution recording is key to the development of an effective BMI [62]. While neuroprostheses often have both stimulating and recording functionality, BMIs are predominantly neural recording devices. In most BMI applications, physiological neural processes are used to control external devices. One such device operates through recording directly from the cortex to provide commu- nications for locked-in or paralyzed patients to interact with the surrounding environment. BMIs can also be connected to the peripheral nervous system [62]. Current-generation neuroprosthetic limb designs are not BMIs, recording from skeletal muscle trans- cutaneously to produce movement of a robotically driven limb, but next-generation BMI designs will connect directly to neural tissue to provide improved control [62]. Regardless of application, when applying the biosignal process- ing techniques to neural records in order to extract features, a criti- cal consideration is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Introduction of noise most commonly occurs owing to poor interfacing between the recording electrode and neural tissue, but other factors, includ- ing recording from multiple neurons or bundles, external noise sources and electrode micromotion, reduce the accuracy of signal acquisition and interpretation [63,64]. Traditionally, microwires of Pt, gold, tungsten or stainless steel have been used in BMI-recording applications. The microwire design is simply an insulated wire with an exposed tip for con- tacting tissue. Although still commonly used in neuroprosthetic research, the microwire is severely limited in application owing to the difﬁculty of placement and the single contact point available per wire. Extensive research over the last decade has produced next- generation electrode arrays that allow for much greater control over electrode size, shape, texture and spacing [64]. Microelectrode arrays, such as the Utah Electrode Array and Michigan Tetrode, have been designed to minimize noise when recording intracorti- cally. Both the Utah and Michigan designs are micromachined from silicon to produce relatively stiff electrodes that can be accu- rately inserted into the cortex. The contacting electrodes are plated with either gold or Pt for improved biocompatibility and safety. However, as with the microwire design, inﬂexible implants in soft cortical tissue are not optimal. Although placement of the array is more accurate, the inﬂammation response following implanta- tion is exacerbated by the strain mismatch between the metallic constructs and neural tissue [65]. Conducting polymers have been applied to the electrode con- tacts of the Michigan array, and it has been demonstrated that this softer interface improves the SNR of acute neural recordings from Table 3.

Two studies have examined the chronic performance of PEDOT-coated Michigan arrays implanted in rat cortex for 6 weeks [55,66]. In both studies, the SNR was sig- niﬁcantly improved compared with the bare-electrode control in the initial period following implantation. Critical design criteria of neural electrodes In the most general terms, a bioelectrode is a transducer, convert- ing ionic currents (carried in physiological ﬂuids) into electronic currents (carried in metallic conductors and device electronics). As discussed earlier, application-speciﬁc research has guided the development of implant electrodes. This research has deﬁned a number of properties that are integral to the chronic performance of electrodes in neuroprosthetic devices and can be broadly cat- egorized as physical, mechanical and electrical, as shown in BOX 1. These properties interact substantially and synergistically to determine the biological performance of an electrode when placed in a physiological environment. The criteria for producing optimal neural electrodes are the same for both stimulating and recording devices. Both applica- tions require low impedance and close coupling between the neural tissue and the electrode surface, although for different reasons. In a stimulating device, these characteristics assist in reducing the overall power consumption of the device, as well as reducing the risk of exceeding the power supply compliance voltage. In recording devices, these characteristics improve the SNR, thereby allowing more accurate signals to be elicited from the data. The ideal design criteria for long-term, implantable electrodes were summarized in a review by Merrill et al. as requiring the following [67]: • Appropriate biological performance of the passive material when under nonstimulated conditions; • Acceptable mechanical properties, including maintaining these properties during storage and surgery and following implantation; • Satisfactory efﬁcacy allowing the required injection of charge and achievement of the appropriate stimulation outcomes; • Absence of signiﬁcant Faradaic reactions during active use so that minimal toxicity is elicited; • Low corrosion rate; • Stable electrical properties, including impedance, and stable conducting and insulating properties. Impact of physical properties The key failure mode of many chronic neural implants has been linked to the foreign body response [63]. Physical properties of bioelectrodes are integral to their initial biological interactions, and surface topography strongly inﬂuences the type of cell growth observed over the ensuing period. An optimal neural electrode will resist ﬁbrosis while providing a conducive surface for neural cell attachment [50,63,64,68]. It is thought that optimal interactions can be achieved through tailoring the surface properties of an electrode construct [63,64]. Patterning or roughening of neural electrodes has been dem- onstrated by a number of groups, and electrode surfaces modi- ﬁed by laser roughening, Pt black electroplating, iridium oxide coating and CP ﬁlms have exhibited properties that encourage neural cell attachment [9,69]. The increase in roughness created by modifying the surface morphology is depicted in FIGURE 3 for both laser roughening and two CP variants, PPy and PEDOT. Additionally, microfabrication of neural probes to create sub- cellular structures at the electrode interface, reported by Seymour and Kipke, has been shown to signiﬁcantly reduce ﬁbrotic encap- sulation [63]. However, studies by Szarowski et al. demonstrate that while these properties can control the initial wound heal- ing response, the chronic formation of glial scarring is not pre- vented [65]. Szarowski et al. suggest that strategies to improve the chronic cellular response purely through physical modiﬁcations to electrode constructs may be ineffective, and they support the current surge in research towards controlling immune reactions and neural cell ingrowth through supply of biological factors [65]. Mechanical design criteria Conventional metallic electrodes such as Pt and gold are rela- tively unreactive in a biological environment and, hence, are considered mechanically stable [64]. While these neural electrodes are physically robust, the biological response to their presence must be appropriate. Stiff, sharp features cause damage to the neural tissue; with a known ‘kill zone’ of up to 100 µm occur-µm occur-m occur- ring on insertion of inﬂexible arrays, such as the Utah Electrode Array and Michigan designs [64,70]. The ensuing inﬂammatory reaction produces ﬁbrotic encapsulation which, in the long-term, reduces implant efﬁcacy [64]. While ﬂexible, rounded electrode 2 mm Figure 2. Laser micromachined, high-density, ﬂexible 98-electrode array for application in a bionic eye implant. www.expert-reviews.com 41 ReviewDevelopment of bioactive conducting polymers for neural interfaces constructs are difﬁcult to place within neural tissue, the more pliable interface is likely to improve chronic performance of the implant [70,71]. Neural tissue is considerably softer than metal, and the result- ing strain mismatch at the neural interface damages tissue during micromotion [65,70]. Rigid metallic electrodes, such as the Utah Electrode Array device, have an elastic modulus of approximately 10 11 Pa [72]. While next-generation ﬂexible electrode arrays have a signiﬁcantly lower stiffness of approximately 10 9 Pa [70], an optimal implant electrode will have an elastic modulus close to that of neural tissue (~10 5 Pa) [72,73]. An intermediate layer or surface modiﬁcation is required to dampen the effect of mechanical differences between the electrode and neural tissue. Ideally, such an interface would also provide biological cues for minimizing the inﬂammatory response and consequent ﬁbrosis following implantation. Coatings or surface modiﬁcations must also be durable. A con- ventional smooth metallic surface is unlikely to be corroded in normal physiological ﬂuid when operated within safe electrical- stimulation parameters [71]. However, coatings such as Pt black and CPs are liable to be susceptible to degradation. Cogan reported on the use of a variant of Pt black called Pt gray – a moderately porous variant of the former, which has the advantage of improved abrasion resis tance [74]. Pt black, Pt gray and CPs are adhered to the metallic electrode via electrically mediated processes [60,75]. As such, the durability of the ﬁlm adhesion to the electrode will be an important consideration in designing a mechanically stable electrode. Additionally, the particles of these coatings must be cohe- sive and nondegradable. Micromotion of implant electrodes is well described in the literature [64,70]; accordingly, surface modiﬁcations must be able to withstand these shear forces. Any particles of the electrode that are displaced must be tolerated by the surrounding biological environment. Electrical design criteria Neural prostheses are broadly categorized into stimulating and recording implants but, realistically, most devices will perform both of these functionalities. Stimulating implants aim to replace a neural function by artiﬁcially evoking a neuronal response with an electrical stimulus, but it is important that recordings also be obtained to provide feedback on the health of the tissue at the neural interface [11,56]. A number of electrical properties need to be considered when designing a neural electrode, including imped- ance, long-term electrical stability and reversibility of reactions occurring at the neural interface (or recovery of Faradaic reactions). Neural electrodes ideally have low impedance so that stimuli can be reliably delivered to the tissue at the required frequency. Current attempts to increase the number of stimulating electrodes in cochlear implants have been limited by the stimulation parameters that can be safely used with smaller electrodes [50]. It is proposed that higher densities of microelectrodes, with improved impedance characteristics, will allow for more complex stimulation paradigms to be delivered to neural tissue. For the cochlear implant, this trans- lates to superior perception of sounds, such as music and speech in a noisy environment [50,53]. It is well documented that impedance is reduced by increasing the available charge transfer area at the electrode surface, but to retain spatial selectivity (or resolution), modiﬁcations must increase the surface area while maintaining the geometric size [49,60]. As such, a number of modiﬁcations, including CP coatings, have been investigated for reducing electrode imped- ance. Speciﬁcally, CPs have highly textured surface characteristics, as shown in FIGURE 3, which results in impedance magnitudes of up to two orders of magnitude lower than that of unmodiﬁed metallic electrodes. A sample of the surface modiﬁcations used to reduce electrode impedance is shown in TABLE 4 for both the conventional electrode materials and for some of the available coating variants. Tissue conducts electron charge by ionic transport, whereas devices conduct charge with electrons and holes and, hence, charge transport at a neural interface is typically a conversion of electronic charge to ionic charge (or the reverse, according to application) [72]. For conventional Pt electrodes, this results in a bilayer capacitance, which must be charged before being passed into the physiological medium. CPs are particularly attractive as a surface modiﬁcation because they are able to facilitate charge transport both electroni- cally and ionically [72]. At oxidation and reduction potentials deter- mined by the CP chemistry, changes in the CP conformation pro- mote ionic ﬂux. Mobile dopant species and small ions present in the extracellular ﬂuid are forced either into or out of the CP, and can be used to mediate the transfer of charge from the underlying metallic electrode to the surrounding tissues. However, if mobile dopant species diffuse away from the CP electrode, then deterioration of the CP electrochemistry will occur. An important consideration in choosing a mobile dopant species is their potential toxicity to surrounding biological environment if released during stimulation. The choice of dopant species is further detailed with respect to electrical stability and biocompatibility in the following section ‘Key hurdles to application of CPs in medical devices’. The electrical function of a neural electrode must not adversely affect performance relating to the other variables. For example, pass- ing a speciﬁc current waveform through a metal electrode to stimu- late tissue should not result in excessive dissolution of metal ions, nor should it cause nonreversible Faradaic reactions at the electrode, both of which can result in tissue damage. In a conventional Pt electrode, nonreversible reactions that may alter the local biological Box 1. Design criteria for neural electrodes: material properties.

Med. Devices 7(1), (2010)42 Review Poole-Warren, Lovell, Baek & Green environment include hydrolysis of the extracellular ﬂuid, which produces oxygen gas, and the interaction of chloride ions with the metal electrode, which causes electrode dissolution and the evolution of toxic chlorides of Pt. If these byproducts cannot be effectively removed by the biological environment, they will result in a local change in the physiological equilibrium, including changes in pH, accumulation of toxins and formation of insoluble particulates [67]. Charge injection limits determine the safe electrical-stimula- tion parameters beyond which the electrode material is affected. Although metal and metal alloys have been widely used for bio- medical electrodes, the increased demands imposed by the need for higher density electrodes for applications such as the bionic eye have resulted in other materials, such as inorganic semiconductors and CPs, becoming more viable alternatives. Semiconductors, such as iridium oxide, have been studied as potential alternatives to the noble metals, having the advantages of excellent charge-storage capacity combined with lower impedance. Wilks et al. recently showed, in a comparative study of iridium oxide and PEDOT, that the CP was more suited for microneural interfaces with signiﬁcantly lower impedance and enhanced charge-storage capacity [76]. Additional biological requirements Although the biological environment has been discussed with respect to physical, mechanical and electrical properties of an implantable electrode, there are additional demands that require consideration. Patients requiring neuroprosthetic implants most often have existing neural damage as a result of injury or diseased tissue states. The introduction of a synthetic device will cause signiﬁcant trauma and probably result in further degeneration of injured tissue. As discussed earlier, even in the case of electrodes being introduced to healthy tissue, for example, cortical recording electrodes for controlling external devices, the impact of implanta- tion can signiﬁcantly damage cells [64]. An optimal bioelectrode will not only interact with neural tissue through design of physi- cal, mechanical and electrical properties, but rescue and regenerate damaged and diseased cells via supply of appropriate biological signaling factors. The provision of trophic factors has been shown to regenerate populations of diseased SGNs in the cochlea [8] and reduce inﬂammatory reactions in the cortex [40,66]. However, it is also known that when these factors are depleted, the surrounding tissue regresses to the diseased state and long-term ﬁbrosis is not 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm A B C D Figure 3.

Presentation of appropriate biomolecules requires consideration of the organ in which the device is being placed. Functionalized materials must be tailored to target speciﬁc tissues or cell types and responses. Therefore, in-depth knowledge of the target organ requirements is vital to design of an ideal bioelectrode. Biological molecules are not only able to positively interact with target tissues and organs; they may also activate speciﬁc com- ponents of the immune system, resulting in adverse host immune responses. Historically, several medical devices based on or incor- porating biomolecules have been approved for use as permanent implantable devices. These include bioprosthetic heart valves sourced from animal tissue [78], injectable tissue ﬁllers based on the protein collagen [79], and artiﬁcial skin products containing both cultured mammalian cells, bovine collagen and associated soluble mediators and extracellular matrix products [80], to name just a few. Immunotoxicity is clearly one of the risks that must be addressed and minimized in any device that incorporates a biologic. In a guid- ance document developed by the US FDA, immuno toxicity was deﬁned as “any adverse effect on the structure or function of the immune system, or on other systems as a result of immune system dysfunction. An effect is considered adverse or immunotoxic if it impairs humoral or cellular immunity needed by the host to defend itself against infectious or neoplastic disease (immunosuppression) or it causes unnecessary tissue damage (autoimmunity, hypersen- sitivity, or chronic inﬂammation)” [201]. The ﬁve major testing cat- egories suggested under this broad deﬁnition were hypersensitivity, chronic inﬂammation, immunosuppression, immunostimulation and autoimmunity. Of these, there are International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards for hypersensitivity based on historical evidence that this is the most likely speciﬁc immune response to most conventional materials. The issue of immuno- toxicity is further discussed later in the section on ‘Preclinical and clinical requirements’. Most bioelectrode research has focused on optimizing the elec- trode material and surface characteristics for improved electrical performance, including increasing the available surface area for more efﬁcient transfer of charge. The design of next-generation electrodes must consider not only the physical, mechanical and electrical requirements of a bioelectrode but the safe and effec- tive delivery of biomolecules required for maintaining an intimate communication at the neural interface. Key hurdles to application of CPs in medical devices Conducting polymers have many beneﬁcial properties that support their use in neural interfacing applications, as outlined in previous sections. These include physical properties, such as the characteristic surface roughness, which allows strong cell adhesion [7,9,81,82–83], and electrical properties, such as the low impedance associated with the rough surface topography [9,14,84,85]. Another aspect that favors their use is the capacity for integration of biological signals, such as growth factors [25,40,43,44,46] and cell adhesive ligands [24,27–29,31]. However, promising research ﬁndings for these new materials can only lead to exploitation for medical device application if the mate- rials can survive all aspects of development into a robust electrode coating. As a new material, the hurdles that CPs need to overcome in order to be applied in an implantable medical device can be broadly grouped as technical, preclinical, clinical and regulatory. The focus in this paper will be mainly on the technical and preclinical hurdles that need to be overcome. Technical issues relating to CPs for neural interfacing devices The major technical hurdles to transferring CP technology into commercial medical devices include the capacity to: • Be manufactured and sterilized under appropriate Good Manufacturing Practices; • Maintain stable electrical properties, including conductivity and impedance, over the implant lifetime; • Achieve adequate mechanical properties and maintain these over longer term implantation. In the case of bioactive CPs, an additional hurdle is the ability of the biological modiﬁed materials to meet all of the design crite- ria across electrical, physical/mechanical, chemical and biological performance measures. Fabrication & sterilization It is clear that the method used to fabricate CP coatings can impact on their function [22,86,87]. CPs fabricated via electrodeposition tend to have poor mechanical properties, although this can be modulated via choice of dopants and polymer type [29,75,87–89]. Chemical syn- thesis may be used to improve the mechanical properties, but this approach can also lead to diminished electrical properties [12,27]. Regardless of the synthetic approach, fabrication as a coating on electrodes needs to be developed as a simple, controlled process that can be conducted rapidly and cost effectively under clean conditions.

Expert Rev. Med. Devices 7(1), (2010)44 Review Poole-Warren, Lovell, Baek & Green Current methods are likely to be excessively complex and require multiple steps to complete. Development of simpliﬁed, robust pro- cesses for CP coating of electrodes is required for acceptance as an appropriate manufacturing process for commercial applications. This is a major issue that will need to be solved. The most common methods for sterilization of prepackaged, single-use medical devices include exposure to ethylene oxide gas or g-irradiation. Some devices are also sterilized by exposure to heat or steam via dry heat or autoclaving processes, and there are several new methods, including low-temperature gas plasma and vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide [90]. Each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages relating to their efﬁciency in reducing bioburden, tox- icity, convenience and cost; however, in developing a process that can be applied to a complex, multicomponent medical device, the impact of sterilization on all of the materials used must be considered. It has been shown that despite widespread acceptance of conventional sterilizing techniques, all of them may have adverse impacts on the polymers incorporated [90]. Devices such as the implantable parts of the cochlear implant are typically sterilized using ethylene oxide, which is conducted at temperatures lower than 60°C and humid- ity between 30 and 90% [91]. Although g-irradiation is likely to be more convenient and have lower associated toxicity, issues relating to polymer degradation and property changes that can occur following g-sterilization may prevent its more widespread use. Sterilization or disinfection of CPs is not usually conducted prior to testing electrical and mechanical properties. For studies assessing cell interactions in vitro, disinfection is typically carried out using UV light exposure or treatment in 70% ethanol [7,22,27]. In a recent study examining tissue responses to CPs in vivo, implants were elec- trodeposited under sterile conditions and the methods of sterilizing the monomer and dopant solutions were not described [8]. Given that all neuroprosthetic implants need to be terminally sterilized, this is undoubtedly a critical barrier that must be overcome before CPs can be applied in such devices. The major issues that need to be addressed are whether sterilization can be conducted using the same approaches as for the whole device and whether sterilization processes impact on the CP properties. In addition, the issues of persistence of ethylene oxide residuals in CPs and the likely impact of g-irradiation on the polymer properties need to be assessed prior to implementing either of these sterilization methods. Electrical stability Electrode materials have many properties that need to be controlled and the consequence of this is signiﬁcant complexity of design. Unlike passive devices with no electrical function, electrodes need to have well-controlled and stable electrical properties, as well as needing to meet the appropriate physical, mechanical, chemical and biological performance criteria. Most studies have suggested that electroactive polymers have excellent electrical properties in comparison with conventional noble metal conductors. Their high ionic conductivity can contribute to efﬁcient charge transfer, and their high surface area results in very low impedance [9,23,76,85]. Polypyrrole and PEDOT are the most common CPs reported as having potential for application to high-density micro- electrodes [11,12,82]. Several studies have confirmed that PPy poly mer ized in the presence of appropriate dopants has high conduc- tivities of the order of 100 S/cm and signiﬁcantly lower impedance than that reported for metal electrodes [17–19]. Although multiple variables need to be controlled in order to produce a CP that fulﬁls electrical, mechanical and biological performance criteria, it is the choice of dopant that probably has the greatest overall impact on properties. Comparison of the relatively low-toxicity dopants pTS and PSS suggests that the smaller dopant may produce PPy with higher conductivities owing to lower mobility and accessibility of anions with PSS [22]. However, stability of electrical properties over longer term implantation is likely to be poorer in CPs with smaller, more mobile dopants owing to diffusion of the dopant out of the polymer [22,82]. In vivo evaluation of electrical properties was con- ducted following implantation of PPy in the guinea pig cochlea [8]. Impedance studies following implantation in the animal model sug- gested that, over the 2-week implantation period, the impedance did not signiﬁcantly increase. Longer term studies examining electrical properties do not appear to have been pursued. When considering CPs as an alternative or adjunct to metal electrodes, the speciﬁc technical issues that need to be addressed include the ability of the electroactive polymer to maintain stable conductivity and impedance, and to display physical and mechani- cal durability over long-term contact with in vivo conditions com- bined with exposure to stimulation regimens. Questions remain regarding whether CPs can fulﬁll this stringent requirement, and future studies need to expand our understanding of the efﬁcacy of CPs following extended implantation periods combined with active stimulation. Mechanical properties & stability A key design requirement for neural electrodes is that they have appropriate mechanical properties and that they are able to maintain these properties over implant lifetimes. As outlined in the critical design criteria, ideal electrodes need to be adhesive to the underlying electrode and cohesive as well as being conformable, soft and ﬂex- ible. Although CPs have potential to be softer than metals, critical issues that have been identiﬁed in CPs include their brittleness and relatively poor mechanical durability in comparison with metals. This needs to be addressed either via alternate fabrication methods or via composite-based approaches to engineering the electrodes. In a recent review by Ateh et al., it was proposed that properties of CPs such as PPy can be modiﬁed via multiple routes, including the choice of dopant, the synthetic technique and post-synthesis modi- ﬁcation, either via surface modiﬁcation approaches or via electrical stimulation [82]. Additional ﬂexibility in design may be achieved by producing composites of CPs with other polymers, such as selected hydrogels. This approach was proposed by Martins group using CPs grown within polymers, including alginate gels and multiple variants of poly(lactic acid) nanoﬁbers [92,93]. These copolymers are designed to be softer than traditional CP ﬁlms, and, although they were shown to decrease the impedance of the gold electrodes by two orders of magnitude through increasing the charge transfer area [93], the mechanical stiffness was not quantiﬁed. Limited assays exist for the mechanical quantiﬁcation of CP stiffness on microelectrodes and future directions of CP research should address this deﬁcit. www.expert-reviews.com 45 ReviewDevelopment of bioactive conducting polymers for neural interfaces There is a paucity of information in the literature on either in vitro or in vivo mechanical durability of CPs. The potential for both mechanical and chemical degradation mechanisms in these polymers needs to be addressed in order to allay concerns relating to their long-term viability as neural electrodes. An intra-cochlear implantation of PPy-coated electrodes in guinea pigs did not assess the mechanical properties of the coating before and after implantation; however, the ﬁbrous tissue response was variable, which may be related, in part, to variations in the physical and mechanical properties [8]. An in vivo study of a nanocomposite based on nanoparticulate PPy and silicone for peripheral nerve stimulation in cats, suggested acute feasibility of the system, but no long-term data were reported [94]. The latter system is likely to be of high durability, given that the silicone polymer matrix is a common implantable polymer with known material responses in vivo. Before exploitation of these polymers in commercial devices, much needs to be learned relating to their baseline mechanical performance, how it can be optimized and whether this can be translated into satisfactory in vivo performances. Short-term bioactivity in long-term implants All bioactive composite materials face large challenges regard- ing the longevity of their bioactivity. In applications where the biomolecules are chemically bound to the CP surface, it is likely that biodegradation typical of all proteins will reduce the bio- logical efﬁcacy of the composite during chronic implantations. Additionally, in many CP applications, biomolecules require endocytosis and retrograde transport [95] and, as such, will have a period of efﬁcacy determined by the drug-release characteris- tics. As such, all bioactivity provided by functionalized CPs is necessarily ﬁnite. A key challenge in implementing an effective bioactive CP is in being able to use the initial period following implantation to establish a stable interface. Cui et al. have demonstrated that PPy doped with the cell attach- ment ligand, YIGSR, can be used to establish a tight connection between electrodes and cortical neurons within 7 days follow- ing implantation [28]. The anchoring of neurons occurred before encapsulation of the neural probe by ﬁbroblasts and astrocytes, which secured a stable recording for a period of 3 weeks [28]. Richardson et al. have shown that release of NT-3 from PPy can be mediated slowly by diffusion, or at an increased controlled rate by application of electrical stimulation [8]. At the stimulated rate, the NT-3 would be depleted by 21 days with continuous electrical stimulation or slightly longer with 8-h/day stimulation. However, it has also been shown that combined drug delivery and electrical stimulation of neurons, speciﬁcally SGNs in the cochlea, followed by electrical stimulation alone, can promote extended neuron survival beyond the period of drug delivery [96]. It is, therefore, viable that in neuroprosthetic applications, short-term bioactive CPs can be used to establish a stable bio- logical state. It is clear from both of these studies that further evaluation of CP modiﬁed bioelectrodes is required to assess chronic implant performance. The initial period following implantation will be vital to establishing the long-term efﬁcacy of bioactive devices. Preclinical & clinical requirements The safety and efﬁcacy of materials and devices are typically inves- tigated under a structured series of preclinical and clinical tests that must be satisfactorily completed before ﬁnal regulatory evalu- ation is commenced. The relevant international standards in this ﬁeld are the ISO 10993 document titled ‘Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices’. These provide a structured guideline to evalua- tion and testing [97] and a series of standards that outline more spe- ciﬁc testing approaches relevant to various critical host responses and other issues, such as selection of control materials and animal welfare. Part 1 of the series describes general principles that relate to biological performance testing of materials and devices, the classiﬁcation of different devices and, ﬁnally, a guidance of selec- tion of appropriate tests. Generally, devices are classed based on three criteria, including the tissue contacted, the nature of tissue contact and the period or duration of contact. The more criti- cal the application, the higher the level of testing required. CPs used in neural interfacing devices would be categorized as being an implant that has direct tissue contact. The contact duration would vary depending on the device type considered; however, for most applications of relevance to this paper, the duration would be for longer than 30 days, which is considered a permanent implant. For devices in this category, the ISO standard recom- mends, as a minimum, cytotoxicity, sensitization, genotoxicity, implantation, chronic toxicity and carcino genicity tests. Although most regulatory bodies refer to ISO10993, the FDA proposed a modiﬁed matrix that increases the suggested testing requirements for all categories of devices [98]. Thus, the FDA-modiﬁed matrix recommends that, in addition to the aforementioned tests, addi- tional tests, including primary irritation, systemic toxicity and subchronic toxicity, should be considered. Although there are no harmonized global standards for neural prostheses, the FDA provides guidance for industries developing neural prostheses. These include guidance for implantable middle ear hearing devices [99] and the recently released draft guidance for investigational device exemption for retinal prostheses [202]. These guidance documents both indicate the need for meeting speciﬁc regulatory requirements for documenting the materials used and their composition and performance; in particular, their electrical, mechanical and biological speciﬁcations. Chemical composition of the material and mobility of the dop- ant are likely to be issues that need to be addressed in terms of maintenance of electrical properties. Additionally, the impact of charge passage on the composition is also an issue. Polymer mechanics are of great importance, since ideal neuroprosthetic electrodes need to be mechanically stable and cause minimal dam- age to neural tissue. Most CPs tend to be more brittle and friable, potentially resulting in release of particles in vivo. Clearly, all of these issues can also impact on the biological performance, and the relevant biological testing would be expected to evaluate the risk of speciﬁc adverse host responses. As discussed earlier, the potential for immunotoxicity of CPs with biologicals incorporated needs to be evaluated. CPs are also characterized by rough, porous surfaces, which, although beneﬁcial to impedance, may also act as a nidus for infection. Infection of neural prostheses is a concern Expert Rev. Med. Devices 7(1), (2010)46 Review Poole-Warren, Lovell, Baek & Green that came to the fore in 2002, when the FDA received notiﬁca- tions of increased rates of bacterial meningitis in cochlear-implant recipients [203]. Links between infection rate and cochlear-implant design were suggested, and the issue of potential design aspects that could increase likelihood of infection is one that will continue to be closely monitored. Expert commentary Conducting polymers are promising materials for neural inter- facing applications where high-density electrodes are required, such as the bionic eye and new-generation cochlear implants. Their main advantages are the ability to tailor surface topography, which confers not only improved impedance but allows better neural cell interaction, and the ease of modiﬁcation with biologi- cal molecules. The key disadvantages that must be managed are the poor mechanical properties and unstable electrical proper- ties, particularly following modiﬁcation with bioactive molecules. Metal electrodes also suffer from signiﬁcant disadvantages, not least, the limits on charge injection. However, owing to their his- tory of use, and excellent electrical and biological performance in current devices, noble metals and alloys will continue to dominate the neural electrode ﬁeld in the foreseeable future. Conclusion A variety of multifunctional CPs based on PPy and PEDOT are being investigated for neural electrode applications. New com- posite materials show promise for improving CP mechanics, while maintaining superior charge transfer through reduced impedance at the neural interface. Additionally, CP coatings have been used to successfully promote neural attachment and growth through controlled supply of appropriate biomolecules. Future studies will investigate the long-term performance of CPs in implant systems, with a focus on continuous delivery of biologicals to maintain the beneﬁts of CPs for the device lifetime. Five-year view While CPs are not likely to be used in current-generation implant devices, their potential physical and electrical beneﬁts make them a candidate for improving bioelectrode efﬁcacy in the future. For speciﬁc devices, such as the developmental bionic eye, cur- rent electrode technologies using Pt electrodes cannot be signiﬁ- cantly smaller and still deliver the requisite charge. Decreasing the electrode size by an order of magnitude but still maintaining safe and efﬁcacious charge delivery would provide for a huge increase in the visual acuity afforded to the implant recipient. In parallel with other developments, CP-coated electrodes could mediate the evolution of bionic eye implants from being devices that would assist in mobility to being devices that would allow for reading and face recognition. Conducting polymers have material properties to potentially support a next generation of bioelectrode technology, with appli- cation-speciﬁc tailoring of biofunctionality to support long-term cell survival and growth. The immediate future will be critical to investigating CP stability over time and demonstrating that they maintain the requisite mechanical and biological properties as described herein.

Devices such as pacemakers and implantable deﬁbrillators have used electrodes fabricated from Pt and alloys of Pt and iridium for several decades with minimal adverse effects [4]. Similarly, the cochlear implant, which is one of the most successful and widely used neural prostheses to date, has used a confor- mal electrode array with exposed Pt contacts for almost 30 years [1]. Despite this history of success, the next stage of development in neural interfacing electrodes needs to address issues such as increas- ing impedance observed over longer-term implan- tation and the resulting need for higher energies to elicit equivalent neural responses. For devices under development, such as the implantable bionic eye, the need for signiﬁcantly more electrodes arranged in a high-density array to achieve effec- tive restoration of function places stringent design requirements on both the electrode material and the fabrication method. Proposals for alternate electrode materials or coatings tend to focus on improving the interface between the electrode and neural tissue, and sup- porting the design and fabrication of denser, more complex electrode conﬁgurations. Conducting polymers (CPs) have been proposed as an alternative or an adjunct to metal electrodes for a range of biomedical applications from bio sensors to cochlear implants [5–7]. Their unique physical and mechanical properties offer closer matching with that of neural tissue compared with metal electrodes. Added to this, the chemical and electri- cal properties of CPs are associated with excellent biological performance [6,8,9]. However, there are still many challenges to overcome before these materials can be approved in commercial medical devices. Although electrical properties have been optimized in CPs during the period since their discovery, the trade-off between electrical and mechanical properties and their ultimate perfor- mance in a biological environment remains a key barrier to their application in biomedical implants. Conducting polymer components & fabrication Conducting polymers can pass electronic charge owing to their molecular structure, in which the polymerized backbone is comprised of alternat- ing single and double bonds. This bond arrange- ment produces a low-energy state and introduces a conduction band [10]. The polymer can be transformed into a conductor by oxidative dop- ing, where an electron is removed from the weaker ‘p’ system of the double bond, producing a free radical and a spinless positive charge known as a polaron. Upon further oxidation, the free radical Laura Poole-Warren †, Nigel Lovell, Sungchul Baek and Rylie Green †Author for correspondence Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia Tel.: +61 293 853 905 Fax: +61 296 632 108 l.poolewarren@unsw.edu.au Bioelectrodes for neural recording and neurostimulation are an integral component of a number of neuroprosthetic devices, including the commercially available cochlear implant, and developmental devices, such as the bionic eye and brain–machine interfaces. Current electrode designs limit the application of such devices owing to suboptimal material properties that lead to minimal interaction with the target neural tissue and the formation of ﬁbrotic capsules. In designing an ideal bioelectrode, a number of design criteria must be considered with respect to physical, mechanical, electrical and biological properties. Conducting polymers have the potential to address the synergistic interaction of these properties and show promise as superior coatings for next-generation electrodes in implant devices.

Devices 7(1), (2010)36 Review Poole-Warren, Lovell, Baek & Green of the polaron is removed, creating a new spinless defect called a bipolaron. Eventually, with continued doping, continuous bipo- laron bands can be formed along the CP backbone. On application of a potential across the CP, the main mechanism of conduction is the movement of charge carriers between localized sites or between bipolaron states (shown in FIGURE 1). Ion movements in or out of the ﬁlm are dependent on dopant charge and motility. Although bipolarons are known to be the main source of charge carriers, the precise mechanism of charge transport through CPs is not fully understood [10]. It is important to consider that most CPs are highly disordered and that charge transport can occur not only along the polymer chains but also between chains and complex boundaries established by the presence of multiple phases. While no CP has been approved for use in implantable medi- cal devices, CP-mediated biosensors have been utilized in ex vivo diagnostics, and a number of CP-coated bioelectrodes have been investigated. In general, CPs are used as coatings rather than stand-alone electrodes, and the fabrication approach used typically aims to produce micrometer-thickness ﬁlms on metal electrodes. Polymerization of CPs can be mediated via either chemical or electrochemical methods [11]. Chemical polymerization proceeds via many different routes, such as addition reactions stimulated by radicals, cations or anions; or condensation reactions [12]. These CPs can be tailored to include a great variety of modiﬁcations, but the processing time is signiﬁ- cantly longer than electrochemical polymerization and entails the use of strong oxidants, such as ferric chloride. Additionally, the resulting ﬁlms often have diminished electrical properties in com- parison with electrically deposited ﬁlms and, thus, may require post- fabrication doping to increase conductivity [11]. As such, chemical polymerization techniques have found limited application in the modiﬁcation of neural electrodes. Electropolymerization can be performed on the electrode intended for coating, and consequently, no further processing is required, making it a superior technique for neuroprosthetic appli- cations [11]. Typical fabrication of CPs for neural implants involves oxidative electrochemical polymerization of CP monomers in an aqueous electrolyte solution consisting of the dopant anions in an appropriate solvent. Electrodeposition is usually carried out in a three-electrode (i.e., working, counter and reference electrodes) system. Upon oxidation, CP monomers form radical cations that simultaneously bind anionic dopants and polymerize to form homo- geneous CP ﬁlms on the working (anode) electrode. The efﬁcacy of a CP-coated bioelectrode is highly dependent on the two main constituents of the CP backbone, the monomer and dopant. Monomers based on heterocyclic aromatics, such as 3,4-ethyl- enedioxythiophene (EDOT) and pyrrole, have been widely used for a range of biomedical applications owing to their environmental stability (thermal and oxidative), electrochemical stability, bio- compatibility, conductivity (10–200 S/cm) and ease of synthe- sis. Polypyrrole (PPy) is the most common CP utilized in neural probe applications owing to the aqueous solubility of the pyrrole monomer; however, PPy has shown limited electrical response after repeated redox cycles because of the formation of structural defects along its backbone [6]. Hence, PPy may not be suitable for chronic neural probe applications. Recently, polymer variants of poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) have been increasingly investi- gated for their superior electrochemical conductivity and stability, and ability to be tailored for altered function ality [6,13–16]. One limitation of PEDOT is the poor water solubility of the EDOT monomer, which researchers have overcome by employing a two- part acetonitirile and water solvent. However, for biomedical applications, a purely aqueous system is desirable for both bio- compatibility and the incorporation of biological signaling factors to mediate cell responses. As such, water-soluble EDOT deriva- tives, such as hydroxymethylated-3,4-ethylenedioxylthiophene (EDOT-MeOH), have been developed [14–16]. Common dopants for biomedical CPs are sodium salts of aro- matic sulfonates, such as paratoluene sulfonate (pTS) and poly- styrene sulfonate (PSS). These large amphiphilic dopants have been shown to produce CPs with high conductivity, chemical stability, desirable mechanical properties and thermal compat- ibility in a wide range of applications [17–21]. When incorporated in an electrochemical deposition, aromatic sulfonates are water soluble but hydrophobic enough to orient the CP chain parallel to the electrode [18]. Consequently, the resulting CP has well-ordered structure with high conductivity and desirable environmental sta- bility [6,18]. In addition, several sulfonate-doped ﬁlms have been shown to be biocompatible both in vivo and in vitro [8,22,23]. Alternative dopants & biological additives In neural prostheses, CPs can be biofunctionalized to control the neural cell response in the initial period following implantation. PEDOT and PPy ﬁlms doped with conventional sodium sulfo- nates are biocompatible but lack the biofunctionality to achieve cell interaction and adhesion. The provision of controlled release of growth factors has been shown to increase the cell numbers interfaced with the electrodes. Bioactive polymeric anions, including laminin pep- tides [16,24–28], hyaluronic acid [29,30], silk ﬁbronectin [27], hep- arin [30–34], ATP [35–38], polymeric amino acids [39], phosphate- buffered saline [39,40], collagen [40] and other biomolecules [21,41,42], have been used to dope CPs. These dopants provide biological cues and have been shown to be compatible with a variety of CPs, as summarized in TABLE 1. To maintain the integrity of biomolecules, CPs for neural implants are fabricated under biofriendly conditions with neutral-pH aqueous electrolytes at low oxidation potentials. As an alternative to doping, biological entities have been incorpo- rated into CPs through entrapment, physical adsorption and cova- lent bonding. Entrapment is a simple and reproducible technique that occurs in parallel with CP doping. In addition to the doping anions present in conventional electrolytes, biological inclusions, which are usually large, weakly charged polymeric molecules, are added to the monomer solution. The biomolecules are introduced into the polymer during polymerization and immobilized within the CP matrix. Neurotrophins and anti-inﬂammatory drugs have been incorporated by this process, including NGF [7,25,40,42], neu- rotrophin-3 (NT-3) [8,43,44] and dexamethasone [45]. These active molecules have been combined with a variety of dopants and poly- mer systems, as summarized in TABLE 2. Drug release can occur either www.expert-reviews.com 37 ReviewDevelopment of bioactive conducting polymers for neural interfaces passively by diffusion or actively by utilizing the oxidation–reduc- tion properties of the CP. Passive diffusion can be an effective way of providing drugs to a biological system. The chemical structure of the constituent components of the CP will be the dominant factor in determining the rate of release. A more controlled mecha- nism involves the application of an electrical stimulus to produce an electrical potential, where dopant anions become mobile and entrapped biomolecules are then carried out of the polymer matrix with the dopant ion ﬂux [43]. The physical adsorption process involves surface immobiliza- tion of biomolecules by weak electrostatic interaction between the cationic polymer matrix and the anionic biomolecules in the CP–biomolecule solution interface. Although the process is very straightforward, this technique offers minimal control over the concentration and stability of the adsorbed molecule. Biomolecules can also be covalently attached to CPs through functional links. While covalent attachment is not as simple as the other immobilization techniques, the signiﬁcantly stronger bond provides better control over the stability and the localization of the biomolecules on the polymer surface. However, covalent attachment tends to increase the steric effect of the CP backbone and reduces the electrical conductivity of the conjugated poly- mer. Nonetheless, a number of biomolecules listed in TABLE 3 have been covalently attached to CPs, including NGF bound to PPy through polyallylamine-azido linker [46], through N-hydroxyl succinimidyl ester linker, and polylysine and laminin bound to poly-l-glutamic acid [39]. The method of polymer modiﬁcation inﬂuences the amount of biomolecule required during fabrication to ensure biofunctional- ity. Generally, a higher concentration of a molecule needs to be incorporated within CPs to provide similar bioactivity to that achieved by molecules supplied directly to the biological environ- ment. Irreversible oxidation during electrochemical polymeriza- tion or post-process chemical modiﬁcation has been shown to degrade the biomolecules in the electrolyte solution and limited the efﬁciency of electrodeposition, and this may degrade the mechanical and electrical performance of the polymer. Application of conducting polymers to medical devices Conducting polymers can potentially meet the complex and syn- ergistic design criteria to produce an optimal electrode surface for neuroprosthetic medical devices. Neuroprostheses aim to artiﬁ- cially replace a damaged or lost biological functionality. They fall into two broad categories: stimulating devices that evoke neural responses in biological tissue; and recording electrodes that trans- duce signals from the neural system for use in either controlling external devices or in mapping the electrophysiological state of excitable tissue. Typical stimulating devices include the cochlear implant and bionic eye, whereas recording electrodes are used most commonly in brain–machine interfacing (BMI) and neuromus- cular control of external prosthetic devices. These devices require connection with excitable tissue via bioelectrodes, through which stimulation and recording of bioelectric activity is performed. Bioelectric activity arises from the intrinsic properties of the cell membranes of excitable cells forming the functional organ systems of the body. Examples of such excitable cells include the neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems, cardiomyocytes form- ing the muscle and the specialized conduction systems of the heart, Figure 1.

Despite their vastly different roles and functions within the body, excitable cells share the common characteristic of being able to be excited. They are all able to receive and respond to appropriate stimuli, be it electrical, mechanical or chemical in nature. In the most general terms, a biopotential electrode is a transducer, which, in the case of neural recording, converts ionic currents (carried by ions in solution) in physiological media (tissues and organs of the body) into electronic currents (carried by electrons) in metallic conductors, suitable for detection, ampliﬁcation and ana lysis by an instrument. In the case of neurostimulation, the transduction process is reversed and an electrical current is converted into an ionic current that depolarizes the cells surrounding the electrode. The electrode material interactions with the surrounding biologi- cal environment during the initial period following device implan- tation are critical in determining the quality of communication formed between the target cells and the bioelectrodes [11,47–49]. As such, bioelectrodes are fundamental to the long-term performance of neuroprosthetic devices, and surface modiﬁcations, such as bio- active CPs, are an important area of research for both developmental devices and next-generation commercial devices [11,50]. Cochlear implant The cochlear implant is a commercially available implant that has, for several decades, restored hearing percepts to patients suffering from sensorineural deafness, which occurs through loss of or dam- age to the cochlea hair cells [11,50]. The stimulating portion of the implant is a ﬂexible electrode array that is placed within the cochlear structure. The application of electrical waveforms stimulates the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), effectively bypassing the dam- aged or lost hair cells [11]. In this device, Pt electrodes provide an effective neural-stimulation platform. However, next-generation devices are being developed to address current limitations in patient sound perception. Current cochlear implant research aims to provide a wider range of perceived frequencies to improve speech recognition in a noisy environment, music appreciation and binaural tasks, such as sound- source localization [51–53]. A key barrier to achieving this aim is the need to produce higher densities of microelectrodes, allowing smaller numbers of cells to be stimulated at different locations along the cochlear, producing a wider range of sound percepts. Conventional cochlear implant-fabrication techniques produce Pt electrodes with a relatively smooth surface, which limits the maximal charge that can be supplied to neural cells as the size of the electrodes is reduced. Surface modiﬁcation, such as laser roughening of the electrodes, has been shown to both improve the permissible stimulation para- meters and also beneﬁt cell integration [49]. However, the stimulation parameters delivered via Pt electrodes are predominantly restricted by the safe charge-injection limit of 100–250 µC/cm 2, above which electrode dissolution and evolution of toxic ions can occur [54]. As such, Pt may not be an optimal material for producing high-density microelectrode arrays in the cochlear implant. CPs provide an alter- native electrode coating, as they have a greatly increased charge- transfer surface area per geometric area compared with Pt. PEDOT has been reported to increase the available charge density by up to two orders of magnitude, to 198 mC/cm 2 [24]. Studies have shown that stimulation rate and electrode place- ment can inﬂuence the threshold, the maximum acceptable loud- ness level, and dynamic range for electrical stimulation in cochlear implant users [52,53]. Perimodiolar placement of new-generation cochlear implants position the stimulating electrodes within close proximity to the SGNs. These cochlear implants have been shown to signiﬁcantly improve patient outcomes owing to the minimized distance between electrodes and target cells [49,51–53]. Several groups have hypothesized that control of surface properties coupled with the supply of trophic factors can create an intimate connection between electrodes and SGNs at the neural interface [8,43,49]. Additionally, it has been shown that supply of appropriate biomolecules can protect SGNs from further degeneration, which is often seen in patients with sensorineural deafness [8,43]. CPs are a potential carrier for trophic factors and have been identiﬁed as having surface character- istics optimal for neural cell attachment [8,24,43,55]. Electrode designs that support improved communication with the target SGNs will directly affect the permissible stimulation parameters and chronic performance of cochlear implants. Richardson et al. have shown that coating cochlear electrodes with PPy loaded with neurotrophin, NT-3, can lower the interfacial impedance and improve SGN survival during the initial period Table 2.

Chronic studies have not shown an ongoing improvement in performance when compared with stan- dard Pt electrodes. However, these studies used only conventional cochlear stimulation parameters, and the increased capacity for charge delivery expected for CP electrodes has not been explored. Bionic eye The bionic eye is a developmental neurostim- ulation device that is intended to provide a perception of sight to blind patients. There are a number of approaches used to achieve sight percepts through electrical stimulation at different locations within the mammalian visual system. The most popular approach is stimulation of the neural retina, which requires less signal pro- cessing than the alternate approaches, which include stimulation of the optic nerve, optic chiasm and vision cortex [56–58]. Stimulation of the retina, via retinal prostheses, is only achievable for patients with a functional neural path between the retina and vision cortex. This encompasses people with degenerative retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. A critical issue in designing a commercial retinal-stimulation device is the construction of the high-density electrode array to interface with the retinal tissue [11]. Such arrays must be ﬁxated in close proximity to the neural retina. They are typically placed either epiretinally [56], subretinally or in the suprachoroidal space [59]. Despite varying retinal locations, these prostheses are designed to primarily stimulate the retinal ganglion cells, which comprise the innermost cell layer of the retina. While signiﬁcant research has investigated the functional efﬁcacy of retinal ganglion cells in blind patients, it is generally thought that a higher density electrode array will increase the resolution of perceived vision [11,56]. It should be noted that high-density fabrication alone will not be a sufﬁcient criteria to increase visual acuity. Many other factors, including the spread of current from the stimulating electrode site, the proximity of the retinal ganglion cells to any particular electrode, and the stim- ulation paradigm itself, will inﬂuence the psychophysical percep- tion of artiﬁcial vision (FIGURE 2). In order to construct high-density electrode arrays with thousands of electrodes, new technological approaches are required [11]. Laser roughening, iridium oxide alloys and Pt black (Pt powder produced on the surface by electroplating) have all been researched as surface modiﬁcations [60,61]; however, CP coatings offer an alternative to produce microelectrodes with higher charge-storage densities [61]. Additionally, CPs may be more effective in maintaining the degenerative neural tissue of bionic eye recipients, as CPs can be polymerized in the presence of biological signaling factors, which are released following implantation and promote neural cell survival and growth [7,25,43]. Brain–machine interfaces High-resolution recording is key to the development of an effective BMI [62]. While neuroprostheses often have both stimulating and recording functionality, BMIs are predominantly neural recording devices. In most BMI applications, physiological neural processes are used to control external devices. One such device operates through recording directly from the cortex to provide commu- nications for locked-in or paralyzed patients to interact with the surrounding environment. BMIs can also be connected to the peripheral nervous system [62]. Current-generation neuroprosthetic limb designs are not BMIs, recording from skeletal muscle trans- cutaneously to produce movement of a robotically driven limb, but next-generation BMI designs will connect directly to neural tissue to provide improved control [62]. Regardless of application, when applying the biosignal process- ing techniques to neural records in order to extract features, a criti- cal consideration is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Introduction of noise most commonly occurs owing to poor interfacing between the recording electrode and neural tissue, but other factors, includ- ing recording from multiple neurons or bundles, external noise sources and electrode micromotion, reduce the accuracy of signal acquisition and interpretation [63,64]. Traditionally, microwires of Pt, gold, tungsten or stainless steel have been used in BMI-recording applications. The microwire design is simply an insulated wire with an exposed tip for con- tacting tissue. Although still commonly used in neuroprosthetic research, the microwire is severely limited in application owing to the difﬁculty of placement and the single contact point available per wire. Extensive research over the last decade has produced next- generation electrode arrays that allow for much greater control over electrode size, shape, texture and spacing [64]. Microelectrode arrays, such as the Utah Electrode Array and Michigan Tetrode, have been designed to minimize noise when recording intracorti- cally. Both the Utah and Michigan designs are micromachined from silicon to produce relatively stiff electrodes that can be accu- rately inserted into the cortex. The contacting electrodes are plated with either gold or Pt for improved biocompatibility and safety. However, as with the microwire design, inﬂexible implants in soft cortical tissue are not optimal. Although placement of the array is more accurate, the inﬂammation response following implanta- tion is exacerbated by the strain mismatch between the metallic constructs and neural tissue [65]. Conducting polymers have been applied to the electrode con- tacts of the Michigan array, and it has been demonstrated that this softer interface improves the SNR of acute neural recordings from Table 3.

Two studies have examined the chronic performance of PEDOT-coated Michigan arrays implanted in rat cortex for 6 weeks [55,66]. In both studies, the SNR was sig- niﬁcantly improved compared with the bare-electrode control in the initial period following implantation. Critical design criteria of neural electrodes In the most general terms, a bioelectrode is a transducer, convert- ing ionic currents (carried in physiological ﬂuids) into electronic currents (carried in metallic conductors and device electronics). As discussed earlier, application-speciﬁc research has guided the development of implant electrodes. This research has deﬁned a number of properties that are integral to the chronic performance of electrodes in neuroprosthetic devices and can be broadly cat- egorized as physical, mechanical and electrical, as shown in BOX 1. These properties interact substantially and synergistically to determine the biological performance of an electrode when placed in a physiological environment. The criteria for producing optimal neural electrodes are the same for both stimulating and recording devices. Both applica- tions require low impedance and close coupling between the neural tissue and the electrode surface, although for different reasons. In a stimulating device, these characteristics assist in reducing the overall power consumption of the device, as well as reducing the risk of exceeding the power supply compliance voltage. In recording devices, these characteristics improve the SNR, thereby allowing more accurate signals to be elicited from the data. The ideal design criteria for long-term, implantable electrodes were summarized in a review by Merrill et al. as requiring the following [67]: • Appropriate biological performance of the passive material when under nonstimulated conditions; • Acceptable mechanical properties, including maintaining these properties during storage and surgery and following implantation; • Satisfactory efﬁcacy allowing the required injection of charge and achievement of the appropriate stimulation outcomes; • Absence of signiﬁcant Faradaic reactions during active use so that minimal toxicity is elicited; • Low corrosion rate; • Stable electrical properties, including impedance, and stable conducting and insulating properties. Impact of physical properties The key failure mode of many chronic neural implants has been linked to the foreign body response [63]. Physical properties of bioelectrodes are integral to their initial biological interactions, and surface topography strongly inﬂuences the type of cell growth observed over the ensuing period. An optimal neural electrode will resist ﬁbrosis while providing a conducive surface for neural cell attachment [50,63,64,68]. It is thought that optimal interactions can be achieved through tailoring the surface properties of an electrode construct [63,64]. Patterning or roughening of neural electrodes has been dem- onstrated by a number of groups, and electrode surfaces modi- ﬁed by laser roughening, Pt black electroplating, iridium oxide coating and CP ﬁlms have exhibited properties that encourage neural cell attachment [9,69]. The increase in roughness created by modifying the surface morphology is depicted in FIGURE 3 for both laser roughening and two CP variants, PPy and PEDOT. Additionally, microfabrication of neural probes to create sub- cellular structures at the electrode interface, reported by Seymour and Kipke, has been shown to signiﬁcantly reduce ﬁbrotic encap- sulation [63]. However, studies by Szarowski et al. demonstrate that while these properties can control the initial wound heal- ing response, the chronic formation of glial scarring is not pre- vented [65]. Szarowski et al. suggest that strategies to improve the chronic cellular response purely through physical modiﬁcations to electrode constructs may be ineffective, and they support the current surge in research towards controlling immune reactions and neural cell ingrowth through supply of biological factors [65]. Mechanical design criteria Conventional metallic electrodes such as Pt and gold are rela- tively unreactive in a biological environment and, hence, are considered mechanically stable [64]. While these neural electrodes are physically robust, the biological response to their presence must be appropriate. Stiff, sharp features cause damage to the neural tissue; with a known ‘kill zone’ of up to 100 µm occur-µm occur-m occur- ring on insertion of inﬂexible arrays, such as the Utah Electrode Array and Michigan designs [64,70]. The ensuing inﬂammatory reaction produces ﬁbrotic encapsulation which, in the long-term, reduces implant efﬁcacy [64]. While ﬂexible, rounded electrode 2 mm Figure 2. Laser micromachined, high-density, ﬂexible 98-electrode array for application in a bionic eye implant. www.expert-reviews.com 41 ReviewDevelopment of bioactive conducting polymers for neural interfaces constructs are difﬁcult to place within neural tissue, the more pliable interface is likely to improve chronic performance of the implant [70,71]. Neural tissue is considerably softer than metal, and the result- ing strain mismatch at the neural interface damages tissue during micromotion [65,70]. Rigid metallic electrodes, such as the Utah Electrode Array device, have an elastic modulus of approximately 10 11 Pa [72]. While next-generation ﬂexible electrode arrays have a signiﬁcantly lower stiffness of approximately 10 9 Pa [70], an optimal implant electrode will have an elastic modulus close to that of neural tissue (~10 5 Pa) [72,73]. An intermediate layer or surface modiﬁcation is required to dampen the effect of mechanical differences between the electrode and neural tissue. Ideally, such an interface would also provide biological cues for minimizing the inﬂammatory response and consequent ﬁbrosis following implantation. Coatings or surface modiﬁcations must also be durable. A con- ventional smooth metallic surface is unlikely to be corroded in normal physiological ﬂuid when operated within safe electrical- stimulation parameters [71]. However, coatings such as Pt black and CPs are liable to be susceptible to degradation. Cogan reported on the use of a variant of Pt black called Pt gray – a moderately porous variant of the former, which has the advantage of improved abrasion resis tance [74]. Pt black, Pt gray and CPs are adhered to the metallic electrode via electrically mediated processes [60,75]. As such, the durability of the ﬁlm adhesion to the electrode will be an important consideration in designing a mechanically stable electrode. Additionally, the particles of these coatings must be cohe- sive and nondegradable. Micromotion of implant electrodes is well described in the literature [64,70]; accordingly, surface modiﬁcations must be able to withstand these shear forces. Any particles of the electrode that are displaced must be tolerated by the surrounding biological environment. Electrical design criteria Neural prostheses are broadly categorized into stimulating and recording implants but, realistically, most devices will perform both of these functionalities. Stimulating implants aim to replace a neural function by artiﬁcially evoking a neuronal response with an electrical stimulus, but it is important that recordings also be obtained to provide feedback on the health of the tissue at the neural interface [11,56]. A number of electrical properties need to be considered when designing a neural electrode, including imped- ance, long-term electrical stability and reversibility of reactions occurring at the neural interface (or recovery of Faradaic reactions). Neural electrodes ideally have low impedance so that stimuli can be reliably delivered to the tissue at the required frequency. Current attempts to increase the number of stimulating electrodes in cochlear implants have been limited by the stimulation parameters that can be safely used with smaller electrodes [50]. It is proposed that higher densities of microelectrodes, with improved impedance characteristics, will allow for more complex stimulation paradigms to be delivered to neural tissue. For the cochlear implant, this trans- lates to superior perception of sounds, such as music and speech in a noisy environment [50,53]. It is well documented that impedance is reduced by increasing the available charge transfer area at the electrode surface, but to retain spatial selectivity (or resolution), modiﬁcations must increase the surface area while maintaining the geometric size [49,60]. As such, a number of modiﬁcations, including CP coatings, have been investigated for reducing electrode imped- ance. Speciﬁcally, CPs have highly textured surface characteristics, as shown in FIGURE 3, which results in impedance magnitudes of up to two orders of magnitude lower than that of unmodiﬁed metallic electrodes. A sample of the surface modiﬁcations used to reduce electrode impedance is shown in TABLE 4 for both the conventional electrode materials and for some of the available coating variants. Tissue conducts electron charge by ionic transport, whereas devices conduct charge with electrons and holes and, hence, charge transport at a neural interface is typically a conversion of electronic charge to ionic charge (or the reverse, according to application) [72]. For conventional Pt electrodes, this results in a bilayer capacitance, which must be charged before being passed into the physiological medium. CPs are particularly attractive as a surface modiﬁcation because they are able to facilitate charge transport both electroni- cally and ionically [72]. At oxidation and reduction potentials deter- mined by the CP chemistry, changes in the CP conformation pro- mote ionic ﬂux. Mobile dopant species and small ions present in the extracellular ﬂuid are forced either into or out of the CP, and can be used to mediate the transfer of charge from the underlying metallic electrode to the surrounding tissues. However, if mobile dopant species diffuse away from the CP electrode, then deterioration of the CP electrochemistry will occur. An important consideration in choosing a mobile dopant species is their potential toxicity to surrounding biological environment if released during stimulation. The choice of dopant species is further detailed with respect to electrical stability and biocompatibility in the following section ‘Key hurdles to application of CPs in medical devices’. The electrical function of a neural electrode must not adversely affect performance relating to the other variables. For example, pass- ing a speciﬁc current waveform through a metal electrode to stimu- late tissue should not result in excessive dissolution of metal ions, nor should it cause nonreversible Faradaic reactions at the electrode, both of which can result in tissue damage. In a conventional Pt electrode, nonreversible reactions that may alter the local biological Box 1. Design criteria for neural electrodes: material properties.

Med. Devices 7(1), (2010)42 Review Poole-Warren, Lovell, Baek & Green environment include hydrolysis of the extracellular ﬂuid, which produces oxygen gas, and the interaction of chloride ions with the metal electrode, which causes electrode dissolution and the evolution of toxic chlorides of Pt. If these byproducts cannot be effectively removed by the biological environment, they will result in a local change in the physiological equilibrium, including changes in pH, accumulation of toxins and formation of insoluble particulates [67]. Charge injection limits determine the safe electrical-stimula- tion parameters beyond which the electrode material is affected. Although metal and metal alloys have been widely used for bio- medical electrodes, the increased demands imposed by the need for higher density electrodes for applications such as the bionic eye have resulted in other materials, such as inorganic semiconductors and CPs, becoming more viable alternatives. Semiconductors, such as iridium oxide, have been studied as potential alternatives to the noble metals, having the advantages of excellent charge-storage capacity combined with lower impedance. Wilks et al. recently showed, in a comparative study of iridium oxide and PEDOT, that the CP was more suited for microneural interfaces with signiﬁcantly lower impedance and enhanced charge-storage capacity [76]. Additional biological requirements Although the biological environment has been discussed with respect to physical, mechanical and electrical properties of an implantable electrode, there are additional demands that require consideration. Patients requiring neuroprosthetic implants most often have existing neural damage as a result of injury or diseased tissue states. The introduction of a synthetic device will cause signiﬁcant trauma and probably result in further degeneration of injured tissue. As discussed earlier, even in the case of electrodes being introduced to healthy tissue, for example, cortical recording electrodes for controlling external devices, the impact of implanta- tion can signiﬁcantly damage cells [64]. An optimal bioelectrode will not only interact with neural tissue through design of physi- cal, mechanical and electrical properties, but rescue and regenerate damaged and diseased cells via supply of appropriate biological signaling factors. The provision of trophic factors has been shown to regenerate populations of diseased SGNs in the cochlea [8] and reduce inﬂammatory reactions in the cortex [40,66]. However, it is also known that when these factors are depleted, the surrounding tissue regresses to the diseased state and long-term ﬁbrosis is not 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm A B C D Figure 3.

Presentation of appropriate biomolecules requires consideration of the organ in which the device is being placed. Functionalized materials must be tailored to target speciﬁc tissues or cell types and responses. Therefore, in-depth knowledge of the target organ requirements is vital to design of an ideal bioelectrode. Biological molecules are not only able to positively interact with target tissues and organs; they may also activate speciﬁc com- ponents of the immune system, resulting in adverse host immune responses. Historically, several medical devices based on or incor- porating biomolecules have been approved for use as permanent implantable devices. These include bioprosthetic heart valves sourced from animal tissue [78], injectable tissue ﬁllers based on the protein collagen [79], and artiﬁcial skin products containing both cultured mammalian cells, bovine collagen and associated soluble mediators and extracellular matrix products [80], to name just a few. Immunotoxicity is clearly one of the risks that must be addressed and minimized in any device that incorporates a biologic. In a guid- ance document developed by the US FDA, immuno toxicity was deﬁned as “any adverse effect on the structure or function of the immune system, or on other systems as a result of immune system dysfunction. An effect is considered adverse or immunotoxic if it impairs humoral or cellular immunity needed by the host to defend itself against infectious or neoplastic disease (immunosuppression) or it causes unnecessary tissue damage (autoimmunity, hypersen- sitivity, or chronic inﬂammation)” [201]. The ﬁve major testing cat- egories suggested under this broad deﬁnition were hypersensitivity, chronic inﬂammation, immunosuppression, immunostimulation and autoimmunity. Of these, there are International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards for hypersensitivity based on historical evidence that this is the most likely speciﬁc immune response to most conventional materials. The issue of immuno- toxicity is further discussed later in the section on ‘Preclinical and clinical requirements’. Most bioelectrode research has focused on optimizing the elec- trode material and surface characteristics for improved electrical performance, including increasing the available surface area for more efﬁcient transfer of charge. The design of next-generation electrodes must consider not only the physical, mechanical and electrical requirements of a bioelectrode but the safe and effec- tive delivery of biomolecules required for maintaining an intimate communication at the neural interface. Key hurdles to application of CPs in medical devices Conducting polymers have many beneﬁcial properties that support their use in neural interfacing applications, as outlined in previous sections. These include physical properties, such as the characteristic surface roughness, which allows strong cell adhesion [7,9,81,82–83], and electrical properties, such as the low impedance associated with the rough surface topography [9,14,84,85]. Another aspect that favors their use is the capacity for integration of biological signals, such as growth factors [25,40,43,44,46] and cell adhesive ligands [24,27–29,31]. However, promising research ﬁndings for these new materials can only lead to exploitation for medical device application if the mate- rials can survive all aspects of development into a robust electrode coating. As a new material, the hurdles that CPs need to overcome in order to be applied in an implantable medical device can be broadly grouped as technical, preclinical, clinical and regulatory. The focus in this paper will be mainly on the technical and preclinical hurdles that need to be overcome. Technical issues relating to CPs for neural interfacing devices The major technical hurdles to transferring CP technology into commercial medical devices include the capacity to: • Be manufactured and sterilized under appropriate Good Manufacturing Practices; • Maintain stable electrical properties, including conductivity and impedance, over the implant lifetime; • Achieve adequate mechanical properties and maintain these over longer term implantation. In the case of bioactive CPs, an additional hurdle is the ability of the biological modiﬁed materials to meet all of the design crite- ria across electrical, physical/mechanical, chemical and biological performance measures. Fabrication & sterilization It is clear that the method used to fabricate CP coatings can impact on their function [22,86,87]. CPs fabricated via electrodeposition tend to have poor mechanical properties, although this can be modulated via choice of dopants and polymer type [29,75,87–89]. Chemical syn- thesis may be used to improve the mechanical properties, but this approach can also lead to diminished electrical properties [12,27]. Regardless of the synthetic approach, fabrication as a coating on electrodes needs to be developed as a simple, controlled process that can be conducted rapidly and cost effectively under clean conditions.

Expert Rev. Med. Devices 7(1), (2010)44 Review Poole-Warren, Lovell, Baek & Green Current methods are likely to be excessively complex and require multiple steps to complete. Development of simpliﬁed, robust pro- cesses for CP coating of electrodes is required for acceptance as an appropriate manufacturing process for commercial applications. This is a major issue that will need to be solved. The most common methods for sterilization of prepackaged, single-use medical devices include exposure to ethylene oxide gas or g-irradiation. Some devices are also sterilized by exposure to heat or steam via dry heat or autoclaving processes, and there are several new methods, including low-temperature gas plasma and vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide [90]. Each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages relating to their efﬁciency in reducing bioburden, tox- icity, convenience and cost; however, in developing a process that can be applied to a complex, multicomponent medical device, the impact of sterilization on all of the materials used must be considered. It has been shown that despite widespread acceptance of conventional sterilizing techniques, all of them may have adverse impacts on the polymers incorporated [90]. Devices such as the implantable parts of the cochlear implant are typically sterilized using ethylene oxide, which is conducted at temperatures lower than 60°C and humid- ity between 30 and 90% [91]. Although g-irradiation is likely to be more convenient and have lower associated toxicity, issues relating to polymer degradation and property changes that can occur following g-sterilization may prevent its more widespread use. Sterilization or disinfection of CPs is not usually conducted prior to testing electrical and mechanical properties. For studies assessing cell interactions in vitro, disinfection is typically carried out using UV light exposure or treatment in 70% ethanol [7,22,27]. In a recent study examining tissue responses to CPs in vivo, implants were elec- trodeposited under sterile conditions and the methods of sterilizing the monomer and dopant solutions were not described [8]. Given that all neuroprosthetic implants need to be terminally sterilized, this is undoubtedly a critical barrier that must be overcome before CPs can be applied in such devices. The major issues that need to be addressed are whether sterilization can be conducted using the same approaches as for the whole device and whether sterilization processes impact on the CP properties. In addition, the issues of persistence of ethylene oxide residuals in CPs and the likely impact of g-irradiation on the polymer properties need to be assessed prior to implementing either of these sterilization methods. Electrical stability Electrode materials have many properties that need to be controlled and the consequence of this is signiﬁcant complexity of design. Unlike passive devices with no electrical function, electrodes need to have well-controlled and stable electrical properties, as well as needing to meet the appropriate physical, mechanical, chemical and biological performance criteria. Most studies have suggested that electroactive polymers have excellent electrical properties in comparison with conventional noble metal conductors. Their high ionic conductivity can contribute to efﬁcient charge transfer, and their high surface area results in very low impedance [9,23,76,85]. Polypyrrole and PEDOT are the most common CPs reported as having potential for application to high-density micro- electrodes [11,12,82]. Several studies have confirmed that PPy poly mer ized in the presence of appropriate dopants has high conduc- tivities of the order of 100 S/cm and signiﬁcantly lower impedance than that reported for metal electrodes [17–19]. Although multiple variables need to be controlled in order to produce a CP that fulﬁls electrical, mechanical and biological performance criteria, it is the choice of dopant that probably has the greatest overall impact on properties. Comparison of the relatively low-toxicity dopants pTS and PSS suggests that the smaller dopant may produce PPy with higher conductivities owing to lower mobility and accessibility of anions with PSS [22]. However, stability of electrical properties over longer term implantation is likely to be poorer in CPs with smaller, more mobile dopants owing to diffusion of the dopant out of the polymer [22,82]. In vivo evaluation of electrical properties was con- ducted following implantation of PPy in the guinea pig cochlea [8]. Impedance studies following implantation in the animal model sug- gested that, over the 2-week implantation period, the impedance did not signiﬁcantly increase. Longer term studies examining electrical properties do not appear to have been pursued. When considering CPs as an alternative or adjunct to metal electrodes, the speciﬁc technical issues that need to be addressed include the ability of the electroactive polymer to maintain stable conductivity and impedance, and to display physical and mechani- cal durability over long-term contact with in vivo conditions com- bined with exposure to stimulation regimens. Questions remain regarding whether CPs can fulﬁll this stringent requirement, and future studies need to expand our understanding of the efﬁcacy of CPs following extended implantation periods combined with active stimulation. Mechanical properties & stability A key design requirement for neural electrodes is that they have appropriate mechanical properties and that they are able to maintain these properties over implant lifetimes. As outlined in the critical design criteria, ideal electrodes need to be adhesive to the underlying electrode and cohesive as well as being conformable, soft and ﬂex- ible. Although CPs have potential to be softer than metals, critical issues that have been identiﬁed in CPs include their brittleness and relatively poor mechanical durability in comparison with metals. This needs to be addressed either via alternate fabrication methods or via composite-based approaches to engineering the electrodes. In a recent review by Ateh et al., it was proposed that properties of CPs such as PPy can be modiﬁed via multiple routes, including the choice of dopant, the synthetic technique and post-synthesis modi- ﬁcation, either via surface modiﬁcation approaches or via electrical stimulation [82]. Additional ﬂexibility in design may be achieved by producing composites of CPs with other polymers, such as selected hydrogels. This approach was proposed by Martins group using CPs grown within polymers, including alginate gels and multiple variants of poly(lactic acid) nanoﬁbers [92,93]. These copolymers are designed to be softer than traditional CP ﬁlms, and, although they were shown to decrease the impedance of the gold electrodes by two orders of magnitude through increasing the charge transfer area [93], the mechanical stiffness was not quantiﬁed. Limited assays exist for the mechanical quantiﬁcation of CP stiffness on microelectrodes and future directions of CP research should address this deﬁcit. www.expert-reviews.com 45 ReviewDevelopment of bioactive conducting polymers for neural interfaces There is a paucity of information in the literature on either in vitro or in vivo mechanical durability of CPs. The potential for both mechanical and chemical degradation mechanisms in these polymers needs to be addressed in order to allay concerns relating to their long-term viability as neural electrodes. An intra-cochlear implantation of PPy-coated electrodes in guinea pigs did not assess the mechanical properties of the coating before and after implantation; however, the ﬁbrous tissue response was variable, which may be related, in part, to variations in the physical and mechanical properties [8]. An in vivo study of a nanocomposite based on nanoparticulate PPy and silicone for peripheral nerve stimulation in cats, suggested acute feasibility of the system, but no long-term data were reported [94]. The latter system is likely to be of high durability, given that the silicone polymer matrix is a common implantable polymer with known material responses in vivo. Before exploitation of these polymers in commercial devices, much needs to be learned relating to their baseline mechanical performance, how it can be optimized and whether this can be translated into satisfactory in vivo performances. Short-term bioactivity in long-term implants All bioactive composite materials face large challenges regard- ing the longevity of their bioactivity. In applications where the biomolecules are chemically bound to the CP surface, it is likely that biodegradation typical of all proteins will reduce the bio- logical efﬁcacy of the composite during chronic implantations. Additionally, in many CP applications, biomolecules require endocytosis and retrograde transport [95] and, as such, will have a period of efﬁcacy determined by the drug-release characteris- tics. As such, all bioactivity provided by functionalized CPs is necessarily ﬁnite. A key challenge in implementing an effective bioactive CP is in being able to use the initial period following implantation to establish a stable interface. Cui et al. have demonstrated that PPy doped with the cell attach- ment ligand, YIGSR, can be used to establish a tight connection between electrodes and cortical neurons within 7 days follow- ing implantation [28]. The anchoring of neurons occurred before encapsulation of the neural probe by ﬁbroblasts and astrocytes, which secured a stable recording for a period of 3 weeks [28]. Richardson et al. have shown that release of NT-3 from PPy can be mediated slowly by diffusion, or at an increased controlled rate by application of electrical stimulation [8]. At the stimulated rate, the NT-3 would be depleted by 21 days with continuous electrical stimulation or slightly longer with 8-h/day stimulation. However, it has also been shown that combined drug delivery and electrical stimulation of neurons, speciﬁcally SGNs in the cochlea, followed by electrical stimulation alone, can promote extended neuron survival beyond the period of drug delivery [96]. It is, therefore, viable that in neuroprosthetic applications, short-term bioactive CPs can be used to establish a stable bio- logical state. It is clear from both of these studies that further evaluation of CP modiﬁed bioelectrodes is required to assess chronic implant performance. The initial period following implantation will be vital to establishing the long-term efﬁcacy of bioactive devices. Preclinical & clinical requirements The safety and efﬁcacy of materials and devices are typically inves- tigated under a structured series of preclinical and clinical tests that must be satisfactorily completed before ﬁnal regulatory evalu- ation is commenced. The relevant international standards in this ﬁeld are the ISO 10993 document titled ‘Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices’. These provide a structured guideline to evalua- tion and testing [97] and a series of standards that outline more spe- ciﬁc testing approaches relevant to various critical host responses and other issues, such as selection of control materials and animal welfare. Part 1 of the series describes general principles that relate to biological performance testing of materials and devices, the classiﬁcation of different devices and, ﬁnally, a guidance of selec- tion of appropriate tests. Generally, devices are classed based on three criteria, including the tissue contacted, the nature of tissue contact and the period or duration of contact. The more criti- cal the application, the higher the level of testing required. CPs used in neural interfacing devices would be categorized as being an implant that has direct tissue contact. The contact duration would vary depending on the device type considered; however, for most applications of relevance to this paper, the duration would be for longer than 30 days, which is considered a permanent implant. For devices in this category, the ISO standard recom- mends, as a minimum, cytotoxicity, sensitization, genotoxicity, implantation, chronic toxicity and carcino genicity tests. Although most regulatory bodies refer to ISO10993, the FDA proposed a modiﬁed matrix that increases the suggested testing requirements for all categories of devices [98]. Thus, the FDA-modiﬁed matrix recommends that, in addition to the aforementioned tests, addi- tional tests, including primary irritation, systemic toxicity and subchronic toxicity, should be considered. Although there are no harmonized global standards for neural prostheses, the FDA provides guidance for industries developing neural prostheses. These include guidance for implantable middle ear hearing devices [99] and the recently released draft guidance for investigational device exemption for retinal prostheses [202]. These guidance documents both indicate the need for meeting speciﬁc regulatory requirements for documenting the materials used and their composition and performance; in particular, their electrical, mechanical and biological speciﬁcations. Chemical composition of the material and mobility of the dop- ant are likely to be issues that need to be addressed in terms of maintenance of electrical properties. Additionally, the impact of charge passage on the composition is also an issue. Polymer mechanics are of great importance, since ideal neuroprosthetic electrodes need to be mechanically stable and cause minimal dam- age to neural tissue. Most CPs tend to be more brittle and friable, potentially resulting in release of particles in vivo. Clearly, all of these issues can also impact on the biological performance, and the relevant biological testing would be expected to evaluate the risk of speciﬁc adverse host responses. As discussed earlier, the potential for immunotoxicity of CPs with biologicals incorporated needs to be evaluated. CPs are also characterized by rough, porous surfaces, which, although beneﬁcial to impedance, may also act as a nidus for infection. Infection of neural prostheses is a concern Expert Rev. Med. Devices 7(1), (2010)46 Review Poole-Warren, Lovell, Baek & Green that came to the fore in 2002, when the FDA received notiﬁca- tions of increased rates of bacterial meningitis in cochlear-implant recipients [203]. Links between infection rate and cochlear-implant design were suggested, and the issue of potential design aspects that could increase likelihood of infection is one that will continue to be closely monitored. Expert commentary Conducting polymers are promising materials for neural inter- facing applications where high-density electrodes are required, such as the bionic eye and new-generation cochlear implants. Their main advantages are the ability to tailor surface topography, which confers not only improved impedance but allows better neural cell interaction, and the ease of modiﬁcation with biologi- cal molecules. The key disadvantages that must be managed are the poor mechanical properties and unstable electrical proper- ties, particularly following modiﬁcation with bioactive molecules. Metal electrodes also suffer from signiﬁcant disadvantages, not least, the limits on charge injection. However, owing to their his- tory of use, and excellent electrical and biological performance in current devices, noble metals and alloys will continue to dominate the neural electrode ﬁeld in the foreseeable future. Conclusion A variety of multifunctional CPs based on PPy and PEDOT are being investigated for neural electrode applications. New com- posite materials show promise for improving CP mechanics, while maintaining superior charge transfer through reduced impedance at the neural interface. Additionally, CP coatings have been used to successfully promote neural attachment and growth through controlled supply of appropriate biomolecules. Future studies will investigate the long-term performance of CPs in implant systems, with a focus on continuous delivery of biologicals to maintain the beneﬁts of CPs for the device lifetime. Five-year view While CPs are not likely to be used in current-generation implant devices, their potential physical and electrical beneﬁts make them a candidate for improving bioelectrode efﬁcacy in the future. For speciﬁc devices, such as the developmental bionic eye, cur- rent electrode technologies using Pt electrodes cannot be signiﬁ- cantly smaller and still deliver the requisite charge. Decreasing the electrode size by an order of magnitude but still maintaining safe and efﬁcacious charge delivery would provide for a huge increase in the visual acuity afforded to the implant recipient. In parallel with other developments, CP-coated electrodes could mediate the evolution of bionic eye implants from being devices that would assist in mobility to being devices that would allow for reading and face recognition. Conducting polymers have material properties to potentially support a next generation of bioelectrode technology, with appli- cation-speciﬁc tailoring of biofunctionality to support long-term cell survival and growth. The immediate future will be critical to investigating CP stability over time and demonstrating that they maintain the requisite mechanical and biological properties as described herein.
