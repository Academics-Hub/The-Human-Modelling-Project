However, our daily activities constantly change either the body’s demands for nutrients and/or place loads on the cardiovascular system which challenge the ability of the heart to generate blood flow as per the body’s needs. To meet these challenges, the cardiovascular system is elegantly designed to accommodate increased requirements for blood flow as well as the varying loads on the cardiovascular system which occur in day-to-day life. Diseases of the cardiovascular system quickly result in an inability to accommodate increased requirements for blood flow as well as the loads on the cardiovascular system which occur in day-to-day life. The consequences of these changes are several clinical symptoms and signs. In order to understand the clinical effects of diseases of the cardiovascular system and the management of these diseases, you need to recognize and understand the situations in which requirements for blood flow are increased, activities during day-to-day life create challenges to the cardiovascular system, and the normal cardiovascular responses to these changes. One aim of this series of practicals is therefore to enhance your knowledge of the situations in which requirements for blood flow are increased, activities during day-to-day life create challenges to the cardiovascular system, and the normal cardiovascular responses to these changes. As future health care professionals it will be your responsibility to diagnose and/or contribute to the care of patients who develop cardiovascular problems such as heart failure or shock. For the effective diagnosis and/or care for patients with these cardiovascular diseases, you will be required to identify abnormalities of function of the cardiovascular system or at least to understand these abnormalities in order to provide effective care. However, assessing the function of the cardiovascular system is not as simple as for example that of the functions of the neurological system, which can be assessed using a wide variety of very simple clinical tests. Indeed, because of the difficulty in imaging the cardiovascular system except through sophisticated technology, the functions of the cardiovascular system are perceived by many to be largely hidden. However, with a sound knowledge of the interpretation of a few simple assessments, it is remarkable how much we can deduce from our patients clinical presentation. However, for you to be effective as practitioners you should become familiar with the deductive reasoning that allows one to form logical clinical decisions based on abnormalities of these simple clinical assessments. This practical session is aimed to familiarize you with these simple assessments of the cardiovascular system including that of auscultation of the heart, the assessment of the electrocardiogram, palpation of the peripheral or cardiac pulses, measurement of blood pressure, and to assist you in interpreting changes in the parameters that you have assessed. Importantly, clinical cases are provided in these practical sessions against which you should compare your findings and answer the questions given. Practical stations: STATION A: Heart sounds and the electrocardiogram. STATION B: Examination of the arterial pulses. B1: Radial pulse. B2: Feet pulses. STATION C: Blood pressure C1: Blood pressure measurement using a stethoscope. C2: Gaining insights into the sounds used to determine blood pressure. C3: Effect of exercise on heart rate and blood pressure. STATION D: Heart rate responses to the Valsalva manoeuvre (video demonstration). STATION A The electrocardiogram The careful examination of electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings is essential to any clinical assessment and to the development of management strategies for cardiovascular disease. It is an indispensable tool to assess cardiovascular risk (the risk of heart attacks, strokes, or heart failure). Moreover, it is the only appropriate method of assessing rhythm disturbances of the heart (electrical disturbances or arrhythmias) or the presence of heart attacks that require interventions. Although electrocardiograms provide accurate measurements, there is no doubt that skill and understanding are required to interpret electrocardiograms appropriately. This skill is sadly diminishing, largely because undergraduates believe that they will miraculously imbibe the knowledge over time without gaining an early understanding. This station is designed to give you an opportunity to gain an early understanding of electrocardiography. Weak electrical activity in the heart is initiated by spontaneous depolarisation at the sino-atrial (S-A) node which generates the P wave of the ECG. The electrical activity associated with the P wave is subsequently transmitted as a wave of depolarisation throughout the heart (from the atria to the ventricles). The atrio-ventricular (A-V) node, located within the lower inter-atrial septum, relays the impulse from the atria to the ventricles, but because the A-V node conducts electrical activity very slowly a delay in electrical events occurs, which results in a delay before the next ECG change. The ECG change that corresponds with this delay in the A-V node is the P-Q interval (often simply called the P-R interval as there is not much difference between the two). After the impulse passes through the A-V node, it enters the fibre tract known as the common bundle or the bundle of His, which is located in the ventricular septum. The bundle of His is a short pathway which subdivides into right and left bundle branches. Once electrical activity occurs in the bundle branches of the ventricular septum, strong electrical activity is recorded by the ECG and this is called the QRS complex. As the ventricles start repolarising the T wave of the ECG is recorded. Heart sounds and the cardiac cycle Cardiac auscultation (listening to the sounds generated by the heart) is an essential component of any medical examination. A number of abnormalities of heart sounds are a key indication to cardiovascular pathology. For example, in patients with cardiac valve diseases the normal sounds generated by the valves of the heart are often louder or softer than normal, while additional sounds generated by turbulence are indicative of abnormal blood flow. These abnormal sounds (cardiac murmurs) are useful to identify the presence and often the cause of valvular heart disease or of other structural cardiac diseases that may occur through congenital cardiac defects. Furthermore, in any form of heart failure, additional sounds are often heard when listening to the heart, sounds generated by the turbulence of blood flow caused by rapid filling of the ventricles of the heart (due to the high ventricular filling pressures). It is therefore important that you are able to identify normal heart sounds and that you become familiar with the mechanisms of these sounds and how they relate to the cardiac cycle. It is also important that you are able to apply your knowledge of heart sounds and the normal cardiac cycle to identifying valve disease. In this regard, your ability to time heart sounds will determine how effective you are at identifying the period of the cardiac cycle in which abnormal heart sounds occur, and hence your ability to identify the causes of the abnormal heart sounds. STATION A 1. Make sure the PowerLab is connected and turned on. 2. Connect the cardio microphone to Input 1 on the PowerLab. You will use it later in the lab. 3.

Electrode placement  Remove any jewellery from the volunteer's wrists and ankles.  Use a pen to mark a small cross where each electrode will be placed on the volunteer's right and left wrists, and right leg. Lightly abrade the skin with abrasive gel and clean the area with alcohol swabs.  Snap the electrode cables onto some disposable ECG electrodes.  Attach the disposable electrodes to the prepared areas on the volunteer's wrists and leg: • Place the positive electrode on the left wrist. • Place the negative electrode on the right wrist. • Place the ground electrode on the right leg. Figure 1: Connecting the Finger pulse transducer, Cardio microphone and ECG connections to the PowerLab. Procedure 1. Ask the volunteer to relax and not move. This will minimize signal artifacts due to movement. 2. Select Start to record. 3. Enter the volunteer’s name into the Comment panel, and select Add. 4. Use the Auto Scale or compression buttons to ensure that you can see the data as it is being recorded. 5. If the ECG cannot be seen, check that all the electrodes are correctly attached. If the signal is noisy and indistinct, make sure that the volunteer is relaxed. Consider using alternative attachment positions. 6. When you achieve a good signal, record for about 15 s then select Stop. Figure 2: Example of the ECG and PCG recordings. Analysis of an ECG  Use the compression buttons and the scroll bar to review the data obtained so you can see two regularly occurring ECG cycles.  To measure the amplitude of the P wave, place the Marker on the baseline immediately before the P wave. Then position the point selector on the peak of the P wave.  The ECG amplitude will be displayed in the value panel. Enter the amplitude into the table.  To measure the duration of the P wave, leave the Marker at the beginning of the wave and position the point selector at the end of the wave.  The time will be displayed in the value panel. Enter the time in milliseconds into the table.  Repeat steps 2–5 for the QRS complex, and the T wave. Answer the questions that follow. 1. In your resting standard II lead ECG recording identify the wave that corresponds with: i) atrial depolarisation. ii) ventricular depolarisation. iii) ventricular repolarisation. 2. From your colleague’s resting ECG recording calculate the following: i) heart rate. ii) duration of P-R interval. iii) duration of systole. iv) duration of diastole. 3. Estimate the time taken for conduction to occur from the SA node to the Purkinje fibres. 4. The following ECG recording was obtained from a patient with a disorder of the A-V node (a disorder called “heart block”). Explaining your answer indicate the changes on the ECG recording that suggest that partial blockade of the A-V node has occurred. Add on heart sounds To see the relationship between ECG events and heart sounds, you will use the cardio microphone to record the phonocardiogram (PCG) or heart sounds of a resting volunteer. In this added activity, you will record a peripheral pulse wave, and then examine how it relates to the ECG and PCG traces. Procedure  Using a stethoscope on the left side of the volunteer's chest, listen to find the best position. When this position has been found, ask the volunteer to place the cardio microphone over this area.  There are two ways to ensure the cardio microphone is held firmly in place:  A strap around the chest can be used. Note: The volunteer should not hold it in place on the chest wall by hand as movement of the hand will introduce considerable noise artefacts into the recording.  Select Start to record the ECG and PCG. If you cannot see distinct heart sounds, ask the volunteer to move the cardio microphone until the best possible PCG is recorded.  When you achieve a good signal, record for about 15 s then select Stop.  Now place a stethoscope bell rather than diaphragm (to block out peripheral noise) on the chest wall over the mitral region, using the diagram on the next page to assist you.  Carefully listen to the sounds that are being recorded by the microphone and compare what you can hear to that which is being recorded and displayed on the screen. Figure 3: Regions of the chest where sounds emanating from the heart are heard best. Analysis of heart sound  Use the compression buttons and the scroll bar to clearly view two cardiac cycles in your data.  Place the Marker in the ECG channel on the peak of the R wave.

Provide physiological explanations for these signs in patient B. Ankles 4. The folder below contains different heart sounds and murmurs in mp3 format. Listen to the heart sounds and draw a tracing for each. Heart sounds and murmurs.zip Jugular venous pulse STATION B Examination of the arterial pulses The detection and examination of the rate and character of peripheral pulses, including the radial pulse, is essential to diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases. For example, when assessing blood pressure, you will be required to first identify the pressure at which the radial pulse disappears as the blood pressure cuff is inflated (see later for the reasons). Further, in patients who are in shock or in heart failure, the pulse may be of a low volume and very rapid and these signs enhance your ability to diagnose and manage these patients. In patients with electrical disturbances of the heart (arrhythmias) the pulse may be slow, rapid, or irregular and in patients with diseases of large arteries to the legs, the pulses noted in the feet (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses), are markedly reduced if not absent. The present practical will therefore provide an opportunity for you to assess your ability to detect arterial pulses (the radial, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses), to assess the rate and characteristics of the radial pulse and to better understand the factors that contribute toward the character and the rate of a radial pulse. In order to assess the character and the rate of the radial pulse of your colleague, you should perform the following tasks at STATION B-1 - Your colleague should be seated with one arm resting on the bench. - Place your second and third finger firmly over the radial artery as shown in the photograph provided at the station. - Determine the pulse rate by counting the pulsations for a full minute as well as for 5 seconds. Time the period using the stopwatches provided. - Record the number of pulsations in a minute ……………………………………………….. in 5 seconds ……………………………………………… - Record your colleagues heart rate expressed as beats per minute ………………………………………………………………………….. Answer the questions that follow. 1. Assuming a resting cardiac output of 5.8 L/min, calculate your colleague’s stroke volume. 2. From the calculations performed above, give reasons to indicate whether it is appropriate to determine heart rate from 5 second recordings. In order to detect the pulses in the leg of your colleague, you should perform the following tasks at STATION B-2 - Your colleague is to remove shoes and socks in order that you may detect these pulses. Your colleague should also be lying down. - To identify the dorsalis pedis pulse and the posterior tibial artery pulse place your first two fingers over these arteries as depicted in the photographs provided at the station. Answer the questions that follow. A 72-year-old man who had smoked heavily all of his life developed pain in his calf muscles when he walked. On examination he was noted to have an ulcer on the heel of his foot similar to that shown in the photograph. Further special studies showed the images on the right below. Also shown below is a photograph of what his aorta was assumed to look like. Atheroma (lipid deposition and other changes) of the wall of his aorta and femoral arteries was thought to be the cause. 1. Giving reasons for your answer, indicate what you think that the character of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses would be in the patient above. 2. Give a physiological explanation for the patient’s calf pain experienced when walking. STATION C Blood pressure Considering that between 20-40% of all adults have an elevated blood pressure (hypertension) and hypertension is a major risk factor for many forms of cardiac disease (ischaemic heart disease [heart disease caused by damage to coronary vessels], systolic heart failure and diastolic heart failure) and other forms of vascular disease (strokes, and peripheral vascular disease), the measurement of blood pressure is essential to diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, an important measurement for detecting the presence and assessing the severity of shock is that of the measurement of blood pressure. In contrast to the many other skills that you are required to gain in clinical medicine, the assessment of blood pressure is possibly that which is performed the most poorly by all groups including future medical practitioners, nurses, etc. Indeed, so little care is taken in the measurement of blood pressure that junior hospital staff have been known to fabricate measurements with obvious consequences for patients. Hence, you should use the present practical to familiarize yourselves with the techniques of appropriate blood pressure measurement, the interpretation of the sounds one hears when recording a blood pressure, and the interpretation of changes in blood pressure. STATION C-1 Blood pressure measurement Blood pressure is most commonly determined by an indirect auscultatory method using a sphygmomanometer which consists of an inflatable cuff attached to a mercury manometer (see sphygmomanometers at station C-1). The general principle behind blood pressure measurement by auscultation is that the cuff is inflated until the radial pulse disappears (i.e. the cuff pressure exceeds that of systolic blood pressure, thus causing the artery to collapse and blood flow to stop) (see Figure 4b). Thereafter the pressure in the cuff is slowly reduced and the pressure at which the blood flow re- occurs is noted (see Figure 4c). This is an approximation of systolic blood pressure. The cuff is then re-inflated to approximately 20 mm Hg above this pressure and then a stethoscope is placed over the brachial artery in the cubital fossa and the blood pressure is determined by listening for sound waves as follows. The sound waves (called Korotkoff sounds) are generated by the blood as it passes through the constriction in the artery (see Figure 4c). Sound waves are produced whenever blood flow is turbulent (i.e. as a consequence of artery constriction). Because systolic pressure is the highest vascular pressure, the first reappearance of a sound (1st Korotkoff sound) is associated with systolic blood pressure (i.e. the pressure inside the artery which is sufficient to cause opening of the artery against the external pressure of the cuff) (Figure 4c). The pressure exerted by the cuff at that instant is read in mm Hg from the mercury column of the sphygmomanometer. As the pressure in the cuff is reduced even further the sounds will disappear once blood flow becomes laminar (ie. no longer turbulent and hence no sound generated) (Figure 4d). The pressure at which the sounds disappear (5th Korotkoff sound) is taken as the diastolic blood pressure (ie. the pressure in the artery which is sufficient to prevent the cuff from constricting the artery at all). Figure 4: Measurement of blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer. In order to assess the blood pressure of your colleague using standard (conventional) auscultatory techniques, you should perform the following tasks at STATION C-1 - Your colleague should be seated with one arm resting on the bench. - Study the photographs provided that indicate the steps you should take to measure a blood pressure. - The most appropriate method of placing the cuff attached to the sphygmomanometer on the arm of your colleague is indicated in the photographs. - Sit opposite your colleague as indicated. - Hold the bulb of the sphygmomanometer as indicated. - Palpate the radial pulse with your free hand and inflate the cuff of the sphygmomanometer until the radial pulse disappears. The mercury column value at which the radial pulse disappears, indicates the estimated systolic blood pressure (SBP). - Deflate the cuff until it is empty of air. - Place the bell (smaller part of the head) of the stethoscope over the brachial artery at the cubital fossa (front of elbow). - Inflate the cuff to approximately 20 mm Hg above the estimated SBP. - Allow the pressure in the cuff to fall slowly (approximately 2 mm Hg per second) using the release valve on the pump. - As the cuff is gradually deflated a series of sounds are heard through the stethoscope. These are known as the Korotkoff sounds. - The cuff pressure at which a sound is first heard is the SBP (1st Korotkoff sound). . The sound becomes more continuous (2nd Korotkoff sound). · The sound becomes progressively louder (3rd Korotkoff sound). · The sound becomes muffled (4th Korotkoff sound). · The sound disappears (5th Korotkoff sound). - The diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is more accurately taken as the onset of the 4th Korotkoff sound. However the 5th Korotkoff sound is more commonly used because it can be defined more readily. - Record your colleagues Systolic blood pressure............................................ (mm Hg) Diastolic blood pressure............................................ (mm Hg) Answer the questions that follow. 1. Is your colleague’s blood pressure within normal limits? 2. Calculate your colleague’s pulse pressure (mm Hg), using the equation: Pulse pressure = SBP – DBP 3. Calculate your colleague’s mean arterial pressure (mm Hg), using the equation: Mean arterial pressure = DBP + ⅓ pulse pressure 4. What are some possible sources of error or variation in this technique of blood pressure measurement? 5. A 52-year-old women with a long history of high cholesterol levels and uncontrolled hypertension, suddenly developed central, crushing chest pain. The following images show her coronary arteries before (left panel) and after (right panel) infusion of a substance that degrades thrombi (thrombolytic agent). The arrows point to the position within the coronary artery where a stenosis was noted. The stenosis was caused by thrombus formation within the artery produced by the presence of atheroma in the coronary artery. She was diagnosed as having had a “heart attack” (myocardial infarction, which means death to the myocardium caused by a reduction in blood flow through the coronary arteries). Her blood pressure and heart rate before and after infusion of the thrombolytic agent are given below. Before thrombolytic After thrombolytic Blood pressure (mm Hg) 86/72 126/88 Heart rate (beats/min) 126 72 STATION C-2 Gaining insights into the sounds used to determine blood pressure (using a cardio microphone). As it is often difficult when assessing blood pressure for the first time to recognize the sounds that you use to assess blood pressure (the Korotkoff sounds), you will also be given the opportunity to assess blood pressure using a technique that records these sounds using a microphone. Thus, if with a stethoscope you have been unable to identify the turbulent sounds created in-between systolic and diastolic blood pressure as the cuff is deflated, you will find the following task enlightening. Setup  Use the same volunteer as for the manual auscultatory technique.  Connect the pressure transducer to Input 1 on the PowerLab.  Ensure the pressure transducer is attached to the sphygmomanometer cuff.  Wrap the sphygmomanometer cuff around the upper arm of your volunteer, just above the elbow.  Connect the cardio microphone to Input 2. In the following activities you will place the cardio microphone over the brachial artery. Figure 5: Connecting the pressure transducer and cardio microphone to the PowerLab Procedure  Ensure the cardio microphone is positioned over the brachial artery and held in place with a Velcro strap.  Select start to record.  Inflate the cuff to 30mmHg higher than the estimated systolic pressure.  Slowly reduce the pressure in the cuff (2-3 mmHg/s).  Deflate the cuff completely after the pressure has fallen below 50 mmHg or after the disappearance of the Korotkoff sounds. Enter slow into the Comment panel and then select Add.  Select stop.  Allow 1-2 minutes for recovery.  Repeat the procedure on the same volunteer, but modify the speed at which you release the pressure cuff. Enter medium and fast into the comment panel, and select Add when deflating the respective speeds. Analyses  Scroll to the comment \"slow”.  Place the point selector on the first Korotkoff sound (the first clear spike in the series).  Enter the value from the ‘Pressure Channel’ into the table below (this is the systolic pressure).  Place the pointer selector on the last clear spike in the series.  Enter the value from the ‘Pressure Channel’ into the table below (this is the diastolic pressure). Note: Diastole may be hard to detect. Sometimes you need to estimate the trend of the decreasing spikes. Answer the questions that follow 1. Compare the SBP and DBP values obtained on your colleague with the finger pulse transducer with those obtained when using the auscultatory technique. 2. Give a physiological explanation for the generation of Korotkoff sounds. STATION C-3 Effect of exercise on heart rate and blood pressure The inability to accommodate increased requirements for blood flow in cardiovascular disease will reflect in blood pressure changes during exercise. Thus, in the following practical you will be given the opportunity to measure your heart rate and blood pressure before and after exercise, compare it with data obtained in a patient with cardiac disease, and understand the differences noted. In order to assess the effect of exercise on blood pressure in your colleague, you should perform the following tasks at STATION C-3 - Measure the resting heart rate as described in STATION A. - Measure resting blood pressure using the technique described at STATION C. - Ask your colleague to either run on the spot or run up and down the stairs a few times until they are visibly breathing more rapidly. - Calculate your colleague’s pulse rate in beats per minute before and after exercise as determined from the 5 second recordings. - Before exercise…………………………………………………………… - After exercise……………………………………………………………… - Ask your colleague to run on the spot again. - Record your colleague’s blood pressure using an automated blood pressure machine Before exercise ……………………………………………….. (mm Hg) After exercise ………………………………………………… (mm Hg) Answer the questions that follow 1. Give a physiological mechanism to explain the change in pulse rate in your colleague after exercise. 2. Give a physiological mechanism to explain the change in the force (volume) of the pulse in your colleague after exercise. 3. Indicate how the pulse rate change and the physiological changes responsible for the alteration in the force of the pulse with exercise may contribute toward maintaining body homeostasis during exercise. 4. The following table describes the pulse characteristics of a patient with cardiac disease before and after moderate exercise similar to that performed by your colleague. The patient was unable to tolerate the exercise and quickly stopped. Before exercise After exercise Pulse rate (beats/minute) 116 176 Volume of the pulse Reduced Modest increase with exercise Give physiological explanations for the patient’s a) resting heart rate as compared to your colleagues. b) inability to tolerate the exercise that your colleague easily completed. 5. Provide a physiological explanation for your colleague’s change in blood pressure from rest to exercise. 6. The following gives the blood pressures of a patient with aortic stenosis before and after moderate exercise similar to that performed by your colleague. Before exercise After exercise Systolic BP (mm Hg) 162 164 Diastolic BP (mm Hg) 36 38 Give physiological explanations for the patient’s lack of change in blood pressure as compared to the change in blood pressure noted in your colleague, assuming that both managed to do the same amount of exercise. STATION D The Valsalva manoeuvre The Valsalva manoeuvre involves a deep inspiration, followed by closure of the glottis and a forced expiration, typical changes that may occur when straining on the toilet. If this is difficult to understand, then imagine what you would do to clear your ears when you change altitude (such as driving down a mountainside) and you struggle to hear. If you have done this before you would hold your nose, take a deep breath and blow through your nose whilst holding it closed. This leads to a rise in intrathoracic pressure which initiates changes in blood pressure and hence heart rate. Physiologically, the Valsalva manoeuvre occurs as a component of defaecation, but also occurs in, for example, trumpet players and weight-lifters. The response to the Valsalva manoeuvre can be divided into four phases (see below). Phase I: At the start of the strain, the increased intrathoracic pressure adds to the pressure of the blood in the aorta, resulting in a sudden rise in blood pressure. (A small decrease in heart rate also occurs due to stimulation of aortic baroreceptors and hence activation of parasympathetic nervous system [PNS] and inhibition of sympathetic nervous system [SNS]). Phase II: The raised intrathoracic pressure compresses the veins, decreasing venous return to the right side of the heart, as a result, cardiac output falls and is followed by a drop in blood pressure and pulse pressure. This drop in blood pressure decreases the firing of the aortic and carotid sinus baroreceptors which via activation of the SNS causes an increase in heart rate (tachycardia) and a rise in peripheral resistance. Phase III: When the glottis is opened, the intrathoracic pressure returns to normal; blood pressure drops further as pressure on the aorta is suddenly removed. Phase IV: With the decrease in intrathoracic pressure back to normal, venous return and hence cardiac output is restored. The increase in cardiac output raises the blood pressure which stimulates the baroreceptors causing an inhibition of the SNS and activation of the PNS, hence heart rate decreases back to normal, or slightly less than normal (slight bradycardia). Activity - Look at the video showing heart rate responses to the Valsalva manoeuvre. Answer the questions that follow 1. Selecting two beats that typify the recordings at that time period, determine the heart rate a) at baseline b) during the Valsalva manoeuvre c) after the Valsalva manoeuvre has been stopped. 2. Explain the differences in the heart rate during and after the Valsalva manoeuvre as compared to baseline. 3. A 16-year-old who complained of shortness of breath with exercise was admitted to hospital for investigation. On examination he was noted to have pulmonary oedema (crackles in the bases of his lungs) and signs of infective endocarditis (infection of the valves of the heart such as that shown in the photograph below), including a cardiac murmur. He underwent cardiac catheterisation to measure the pressures in his heart and these values are listed below. His chest X-Ray (roentogram) obtained whilst on treatment is compared with that of a normal person’s X-Ray on the next page. The patient was diagnosed with aortic incompetence. Patient Normal LV systolic pressure (mm Hg) 162 120-140 LV diastolic pressure (mm Hg) 26 8-12 Left atrial pressure (mm Hg) 18-32 8-12 Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 162 120-140 Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 36 80-90 LV= left ventricle When asked to perform the Valsalva manoeuvre the patient quickly became dizzy. Give a physiological explanation for the patient’s responses to the Valsalva manoeuvre. 4. The following image shows a blood pressure recording obtained from a patient with chronic, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus whilst the patient was performing the Valsalva manoeuvre. A diagnosis of damage to the autonomic nervous system was made, caused by the deleterious effects of raised glucose concentrations on nerves. The scale indicated on the left of 0 to 100 is in mm Hg. Explaining your answer indicate whether the component of the autonomic nervous system that has been damaged in the patient, is likely to be the parasympathetic or the sympathetic component.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
