Dose • Radiation Detection • Tomographic Imaging – SPECT – PET What is Nuclear Medicine? • Diagnostic and therapeutic use of radioactivity in the treatment of patients – Diagnostic = studying structures and processes to diagnose disease – Therapeutic = using radioactivity to destroy deleterious tissues in the body (e.g. cancer) • Aim to determine the distribution of administered radiopharmaceutical in the patient Physics Review • The nucleus is the source of energy for the radiations used in nuclear medicine – Element = classification of a substance according to atomic number (106 elements) – Nuclide = classification according to atomic number and number of neutrons (1300 nuclides) – Isotopes = nuclides with the same atomic number (i.e. same no. of protons) (e.g. 12 C and 13 C) • Radio-isotopes = isotopes that are radioactive – Isomers = nuclei with the same proton-neutron composition but different energy (higher energy is metastable) (e.g. 99m Tc and 99 Tc) Physics Review • Radioactivity is the result of the decay of unstable parent nuclei into more stable daughter nuclei • Nuclear stability varies – Unstable (cannot exist as intact nuclei) – Meta-stable (temporarily stable with t 1/2 > 10 -6 s and radioactive) – Stable (non-radioactive) • Spontaneous radioactive transitions of nuclei result in the release of radiation energy • Typically 100 – 500 keV in nuclear medicineRelative energy unstable meta-stable stable Physics ReviewPhysics Review • Types of radioactive decay – Alpha (α) • 4 He nuclei • barely penetrate a piece of paper – Beta (β) • electrons (e - ) or positrons (e + ) • penetrate a few millimeters of aluminium – Gamma (γ) • high-energy photons (1 MeV – 1 GeV) • penetrate several centimeters of lead • SI Unit: becquerel (Bq) or decay/sec λ h c h fE == Physics Review • Photons emitted from a radioactive source are stochastic (random) events with respect to both location and time • For large numbers of radioactive nuclei, the rate of radioactive decay in a sample is proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei (first-order kinetics) N d t d N λ−= t eNN λ− = 0 )2l n ( )2l n ( 2 1 τ λ ==t and Physics Review • The patient’s biology introduces its own half-life, by eliminating the drug at some clearance rate • The effective half-life of the radiopharmaceutical is the combination of both processes (physical and

source of error and limitation of precision in the measurement of radioactivity • To reduce noise to acceptable levels, requires certain combinations of activity and acquisition times (determined by the specific imaging parameters) nn ± counts t n t n ± count rate Radiation Dose • ALARA – as low as reasonably achievable • Absorbed dose = energy of ionising radiation absorbed per unit mass of tissue – Measured in Gray (Gy) or “radiation absorbed dose” (rad) • Equivalent dose = the absorbed dose modified by a factor accounting for the effectiveness of the radiation in producing biological damage – Measured in sievert (Sv) or “Rontgen equivalent man” (rem) • Used to predict deleterious biological effects Radiation Detection • Radioactive materials are used as biological tracers inside the body which then emit signals (γ-rays) to detectors outside the body indicating anatomic and physiologic information • Unlike in x-ray imaging, where differential attenuation of the x-rays is responsible for image formation, attenuation of photons in nuclear imaging degrades the image, introducing artifacts, distortions and inaccurate quantitation • Attenuation compensation is necessary Radiation Detection • The radioactive nuclide chosen must emit γ- rays with energy between 20 and 700 keV to be adequately detected outside the body • E.g. 99m Tc emits 140 keV γ–rays, has a short half-life of 6 hours, is relatively safe (only emits photons) and can be incorporated into a variety of compounds and drugs – E.g. 99m Tc-MDP in bone scanning Radiation Detection • The Technetium-99m generator – Molybdenum-99 • From fission of highly-enriched-Uranium at Pelindaba • Long half-life (66 hours) allows for travel • Adsorbed onto column of Aluminium beads – Technetium-99m • Short half-life (6 hours) keeps patient exposure low • Eluted from column using saline – Use Bateman Equations to predict elution patterns (e.g. 99 Mo- 99m Tc transient equilibrium) Radiation Detection • Gamma Camera Collimator Scintillation crystal Photomultiplier tubes Gamma radiation Rest of circuitry Philips Axis gamma camera in Nuclear Medicine at the Donald Gordon with David Starfield’s apparatus Radiation Detection • Collimator – Placed between the patient and the scintillation crystal – Blocks out γ-rays not travelling perpendicular to the plane of the crystal and focuses the radiation – Provides 1:1 positional correspondence between γ-ray interactions in the scintillation crystal and their origin in the human body Radiation Detection • Collimator – Compromise between sensitivity (how much radiation reaches the crystal) and resolution (image clarity) • thick septa for medium energy radiation • thin septa for low energy radiation – Examples of geometry • parallel multi-hole collimator – most commonly used – composed of small straight cylinders separated by lead or tungsten septa (thickness determines range of energy absorption) • pin-hole and converging collimators magnify the image • diverging collimators reduce the image • Scintillation crystals – High density and atomic number – Alkali-halide (e.g. NaI) – Energy absorbed from γ–rays excites electrons to higher energy levels, which then release this energy in the form of light γ-ray light NaI crystal Radiation Detection • Photomultiplier tubes – Incident light causes electrons to be released from the photo-sensitive surface (cathode) of the photomultiplier tube – Electrons are accelerated to the first dynode, absorbed, multiplied and ejected to the next dynode – Amplification process results in an electrical signal at the anode that is proportional to the amount and energy of γ-radiation received photo-sensitive layer dynodes light electrons γ-ray Radiation Detection • Photomultiplier tubes – Array of PM tubes – PM tubes closest to where γ-ray strikes scintillation crystal detect greatest intensity and allow localisation of the γ-ray Radiation Detection Collimator Scintillation crystal Photomultiplier tubes Gamma radiation Rest of circuitryScientific Reports, Nature https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49130-z Radiation Detection • Pre-amplifier – Matches the impedance of the detector with the amplifier to prevent distortion and attenuation of the signal • Amplifier – Increases signal size by a linear or logarithmic ‘gain’ • Pulse Height Analyser – Rejects signal below a certain voltage threshold – The size of the voltage pulse from the photomultiplier tube is proportional to the energy deposited in the crystal – Provides a means of discounting Compton Scattered γ-rays • Display – Illustrates spatial distribution of radioactive intensity in grey-scale Collimator and Detector PreAmp Amplifier PHA Display Tomographic Imaging • Conventional nuclear medicine creates planar, projection images • Tomography is imaging by sections • Radiation emitted from a radiopharmaceutical distributed in the patient is registered by external detectors positioned at different orientations • The distribution of radioactivity is estimated by back projection methods • Attenuation compensation is necessary • SPECT and PET object slices projection SPECT • Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography – Tomographic images computed from the registration of interactions of individual γ-rays in a crystal – Longitudinal-section SPECT • original, research use • superposition of data from multiple views leads to multiple images and therefore blurring of all objects except those at the plane defined by the junction of the viewing areas of the detector • a source of radiation can be located in 3D within the patient SPECT – Transverse-section SPECT • current, clinical use • employs a rotating detector (Gamma Camera) and stationary source (patient) • continuous motion or “step and shoot” modes • projection data acquired and similar reconstruction algorithms to CT • a SPECT image represents the distribution of radioactivity across a slice through the patient Sprawls PET • Positron Emission Tomography – Production of tomographic images by detection of annihilation photons released during positron decay – Positrons emitted by certain radionuclides travel only a short distance in a tissue (a few millimeters) before contacting an electron and being annihilated – 2 photons with energy from 511 keV are emitted in opposite directions – Note: angle not always 180º – Positron emitters (e.g. 11 C, 13 N, 15 O, 18 F (dominant, half-life ~ 110 min)) have very short half-lives (in the order of seconds, minutes, a few days) and are produced in a cyclotron k gm e 3 1 1 01.9 − ×= − Cq e 1 9 1 06.1 − ×−= − 2 m cE = 18 1 03 − ×= m sc PET – The patient is surrounded by a ring of detectors and when detectors on opposite sides of the patient register annihilation photons simultaneously (within 10 -9 s), it is assumed that a positron decay process occurred along a line of response between the detectors – Many lines of response are acquired and the image is calculated by filtered back-projection – Uncertainty in which events occurred simultaneously if more than one, and distance travelled by positron before decay, introduce error into the image Cross-sections through PET scanner β + ring of detectors patient γ-ray γ-ray β + β + PET – Attenuation correction using a transmission scan aids artifact reduction – ‘Time of flight PET’ allows the determination of where on the line of response the event occurred, within a margin of error, allowing better localisation – Several detector rings can be used to acquire multiple image slices – PET images provide physiologic and metabolic information – tumor identification and localisation – Co-registration of images with CT or MRI for anatomic information References • Bronzino,
