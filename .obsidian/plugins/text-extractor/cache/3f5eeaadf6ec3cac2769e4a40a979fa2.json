Then a one -poin t calibration defines the calibration curve that plots output versus input. •If the linearity is unkno wn, •a two -point calib ration is needed •These tw o points and the zero point should be plotted to ensure linearity 3 Prof. Vered Aharonson 2018 Calibration Curves (a) one -point calibration (b) tw o -point calibration (a) (b) Output Input Output Input Prof. Vered Aharonson 2018 4 Calibration Curves issues •If the resulting curve is nonline ar, •many points should be measured and plotted to ob tain the calibration curve. •If the output cannot be set to zero for zero inp ut, •For linear instrumentation: measuremen ts should be performed at zero and full scale •for non -linear instruments: measurements should be performed at more points for nonlinear instruments. •Example: Calibration curves for tempe rature measurement instruments should be ob tained at several expected tempe ratures to determine tempe rature drift of the zero point and the gain. Prof. Vered Aharonson 2018 5 Example: BP calibration •Instrumen ts have “Calibrate ” or “Service ” mode •EC G and Invasive Blood pressure connections are made on Non Invasive Blood Pressure monitoring system, for calibratio n. •The target pressure is changed in increments of 10 mmHg. •Some “Start Test ” Key is presse d -> A BP Pump starts delivering air to the system. •Results are sho wn at the display (u sually w ith “prin t ” op tion) •Results example: •Pressure So urce Target Pressure: 60 mmHg •Measured Pressure: 61.5 mmHg •Overpressure Relief Pressure: 347 mmHg Prof. Vered Aharonson 2018 6 Measu rements Presentation (review) •Mean •A condensed w ay to report an e stimate of a value x based on n measuremen ts of x. •The simplest statistic is the estimated sample mean where i = 1 , 2 ,…n. 7 n x x i  = Prof. Vered Aharonson 2018 Measu rements Presentation •Standard Deviation •A measure of the spread of data about the mean is the estimated sample standard de viation •Used w ith the mean for symmetric distributions of nume rical data. 8 1 )( 2 − −=  n xxs i Prof. Vered Aharonson 2018 Standard deviation of the mean •Standard deviation of the mean, sometime s called standard error of the mean (SEM) •Expresses the expected variability among the means in future samples, •whereas the standard de viation describes the variability to be expected amo ng individua ls in future samples. 9 n s s x = Prof. Vered Aharonson 2018 Measu rements Distribution •Probability Distribution Function (PDF) = a function describ ing the spread (distribution) of data •may be rectangular, skew ed, Gaussian, o r other. •The Gaussian PDF: where μis th e true me an and σis the true standard deviation of a very large number of measurements. 10   2)( )2/()( 22 −− = X eXf Prof. Vered Aharonson 2018 The Gaussian PDF Frequency Population standard deviation  Estimated mean x s standard deviation s x d a x + −  Mean 11 Prof. Vered Aharonson 2018 Poisson PDF •The Poisson PDF can describ e, among other th ings, the probability of radioactive decay e vents, ce lls flo win g through a counter, or the incidence of light pho tons. •The probability that a particular number of events K will occur in a measurement (or during a time) having an average number of events m is •The standard de viation of the Poisson distribution is 12 !),( K memKp Km− = m Prof. Vered Aharonson 2018 Poisson PDF •A typical Poisson distribution for m = 3 . 13 0.2 0.1 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 p K x x x x x x Prof. Vered Aharonson 2018 Error Types 1) Instrumental limitations •Any measuring device can only be used to measure with a ce rtain degree of resolution.
