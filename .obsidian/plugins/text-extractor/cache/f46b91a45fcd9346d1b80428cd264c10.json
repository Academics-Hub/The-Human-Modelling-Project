Transposition is therefore a possible solution to undesired induced e.m.f. •rate of change of the current in the primary circuit influences the induced e.m.f in direct proportionality. •loop geometry of the coupling circuit can be manipulated to minimise the induced e.m.f. •The negative sign of the induced e.m.f. represents the polarity of the emf relative to that of the primary circuit.
