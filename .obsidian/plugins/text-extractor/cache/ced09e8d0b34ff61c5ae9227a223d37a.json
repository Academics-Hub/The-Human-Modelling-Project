The junction between the foregut and the midgut is known a the anterior intestinal portal while the junction between the midgut and the hindgut is called the posterior intestinal portal The derivatives of the foregut  Pharynx  Oesophagus  Stomach  Proximal duodenum  Liver  Pancreas Blood supply Foregut- Celiac artery Midgut- Superior mesenteric artery Hindgut- Inferior mesenteric artery The primitive gutThe primitive gutThe primitive gut Hiatus/Hiatal hernia Rotation of the stomachRotation of the stomachRotation of the stomach Rotation of the stomachRotation of the stomach Dorsal and ventral mesogastriumGreater omentumGreater omentumDuodenum Duodenum development Liver developmentLiver development Liver developmentLiver development Dorsal and ventral mesogastriumDorsal and ventral mesogastrium Pancreatic developmentPancreatic developmentPancreatic developmentPancreatic development Annular pancreas  Initially the ventral pancreatic bud consists of two components that normally fuse before they migrate towards the dorsal pancreatic bud.  If the two components fail to fuse the right portion of the ventral bud migrates along its normal route but the left part will migrate in the opposite direction.  Therefore the duodenum will be surrounded by pancreatic tissue which constricts the duodenum. Annular pancrease Pancreatic development  The Islets of Langerhan (the endocrine portion) of the pancrease will develop from its parenchyma in the third month of gestation.  Insulin production becomes evident during the fifth month.  The connective tissue which surrounds the pancreas is derived from splanchnic mesoderm Primary intestinal loopPrimary intestinal loop Midgut Proximal and Distal limbs • Proximal develops into the distal part of duodenum, jejenum, proximal part of ileum • Distal develops into the distal part of ileum, cecum, appendix, ascending colon and proximal 2/3 of tranverse colon Physiological Umbilical herniation Primary intestinal loop Physiological Umbilical herniationPhysiological Umbilical herniationMidgut developmentMidgut developmentMidgut development Exomphalos If the midgut loop doesn’t return into the abdominal cavity exomphalos results Caecum anomaly If the caecum fails to descend into the right iliac fossa, the caecum and the vermiform appendix will remain in a subhepatic position. This may lead to abnormal site of pain in acute appendicitis. Abnormalities of rotation  If the rotation of the midgut amounts to 90 degrees only (abnormal rotation), the colon and the ceacum will be the first portions to enter and they will move to the dorsal and inferior portions and settle on the left side of the abdominal cavity resulting in a Left-sided colon  When the midgut loop rotates in a clockwise direction the transverse colon will pass behind the duodenum and it will lie behind the superior mesenteric artery. This condition is called Reversed rotation of the intestinal loop Abnormal and Reversed rotation of the intestinal loop Hindgut • Gives rise to the distal 1/3 of the transverse colon, the descending colon, sigmoid, rectum, and proximal part of the anal canal Hindgut development Hindgut cont… • End of 7th week cloacal membrane ruptures • Urorectal septum forms perineal body • Proliferation of ectoderm closes the caudal most anal canal • Anal canal recanalizes in the 9th week • Caudal part of the anal canal is ectodermal in origin supplied by inferior rectal arteries • Cranial part is derived from endoderm and therefore supplied by superior rectal arteries Urorectal fistula Failure of the urorectal septum to completely separate the urogenital sinus from the rectum. Therefore the rectum opens into the urethra and faecal material is deposited into the urethra. Rectovaginal fistula Failure of the urorectal septum to completely separate the urogenital sinus form the rectum. Therefore the rectum opens into the vaginal opening and faecal material is deposited into the vagina. Imperforate anus Imperforate anus occurs when the proctodeum fails to recanalize following the proliferation of its cells. This condition may also arise if the cloacal membrane fails to rupture.
