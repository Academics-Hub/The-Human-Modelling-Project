Think and read about the effect on the x-ray quality of each of these variables and under what circumstances you would need to change them. 2) What determines exposure and what is the relevance of the product of tube current and duration in mAs 3) When the radiographer adjusts the tube beam current, how is this achieved in the tube? In other words, what does the circuit do? Hint: Think about thermionic emission of electrons. 4) In these slides, we didn’t mention the use of lead collimators where the x-rays emerge from the tube or just before the detector, in order to achieve an appropriate x-ray beam geometry. Read and think about this. 5) If you were designing an x-ray machine, how would you generate the very high tube voltage? Read about the various designs for these generators and in particular the multiphase systems. 6) When would molybdenum be a more suitable anode than tungsten and why? 7) An x-ray image can be thought of as an x-y map of the line integrals of the beam attenuation as it pass through the tissue. The key determinant for x-ray absorption (attenuation) in tissue is the photoelectric effect. The other determinant of beam attenuation is Compton scatter which clearly contributes to attenuation but also to signal noise due to the multidirectional scatter of lower energy x-rays. Is there any other process giving rise to x-ray attenuation and how significant is it at typical x-ray energies? 8) We use filters at the aperture where the x-rays emerge form the tube. Other than beryllium, what types of materials are used as filters and what are their properties? Why do you think it is important to remove low energy photons from the x-ray beam? Think about patient absorbed dose from a safety perspective. References •Enderle, J., Blanchard, S., Bronzino, J. (2005). Introduction to Biomedical Engineering. Second Edition.
