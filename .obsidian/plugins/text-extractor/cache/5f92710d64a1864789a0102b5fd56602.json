Denaturation (95°C): The double stranded DNA “melts”open by disrupting the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases to form single stranded DNA 2. Annealing/Hybridisation (~55°C): Primer anneals to the single stranded DNA 3. Extension/Elongation (72°C): Polymerase adds deoxynucleoside triphosphates in a template-dependent fashion Steps are repeated (cycled) 30-50 times –“thermocycling” PCR automation •Most enzymes denature at high temperatures –Thus after each cycle new enzyme must be added – causes many issues! •Thermostable DNA polymerases –isolated from bacteria that grow in thermal vents on the ocean floor or in hot springs –Taq Polymerase from Thermus aquaticus can withstand 95°C –enzyme activity at ~72°C = 2000 - 4000 nt/min PCR mechanism PCR contains: 1. template DNA 2. polymerase 3. deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) 4. TWO synthetic DNA primers (Fwd + Rev, 18-20 nt) PCR mechanism Cycle 1: Denaturation at 95C • Heating to 95C disrupts hydrogen bonding between complementary bases causing the two strands to “melt”apart PCR mechanism Cycle 1: Annealing at ~55C • Primers hybridise to complementary sequences on template • Each primer is sequence specific (20 nucleotide primer = 420 possible combinations) PCR mechanism Cycle 1: Extension at 72C •DNA polymerase extends primers by adding dNTPs in a 5ʹ→3ʹdirection •1st round extension continues until 2 dsDNA sequences are produced PCR mechanism Cycle 1: Extension at 72C PCR mechanism Cycle 2: PCR mechanism Cycle 2: Denaturation at 95C PCR mechanism Cycle 2: Annealing at ~55C PCR mechanism Cycle 2: Extension at 72C PCR mechanism Cycle 2: Extension at 72CPCR = Exponential amplificationPCR = Exponential amplification 𝒚 =𝒂×𝟐𝒙 𝒚 =𝑐𝑜𝑝𝑦𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 𝒂=𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑐𝑜𝑝𝑦𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝒙 =𝑐𝑦𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 •Assuming you start off with a single molecule of a gene you are interested in, how many copies would you have after 30 cycles? 1 073 741 824 copies Exercise Starting copy number (a) Number of cycles (x) Copies produced (y) 2 10 5 5 100 800 1 000 4 000 10 51 200 6 960 𝑦=𝑎 ×2𝑥 2048 160 3 2 50 15 Detecting PCR products •Electrophoresis –Gel electrophoresis •“The motion of charged particles in a fluid under the influence of an electric field” •Cations (+) migrate towards the cathode •Anions (–) migrate towards the anode Agarose gel •Agarose –Polysaccharide derived from seaweed –Powder dissolves in water at high temperatures = forms a gel –Gel poured into a mold –Contains ethidium bromide (visualisation) Agarose gel electrophoresis •Gel submerged in running buffer (liquid) Agarose gel electrophoresis •Samples added to wells Agarose gel electrophoresis •Electric current applied –Nucleic acids (anions) migrate to anode Agarose gel electrophoresis •Migration through gel separates molecules by size Agarose gel electrophoresisPCR products/amplicons •Where primers bind determines the size of the PCR amplicon Predominant PCR product PCR products/amplicons 1.
