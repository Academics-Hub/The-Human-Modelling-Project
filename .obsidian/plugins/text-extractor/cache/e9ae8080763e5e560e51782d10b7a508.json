A prediction model for estimating glycemic load in ready-to-eat meals has been developed.2. The model is accurate, with high correlation to actual values.3. Factors influencing GL include carbohydrate content, type of carbohydrates, and fiber presence. BacklinksMedical papersDevelopment of a Prediction Model to Estimate the Glycemic Load of Ready-to-EatMealsAbstractThe glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) of a single food item has been used to monitor blood glucose level. However,concerns regarding the clinical relevance of the GI or GL have been raised on their applicability to a combination of several foodsconsumed as meal. This study aimed to investigate the glycemic response after consuming commercially purchased ready-to-eatmeal and to develop the GL prediction formula using the composition of nutrients in each meal. Glycemic responses were measuredin healthy adults with various mixed meals comprising approximately 25 g, 50 g, and 75 g of carbohydrates. After fasting, participantsconsumed test meals, and the glycemic response was measured for a subsequent 120 min. The GI and GL values for mixed mealswere calculated as area under curve for each participant. For the prediction formula, 70 mixed meals were analyzed, of which the GIand GL values of 64 participants were used. The prediction formula produced was as follows: GL = 19.27 + (0.39 × availablecarbohydrate) – (0.21 × fat) – (0.01 × protein2) – (0.01 × fiber2). We hope that this prediction formula can be used as a useful tool toestimate the GL after consuming ready-to-eat meals.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
