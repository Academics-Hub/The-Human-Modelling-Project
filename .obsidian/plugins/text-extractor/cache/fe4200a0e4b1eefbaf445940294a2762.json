Analysis of acid-base disorders I- Introduction • Acid: any substance that adds H+ to body fluids (BF) Base (or Alkali): any substance that remove H+ from BF • Strong acid: complete dissociation in solution forming a proton (H+) and an anion (negatively charged ions) e.g. HCl → H++ Cl- • Weak acid: incomplete dissociation in solution e.g. H2CO3 ↔ H++ HCO3- NH4+ ↔ H++ NH3 HB (acid) + B- (base)H+ • Strong base: complete dissociation in solution to form OH- and a cation e.g. NaOH → Na++ OH- • Weak base: incomplete dissociation in solution e.g. NH3 + H2O ↔ NH4+ + OH- - Most weak bases are anions of weak acids - Do not provide/give a hydroxide ion by dissociation, instead they react with water to generate hydroxide ions Any weak acid and its conjugate base can act as a buffer. → consume or release H+ to stabilize the pH. H20 ↔ H+ (acidic ) + OH- (basic) = ionisation e.g.H2CO3 ↔ H++ HCO3- • Potential of Hydrogen : pH = log (1/[H+]) = -log [H+] acid alkaline [H+] = 10-7 mol/L pH of arterial blood ~ 7.44 pH of venous blood = 7.36 Acidemia when plasma pH < 7.36 - Acidosis = drop in pH Alkalemia when plasma pH >7.44 - Alkalosis = increase in pH Average pH=7.40 In BF, [H+] = 4.10-8 mol/L pH=log (1/[H+]) = log (1/4.10-8) = 7.40 High [H+] → low pH If pH<7 = acidic (more H+ than pure water) If pH>7 = basic (less H+ than pure water) pH= -log [H+] Consequences of fluctuations in pH: • Marked changes on enzymatic activity • Influence K+ levels in body • Change in excitability (nerve & muscle) ↑[H+] → ↑[K+] ↓[H+] → ↓[K+] ↑[H+] → depression CNS – Coma ↓[H+] → Hyperexcitability CNS – Tetany/spasm respiratory muscle [H+] in body fluids regulated = Acid/Base balance• Carbonic acid formation (from soluble CO2) • Organic acids resulting from intermediary metabolism • Inorganic nutrients produced during breakdown of nutrients • Abnormal acids from disease situations/ ingestion II- Source of H+Daily prod.(mol) Source Normal elimination Class I CO2 15 tissue respiration Lungs Class II Organic acids and Urea synthesis (1) Lactic acid (2) Hydroxy-butyric and acetoacetic acid (3) Free fatty acids (4) H+ generated during urea synthesis 1.2 0.6 0.7 1.1 muscle, brain, rbc, skin liver adipose tissue Liver Metabolic Removal liver (50%) kidneys, heart many tissues (not liver) Most tissues most tissues urine (small) Class III “Fixed” acid Sulphuric acid Phosphoric acid 0.1 dietary sulphur - containing amino acids organic phosphate metabolism partly excreted in urine Source of H+ strong acids weak acid • Carbonic acid formation (from soluble CO2) • Organic acids resulting from intermediary metabolism • Inorganic nutrients produced during breakdown of nutrients • Abnormal acids from disease situations/ ingestion Produced sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid = strong acids.
