Minimal model estimation of glucose absorption and insulin sensitivity from oral test: validation with a tracer method. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 287: E637– E643, 2004. First published May 11, 2004; 10.1152/ajpendo.00319. 2003.—Measuring insulin sensitivity during the physiological milieu of oral glucose perturbation, e.g., a meal or an oral glucose tolerance test, would be extremely valuable but difﬁcult since the rate of appearance of absorbed glucose is unknown. The reference method is a tracer two-step one: ﬁrst, the rate of appearance of glucose (Ra meal ref ) is reconstructed by employing the tracer-to-tracee ratio clamp tech- nique with two tracers and a model of non-steady-state glucose kinetics; next, this Ra meal ref is used as the known input of a model describing insulin action on glucose kinetics to estimate insulin sensitivity (SI ref). Recently, a nontracer method based on the oral minimal model (OMM) has been proposed to estimate simultaneously the above quantities, denoted Ra meal and SI, respectively, from plasma glucose and insulin concentrations measured after an oral glucose perturbation. This last method has obvious advantages over the tracer method, but its domain of validity has never been assessed against a reference method. It is thus important to establish whether or not the “nontracer” Ra meal and SI compare well with the “tracer” Ra meal ref and SI ref . We do this comparison on a database of 88 subjects, and it is very satisfactory: Ra meal proﬁles agree well with the Ra meal ref and correlation of SI ref with SI is r \u0001 0.86 (P \u0002 0.0001). We conclude that OMM candidates as a reliable tool to measure both the rate of glucose absorption and insulin sensitivity from oral glucose tests without employing tracers. glucose kinetics; rate of appearance of glucose; tracer; meal; insulin resistance INSULIN SENSITIVITY (SI), i.e., the ability of insulin to enhance glucose utilization and inhibit glucose production, is an impor- tant parameter to assess the efﬁciency of the glucose regulatory system. This index, useful not only for diagnosis but also for assessing the efﬁcacy of a given therapy, is usually measured using methods involving an intravenous administration of glucose and/or insulin, such as the glucose clamp technique (10) or the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) inter- preted with the minimal model (5). However, both of these techniques realize experimentally a “nonphysiological milieu” since neither the elevated insulin-basal glucose condition of the clamp technique nor the rapid glucose and insulin perturbations of an IVGTT reﬂect the condition of daily living. Therefore, it is highly desirable to have a method able to quantify insulin sensitivity in a normal life “physiological milieu,” e.g., during a meal. Unfortunately, the estimation of insulin sensitivity after an oral glucose perturbation is not an easy task, the major obstacle being that the rate of appearance of glucose absorption is unknown. The most reliable, probably the reference method for estimating insulin sensitivity during a meal, is a two-step procedure. First, the rate of appearance of absorbed glucose is reconstructed as accurately as possible with a tracer method. A reliable method uses a tracer-to-tracee clamp technique in conjunction with a model of glucose kinetics in nonsteady state (14). Two tracers are necessary, one given intravenously, mim- icking the rate of appearance of glucose absorption, and one together with the meal. Once the rate of appearance of absorbed glucose is known, to estimate insulin sensitivity one has to explain the meal plasma glucose measurements with a model describing insulin action on glucose production and disposal. This model already exists and is the classic single-compartment minimal model. In fact, when glucose and insulin change smoothly as during an oral test, the single-compartment description of glucose kinetics has proven to be sufﬁciently accurate (2). In summary, the state-of-the-art method for the estimation of insulin sensitivity during an oral test entails the use of a two-tracer protocol in conjunction with a model of non-steady- state glucose kinetics to obtain the rate of appearance of glucose absorption (Ra meal ref ), and then the use of the minimal model to extract insulin sensitivity (SI ref) from plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Since this is an expensive and labor-intensive procedure, an alternative approach capable of reducing the cost and the effort is required to favor a wide- spread application of the oral test for the estimation of insulin sensitivity. Recently, a nontracer method based on a new model, the oral minimal model (OMM), has been proposed to estimate insulin sensitivity (SI) together with the glucose rate of appearance (Ra meal) from plasma glucose and insulin con- centrations measured after a meal or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; see Ref. 9). The method has obvious advantages over the reference tracer method discussed above, but its performance in recovering both insulin sensitivity and rate of appearance of glucose absorption has never been compared with other methods, albeit some reassuring indirect validation results are available: in two studies (3, 9) insulin sensitivity was compared with that obtained from IVGTT performed in the same subjects, and correlation was satisfactory. It is thus important to establish whether or not the “nontracer” Ra meal and SI provided by OMM compare well with the “tracer” Ra meal ref and SI ref provided by the reference method.

This is precisely the aim of the present contribution. We do this comparison on a database consisting of 88 subjects who underwent the triple-tracer meal protocol described (4). DATABASE AND PROTOCOL The database consists of 88 normal subjects (46 males and 42 females; age \u0001 58 \u0003 2 yr, body weight \u0001 77 \u0003 2 kg) who received a triple-tracer mixed meal (10 kcal/kg, 45% carbohy- drate, 15% protein, and 40% fat) containing 1 \u0003 0.02 g/kg glucose. The meal was labeled with [ 13C]glucose (in the following tracer I) to segregate the exogenous, i.e., coming from the meal, glucose (Gex) from the endogenous one (Gend). Two additional tracers {[6,6- 2H2]glucose (tracer II) and [6- 3H]glucose, (tracer III)} were infused intravenously at vari- able rates, mimicking the endogenous glucose production (EGP) and Ra meal, respectively; by this way, the change in the plasma tracer-to-tracee ratios tracer II/Gend and tracer III/Gex was minimized, and Steele equation provided an essentially model-independent estimate of EGP and Ra meal (4). As far as the present contribution is concerned, one only needs two of the three tracers, i.e., the one labeling the meal (tracer I) and the one mimicking Ra meal (tracer III). Plasma samples were collected at times (t) \u0004120, \u000430, \u000420, \u000410, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 260, 280, 300, 360, and 420 min. Figure 1 shows the mean glucose and insulin plasma concentration curves. METHODS Tracer Method Reconstruction of Ra meal ref . An accurate estimation of Ra meal ref was obtained by applying the single-compartment model of Steele et al. (14) to the clamped tracer-to-tracee ratio (TTR) \u0001 tracer III/Gex: Ra meal ref \u0005t\u0006 \u0001 F\u0005t\u0006 TTR\u0005t\u0006 \u0002 p \u0001 V \u0001 Gex\u0005t\u0006 TTR\u0005t\u0006 \u0001 dTTR dt (1) where F(t) is the pump infusion proﬁle of tracer III,Visthe distribution volume of glucose, p is the pool fraction, and Gex is the concentration in plasma of the oral ingested glucose. Estimation of SI ref . By knowing Ra meal ref , it was possible to identify the classic minimal model in each subject by using Ra meal ref as the known exogenous input.

Speciﬁcally, SG is the fractional (i.e., per unit distribution volume) glucose effectiveness measuring glucose ability, per se, to promote glucose disposal and inhibit glucose production; p2 is the rate constant describing the dynamics of insulin action; p3 is the parameter governing the magnitude of insulin action.

It couples the single-compartment minimal model with a parametric description of the glucose rate of appearance: \u0001G˙ \u0005t\u0006 \u0001\u0002 \u0007SG \u0003 X\u0005t\u0006\b \u0001 G\u0005t\u0006 \u0003 SG \u0001 Gb \u0003 Ra meal\u0005t\u0006 V ; G\u00050\u0006 \u0001 Gb X˙ \u0005t\u0006 \u0001\u0002 p2 \u0001 X\u0005t\u0006 \u0003 p3 \u0001 [I\u0005t\u0006 \u0002 Ib]; X\u00050\u0006 \u0001 0 (4) The parametric description of Ra meal proposed (9) is a piecewise- linear function with known break point ti and unknown amplitude i: Ra meal\u0005t\u0006 \u0001\u0002 i\u00041 \u0003 i \u0002 i\u00041 ti \u0002 ti\u00041 \u0001 \u0005t \u0002 ti\u00041\u0006 per ti\u00041 \u0004 t \u0004 ti i \u0001 1...8 0 otherwise (5) SI was estimated as S1 \u0001 p3 p2 \u0001 V (dl \u0001 kg \u00041 \u0001 min \u00041 \u0001 \tU \u00041 \u0001 ml) (6) Parameter Estimation Tracer method. To estimate Ra meal ref , we used the single-compart- ment model of Steele et al. (14). Because the tracer-to-tracee ratio was well clamped, a two-compartment model gave virtually the same results (4). The tracer-to-tracee ratio proﬁle was smoothed using WINSTODEC (13), which also provides the ﬁrst derivative of the Fig. 1.

Finally, the minimal model of glucose kinetics was numerically identiﬁed by nonlinear least squares (7, 8), as imple- mented in SAAM II (Simulation Analysis and Modeling software; see Ref. 1). Measurement error on glucose data was assumed to be independent, Gaussian, with zero mean and known SD [coefﬁcient of variation (CV) \u0001 2%]. Insulin concentration is the model-forcing function and was assumed to be known without error. The model provided estimates of SG ref ,V ref, p2 ref, and SI ref . Knowledge of Ra meal ref allowed us to calculate f ref [the fraction of the ingested dose (D) that is actually absorbed] as fref \u0001 \u000b 0 \f Ra meal ref D (7) Nontracer method. OMM was numerically identiﬁed with the same strategy described above. However, OMM identiﬁcation requires a number of assumptions that were discussed in detail (9). Brieﬂy, to ensure its a priori identiﬁability, one has to assume values for V and SG. Here, we ﬁxed them to the median obtained with the tracer method, i.e., V \u0001 V m-ref,SG \u0001 SGm-ref (median was preferred to mean values since parameters are not normally distributed, see RESULTS). To improve numerical identiﬁability of the remaining parameters, p2, p3, and i (i \u0001 1 . . . 8), a Gaussian bayesian prior was considered on the square root of p2 ref (SQRp2 ref), which is normally distributed (see RESULTS): SQRp2 \u0001 mean SQRp2 ref;SD \u0001 10%. Finally, a constraint was imposed to guarantee that the area under the estimated Ra meal equals the total amount of ingested glucose, D, multiplied by the fraction of the ingested dose that is actually absorbed, f (ﬁxed to the median of reference values f \u0001 f m-ref): this constraint provides an additional relationship among the unknown parameters i, thus re- ducing the number of unknowns by one. In summary, OMM provides estimates of SI, p2, and i (i.e., the Ra meal proﬁle). Statistical Analysis Data are presented as means \u0003 SE. Two-sample comparisons were done by Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Shapiro-Wilk test was used to verify if parameters are normally distributed (signiﬁcance level set to 5%). Pearson’s correlation was used to evaluate univariate correlation. To investigate how sensitive the OMM estimate of SI was to the assumptions on V, SG,f,and p2, we investigated the relationship between the percent deviation of SI, \rSI%, and the percent deviation of the various parameters that were ﬁxed (namely \rV%, \rSG%, \rf%, and \rp2%) using regression analysis. The percent deviation of each parameter was calculated as the difference between the reference and OMM parameter value divided by the reference. We used single- regression analysis to determine the association of \rSI% with \rV%, \rSG%, \rf%, and \rp2% separately. Next, we used forward and backward stepwise multiple regression (using F ratio-to-remove \u0001 4 and F ratio-to-enter \u0001 3.996) to assess the relevance of the ﬁxed parameters as predictors of the error affecting SI. RESULTS Tracer Method Ra meal ref obtained using the tracer-to-tracee ratio clamp tech- nique is shown in Fig. 2A. The ﬁt of the minimal model (Eq. 2) was satisfactory, since, as indicated in Fig. 3A, average weighted residuals did not show systematic deviations from zero. Reference parameters of glucose kinetics were estimated with good precision: SG ref \u0001 0.031 \u0003 0.002 min \u00041 (CV \u0001 12 \u0003 1%; mean \u0003 SE); V ref \u0001 1.50 \u0003 0.05 dl/kg (CV \u0001 4 \u0003 1%); p2 ref \u0001 0.013 \u0003 0.001 min \u00041 (CV \u0001 11 \u0003 1%); SI ref \u0001 11.55 \u0003 0.68 \u000e 10 \u00044 dl \u0001kg \u00041 \u0001min \u00041 \u0001\tU \u00041 \u0001ml (CV \u0001 5 \u0003 1%). The fraction of ingested glucose that reaches plasma, calculated as the ratio between the area under Ra meal ref and the ingested dose, was f ref \u0001 0.89 \u0003 0.02. Because the kinetic parameters were not normally distributed (P \u0002 0.01 by Shapiro-Wilk test; Fig. 4), median values were different from the mean ones: SG m-ref \u0001 0.025 min \u00041;V m-ref \u0001 1.45 dl/kg; p2 m-ref \u0001 0.012 min \u00041; SI m-ref \u0001 10.35 \u000e 10\u00044 dl\u0001kg \u00041 \u0001min \u00041 \u0001\tU \u00041 \u0001ml; f m-ref \u0001 0.9. As anticipated in Parameter Estimation, SQRp2 ref was normally distributed (P \u0001 0.35 by Shapiro-Wilk test), whereas p2 ref was not (SQRp2 ref \u0001 0.11 \u0003 0.004 min \u00041/2). Nontracer Method The mean proﬁle of Ra meal provided by the model is shown in Fig. 2A. The ﬁt of OMM was satisfactory (Fig. 3B).

Comparison A good agreement was found between the OMM Ra meal and Ra meal ref proﬁles (mean curves are shown in Fig. 2A). We calculated the relative deviation of OMM Ra meal estimates from the reference Ra meal ref in each breakpoint of the piecewise- linear function as: \u000fRa meal \u0001 Ra meal ref \u0002 Ra meal Ra meal ref (8) The temporal proﬁle of the mean \u000fRa meal is shown in Fig. 2B and does not present systematic deviation from zero. Moreover, SI provided by OMM and SI ref were not signiﬁcantly different (SI \u0001 11.68 \u0003 0.73 10 \u00044 dl \u0001kg \u00041 \u0001min \u00041 \u0001\tU \u00041 \u0001ml, SI ref \u0001 11.55 \u0003 0.68 \u000e 10 \u00044 dl \u0001kg \u00041 \u0001min \u00041 \u0001\tU \u00041 \u0001ml) and well correlated (r \u0001 0.86, P \u0002 0.0001; Fig. 5). To quantify the agreement between OMM and reference SI in each individual, we calculated the absolute percentage deviation between the two measurements as: \u0003 \rSI \u0003 \u0001 \u0003SI ref \u0002 SI\u0003 SI ref (9) It was found that \u0003 \rSI \u0003 \u0001 29 \u0003 3% on average (range 0.42–160%). Finally, to assess the inﬂuence of model param- eters SG,f, p2, and V on individual SI estimates, a multivariate regression was performed of \rSI vs. \rSG, \rf, \rp2, and \rV covariates. Results indicate that \rSG, \rf, and \rp2 contribute to \rSI variance (r \u0001 0.752, P \u0002 0.0001), whereas \rV does not. We conclude that the OMM is quite robust and most applicable in population studies, but it is less accurate in estimating the individual values of SI. DISCUSSION Insulin sensitivity measures the ability of insulin to inhibit glucose production and enhance glucose utilization. It is used in clinical and epidemiological studies to quantify insulin resistance as a risk factor for pathological conditions, such as obesity and hypertension, and to assess the efﬁcacy of a given therapy. Insulin sensitivity is usually estimated using intrave- nous administration of glucose and/or insulin, such as the glucose clamp technique (10) or the IVGTT interpreted with the minimal model (5). However, both of these techniques measure insulin sensitivity by experimentally creating a non- physiological milieu, and it would be important to be able to measure this parameter in a normal-life physiological milieu, e.g., during a meal. Recently, a new OMM has been proposed that is able to estimate insulin sensitivity SI in a given individual from plasma glucose and insulin concentration measured after an oral glucose perturbation, by simultaneously reconstructing also the rate of appearance of absorbed glucose (Ra meal). In this study, we have validated the OMM against what can be considered today the state-of-art reference method for estimat- ing insulin sensitivity during a meal or an OGTT. The refer- ence method relies on tracers and comprises the following two steps: ﬁrst, a two-tracer protocol is used in conjunction with a model of non-steady-state glucose kinetics to obtain the rate of glucose absorption; second, the calculated rate of glucose absorption is used in conjunction with the classic minimal model to measure insulin sensitivity from the measured plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. To test the nontracer OMM against the tracer method, we analyzed with both methods 88 subjects who underwent the triple-tracer meal protocol described (4). The comparison be- tween the Ra meal proﬁle obtained with the OMM and Ra meal ref indicates a good agreement between the two (Fig. 2). The temporal plot of the deviations of OMM Ra meal estimates from the reference in each breakpoint of the piecewise-linear func- tion does not present systematic deviation from zero. However, some differences between the reference proﬁle and OMM prediction can be seen at the individual level. A likely expla- nation for these discrepancies is that OMM requires us to ﬁx some parameters. In particular, the use of a population value for the fraction of absorbed dose (f) forces the area under the curve of Ra meal to take on a value that is correct on average but differs slightly at the individual level. The comparison between insulin sensitivity indexes obtained by OMM and the reference model indicates an excellent agreement in average between the estimates of insulin sensitivity (SI ref \u0001 11.55 \u0003 1 \u000e 10\u00044 dl \u0001kg \u00041 \u0001min \u00041 \u0001\tU \u00041 \u0001ml, SI \u0001 11.68 \u0003 2 \u000e 10 \u00044 dl \u0001kg \u00041 \u0001 Fig. 3.

The ability of the OMM to provide results that are in good agreement with those provided by the more complex and expensive tracer method hinge on a simple but effective para- metric modeling of the rate of glucose absorption and on the assumption that some model parameters such as V, SG, and f equal their population values. In addition, the model uses a bayesian prior on p2 to improve the numerical identiﬁcation properties of the model. The novelty of the present study is that the reference model provides values of kinetic parameters during a meal. The large number of subjects studied in the present experiments permitted the distributions to be deter- mined for all parameters. As is evident in Fig. 4, kinetic parameters were not normally distributed (as conﬁrmed by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, P \u0002 0.01). Therefore, the median rather than mean values (V m-ref \u0001 1.45 dl/kg, SG m-ref \u0001 0.025 min \u00041,f m-ref \u0001 0.90) were used as reference for OMM to better describe nonnormality of the distributions.

With the use of these reference values, OMM provided an accurate estimate of insulin sensi- tivity not signiﬁcantly different from SI ref (SI \u0001 11.68 \u0003 0.73 vs. SI ref \u0001 11.55 \u0003 0.68 \u000e 10 \u00044 dl \u0001kg \u00041 \u0001min \u00041 \u0001\tU \u00041 \u0001ml) also when insulin sensitivity is expressed per unit of distribu- tion volume (SI \u0001 8.05 \u0003 0.50 vs. SI ref \u0001 8.56 \u0003 0.60 \u000e 10 \u00044 min\u0001\tU \u00041 \u0001ml). In previous studies (3, 9), mean population values derived from IVGTT and clamp studies were used [V \u0001 1.7 dl/kg; SG \u0001 0.014 min \u00041, p2 \u0001 0.03 min \u00041,f \u0001 0.86 (4)]. As seen above, mean values of parameters during a meal are different from those of the IVGTT; in particular, volume of distribution and p2 are lower (V ref \u0001 1.50 dl/kg, p2 ref \u0001 0.013 min \u00041), whereas glucose effectiveness is higher (SG ref \u0001 0.031 min \u00041). However, the OMM method is quite robust on aver- age: if intravenous values of kinetic parameters are used for OMM identiﬁcation, insulin sensitivity (SI iv \u0001 11.82 \u0003 0.66 \u000e 10 \u00044 dl \u0001kg \u00041 \u0001min \u00041 \u0001 \tU\u00041 \u0001 ml; see Ref. 3) is not statistically different from SI ref (insulin sensitivity per unit of distribution volume is different, SI iv \u0001 6.95 \u0003 0.39 \u000e 10\u00044 min \u0001 \tU\u00041 \u0001 ml vs. SI ref \u0001 8.56 \u0003 0.60 \u000e 10\u00044 min \u0001 \tU\u00041 \u0001 ml, P \u0001 0.0005 because of differences in the distri- bution volume) and correlation between OMM and the reference model remains very good (r \u0001 0.83, P \u0002 0.001). The necessity of using some population a priori knowledge for OMM numerical identiﬁcation can affect SI estimates in the single individual: the absolute percentage deviation between reference and OMM measurements is \u0003 \rSI \u0003 \u0001 29 \u0003 3% on average (range 0.42–160%). The discrepancy between the estimates of insulin sensitivity obtained with the reference model and with the OMM arises, at least in part, from the assumptions that parameters such as V, SG,f,and p2 take on the same value in all subjetcs (p2 is constrained to a bayesian prior). To investigate how sensitive the OMM estimate of SI was to the assumptions made on V, SG,f,and p2, we investi- gated the relationship existing between the percent deviation of SI, \rSI%, and the percent deviation on the various parameters that were ﬁxed (namely \rV%, \rSG%, \rf%, and \rp2%) using multiple-regression analysis. We found that the percentage deviation of f, SG, and p2 from the ﬁxed values explains the deviation in SI estimate (0.752, P \u0002 0.0001), whereas the deviation of V does not give a signiﬁcant contribution to the regression. We conclude that the OMM is quite robust and well applicable in population studies, although it is less accurate in estimating the individual values of SI. Until now, it has been possible to compare the SI provided by OMM with the analogous index obtained from the IVGTT (3, 9). Although SI values estimated during IVGTT were 40% lower than OMM ones, they correlated well with each other (r \u0001 0.62, P \u0002 0.001). Whereas these results were reassuring, one source of concern was that the experimental conditions during the IVGTT were markedly different from those during the oral test both in terms of the route of glucose administration and in the pattern of change of plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Also, in the previous study (3, 9), the IVGTT studies and the oral tests were not performed on the same days, adding a potential source of variability to the comparison. Thus the present validation of the OMM estimates of Ra meal and SI against an independent “oral reference technique” adds credi- bility to the OMM and provides the necessary prerequisite for a more general validation of this novel method against the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp: this important issue may be addressed in a separate study, but the available preliminary results (6) are reassuring. Finally, it is also of interest to compare OMM and reference SI with other indexes, such as the Homeostasis Model Assess- ment (HOMA) (15), the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) (11), and the insulin sensitivity index (ISI) of Matsuda-De Fronzo (12), frequently used to measure insulin sensitivity during an OGTT or meal. Correlation between SI OMM and ISI index is r \u0001 0.63, whereas correlation with HOMA or QUICKI is much lower (r \u0001 0.43 and 0.46, respectively). This was expected because HOMA and QUICKI indexes are derived from glucose and insulin concentration in the basal state, whereas OMM and ISI indexes are both estimated using the 420-min data. Similar results were found if SI ref was compared with the three indexes (HOMA: r \u0001 0.43; QUICKI: r \u0001 0.44; ISI: r \u0001 0.59). In conclusion, we have validated the nontracer OMM method by comparing its Ra meal and SI measurements with Fig. 5. A: comparison between SI estimated from the OMM and SI ref. B: correlation plot.

Our results indicate that the OMM provides an accurate estimation of both the Ra meal proﬁle and insulin sensitivity. Thus the OMM candidates as a simple, cost-effective, and reliable tool to measure both the rate of glucose absorption and insulin sensi- tivity from oral glucose tests without employing tracers.
