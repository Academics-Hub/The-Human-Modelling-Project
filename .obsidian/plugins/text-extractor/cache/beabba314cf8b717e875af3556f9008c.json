These techniques allow us to turn an integrand into a form for which we know the integral or for which we have a known technique to ﬁnd the integral. 1.1 Simple Techniques TC 8.3 “Turning a product into a sum”. If the integrand is the product of a function and its derivative, we saw in MATH1042 Chapter 4 that we can reverse the chain rule. But if the integrand is not aprodct ofthis form weneedto usedi↵erenttechniques. Recall: • cos 2A =2 cos 2 A \u0000 1 ) cos 2 A = 1 2(1 + cos 2A) • cos 2A =1 \u0000 2sin 2 A ) sin 2 A = 1 2(1 \u0000 cos 2A) • sin(A \u0000 B)=sin A cos B \u0000 cos A sin B + sin(A + B) =sin A cos B +cos A sin B sin(A \u0000 B)+sin(A + B)= 2 sin A cos B ) sin A cos B = 1 2⇥ sin(A \u0000 B)+sin(A + B) ⇤ • Similarly cos A cos B = 1 2⇥ cos(A \u0000 B)+cos(A + B) ⇤ and • sin A sin B = 1 2⇥ cos(A \u0000 B) \u0000 cos(A + B) ⇤ 2 Example 1.1.1. R sin 3x cos 2xdx = Example 1.1.2. Homework: Do the following two examples in a similar way 1. R cos 5x cos 3xdx 2. R sin 4x sin 3xdx Using the double angle formula we can deal with the integrals of sin 2 x and cos 2 x: Example 1.1.3. R cos 2 2xdx Example 1.1.4. R cos 4 xdx 1.1.1 Tutorial questions — Simple techniques D1. Use trigonometric identities to simplify the following functions, and then integrate them with respect to ✓. (a) sin 2✓ cos 2✓ (b) cos 5✓ cos ✓ (c) sin 2✓ cos 4✓ (d) sin ✓ sin 7✓ (e) cos 2 ✓ (f) sin 4 ✓ (g) cos 4 ✓ sin 2 ✓ (h) tan 2 ✓ (i) 1 1 \u0000 sin ✓ (j) sin ✓ sin 2✓ sin 3✓. (Hint for (i): multiply top and bottom by 1 + sin ✓.) 1.2 Di↵erentials We have used dy dx to denote the derivative of y with respect to x.It is not a ratio.We now introduce two new variables dx and dy with the property that when their ratio exists, it is equal to the derivative. Deﬁnition 1.2.1. Let y = f(x)beadi↵erentiable function. The di↵erential dx is an indepen- dent variable. The di↵erential dy is dy = f 0(x)dx. The variable dy is always a dependent variable and depends on x and dx.If y = f(x), then dy dx = f 0(x) ) dy = f 0(x)dx,when dy is called the di↵erential of y. Recall: \u0000y =changein y, not to be confused. In the chain rule, we are cancelling the di↵erentials dy dx = dy du du dx. Example 1.2.2. If y = p 1+ x ,ﬁnd the di↵erentialof y. Example 1.2.3. If x =2 tan ✓,ﬁnd the di↵erentialof x. 3 1.2.1 Tutorial questions — Di↵erentials D2. Find the di↵erentials of the following functions. (a) p 1+ x2 (b) sin 2 ✓ (c) arcsin(2v \u0000 1) (d) e x2 (e) (sin(x 3)) 1/3 (f) ln | tan \u0000|. 1.3 Integration by substitution TC 5.5 Theorem 1.3.1. If y is a function of u and u is a function of x, then Z y du dxdx = Z ydu “we have cancelled the di↵erentials”. Example 1.3.2. : R sin 3 x cos xdx Example 1.3.3. R (1 + x 2) 42xdx Example 1.3.4. R x 2 (1 + 2x3) 2 dx How to choose u?Choose u,such that du dx appears somewhere else in the integrand (we may have to introduce a “correction factor”). Example 1.3.5. R p 1+ ex e xdx Example 1.3.6. R x p 1 \u0000 x dx slightly di↵erent! Example 1.3.7. Homework (give substitutions): Solve the following three integrals by using a u substitution. Verify your answer by di↵erentiating. 1. R x sin x 2dx⇣ u = x 2, du dx =2x, xdx = 1 2du ⌘ . 2. R y2 cos y3dy ⇣ u = y3, du dy =3y2,y2dy = 1 3du ⌘ . 3. R sin n ✓ cos ✓ d✓ ⇣ u =sin ✓, du d✓ =cos ✓, du =cos ✓d✓⌘ Sometimes we may need to manipulate the integrand so that our choice of u becomes more obvious. Example 1.3.8. R sec 5 x tan xdx Example 1.3.9. R sin 5 xdx Example 1.3.10. R cos x 2 \u0000 cos2 xdx 4 Recall: Example 1.3.11. R tan xdx = R sin x cos xdx To ﬁnd the integrals of sec x and cosec x we “multiply by a form of 1” in order to get a fraction which we can write as du u : Example 1.3.12. R sec xdx Example 1.3.13. R cosec xdx TUTORIAL Example 1.3.14. R cot xdx Example 1.3.15. Z 1 x2 +2x +3dx Example 1.3.16. Z x x2 +4x +5dx 1.3.1 Deﬁnite integrals and Integration by substitution TC 5.6 Example 1.3.17. R 1 0 x(1 + x 2) 10dx⇣ u =1 + x 2, du dx =2x, xdx = 1 2du ⌘ Example 1.3.18. R ⇡/2 ⇡/4 sin 3 5x cos 5xdx Make sure the ORDER of the limits stays the same! TUTORIAL Example 1.3.19. Show that for a deﬁnite integral, the variable is a “dummy variable”. i.e. Z b a f(x)dx = Z b a f(u)du. 5 1.3.2 Tutorial questions — Integration by substitution D3. Integrate with respect to x by direct substitution: (a) sin p x p x (b) e tan x sec 2 x (c) x +3 x2 +6x +10 (d) e xp 1+ ex (e) cot(x) (f) sec 2 x tan x (g) x tan(x 2) (h) x 1+ x4 (i) sec 3 x tan x. D4. Integrate by direct substitution and some manipulation: (a) sec 4 x (b) sec 2n x sec 2 x (c) x x2 +6x +10 (d) sec x tan 3 x. T5. Show that the variable in any deﬁnite integral is a dummy variable (i.e. that R b a f(x)dx = R b a f(u)du for a general function f) by substituting u = x. E6. (a) Show that sec n x tan m x can be integrated by a sec substitution if m is odd (put m =2k +1) and by a tan substitution if n is even (put n =2k +2). Do not perform the integration. (b) Show that sin n x cos m x can be integrated by a cos substitution if n is odd and by asin substitutionif m is odd. What technique would you use ﬁrst if n and m are both even? T7. Prove that R ⇡/2 0 f(sin ✓)d✓ = R ⇡/2 0 f(cos ✓)d✓ for a general function f,by substituting \u0000 = ⇡ 2 \u0000 ✓ . E8. Prove that R ⇡/2 0 f(sin 2✓)d✓ = R ⇡/2 0 f(sin ✓)d✓ for a general function f,by ﬁrst substituting \u0000 =2✓ ,next splitting the integral into one from 0 to ⇡ 2 and one from ⇡ 2 to ⇡,and ﬁnally substituting ✓ = \u0000 in the ﬁrst integral and ✓ = ⇡ \u0000 \u0000 in the second one. E9. The indeﬁnite integral of ln sin ✓ cannot be found by any method, but the deﬁnite integral from 0 to ⇡ 2 can be evaluated as follows. Let I = R ⇡/2 0 ln sin ✓d✓ and J = R ⇡/2 0 ln sin(2✓)d✓. Use the double angle formula and Question 7 to show that J = ⇡ 2 ln 2 + 2I,and use Question 8 to show that J = I. Hence I = \u0000 ⇡ 2 ln 2. 6 1.4 Indirect substitution TC 8.4 We shall look at an indirect substitution, where ORIGINAL variable = (trigonometric) function of NEW variable. Recall: • sin 2 ✓ +cos 2 ✓ =1, sin 2 ✓ =1 \u0000 cos 2 ✓, cos 2 ✓ =1 \u0000 sin 2 ✓. • 1+tan 2 ✓ =sec 2 ✓, tan 2 ✓ =sec 2 ✓ \u0000 1, 1 \u0000 sec 2 ✓ = \u0000 tan 2 ✓. • how to “complete the square” method. • d dx(arctan x)= 1 1+ x2 . • d dx(arcsin x)= 1 p 1 \u0000 x2 . This method of integration is e↵ective when we are dealing with, amongst others, square roots of quadratic functions such as p a2 \u0000 x2, p a2 + x2 or p x2 \u0000 a2,since the square trigono- metric identities and the reference right angle triangles allow us to transform the integrals into integrals we can evaluate directly. With x = a tan ✓, a 2 + x 2 = a 2 + a 2 tan 2 ✓ = a 2(1 + tan 2 ✓)= a 2 sec 2 ✓. With x = a sin ✓, a 2 \u0000 x 2 = a 2 \u0000 a 2 sin 2 ✓ = a 2(1 \u0000 sin 2 ✓)= a 2 cos 2 ✓. With x = a sec ✓, x 2 \u0000 a 2 = a 2 sec 2 ✓ \u0000 a 2 = a 2(sec 2 ✓ \u0000 1) = a 2 tan 2 ✓. Example 1.4.1. R dx (1 \u0000 x2) 3/2 = (NOT arcsin x !!) It would be useful to have a single term in the square root, so, if we let x =sin ✓,then 1 \u0000 x 2 =1 \u0000 sin 2 ✓ =cos 2 ✓. (Note: We cannot use 1 \u0000 sec 2 ✓ = \u0000 tan 2 ✓ since p of \u0000). Example 1.4.2. R dx (x2 +1) 3/2 (Not arctan x!!) Example 1.4.3. R dx x2 \u0000 4. To turn quadratics into trig functions we complete the square and compare with the trig identities to determine which would be most useful. 7 Example 1.4.4. R dx x2 +2x +5 = Z dx (x +1)2 +4 (use x +1 = 2 tan ✓ then dx =2 sec 2 ✓ d✓). Example 1.4.5. R (4x 2 +4x \u0000 3) \u00003/2dx = R ⇥ (2x +1) 2 \u0000 4 ⇤\u00003/2dx Example 1.4.6. Z dx (1 + 6x \u0000 9x2) 1/2 = Z dx ⇥ 2 \u0000 (3x \u0000 1)2⇤1/2 = Z p 2 3 cos ✓ d✓ [2 \u0000 2sin 2 ✓] 1/2 Example 1.4.7. R (x \u0000 1)dx [1 + 2x \u0000 x2] 1/2 needs a DIRECT SUBSITUTION 1.4.1 Deﬁnite integrals and Indirect substitution Example 1.4.8. R 1 \u00001 dx p x2 +6x +13 = Z 1 \u00001 dx p (x +3)2 +4 Example 1.4.9. R 1 0 dx x2 \u0000 4 (done earlier!) WARNING: We had 2 choices. 1.4.2 Tutorial questions — Indirect substitution D10. Integrate by completing the square if necessary and then making a trigonometric substi- tution: 8 (a) (1 + x 2) \u00001/2 (b) (1 \u0000 x 2) 1/2 (c) (x 2 \u0000 1) \u00001/2 (d) (x 2 +2x +2) \u00003/2 (e) (x 2 + x + 1 2) \u00001/2 (f) (x 2 + x \u0000 2) \u00001/2 (g) (\u0000x 2 +3x +4) 1/2. D11. Integrate 1p x\u0000x2 ﬁrstly by substituting u = p x and secondly by completing the square. Let ✓ denote the ﬁrst integral and \u0000 denote the second integral. Use trigonometric identities (double angle formulae) to show that ✓ and \u0000 di↵er by a constant. D12. Integrate by combining direct and indirect substitution (which can be done in one step, if you like). (a) p 1+ e2x (hint: ﬁrst put u = e x) (b) p 1 \u0000 e2x (c) p e2x \u0000 1 (d) (x +2 p x +2) \u00003/2. D13. Evaluate the following deﬁnite integrals using appropriate simple techniques or substitu- tion methods: (a) R ⇡/4 0 tan 3 ✓ d✓ (b) Z ⇡/2 ⇡/4 1 1+cos ✓ d✓ (c) R 2⇡ 0 sin ✓ cos 2✓ d✓ (d) Z 1 0 1 4x2 +4x +17 dx (e) R 1 1/2 p 1 \u0000 x2 dx (f) Z 2 1 p x2 \u0000 1 x dx (g) R 2 0 p 1+ e2x dx (h) Z 1 0 x 1+ x2 dx (i) Z 1 0 x 1+ x4 dx. 1.5 Rational functions (or Partial fractions) TC 8.5 Example 1.5.1.

Hopefully, the integral on the right-hand side is easier than the original on the left-hand side. u and dv dx need to be decided from the original integral. Then u is di↵erentiated to obtain du dx and dv dx is integrated to obtain v. So we have 4 items: u, du dx dv dx,v that are plugged into the RHS. Example 1.6.1. R x sin 2xdx We want to choose u and dv dx to make the integration easier. We could have chosen u =sin 2x, du dx =2 cos 2x dv dx = x, v = x 2 2 . This would have given us x 2 2 sin 2x \u0000 Z x 2 2 2cos 2xdx a WORSE INTEGRAL! Example 1.6.2. Z xe \u0000x dx 10 Example 1.6.3.

Example 2.1.1. y = x 2 + x \u0000 1 x +3 ,y =2 sin x +cos x, . . . . For each x there is only one y. Explicit form cannot cope with curves that have loops or doubled back on itself. We need equation of the form f(x, y)=constant in an implicit form. Example 2.1.2. (conic forms: seen in MATH1042 Chapter 4 of algebra) x 2 + y2 =4, (x +1) 2 4 \u0000 (y +2) 2 5 =1,y sin xy =1,. .. . Example 2.1.3. Show that P \u0000 ⇡ 12, 2 \u0000 lies on the curve y sin xy =1 and ﬁnd dy dx at that point. Another way is to express x and y in terms of a 3rd independent variable, called a parameter, t say, or ✓. ⇢ x = x(t) y = y(t) called parametric equations. 17 Example 2.1.4. Polar eq. x = r cos ✓, y = r sin ✓ where the parameter is ✓. If y(✓) x(✓) =tan ✓,then the parametric equations are polar equations (which have been done in algebra). Often t is used for parameter, so that x = x(t)and y = y(t)describethe pathofaparticle that at time t is at position \u0000 x(t),y(t) \u0000 . In vector form we write r = r(t) i.e.: (x, y)= \u0000 x(t),y(t) \u0000 =displacementvector ˙r =( ˙x, ˙y)= velocity vector The slope of a curve given in parametric form, using the chain rule is given by dy dx ) if ˙y = dy dt = dy dx · dx dt ) dy dx = dy dt · dt dx = ˙y ˙x. · = d dt ) dy dx = ˙y ˙x Horizontal tangents occur when dy dx =0 as before, ) when ˙y =0, ˙x 6=0 Vertical tangents occur when ˙x =0 and ˙y 6=0, dy dx is undeﬁned. If we have ˙x = 0 AND ˙y = 0, we have a CUSP or KINK. .. . the particle is at rest Since x(t)gives the horizontalpositionof the particle, ˙x gives the horizontal change: neg- ative for left and positive for right. Similarly y(t)gives thevertical positionof theparticle,so ˙y gives the vertical change: negative for down and positive for up. 2.2 Parametric curve sketching Example 2.2.1. 8 < : x = t 2 \u0000 1 y = t 2 2 (2t +3) 18 2.2.1 Method for sketching curves in parametric form x = x(t),y = y(t) • Find x \u0000 y intercepts, by putting solving y(t)=0 and substituting the values for t into x(t)and repeatfor x(t)= 0. • Determine behaviour of x(t)and y(t)as t ! ±1. (unless domain is restricted). • Find critical points by solving ˙x(t)= 0, ˙y(t)= 0, both = 0 CUSP v.t. h.t. • Make a table showing the signs of ˙x and ˙y and the direction of travel. E.g. the 4 possible directions are: ˙x ++ \u0000\u0000 Aparametric curve is ˙y + \u0000 + \u0000 always orientated Direction %& -. i.e. it has direction x y Examples 1 and 4 for homework (solutions will be available on SAKAI). 1 2 3 4 x = t +sin(2t) x = t +sin t x =cos ✓ x =cos t \u0000 cos(2t) y =sin t y =1 + cos t y =sin(2✓) y = \u00002sin t +sin(2t) 0  t  4⇡ 0  ✓  2⇡ 0  ✓  2⇡ Example 2.2.2. ⇢ x = t +sin t y =1 + cos t Example 2.2.3. ⇢ x =cos ✓ y =sin(2✓) 19 2.3 Another application Theorem 2.3.1. Suppose we have a POLAR CURVE, r = r(✓), with vector form r =(r cos ✓, r sin ✓). Let ↵ = angle between position vector and tangent vector at a point P on the curve: then tan ↵ = r ˙r , ˙r 6=0. Note: If ˙r =0, then tan ↵ is undeﬁned, hence ↵ = ⇡ 2 ) tangent ? radius ) circle, i.e. r =constant Example 2.3.2. Find the angle ↵ between the tangent and the position vector to the curve r =2 sin ✓ at the point (x, y)= ⇣ p 3 2 , 1 2⌘ . Find the equation of the tangent at that point. 2.3.1 Tutorial questions — General curves in the plane D1.

For each of the following curves in parametric form, (i) ﬁnd cuts on axes (y =0 and x =0), (ii) ﬁnd what happens to x and y as the parameter tends to ±1 (unless the parameter values are restricted), (iii) ﬁnd points with horizontal or vertical tangents ( ˙y =0 or ˙x =0), (iv) draw up a table of signs of ˙x and ˙y,including arrowstoshow directionoftravel, (v) plot all points found in (i) and (iii), labelling them with the parameter value, (vi) join up the points, checking that the direction of travel agrees with the results from (ii) and (iv). (a) x =6 cos ✓ +cos 3✓, y =6 sin ✓ +sin 3✓ (\u0000⇡  ✓  ⇡). Hint: in ﬁnding intercepts and tangents it may be helpful to remember that sin 3✓ =3 sin ✓ \u0000 4sin 3 ✓ and cos 3✓ = \u00003cos ✓ +4 cos 3 ✓. Note that ✓ is not the polar co-ordinate of the point (x, y). Why not? (The curve is the dumbbell shape of a Wankel engine.) (b) x =cos ✓(1 + 2 sin 2 ✓), y =2 sin 3 ✓ (\u0000 ⇡ 2  ✓  ⇡ 2 ). Again prove that ✓ is not the polar co-ordinate of (x, y). (This is the caustic curve formed when light is reﬂected in a semicircular mirror. Look inside a cylindrical co↵ee mug. There is a cusp that becomes the focus if only a small part of the mirror is used.) (c) x = 3 5t 5 \u0000 5t 3 +12t, y =10/(t 2 +1). (d) x = t 3 \u0000 3t, y =10/(t 2 +1). (e) x = t 3 \u0000 3t, y =10/(t 2 \u0000 2t +2). (f) x = t 3 \u0000 3t, y =10/(t 2 \u0000 4t +5). (g) x = t 3 \u0000 3t, y =4te \u0000t2/8. (h) x = t 3 \u0000 3t, y =8te \u0000t2/2. (i) x = t 3 \u0000 3t, y =16te \u00002t2. The last six curves go together in threes, and illustrate how by changing a constant one can change a simple curve (i.e. a curve that does not cross itself) into one with a cusp, and then into one with a loop. Think of a plane doing aerobatics: with too little power it rises, then descends smoothly; with more power, it may stall; with still more power, it can loop the loop. D3. Give the vector parametric form of the polar equation r =1 + cos ✓,which represents a cardioid. Find the vertical and horizontal tangents, and verify that there is a cusp where ✓ = ⇡. Hence sketch the curve roughly. D4. Prove that in a logarithmic spiral (polar equation r = ae b✓)the angle betweenposition vector and tangent vector is constant. What happens to this angle in an Archimedean spiral (polar equation r = a + b✓)as ✓ !1? D5. Simplify ˙y/ ˙x and then apply the method of indeterminate forms, if necessary, to ﬁnd the slopes at the cusps on the curves in Question 2(b), (e), and (h). 21 2.4 Areas in parametric form We know R b a |y|dx is the area between a curve and the x-axis from x = a to x = b. If the curve is in parametric form x = x(t),y = y(t)then area A = Z t=\u0000 t=↵ |y(t)|dx(t) dt dt. (limits: integrate from “left to right”). If we want the area between curve and y-axis we use Z t=\u0000 t=↵ |x(t)|dy(t) dt dt. (limits: integrate from “bottom to top”). Example 2.4.1. Find the area under one arch of the cycloid x = t \u0000 sin t, y =1 \u0000 cos t Example 2.4.2. Find the area of the loop of the curve x = t 3 \u0000 3t, y =4 \u0000 t 2 ALTERNATIVELY We can use the are between the curve and the x-axis, but this is much much harder. 22 J cost def t coat de It singe t c ELT A 1541 cost dt l 2 cost cost dt t Lint It It sing 31T to A LIEGE 34 25 de 2433 2.4.1 Tutorial questions — Areas in parametric form D6.

Use your sketch to obtain the ✓ limits, and make sure you have them in the correct order.) D7. Find the area in the ﬁrst quadrant lying inside the caustic curve x =cos ✓(1 + 2 sin 2 ✓), y =2 sin 3 ✓ (Question 2(b)). (Hint: ﬁnd the area between the curve and the y axis.) T8. Show by means of a picture that if the curve r = r(t)crossesitself when t = ↵ and t = \u0000, and travels anticlockwise around the loop thus formed, then the area of the loop is equal to \u0000 R \u0000 ↵ ydx and to R \u0000 ↵ xdy. (Hint: express the area of the loop as the area between its top and bottom boundaries, and also as the area between its left and right boundaries.) D9. Find the area of the loop in the curve x = t 3 \u0000 3t, y =10/(t 2 + 1) (Question 2(d)). (Hint: ﬁnd the area between the loop portion of the curve and the y axis, and double it.) D10.

Find the area enclosed between the x axis, the curve x = t 3 \u0000 3t, y =4te \u0000t2/8 and the line x =18 (Question 2(g)). 23 2.5 Arc length TC 6.3, 11.2 and 11.5 Theorem 2.5.1. If ↵ < \u0000 then the length of arc of the curve r = r(t) (i.e. in parametric form) x = x(t) y = y(t) between the points t = ↵ and t = \u0000 is given by arc length = Z \u0000 ↵ p ˙x2 +˙y2 dt Example 2.5.2. Find the arclength of the curve x =2 cos t +cos 2t and y =2 sin t +sin 2t between the points (3, 0) and (-1, 0).

If you rotate only the bounding curve itself, it does not sweep out any interior volume, but rather a surface that surrounds the solid and forms part of its boundary. As an arc PQ of the curve rotates about the axis it sweeps out a band that we can approx- imate as a frustum of a cone. The surface is a union of bands like the one swept out by PQ (see TC 6.4 for detailed explanation). Using the formula for the surface area of a frustum and a Riemann Sum to sum the union of bands, we get the formula for the Curved Surface Area of an explicitly given curve y = f(x) rotated about the x-axis as CSA = Z b a 2⇡y s 1+ ✓dy dx ◆2 dx Note the use of the formula for explicitly given arclength from the previous section.

We can ﬁnd a 1 st approximation to f(x),using the deﬁnition of the derivative. f(x) \u0000 f(0) x \u0000 0 ⇡ f 0(0) so that f(x) ⇡ f(0) + xf 0(0). This represents the equation of a straight line through (0,f(0)) and the gradient f 0(0). This line is the tangent to the curve at x =0 We have a polynomial of degree 1, called 1 st approximation, which has the same value as f at 0and hasthesame 1 st derivative at 0. So, near x =0, this polynomial approximates f(x). We shall call this polynomial P1(x). So P1(x)= f(0) + xf 0(0) where P1(0) = f(0) and P 01(0) = f 0(0) Similarly we deﬁne the 2 nd approximation to f(x)near x =0 to be a polynomial of degree 2, i.e. a quadratic with the same value, 1 st derivative and 2 nd derivative at x =0. 31 Let P2(x)= A + Bx + Cx 2.We need P2(0) = f(0), P 02(0) = f 0(0) and P 002(0) = f 00(0). P2(0) = f(0) gives A = f(0) P 02(0) = f 0(0) gives B = f 0(0) P 002(0) = f 00(0) gives 2C = f 00(0) ) C = 1 2f 00(0) So our 2 nd approximation is P2(x)= f(0) + f 0(0)x + 1 2f 00(0)x 2 This process can be done for a cubic polynomial. Let P3(x)= A + Bx + Cx 2 + Dx 3 P3(0) = f(0) ) A = f(0) P 03(0) = f 0(0) ) B +2Cx +3Dx 2\u0000 \u0000 x=0 = B = f 0(0) P 003(0) = f 00(0) ) 2C +6Dx \u0000 \u0000 x=0 = f 00(0) ) C = 1 2f 00(0) P 0003(0) = f 000(0) ) 6D = f 000(0) ) D = 1 6f 000(0) So our 3 rd approximation is P3(x)= f(0) + f 0(0)x + 1 2f 00(0)x 2 + 1 6f 000(0)x 3 Note: Pn+1(x)is Pn(x)plusanextraterm. The fourth approximate will be of the form P4(x)= A + Bx + Cx 2 + Dx 3 + Ex 4: P4(x)= f(0) + f 0(0)x + 1 2f 00(0)x 2 + 1 6f 000(0)x 3+?f 0000(0)x 4, where ? satisﬁes P 0000(0) = f 0000(0) which implies 4 · 3 · 2E = f 0000(0), so E = 1 4!f 0000(0). Using factorials: recall the nth derivative of x n: d nx dxn = n! (MATH1042 Calculus Chapter 2) so P4(x)= f(0) + f 0(0)x + 1 2f 00(0)x 2 + 1 6f 000(0)x 3 + 1 4!f 0000(0)x 4. This idea can be extended to a polynomial of degree n, Pn(x), called the n th approximation to afunction f(x)near x =0 if • Pn(x)isof degree at most n and • Pn(0) = f(0), Pn0(0) = f 0(0), ·· · , Pn(n)(0) = f (n)(0) Hence we have: Pn(x)= f(0) + 1 1f 0(0)x + 1 2!f 00(0)x 2 + 1 3!f 000(0)x 3 + 1 4!f 0000(0)x 4 + ·· · + 1 n!f (n)(0)x n = nX r=0 f (r)(0) r! x r. 32 These are called Taylor polynomials after the English mathematician Brook Taylor (1685 - 1731).

TAYLOR’S THEOREM: The error f(x) \u0000 Pn(x) is given by f(x) \u0000 Pn(x)= f (n+1)(c) (n +1)! x n+1, for some c, a number between 0 and x. 34 Example 3.1.9. Let f(x)= e x. Find the value of c,when a 3 rd approximation is used with x =1. (not too close to 0) With n = 0, Taylor’s theorem is called the “Mean value Theorem”. It is better known when 0 and x are replaced by a and b. f(x) \u0000 P0(x)= f (1)(c)x 1 1! f(x) \u0000 f(0) = f 0(c)x ) f 0(c)= f(x) \u0000 f(0) x If x = b, a =0 then f 0(c)= f(b) \u0000 f(a) b \u0000 a LHS = gradient of tangent to f(x)at x = c RHS = gradient of secant, the line joining (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) So there is a point c 2 (a, b)suchthatgradient oftangentat c equal to gradient of secant, i.e. tangent k secant Example 3.1.10.

P10(x)isbetterthan P9(x) P100(x)isbetterthan P99(x), etc. As n !1,and wegetanexact valuefor f(x)near x =0 We then get a polynomial of inﬁnite degree, i.e. an inﬁnite series, called Maclaurin Series, after the Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin (1698 - 1746).

(d) Verify Stirling’s formula with a calculator, using the largest value of n!it cancope with. 3.6 Convergence of Series I, TC 10.2 Convergence and divergence of series were introduced in MATH1042 Algebra Chapter 3. A series P an is said to converge to the number S if the partial sums a1 + a2 + ·· · + aN tend to S as N !1.Roughly speaking, this means that the more terms you add on, the closer you get to the number S,whichissometimes calledthe sum to inﬁnity. Example 3.6.1. Consider the series NX n=1 an. 1 st partial sum =a1 2 nd partial sum =a1 + a2 3 rd partial sum =a1 + a2 + a3 ... N th partial sum =a1 + a2 + a3 + ·· · + aN Now, if the partial sums tend to S as N !1,that is a1 + a2 + a3 + ·· · + aN ! S as N !1, then 1X n=1 an = X an (shorthand for the series to inﬁnity) is said to converge to S and S is called the sum to inﬁnity. Note: 1. When you are taking a partial sum, even for N 101010 ,you are omitting inﬁnitely many terms, i.e. more than you are taking, so convergence is determined by the tail of the series. 2. Apartial sum must always be ﬁnite, but the sum to inﬁnity might not be. Aseries that doesnotconverge issaidto diverge.We shall describe some tests to determine whether or not a series converges. They are important because not many sums to inﬁnity can 43 be found exactly. We often use a computer to approximate a sum to inﬁnity by the partial sum for say N =100 or N =1000. This is called truncating the series,but it is meaningless if the series does not converge. Even if the series converges it is valuable to know how fast it converges, so we can estimate the truncation error,which is the di↵erence between the sum to inﬁnity and the partial sum. Deﬁnition 3.6.2. The truncation error for a convergent series is the absolute value of the di↵erence between the sum to inﬁnity and the partial sum: \u0000 \u0000 \u0000S \u0000 NX n=1 an\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 = \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 1X n=N+1 an\u0000 \u0000 \u0000. Note: In testing for convergence it is only the inﬁnite tail of the series that matters. We can ignore any number of terms at the beginning, because a ﬁnite sum must have a ﬁnite value and therefore cannot a↵ect the overall convergence or divergence, though it obviously does a↵ect the sum to inﬁnity if it exists. 3.6.1 The divergence test Anecessary condition for convergenceisthat the n th term, an,must tend to0, that is an ! 0as n !1. We illustrate the idea as follows: The partial sums must approach the value S as N !1,not necessarily from below,so the di↵erence between any two successive partial sums must go to zero. But this di↵erence is precisely aN. Theorem 3.6.3. If 1X n=1 converges, then an ! 0. Note of caution: Theorem 3.6.3 does not say that P1 n=1 an converges if an ! 0. It is possible for a series to diverge when an ! 0. In a more useful form we have the divergence test: 44 If lim n!1 an 6=0, then 1X n=1 an is divergent. Note: No conclusion about convergence or divergence can be drawn if limn!1 an =0. Example 3.6.4. Determine whether 1X r=1 r r +1 is convergent or divergent. Example 3.6.5. Determine whether 1X r=1 ln ⇣ 1+ 1 r ⌘ is convergent or divergent. There is another important general result which applies to series with real or complex terms, see TC 10.5. Theorem 3.6.6. If P |an| converges, then P an converges and we say P an is absolutely convergent. This result seems obvious, since |a1 + a2 + ·· ·|  |a1| + |a2| + ·· · ,but the proof is rather subtle and will be omitted. 3.6.2 The ratio test, TC 10.5 The ratio test enables us to deal with fast converging or diverging series. Usually the terms involve exponentials or factorials. The simplest examples are geometric series in which the ratio between successive terms is constant, that is, if P1 i=1 b i\u00001,then an+1 an = bn bn\u00001 = b,a constant. Furthermore,if the common ratio |r| < 1the seriesconverges, andif |r| \u0000 1the seriesdiverges. The ratio test applies to series that behave like geometric series in that the ratio (in modulus) between successive terms tends to a constant. Ratio Test:Suppose \u0000 \u0000 \u0000an+1 an \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 ! L as n !1, then the series P an converges if L< 1and divergesif L> 1. There is no conclusion if L =1. The conclusion is basically the same as for geometric series except that the borderline L =1 gives no conclusion. For this reason the ratio test is useless unless n appears in an exponent or factorial. Note: Since this test works with moduli, it can be applied to series with positive, negative or non-real terms. Example 3.6.7. Determine whether P1 n=1 n ⇣ 7⇡ 22 ⌘n converges or diverges. Example 3.6.8. Determine whether the following series are convergent or divergent? 45 1. 1X n=1 (\u00001) n n 2. 1X n=1 p n Example 3.6.9. Determine those values of x for which 1X r=1 r(4x 2) r is convergent. 3.6.3 Tutorial questions — Convergence of series I D20. Use one of the tests above to determine, if possible, whether the following series converge (C) or diverge (D): (a) X n 2n (b) X 3 n n2 (c) X (\u00003) n n! (d) X 1 n (e) X p n 1+ p n (f) X ✓ 2n n ◆ 2 \u00002n (g) X n! nn 3.7 Convergence of Series II, TC 10.3& 10.4 3.7.1 P -series, TC 10.3 We now deal with series for which the ratio test fails, i.e. for which the limit is 1, which are series involving powers or logs of n. Unfortunately we are restricted to series of positive terms. The partial sums cannot oscillate: since the terms are all positive, it follows that adding on an extra term must always increase the value of the partial sum, so the partial sums are always increasing. So there are only two possibilities: either the partial sums go o↵ to inﬁnity, or they approach a limiting value. Thus we have the following lemma: Lemma 3.7.1. If P an is a series with positive terms, then either it converges, or its partial sums tend to inﬁnity. 46 The simplest series of this type are where an is a power of n,say an = 1 np where p is constant, which we call p-series. Theorem 3.7.2 (The p-series test). If p is constant, then the series X 1 np diverges if p  1 and converges if p> 1. Figure 3.1 3.7.2 Comparison tests, TC 10.4 The p-series are used as a set of standards by which other series of positive terms can be compared. There are two tests for comparing series having positive terms, each saying essen- tially that if such a series converges, then so does any such series with smaller terms, and if it diverges, then so does any series with larger terms. Theorem 3.7.3 (Comparison test). If 0  an  bn for all n su\u0000ciently large, then: (i) if P bn converges, then P an converges, (ii) if P an diverges, then P bn diverges. Example 3.7.4.

These canbe plottedon contour maps, where all points with the same height are plotted on a curve. 4.1 Quadric Surfaces TC 12.6 Recall from Algebra (chapter 5) we looked at the following curves: Parabola y2 =4ax,Ellipse x 2 a2 + y2 b2 = 1 and Hyperbola x 2 a2 \u0000 y2 b2 =1 Quadric surfaces z = Q(x, y)have an equation of the form: z = Ax 2 + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F By rotating the axes and slightly shifting the origin we get z = \u0000u 2 + µv2,called the canonical form. 49 There are 5 possibilities: • \u0000 > 0, µ> 0(both positive) Let \u0000 = 1 a2 , µ = 1 b2 ,then z = u 2 a2 + v2 b2 . For each z = k,where k is constant we get u 2 a2 + v2 b2 = k which is an ellipse. This shape is called an elliptic paraboloid, or “CUP”. When u is constant, say u = c,then z = c 2 a2 + v2 b2 ,i.e. z \u0000 c 2 a2 = v2 b2 is a parabola. Similarly for when v is constant. Vertical cross sections in both the u and v directions are parabola ^ in shape. • \u0000 < 0, µ< 0(both negative) Let \u0000 = \u0000 1 a2 , µ = \u0000 1 b2 ,then z = \u0000u 2 a2 \u0000 v2 b2 . z = k ellipse elliptic paraboloid, or “CAP” u = k parabola. v = k parabola. Vertical cross sections in both the u and v directions are parabola _ 50 • \u0000 > 0, µ< 0 Let \u0000 = 1 a2 , µ = \u0000 1 b2 ,then z = u 2 a2 \u0000 v2 b2 . For each z = k,we get u 2 a2 \u0000 v2 b2 = k which is a hyperbola. When u is constant, say u = k,then z = k2 a2 \u0000 v2 b2 is a parabola _ Similarly for when v is constant z = u 2 a2 \u0000 k2 b2 is a parabola ^ This shape is called an hyperbolic paraboloid, or ”SADDLE”. • \u0000 > 0, µ =0 [or \u0000 =0, µ> 0] (one positive, one zero) Let \u0000 = 1 a2 ,then z = u 2 a2 only. For z constant, we get u 2 = za 2, u = ±a p k,i.e. 2 lines. For v constant, z = u 2 a2 aparabola ^ This shape is a parabolic cylinder. If \u0000 =0, µ> 0 51 • \u0000 < 0, µ =0 [or \u0000 =0, µ< 0] (one negative, one zero) Let \u0000 = \u0000 1 a2 ,then z = \u0000u 2 a2 . Also a parabolic cylinder. Example 4.1.1.

We look at sections of the surface, where we get curves. We di↵erentiate as before keeping all other variables constant. We call these partial derivatives, denoted by @z @x or @z @y if z = f(x, y). zx and zy,or fx and fy can also be used. Deﬁnition 4.2.1.

These occur frequently in Science and engineering. The order of a d.e. is the order of the highest derivative. Here are a few examples: dN dt = \u0000kN, radioactive decay, order 1, ordinary. d 2x dt2 = \u0000!x, simple harmonic motion, mechanics, order 2, ordinary. (x 2 + y)dy \u0000 (sin x)dx =1, order 1, ordinary. k @2u @x2 = @u @t , the heat equation, order 2, partial. dy dt +sin ty = t, order 1, ordinary. We are interested in solving a d.e., this means ﬁnding the function that satisﬁes the d.e.. Example 5.1.1. Solve for y the d.e. d 2y dt2 \u0000 dy dt \u0000 2y =0. In this chapter, we will learn how to ﬁnd y. For now, we shall just check that y =3e \u0000t +4e 2t is a solution. 63 In fact, more generally, we can check that y = Ae \u0000t + Be 2t is also a solution, where A and B are two arbitrary constants. Check this for yourself! In the above example, we say the second order d.e. d 2y dt2 \u0000 dy dt \u0000 2y =0 has general solution y = Ae \u0000t + Be 2t. It has 2 arbitrary constants. Whereas y =3e \u0000t +4e 2t is a particular solution, where A =3 and B =4. The order of the d.e. corresponds to the number of arbitrary constants in the general solution. If the d.e. is of the form d ny dxn = f(x), the general solution y can easily be found by integrating n times. Example 5.1.2. Solve (at this stage it means “ﬁnd the general solution”) d 2y dx2 =cos x. Now, if we are given some extra information (often called boundary conditions, or initial conditions) we can use this information to ﬁnd the arbitrary constants. This will give the particular solution. Example 5.1.3. Find the particular solution to the above d.e. d 2y dx2 =cos x, given that y =0 and dy dx =0 when x =0. In this chapter, we shall concentrate on solving ﬁrst order ordinary di↵erential equations. We shall consider 4 types namely: VARIABLE SEPARABLE, HOMOGENEOUS, EXACT and LINEAR. 64 5.2 Variable Separable E & P 1.4 A d.e. is said to be variable separable if it can be written in the form M(x)dx = N(y)dy. To solve this we integrate the left hand side with respect to x and the right hand side with respect to y. Note, the d.e. may ﬁrst have to be put in the required form, you ﬁrst have to separate the variables. Example 5.2.1. Solve dy dx = sin x cos y . Example 5.2.2. Solve dy dx =2xy. Example 5.2.3. Solve xy dy dx =1 \u0000 x 2. Example 5.2.4. Homework: Solve dy dx =(3x +2) \u00002.Solution: y = \u00001 3(3x+2) + c. Example 5.2.5. Homework: Find the particular solution to dy dx = y2 given that y(0) = 1 or if x =0 then y =1. Solution: y = 1 1\u0000x. Example 5.2.6. Find the particular solution of the d.e. (1 + 4x 2)dy =(1 \u0000 y2)dx given that y =3 when x =1/2. Example 5.2.7. Solve y(x +1) dy dx = x 2 +2. 65 Example 5.2.8. The rate of decay of a radioactive substance is proportional to the quantity Q which remains. Initially, Q = 2g. If it takes 8 hours for the quantity to reduce to 50% (called the half life), how long will it take for the quantity to reduce from 2g to 0.1g? Solution: Proportional, hence dQ dt = kQ,where k< 0 because of decay. Example 5.2.9. Homework: Solve y \u0000 x dy dx =1 + x 2 dy dx. Solution: y =1 + Ax 1+x. 5.2.1 Tutorial questions — Variables separable D1.

Solve the di↵erential equation dy dt = k b y(b \u0000 y)and verifythatthe generalsolutionis the logistic curve y = b/(1 + Re \u0000kt), where R is the arbitrary constant. (See Calculus Chapter 5 Question ??.) Show that the solution can be rewritten in the form y = 1 2b{1+ tanh( 1 2kt \u0000 ↵)},where ↵ = 1 2 ln R and the hyperbolic tangent is deﬁned by tanh ✓ = sinh ✓ cosh ✓ (see Algebra Chapter 5). 5.3 Homogeneous E & P 1.6 (p62) Adi↵erential equation issaid to behomogeneousif it isof theform M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy =0, where M(x, y)and N(x, y)are functions in x and y, with the SAME total degree. i.e. the total sum of the exponents of x and y for every term is the same. Example 5.3.1. (y2x 2 + xy3 + x5 y )dx \u0000 (x 4 + y4 + x 3/2y5/2)dy =0 has the same total degree 4. Example 5.3.2. (y2 + xy +1)dx =(x 2 + y + x3 y )dy has not, because of 1 and y. 66 5.3.1 Solving a homogeneous d.e. Ahomogeneous di↵erential equation can be written in the form dy dx = f(y/x)= M(x, y) N(x, y) , or if we put y = vx then dy dx can be written as a function of v only dy dx = f(v). Total degree k =) for everyx myn,m + n = k,so x m(vx) n = x m+nvn = x kvn Therefore, every term will have x k in the numerator and denominator and it will cancel, leaving afunction in v only. Example 5.3.3. Let (4x +5y)dx +(x \u0000 4y)dy =0. The total degree is 1 everywhere. Example 5.3.4.

Find the particular solution of (b) such that y =1 when x =1. 5.4 Exact E & P 1.6 (p68) 5.4.1 Total di↵erential In order to fully understand EXACT di↵erential equations we ﬁrst need to look at the partial chain rule done in Chapter 4. Suppose f is a function of 2 variables x and y,where x and y are themselves functions of u.Then by the partial chain rule we saw that df du = @f @x dx du + @f @y dy du. If we cancel the di↵erential du we obtain df = @f @x dx + @f @y dy, which is called the total di↵erential of f. 5.4.2 Deﬁnition of an exact d.e. A d.e. is said to be exact if it is of the form M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy =0 and if there is a function f(x, y) such that the left hand side of this d.e. is the total di↵erential of f.i.e., M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = df M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = @f @x dx + @f @y dy. Equating coe\u0000cients we get ( M(x, y)= fx N(x, y)= fy. 68 Now if we di↵erentiate M(x, y)partiallywithrespectto y and N(x, y)withrespectto x, we obtain: My(x, y)= fxy and Nx(x, y)= fyx and if we use the fact that the mixed derivatives fxy and fyx are equal we get My(x, y)= Nx(x, y), which is called the TEST FOR EXACTNESS. This checks whether the d.e. is exact or not. This must be done before attempting to solve the d.e. Finally, if df =0 or df du =0 then f(x, y)mustbe aconstant. Sothe ﬁnalgeneralsolutionis of the form f(x, y)= c. 5.4.3 Solving an exact d.e. We have all the information on how to solve an exact d.e. from the previous subsection. • We ﬁrst make sure the d.e. is of the form M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy =0. • We state what M(x, y)and N(x, y)areequalto. • We perform the test for exactness and check that My(x, y)= Nx(x, y), if it is then we process, otherwise we stop and try to relable the d.e.(separable, homogeneous or linear). • Our aim is now to ﬁnd f(x, y). • We write M(x, y)= fx and integrate with respect to x to get f,treating y as a constant. The constant of integration will be some function of y,say 1(y). • We do the same thing for N(x, y)= fy.We integrate with respect to y,treating x as a constant. The constant of integration will be some function of x,say 2(x). • We end up with two versions of f(x, y), we amalgamate them, making sure equal terms are not repeated. • Once f(x, y) is found, the ﬁnal general solution is just f(x, y)= c. Example 5.4.1. Solve (6x +9y +11)dx +(9x \u0000 4y +3)dy =0. Example 5.4.2. Solve (x 2 + y2)dx +(2xy +cos y)dy =0. Example 5.4.3. in handout:Solve (sin y + ye x)dx +(x cos y + e x)dy =0. Example 5.4.4. Homework in handout:Solve (12x \u0000 4y +2)dx +(18y \u0000 4x +1)dy =0. Solution: 6x 2 \u0000 4xy +2x +9y2 + y = c. Example 5.4.5. Solve (tan y + y sec x tan x)dx +(x sec 2 y +sec x)dy =0. 69 5.4.4 Tutorial questions — Exact equations D4. First test for exactness and then ﬁnd the general solution of the di↵erential equations below. (a) xy{2sin(x + y)+ x cos(x + y)} dx + x 2{sin(x + y)+ y cos(x + y)} dy =0 (b) (1 + ye xy) dx +(2y + xe xy) dy =0 (c) (2x +3y +1) dx +(3x +4y \u0000 1) dy =0 (d) ln(1 + y2 x2 ) dx \u0000 2arctan( y x) dy =0. Find the particular solution of (b) such that y =1 when x =0. D5. If ux = vy and uy = \u0000vx (Cauchy-Riemann equations), show that the di↵erential equa- tions udx \u0000 vdy =0 and vdx + udy =0 are exact. 5.5 Linear E & P 1.5 A d.e. is said to be LINEAR if it can be written in the form: dy dx + P (x)y = Q(x), where P (x)and Q(x)are functions of x only. Note there is only one term in y only, no y2 etc... The form may be disguised, for example (P (x)y \u0000 Q(x))dx + dy =0 is a linear d.e.. Example 5.5.1. The equation dy dx +2y cot x =cos x is linear where P (x)= 2 cot x and Q(x)= cos x. 5.5.1 Solving a linear d.e. We aim to transform the linear d.e. into a d.e. that can easily be solved. We ﬁrst ﬁnd an expression called the integrating factor,denoted by µ.It is, for a reason that will be explained µ = e R P (x)dx. Note, that when integrating P (x)noconstantis added, this constantgets cancelledlateronin the process. Check it for yourself! Take the original linear d.e. and multiply each term by µ to obtain dy dx + P (x)y = Q(x) µ dy dx + µP (x)y = µQ(x) e R P (x)dx dy dx + e R P (x)dx P (x)y = e R P (x)dx Q(x). 70 Now, let’s look at the left hand side. This is in fact the derivative of a product, by the product rule we have d dx ⇣ ye R P (x)dx⌘ = dy dx e R P (x)dx + ye R P (x)dx P (x). Thus d dx ⇣ ye R P (x)dx⌘ = e R P (x)dx Q(x), or d dx(yµ)= µQ(x). We integrate with respect to x: ye R P (x)dx = Z e R P (x)dx Q(x) dx, or yµ = Z µQ(x) dx. Do not cancel µ,it is nota constantthatcan go outside the integral!. Finally we solve for y. Example 5.5.2. Solve dy dx +2y cot x =cos x. Example 5.5.3. Solve dy dx +2xy = x 3. Example 5.5.4. in handout:Solve dy dx \u0000 y tan x =tan x +sec x. Example 5.5.5. Solve (x +1) dy dx + y =ln x, given that x =1 and y =10. Example 5.5.6.
