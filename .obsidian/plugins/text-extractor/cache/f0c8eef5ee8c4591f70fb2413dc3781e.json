Example: An expe riment to test Galileo ’s hypothes is that all objects fall at the same rate in the absenc e of air res istance: A table -tennis ball and a golf ball are dropped from same height Prof. Vered Aharonson 2018 18 Requirements (1 ) Convert measurements into scie n tific notation. Use significan t figures in measurements and calculations. In terpret data in tables and graphs, and recognize rules that summarize data. Prof. Vered Aharonson 2018 19 Accuracy, Precision, Uncertainty • Accuracy = a descrip tion of ho w close a measurement is to the correct or accep ted value of the quantity measured. • Precision = the degree of exactne ss of a measurement. • uncertain ty = a numeric measure of con fidence in a measurement or result. • A lo w er un certain ty indicates greater con fidence.
