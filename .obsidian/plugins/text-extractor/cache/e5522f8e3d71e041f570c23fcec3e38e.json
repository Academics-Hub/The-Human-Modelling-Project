Xulu Room: 2P13, School of Anatomical Science Office no. 011 717 2208 Email: kutlwano.xulu@wits.ac.za Lecture objectives • Describe the constituents of the cardiovascular system: • Heart: muscular pump • Blood vessels: transport of blood • Lymphatic vessels: immune surveillance • The histology of the heart • The general histological pattern of blood vessels • Identify , classify and describe the structure and function of blood vessels • Compare and contrast between the histology of blood vessels • The histology, location and function of three types of capillaries Disclaimer Please note that the purpose of this lecture is to provide an overview of the work. Lecture notes alone are not sufficient to prepare for tests and examinations. Students are advised to supplement with readings from the prescribed textbook, completion of exercises from the histology practical manual and other relevant resources. Overview of the cardiovascular system • Transport system that carries blood and lymph to and/or from tissues of the body • Constituents (in your notebook list the functions of each); -Heart -Blood vessels -Lymph vessels • Two circuits distribute blood to the vessels of the heart: -Pulmonary circulation: conveys blood from the heart to the lungs and vice versa -Systemic circulation: conveys blood from the heart to other tissues of the body and vice versa LUMEN EPITHELIAL LINING MUSCULAR WALL SURROUNDING CONNECTIVE TISSUE General pattern of the heart and blood vesselsGeneral structure of the heart • Muscular pump that maintains unidirectional flow of blood • Consists of four chambers (right and left atria and ventricles) • Valves guard the exit of the chambers and prevent backflow of blood • Heart wall constituents: -Cardiac muscle -Fibrous skeleton -Impulse conducting system images.radiopaedia.org ▪ Endocardium;  Innermost layer  Endothelium + subendothelial CT  Consists of three layers  Subendocardial CT = specialised cardiac muscle fibres ▪ Myocardium;  Middle layer  Cardiac muscle ▪ Epicardium;  Outermost layer  Mesothelium lining underlying Ct  Blood vessels and nerves  Adipose tissue Histological structure: Heart ww.ouhsc.edu www.stylepinner.com Histology of the heart wall This is what you would typically see when looking at the heart on low power (LP) using Olyvia. You need to orientate yourself using the features characteristic of each layer. Even though some features do not resolve clearly at LP (like the endothelium) but you can see the white area (adipose tissue) with blood vessels so you have located the epicardium (using the characteristic features for that layer), and you can use that as your starting point. Epicardium Myocardium Endocardium Image: OlyVIA MYOCARDIUM mesotheliumAdipose tissue Loose CT EPICARDIUM ENDOCARDIUM Endothelium Smooth muscle & CT cardiac muscle fibres CT and conducting system Study the features of the heart wall layer in detail. Revise cardiac muscle lecture (primary tissues) to help you identify features of the cardiac muscle . What is unique about the cardiac muscle fibres found in the endocardium? Purkinje fibres vs Cardiac muscle fibres • Wider in diameter compared to ordinary CM fibres • Glycogen space larger than myocytes • Myofibril arranged at the periphery • Terminal part of the conducting system • Function; receive, conducts and transmits contractile impulse to the myocardium. A B With reference to the micrograph provided, identify which type of cardiac muscle fibres are found in the region labelled A and B? LUMEN EPITHELIAL LINING MUSCULAR WALL SURROUNDING CONNECTIVE TISSUE The general histological pattern of blood vessels Remember to keep this pattern in mind as you study each blood vessel! General features of blood vessels The walls are composed of three layers called tunics 1. Tunica Intima (TI): • Innermost layer • Contains 3 components; -Endothelium (classify this?) with basal lamina -Subendothelial layer (contains loose CT, scattered smooth muscle cells) -Internal elastic membrane/laminae (IEL) 2. Tunica media (TM): • Middle layer • Circumferentially arranged layers of smooth muscles • Variable amounts of elastin, reticular fibres and proteoglycans interposed between the smooth muscle cells • Fenestrated elastic sheets or lamellae arranged in a circular layer (why are they fenestrated) 3. Tunica adventitia (TA): • Outermost layer • Primarily composed of longitudinally arranged collagenous tissue and elastic fibres • May contain external elastic laminae • Merges with the loose CT surrounding the vessels • Relatively thin in arterial system but thicker in venous system • In large arteries and veins contains a system of blood vessels called vasa vasorum and the nerves www.lab.anhb.uwa.edu.au/mb140/ Keep in mind that these are general features and may be variable in different blood vessels, especially the proportions of each and some features may be absent or less prominent in some blood vessels! Contrast between arteries and veins • Tunica intima: • IEL generally present in arteries but variable in veins. • Tunica media: • Thicker than TA in arteries. • IEL present in arteries except large arteries (not easily discerned). Veins generally lack EEL • Tunica adventitia: • In veins TA is wider than TM Regents of the University of Michigan Medical School © 2012) Large (elastic) artery • Tunica intima: • Endothelium + • Subendothelial layer: CT, elastic fibers and smooth muscle • IEL inconspicuous (why is this layer not prominent? ) • Tunica media: • Is substantially greater than TA • Multiple layers of smooth muscles • Consists of fenestrated elastic lamellae • Some collagen fibres and ground substance (which cell type secretes these?) • Tunica adventitia: • Relatively thin compared to TM • Collagen and loose network of elastic fibres • Fibroblasts and macrophages • Vasa vasorum (what is the function of these?) • Network of autonomic nerves called nervi vascularis • Function: conveys blood from the heart to the systemic and pulmonary circulation www.embryology.med.unsw.edu.au Large vein • Tunica intima: • Endothelium • Small subendothelial CT, elastic fibers and smooth muscle • prominent valves • Indistinct boundary between TI and TM • Tunica media: • Relatively thin compared to TA • Circumferentially arranged layers of smooth muscle and collagen fibres, and fibroblasts • Tunica adventitia: • Thickest layer • May contain longitudinally arranged smooth muscle cells with collagen and elastic fibers • Vasa vasorum • Function: Returns blood to the heart www.lab.anhb.uwa.edu.au/mb140/ Large (Elastic) Artery (aorta) Large vein (vena cava) www.embryology.med.unsw.edu.au Compare and contrast… Medium (muscular) artery • Tunica Intima: • Endothelium and basal lamina • Sparse sub-endothelial layer • Prominent IEL (wavy appearance) • Tunica Media: • Multiple layers of SM • Few elastic fibres, more collagen fibres • Tunica Adventitia: • Fibroblast, collagen fibres, elastic fibres, scattered adipose cells • Prominent EEL • Vasa vasorum • Nerves • Function: distributes blood to all organs and maintains steady blood pressure and flow www.lab.anhb.uwa.edu.au/mb140/ Medium vein • Tunica intima: • Endothelium with basal lamina, • Thin subendothelial layer • May contain a thin IEL • Prominent valves • Tunica media: • Relatively smaller than TA • Thinner than TM of medium sized artery • Circumferentially arranged layers of smooth muscle interspersed with collagen and elastic fibres • Tunica adventitia: • Thicker than TM • Collagen fibres and a network of elastic fibres • Function: carries blood to larger veins TI TM TA Images: OlyVIA Medium artery Medium vein Ross & Pawlina, 2011 Compare and contrast… Muscular artery Large artery Large vein Medium vein www.histology.medicine.umich.edu Magscope.com © 2012 AM Gonzalez & DG Perryer, The University of Birmingham UK www.wahoo.nsm.umass.edu Compare and contrast… Small arteries • Tunica intima: • Endothelium • Smaller subendothelial layer • May have IEL • Small arteries typically have CT, little SM and an IEL (not be present in an arteriole) • Tunica media: • May have as many as 8 layers of smooth muscle • Tunica adventitia: • Thin CT • Function (?)

A B C 12 3 Lymphatic vessels • Conveys fluids from tissues into the bloodstream (unidirectional) • Also distribute lymphocytes, antibodies and other immune components to and from lymphoid tissues • More permeable than blood capillaries (consist of endothelium with an incomplete basal lamina) • Lymphatic capillaries converge into larger lymphatic vessels • Thin walled vessels that collect excess interstitial fluid (protein-rich) called lymph and return it to the blood via veins • Lined by endothelium • Contain valves (more than in veins) why? • Generally have a thin wall similar (shares similarities to venules) Layers Heart Blood vessel Inner layer Middle layer Outer layer Exercise 1.
