{"path":"Physiology/Physiology Slides/Energy Metabolism.pdf","text":"1 Hello PHSL 2004A Class of 2023. I am Eliton Chivandi [P.G. Dip. Health Sci. Edu., BSc. Hons., MSc., PhD; Room: 7M09 ], an Associate Professor in the Wits School of Physiology. I look forward with excitement to facilitating you through this section of the course. A WARM WELCOME TO THE ENERGY METABOLISM SECTION Introduction: This section of the course is made up of 3 lectures, 1 reinforcement session and 1 tutorial. The reinforcement session will combine a discussion on content covered for both ENERGY METABOLISM and LIPID METABOLISM. Questions for the tutorial are attached at the end of the your “Energy Metabolism” and “Lipid Metabolism” lecture content slide series. The quiz, which contributes towards your formative assessment and year mark for each of the sections (Energy Metabolism and Lipid Metabolism) will be posted online as per the timetable. Lectures and Content Delivery Approach: The three lectures will cover content on 3 major sub-sections, that is, “Whole Body Energy”, “The Krebs/TCA Cycle” and “The Electron Transport” Chain.” Specific themes/concepts to be covered under each sub-section are highlighted in the slide designated “Content Outline” in the lecture content slide series. Content will be delivered in a series of VOPPs which will be uploaded on the ULWAZI. You will also have access to hard copy (printed) and uploaded PDF of the lecture slides. Please engage with the content. You are encouraged to write down any points that you need further clarity on. We will engage on such points/questions during the reinforcement session. Quiz: It is encouraged that you go through the section lecture content and actively participate during the reinforcement sessions before attempting the quiz. Please observe the quiz upload, open and submission dates. It is best that you work through the quiz questions a little in advance so that you do not have to be pressured to submit at the last minute. Tutorial: Tutorial questions are attached at the end of your “Energy Metabolism” course pack. I have deliberately given these in advance so that you prepare in order for us to have fruitful engagement during the tutorial. Discussion: I will frequently check the “Discussion Forum of Ulwazi.” Should you have any questions I encourage you to post them on this platform so that everybody benefits and we avoid duplication of the same questions. I will endeavour to check the “discussion forum on Ulwazi” once daily during the course lectures and provide answers to posted questions. I urge you to also have a constant look on the forum. I trust that you will enjoy the “Energy Metabolism” lecture series. All the best, Eliton. 2 Content Outline 1.

Complex metabolic syndrome associated with / characterised by loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass. Protein-energy malnutrition: PEM results from severe deficiency of dietary intake of energy and protein Anorexia: An eating disorder characterised by abnormally low body weight, fear to gain body weight & strong desire to be thin resulting in food intake restriction. Also called anorexia nervosa Lifestyle choices Excess energy intake: high fat high sugar diets Sedentary lifestyle Excess energy intake results in OBESITY which causes metabolic derangements, e.g. insulin resistance, hyperlipidaemias & metabolic diseases, for example metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes mellitus Kwashiorkor: severe deficiency of dietary protein. Signs – thinning & hair loss, “pot bell”, oedema & generalised body swelling, flaky rash, skin depigmentation, loss of muscle mass, stunting, diarrhoea, 4 ENERGY AND NUTRITION: THE BENEFITS OF EXERCISE Physical Inactivity: • excess energy converted to fat • fat deposited around the waist area & in and around key organs • obesity sets in leading to metabolic ill-health Exercise/Physical Activity: • burns off excess energy • prevent development of obesity • improves health 5 ENERGY AND NUTRITION: FOOD AND NUTRIENTS Food provides a. energy necessary to support biochemical reactions that maintain homeostasis b. substances/substrates necessary for: • building & maintaining the body • specific bodily functions Macronutrients/energy sources • carbohydrates • fats • proteins (important only in starvation) NB: macronutrients are the fuel molecules are oxidised to generate ATP Micronutrients – essential • vitamins – fat soluble and water soluble • minerals NB: these form precursors of coenzymes (vitamins) and cofactors (minerals) required for enzyme catalytic function in metabolic reactions 6 ENERGY AND NUTRTITION: ENERGY MEASUREMENTS Units of Energy Measurement Determination of Energy Content of Foods Energy is measured in units of HEAT • 1 small calorie (cal) = heat energy required to increase the temperature of 1g of water by 1°C • 1 joule = energy used when a force of 1N moves a mass through 1m o 1 cal = 4.184 J 1 joule = 0.24 cal Point to note: In nutrition 1 LARGE calorie (Cal) = 1000 cal or 1 kcal = 4.2 kJ is used as a measure of energy Bomb calorimetry used – gives GROSS (POTENTIAL) ENERGY value Nutrient Gross Energy Values • carbohydrates: 17 kJ/g • fats: 38.9kJ/g • proteins: 22.5 kJ/g Actual Physiological Energy Values • carbohydrates: 17 kJ/g • fats: 37 kJ/g • proteins: 17kJ/g • alcohol: 29 kJ/g 7 ENERGY AND NUTRITION: FOOD PYRAMID & RECOMMENDED ENERGY INTAKE Points to Note: • A balanced diet – ENERGY must come from CARBOHYDRATES, PROTEINS & FATS • ENERGY should mostly be gained from FRUIT, VEGETABLES & UNPROCESSED CEREALS to ensure enough adequate supply of MICRONUTRIENTS • Recommended adult energy intake = approx. 10 000 kJ/day (or 2 400 Cal/day) 8 CALORIMETRY: THE MEASUREMENT OF ENERGY EXPENDITURE a. Direct calorimetry: measures heat generated to measure heat expenditure b. Indirect calorimetry: relates energy expenditure to O2 consumption Point to Note: Use of indirect calorimetry is beset with a challenge because oxygen consumption differs depending on whether carbohydrates or fat is being metabolised 9 ENERGY EXPENDITURE: RESPIRATORY QUOTIENT The respiratory quotient (RQ) is the RATIO of the VOLUME OF CARBON DIOXIDE EVOLVED to that of OXYGEN CONSUMED by an organism, tissue, or cell in a given time Respiratory quotient = moles of CO2 produced = CO2 expired (VCO2) moles of O2 consumed O2 inhaled (VO2) For the aerobic oxidation of only glucose for energy: C6H12O6 + 6O2 6CO2 + 6H2O • therefore the RQ when using only glucose = 6CO2 = 6 = 1 6O2 6 For the oxidation of fatty acids for energy (palmitic acid as an example): C16H32O2 +23O2 16CO2 + 16H2O • therefore the RQ when using only fats = 16CO2 = 16 = 0.7 23O2 23 Point to note: The RQ for protein = ~ 0.84. This is usually ignored 10 RESPIRATORY QUOTIENT The respiratory quotient of a balanced diet is ~ 0.82 For the RQ = 0.82, energy expenditure = 20.2 kJ/l of O2 consumed Therefore estimated energy expended (kJ) = VO2 (l) × 20.2 kJ/l Average energy expenditure is ~ 10 000kJ/day which equates to 500L of O2 per day • basal metabolism – 60-70% • thermogenesis – 10-20% • external work/physical activity – 10-20% NB: The energy expenditure of an individual depends mostly on exercise levels 11 ENERGY EXPENDITURE AND BASAL METABOLIC RATE Basal metabolic rate (BMR): energy expenditure required to maintain body functions at complete rest • Energy spent in maintenance of normal physiological functions • measured following 12 hrs fasting & at comfortable temperatures Factors Affecting BMR Point to note: BMR equates to metabolic activity of CELLS & TISSUES, BLOOD CIRCULATION & AWAKE STATE • when sleeping BMR is ~5% lower versus awake status Tissue Energy Expenditure as Total of BMR • sex • age • body composition • health status • physiological status e.g. pregnant, lactating • brain function ~20% • liver ~25% • muscle ~25% • heart ~9% • kidney ~8% • adipose ~4% 12 ENERGY EXPENDITURE: THERMOGENESIS Thermogenesis: heat production in the body by physiological actions/metabolic processes Types of Thermogenesis • thermic effect of food (specific dynamic action of food/heat increment) • cold and heat-induced thermogenesis • “substance-induced” thermogenesis • psychological thermogenesis • muscle shivering Activi ty Thermogenesis Bas al Point to note: • Physical activity level (PAL) is the most variable part of total energy expenditure • PAL is expressed as a multiple of BMR • A PAL of 1.4 for minimal activity (sedentary) & up to 7 for climbing steps or playing sports 13 FREE ENERGY IN METABOLISM The Concept of Free Energy • Free energy (G) = TOTAL ENERGY in a MOLECULE (mostly harnessed in bonds of the molecule) • G changes when one molecule is converted to another • The change in free energy is ΔG • A + B C + D ΔG = ? • If ΔG is –Ve then ENERGY IS RELEASED (reaction is EXERGONIC) - reaction ENERGETICALLY FAVOURABLE in that direction • If ΔG is +Ve then ENERGY IS CONSUMED (reaction is ENDERGONIC) – reaction NOT energetically favourable in that directionPoints to note: o Energy metabolism: series of oxidation reactions that in total are EXERGONIC & release electrons that are used to drive ATP synthesis o BUT, not all the reactions in the pathway are exergonic: In metabolism many reactions are endergonic, for example; i. Glucose + Pi Glucose-6-phosphate ΔG = +12.6 kJ/mol ii. ATP ADP + Pi ΔG = -31kJ/mol Combining reactions (i) and (ii) = Glucose + ATP Glucose-6-phosphate + ADP ΔG = -18.4 kJ/mol *Coupling reaction (i) with a high energy reaction (ii) allows endergonic reactions to proceed 14 HIGH ENERGY PHSOPHATE MOLECULES High Energy Molecule Reaction(s) and Notes Energy Change ATP ATP ADP + Pi ΔG = -18.4 kJ/mol Phosphoenol pyruvate In glycolysis: PEP + H2O pyruvate + Pi The ΔG is sufficient to generate 1 × ATP: PEP + ADP + H2O pyruvate + ATP NB: an example of ATP synthesis by Substrate Level Phosphorylation ΔG = -62kJ/mol ΔG = -31kJ/mol Creatine phosphate Creatine phosphate + H2O Creatine + Pi *if reaction is combined with ADP Creatine phosphate + H2O + ADP Creatine + ATP Pi ΔG= -43 kJ/mol Points to Note: • The reaction is fully reversible; creatine phosphate is used to ‘store’ ATP in skeletal and cardiac muscle and brain • The reaction is catalysed by creatine kinase (CK or CPK) & there are three different isoenzymes of creatine kinase CK-MM in skeletal muscle, CK-MB in cardiac muscle and CK-BB in nervous tissue • Creatine is broken down to creatinine and excreted in the urine 15 ENERGY METABOLISM Food Fats (Triacylglycerides) Carbohydrates (polysaccharides) Proteins Fatty acids Monosaccharides Amino acids Acetyl-CoA NH4+ & urea TCA cycle (Krebs cycle) CoA 2CO2 Electrons (e-) (NADH2) ETC ADP + Pi ATP O-2H+ O2 H2O Oxidative phosphorylation 16 THE KREBS’ /TRICARBOXYLIC ACID CYCLE Hans Krebs (1900- 1981) • Hans Krebs elucidated the cycle • The Krebs cycle - common pathway for the AEROBIC OXIDATION of fuels (carbohydrates, fats and proteins) for ATP/energy production Pyruvate Fatty acids Amino acids Acetyl-CoA Acetyl group Acetyl-CoA Point to Note: The Krebs cycle OXIDISES the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA 17 KREBS CYLCE SITE AND INTERMEDIATES Site of the Krebs Cycle Krebs Cycle Intermediates Krebs cycle reactions occur in the INNER MITOCHONDRIAL MATRIX In addition to producing reduced co-enzymes, GTP and CO2, the Krebs cycle provides metabolic intermediates for the synthesis of: • amino acids and glucose • fatty acids and haem • neurotransmitters 18 KREBS CYCLE: ENZYMES & REACTIONS AND PRODUCTS Cycle Reactions and Enzymes • 8 enzymes catalysed reactions • Reacts 3 and 4 are OXIDATIVE DECARBOXYLATIONS • 2 acetyl group carbon are oxidised (‘blown off”) as CO2 Cycle Products • four pairs of electrons are removed o 3 ×NADH & 1 × FADH2 • one molecule of GTP produced – equivalent to 1 × ATP • net energy production per turn of the cycle = 12 ATP 19 REGULATION OF THE KREBS CYCLE Cycle Stimulators Cycle Inhibitors • Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) • Calcium ions (Ca2+) • Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) • Reduced NAD (NADH) • Guanine triphosphate (GTP) • Succinyl-CoA Points to Note: • availability of NAD+ and FAD + - these coenzymes are required for the cycle to occur • increased ATP inhibits the enzymes of the cycle • increased ADP stimulates the enzymes of the cycle • ISOCITRATE DEHYDROGENASE, which cataylses conversion of citrate to α-ketoglutarate, is the RATE LIMITING ENZYME 20 REPLENISHING THE KEREBS (TCA) CYCLE The Krebs/TCA cycle is replenished from a variety of substrates whose metabolites enter it at different points Points to Note: • Oxaloacetate is produced from pyruvate derived from alanine by ALT during gluconeogenesis, or from glucose during glycolysis • Oxaloacetate is produced from the amino acid, aspartate (by aspartate transaminase, AST) during protein catabolism • α-ketoglutarate is produced from the amino acid, glutamate (by transaminases) during protein catabolism • Succinyl-CoA is produced from catabolism of amino acids and fatty acids (with odd numbers of carbon atoms) • Fumarate is produced from catabolism of amino acids 21 METABOLISM OF α-KETOGLUTARATE & PYRUVATE: SIMILARITIES Pyruvate α-Ketoglutarate Acetyl-CoA Succinyl-CoA CO 2 CO 2 NA D + NA D + NADH 2 NAD H2 Pyruvate dehydrogenase α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase Points to note: The metabolism of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and α-ketoglutarate is catalysed by dehydrogenases • both enzymes catalyse oxidative decarboxylation reactions • both enzymes require thiamine as a co-enzyme • therefore both enzymes are affected by thiamine deficiency 22 ENERGY METABOLISM: RIBOFLAVIN AND THIAMINE DEFICIENCY Angular stomatit is Thiamine deficiency – wet & dry beriberi Riboflavin deficiency: marasmic child and older boy with angular stomatitis, a sign of riboflavin deficiency (Source: Dr Roger Whitehead) 23 ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN & OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION: AN INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW The chain operates like a conveyor belt system and is dependent on the availability of O2. Oxygen is the terminal electron acceptor. Therefore any condition that impact the basal metabolic rate and or the supply of oxygen impacts the ETC. Conditions and Factors that May Affect the Electron Transport Chain Hyperthyroidis m Hypothyroidism - with deposition of mucoplysaccharides in the dermis resulting in swelling (puffy appearance) Emphysema: lung condition that causes shortness of breath. Results from alveoli damage which causes a reduction in the area for gaseous exchange Hypoxia – lack of oxygen: ETC requires O2 as the terminal electron acceptor Increases BMR Decreases BMR Reduces O2 supply Inhibits ETC 24 ENERGY METABOLISM: THE MITOCHORIA & OXIDATIVE PHOSPHPRYLATION Intermembr ane space Outer membrane: Small molecules can pass freely through the outer membrane. This outer portion includes proteins called porins, which form channels that allow proteins to cross. The outer membrane also hosts a number of enzymes with a wide variety of functions. Intermembrane space: This is the area between the inner and outer membranes. Inner membrane: This membrane holds proteins that have several roles. Because there are no porins in the inner membrane, it is impermeable to most molecules. Molecules can only cross the inner membrane in special membrane transporters. The inner membrane is where most ATP is created. Cristae: These are the folds of the inner membrane; increase the surface area of the membrane, therefore increasing the space available for chemical reactions. Matrix: This is the space within the inner membrane. Containing hundreds of enzymes, it is important in the production of ATP. Mitochondrial DNA is housed here Points to note: • the outer membrane is permeable • the inner membrane is impermeable to H+ but is permeable to O2, H2O& CO2 • the matrix contains the enzymes for the Krebs/TCA cycle and FA oxidation • enzymes of the electron transport chain are embedded within the inner membrane • the inter-membrane space is important in ATP synthesis 25 Complex I = NADH-Q reductase Complex II = Succinate dehydrogenase (see TCA cycle) Q = Coenzyme Q or ubiquinone Complex III = QH2-cytochrome reductase CytC = cytochrome C Complex IV = Cytochrome oxidase Complex V =ATP synthase/ATPase ORGANISATION OF THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN: AN OVERVIEW 26 Complex I pumps 4H+ across the membrane Complex III pumps 4H+ across the membrane Complex IV pumps 4H+ across the membrane Electrons are passed onto oxygen to form water. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor Point to note: as electrons are passed from Complex III to cytochrome C, they reduce the Fe in the cytochrome from the Fe3+ to Fe2+ state. NAD + THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN: OXIDATION OF NADH + H+ 27 THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN: OXIDATION OF FADH2 FADH2 does not provide enough energy to pump 4H+ across the membrane Electrons are passed onto oxygen to form water.

This drives the synthesis of ATP H+ H+ H+ H + Electron transport is coupled to ATP synthesis H+ H+ H+ H + Complex III Fe-S CytC Fe 3+ Complex IV Haem 4H+ THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN AND ATP SYSNTHESIS/OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION ATP 29 THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN: PHYSIOLOGICAL UNCOUPLING Brown adipose tissue (BAT), through the activity of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis, a major component of facultative thermogenesis in human neonates. The UCP de-links (uncouples) substrate oxidation to ATP production resulting instead in HEAT production • BAT in neonates mitochondria have UCPs and so this tissue generates heat not ATP • Thyroid hormone increases UCPs resulting in increased heat production 30 THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN: CHEMICAL-INDUCED UNCOUPLING Chemical uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria inhibit the coupling between the ELECTRON TRANSPORT and phosphorylation reactions and thus inhibit ATP synthesis without affecting the respiratory chain and ATP synthase. Use/abuse of these substances results in OVERHEATING which can cause death. Chemical Uncouplers: An Example 2,4-dinitrophenol • chemical uncoupler that causes weight loss • treatment facilitates “burning” of fats o also caused patients deaths • Source: Efraim Racker (A New Look at Mechanisms in Bioenergetics, Academic Press, 1976, p. 155) The Mail on Sunday: 20th April 2013 Killed by tablets they took to lose weight.

However HYPOXIA (lack of oxygen) inhibits the entire electron transport chain • Complex I inhibitors - amobarbitol (a barbiturate) and retonone • Complex IV inhibitors - carbon monoxide and cyanide • Hypoxia –inhibits the entire electron transport chain 32 ENERGY AND NUTRITION: A SUMMARY • food provides the body’s energy supply in the form of the macronutrients; CARBOHYDRATES, FATS and PROTEINS • foods that have a high fat content have a higher energy density (37 kJ/g) than foods that consist predominantly of carbohydrate (17 kJ/g) or protein (17 kJ/g) • lipids require more oxygen than do carbohydrates for complete conversion to ATP, CO2 and H2O, resulting in a lower RQ [CO2 produced/O2 consumed =0.7] than for carbohydrates (1.0) • total energy expenditure is the sum of the energy used for basal metabolism, thermogenesis and physical activity. • an imbalance between energy consumption (food intake) and total energy expenditure results in storage as fat (weight gain) or metabolism of fat stores (weight loss). 33 ENERGY METABOLISM: A SUMMARY OF THE KREBS/TCA CYCLE The chemical energy of food is transferred in the form of electrons (hydrogen atoms or hydride ions) to the redox co-enzymes, NAD + and FAD, mostly in the TCA cycle The reduced co-enzymes (NADH & FADH2) are used to synthesize ATP, which provides energy for endergonic metabolic processes The TCA (Krebs) cycle oxidizes the 2 carbons and 8 electrons of the CH3CO (acetyl) group of acetyl-CoA to 2 × CO2, 1×FADH2 and 3×NADH molecules, while converting 1 GDP to GTP The activity of the TCA cycle is regulated by availability of the oxidized NAD+ co-enzyme (co-substrate) and oxaloacetate (substrate). TCA cycle enzymes are activated by ADP and inhibited by NADH TCA cycle intermediates are used to synthesize glucose, fatty acids, amino acids and haem. TCA cycle intermediates are replenished from metabolism of pyruvate, amino acids and fatty acids 34 ENERGY METABOLISM – A SUMMARY OF THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN I The electron transport chain uses the redox (electrical) energy of the electrons in the reduced co-enzymes, NADH and FADH2, to pump protons (H+) across the mitochondrial inner membrane, while transferring electrons from the co-enzymes to oxygen, making H2O The proton concentration gradient across the membrane results in an electrochemical gradient, called the proton-motive force. Protons moving down their concentration gradient through the ATP synthase channel provide the energy to convert ADP to ATP on the matrix side of the membrane The electrochemical gradient can be collapsed by uncoupling protein (UCP) or chemicals. This decreases ATP synthesis, but increases electron transfer, which releases energy as heat Electron transport inhibitors, including barbiturates, cyanide and carbon monoxide, block transfer of electrons from the NADH/FADH2 to oxygen. This decreases both oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis 35 • A pair of electrons from NADH has sufficient energy to generate a total of 3 ATPs • A pair of electrons from FADH2 only has sufficient energy to generate a total of 2 ATPs • ADP stimulates the electron transport chain • About 35% of the energy release from electron transport is captured to synthesise ATP, the rest is given off as heat • If the inner mitochondrial membrane “leaks” protons, less ATP is made, but electron transport (and O 2 consumption) continues. This is known as uncoupling • “Uncoupling” means detaching electron transport from ATP synthesis/oxidative phosphorylation. All of the energy is then given off as heat ENERGY METABOLISM – A SUMMARY OF THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN II 36 TUTORIAL QUESTIONS The diagram below shows carbohydrate metabolic pathways that occur in most cells.
