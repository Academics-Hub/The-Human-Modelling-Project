Respiratory physiology Upper respiratory system Lower respiratory system Respiration involves two separate processes: External respiration:  Exchange of O2 and CO2 between the external environment and the tissue cells. Internal respiration:  Mitochondria • Use up oxygen for metabolic processes. • Produce CO2 (which will be eliminated). Respiratory tree  Upper airways: Nose to pharynx  Lower airways:  Conducting airways: larynx and bronchioles : Air transport, warming, humidification, particle filtration  Anatomic dead space: is the total volume of the conducting airways from the nose to the mouth down to the terminal bronchioles.  Respiratory airways: alveoli.  Surface area for gas exchange. Adapted from Kim et al. Ganong’s review of Medical Physiology, 25th Ed The process of respiration Alveoli Alveoli cross section Alveolar walls consist of: • Type I alveolar cells (Single layer of flattened)  For gaseous exchange • Type II alveolar cells  Covers 5% of alveolar surface epithelium  Secrete pulmonary surfactant • Surfactant  Decreases surface tension allowing for easier alveoli inflation.  Secreted from the 7th month of pregnancy. • Alveoli has humid environment (air saturated with water vapour) • Presence of macrophages in alveoli (fight infection) Respiratory membrane Rate of diffusion across respiratory membrane depends on: - Surface area for diffusion - Thickness of membrane - Pressure gradient of the gasses (O2; CO2) - Distance which gases travel - Solubility of gasses (O2; CO2) Respiratory muscles 1. Diaphragm - forms floor of thoracic cavity - it is a skeletal muscle - it is a muscle of inspiration - contracts during inspiration 2. Intercostal muscles - lie between ribs i. External intercostal muscles - Contract during inspiration ii. Internal intercostal muscles - Contract during forced expiration 3. Abdominal muscles - Contract during forced expiration 2. Mechanics of breathing Muscles of inhalation (Inspiration) • Inspiration is an active process • Before inspiration (‘end of passive expiration’):  Diaphragm relaxes to assume dome shape that protrudes upward into the thoracic cavity.  External intercostal muscles relax. • During Inspiration:  Diaphragm contracts → descends downwards →↑ volume of the thoracic cavity by ↑ the vertical dimension.  Intrapulmonic pressure decreases.  External Intercostal Muscles contract → elevating the ribs (upward & outward)  Sternum pushed forward→ ↑ thoracic cavity in both the front-and-back & side- to-side dimensions.  Neck muscles (accessory) → raise the sternum & elevate the first two ribs, enlarging the upper portion of the thoracic cavity. • Muscles of inspiration  External intercostals, sternocleidomastoids, Scalenes. Muscles of exhalation (Expiration) • During Quite/passive expiration:  Diaphragm relaxes→ volume of the thoracic cavity from the peak inspiratory size.  External intercostal muscles relax.  Intrapulmonic pressure increases.  Elevated rib cage falls because of the force of gravity → volume of the thoracic cavity back to its pre-inspiratory size. • During forced/active expiration:  Abdominal muscles contract → ↑ intra-abdominal P, which exerts an upward force on the diaphragm → vertical dimension of the thoracic cavity.  Internal intercostal muscles contract → flattening the thorax by pulling the ribs downward and sternum inward→ further reducing side to- side and front-and-back dimensions of the thoracic cavity. • Muscles of expiration  Rectus abdominus, internal intercostals Thoracic & Pleural cavity • Pleura:  Thin, transparent, double-layered serous membrane  Lines the thoracic cavity and encases the lungs  Surface secretes intrapleural fluid  lubricates the pleural surfaces  Pleural effusion = abnormal collection of fluid or exudate in pleural cavity. • Pleural sac:  Separates each lung from the thoracic wall  Interior = pleural cavity (visceral pleura)  Exterior = pleural cavity (parietal pleura) • Pleural problems:  Pneumothorax (e.g. stab wound or broken/cracked rib)  Haemothorax  Pleurisy: inflammation of pleural sac  Collapsed lung Respiratory movement (ventilation) • Air moves from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure (P) • Pressure gradient important for air to flow into lungs. • In ventilation: • air flows into and out of the lungs by moving down alternately reversing pressure gradients by cyclic respiratory muscle activity. • Flow of air is directly proportional to P difference • Flow is inversely proportional to resistance of the airways (Flow = ΔP/R) • Thus, Flow = ΔP/R • Inspiration: P atmosphere > P pulmonary • Expiration: P pulmonary > P atmosphere 3. Respiratory pressures • Atmospheric (barometric) pressure (Patm)  Weight of air. • Intrapulmonary pressure (Ppul)  Intra-alveolar pressure (pressure in the alveoli). • Intrapleural pressure(Pip)  Pressure in the intrapleural space. → pressure is lower than Patm  Lack of air in the intrapleural space (fluid filled) and to the lung elasticity. • Transpulmonary pressure (Ppul-ip)  Pressure difference across the wall of the lung.  Intrapulmonary pressure & intrapleural pressure: keep the lungs against the chest wall.  Prevents the lung from collapsing. Inspiration vs Expiration S INSPIRATION Inspiratory muscles contract Thoracic cavity expands Intrapleural pressure becomes more negative Transpulmonary pressure become more positive The lung inflates Alveolar pressure becomes sub-atmospheric Air flows into the lung EXPIRATION Respiratory muscles relax Thoracic cavity decreases in size Intrapleural pressure becomes less negative Transpulmonary pressure decreases Lung size decreases Alveolar pressure becomes greater than atmpspheric P Air flows out of the lung 4. Pulmonary ventilation • Physical Factors Influencing Pulmonary Ventilation 1. Airway resistance 2. Lung compliance 3. Alveolar surface tension 1. Airway resistance Friction  Flow (F) of air is directly proportional to the pressure difference (ΔP)  ΔP = difference between atmospheric and intrapulmonary pressure (pressure gradient)  R = resistance of airways, determined by their radius.  Flow is inversely proportional to resistance of the airways (R) Flow = ΔP/R.  Gas flow is inversely proportional to resistance with the greatest resistance being in the medium-sized bronchi.  ↓ Resistance = ↑Flow  ↑ Resistance = ↓Flow Changes in airway resistance • Pathologies in airway resistance  Asthma & bronchitis: Severe bronchiolar constriction or obstruction. • Fixed obstruction  Intra-thoracic - intra-pulmonary tumour  Extra-thoracic - thyroid tumour Autonomic Nervous System Sympathetic response: bronchodilation.  Epinephrine binds β2 :relaxation of bronchiolar smooth muscle. Parasympathetic: bronchoconstriction.  ACh binds M: contraction of bronchiolar smooth muscle. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJRvhrHxR94 htps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJRvhrHxR94 2. Lung compliance • A measure of the change in lung volume that occurs with a given change in distending (transpulmonary) pressure. • Distensibility of the lung tissue ease at which lungs expand under pressure • Compliance = ∆V/∆P • Normal compliance due to:  Distensibility of the lung tissue  Alveolar surface tension • Decreased distensibility = stiffer lungs. • Decreased ∆V/∆P = decreased compliance • NB: ∆V/∆P • Related to the distensibility of the lung tissue. • Opposed to the elasticity of the lung tissue. • Types of compliance  Static compliance  Dynamic compliance • Alveoli in upper regions have greater volume & are less compliant. • Alveoli in lower parts have greater change in volume during inspiration = better ventilated. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV_J8O0HIQI htps://www.physio-pedia.com/Lung_Compliance Characteristics and consequences of an increased compliance e.g. emphysema  Increased stretch of the lungs.  Reduced elastic recoil.  Difficult to empty. Factors that increase lung compliance  Loss of connective tissue.  Destruction of alveolar walls. Lung compliance cont.… Factors that decrease lung compliance e.g. emphysema – Scar tissue – Reduced production of surfactant. – Decreased mobility of the thoracic cage. Characteristics of decreased compliance  Reduced ability to stretch  Increased recoil Consequences of decreased compliance:  Increased vigorous contraction of Diaphragm & External muscles  Increased work of inspiration Factors that diminish lung compliance:  Scar tissue  Blockage  Oedema  Reduced production of surfactant  Mobility of the thoracic cage 3. Alveolar surface tension • Resists any force that tends to increase the surface area of the liquid. • Thin layer of fluid in alveoli causes inwardly directed force = surface tension • Water molecules strongly attracted to each other. • Causes alveoli to remain as small as possible. • Detergent-like substance called surfactant produced by Type II alveolar cells. • Decreases surface tension in the lungs. • Allows oxygen to dissolve. • Facilitates lung expansion • Lowers alveolar surface tension. • Insufficient in premature babies so that alveoli collapse at end of each exhalation. • Breathing requires effort. • Increased alveolar surface tension  collapsed alveoli. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XzUDClgac Alveolar surface tension cont. - Alveoli different size - Pressure is more important in smaller alveoli - P=2T/r - Pressure in alveoli is directly proportional to surface tension; and inversely proportional to radius of alveoli. - Air in small alveoli will flow into large alveoli. - Does not optimize gas exchange. - Surfactant promotes alveolar stability by reducing tension - Equilibrate pressure in all alveoli – optimize gas exchange 5. Gas exchange • Adequate oxygen from inspired air to sustain aerobic metabolic activity. • Oxygenation - diffusion of oxygen from alveolus to capillary; binds to red blood cells or dissolves in plasma.  Oxygen delivery - rate of transport from lung to periphery  Oxygen consumption - rate of O2 removed from blood to be used by the tissue.  Hypoxaemia - inadequate level of blood oxygen. Basic properties of gases:  The amount of gas that will dissolve in a liquid also depends on its solubility  CO2 is 20 times more soluble in water than in O2  Very little N2 dissolves in water.  Gases move from high to low partial pressure. The amount of gas that moves across a membrane (Vgas) is Inversely proportional to its thickness. Dependent on total surface area (SA).  Dependent on gas solubility (Dc). Dependent on pressure gradient (P1-P2). Vgas = SA x Dc x (P1-P2) . Internal respiration: Blood & cells • Available surface area. • Smallest diffusion distance (thinnest of membranes). • Adequate partial pressure gradients. • The rate of blood flow. External (pulmonary) respiration: Alveoli & Blood. • Large surface area • Smallest diffusion distance (thinnest of membranes) • Adequate partial pressure gradients and gas solubilities • Matching pulmonary air flow (ventilation) and blood flow (perfusion). 1. Available surface area 2: diffusion distance (thinnest of membranes) 3. Adequate partial pressure gradients • In a mixture of gases, each gas exerts a pressure (i.e., each gas has a partial pressure). • A total pressure exerted by a gas mixture is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of its components. • Partial pressure = Total Pressure x % • Consider the following air compositions:  O2 = 21%  CO2 = 0.03%  N2 = 79%  Some water vapor. 6. Concept of partial pressures • Caused by gas molecules • Pressure directly proportional to concentration • Atmospheric air exerts pressure • P = 760 mm Hg (sea level) • It is the sum of partial pressures of gases (Dalton’s law) • Composition of atmosphere:  20.93% O2  0.03% CO2  79.04% N2  Some water vapor • Each of these gases exert partial pressure in the atmosphere • Partial P = % of gas x Total P • Therefore:  PO2 = 160 mm Hg  PCO2 = 0.3 mm Hg  PN2 = 600 mm Hg Composition of air at altitude (Johannesburg) Johannesburg: Atmospheric P = 620 mm Hg • PO2 = 130 mm Hg • PCO2 = 0.19 mm Hg • PN2 = 491 mm Hg Sea level: Atmospheric P = 760 mm Hg • PO2 = 160 mm Hg • PCO2 = 0.3 mm Hg • PN2 = 600 mm Hg Partial pressure (pp) differs throughout the body: • PAO2 = pp of oxygen in the alveolus • PaO2 = pp of oxygen in the arterial blood • PvO2 = pp of oxygen in venous blood • PaCO2 = pp of carbon dioxide in arterial blood Alveolar (PA), Arterial (Pa) & Venous (Pv) Sea level: Atm pressure = 760 mm Hg PAO2 = 110 mm Hg PACO2 = 40 mm Hg PaO2 = 100 mm Hg PaCO2 = 40 mm Hg PvO2 = 40 mm Hg PvCO2 = 46 mm Hg Johannesburg: Atm pressure = 620 mm Hg PAO2 = 85 mm Hg PACO2 = 35 mm Hg PaO2 = 75 mm Hg PaCO2 = 35 mm Hg PvO2 = 40 mm Hg PvCO2 = 46 mm Hg 7. Ventilation-Perfusion Relationship • Ventilation (V): alveolar air flow air which reaches the lungs (g/l) • Perfusion (Q): capillary blood flow “blood which reaches the lung” (l/min) • PAO2 is partial pressure of O2 in the alveolus • PaO2 is the partial pressure of O2 in arterial blood • PaCO2 is the partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood • Alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of O2: • PAO2 - PaO2 =10  > 10 = diffusion defect Calculate V/Q • Alveolar ventilation rate (Va) = RR x (TV –VD) = 12 x (500 ml/breath – 150 ml) = 4200 ml/min = 4,2 L/min • Cardiac output = 5L/min (blood to lungs (Q) Thus V/Q = 4.2/5 = 0.84 (normal value is 0.8) V/Q mismatch: 2/5 = 0.4 Another example: If Va= 4 and CO is 2, then : 4/2 = 2 Ideally match (compliment) each other V/Q = 1 Ventilation Perfusion Force of gravity Blood pools at the base of the lung More blood flow at the base • Pulmonary arterial pressure = 25 (apex) /8 (base) • Increases from the apex to the base. Distribution of blood flow in lungs • The distribution of blood flow in the lung is influenced by both hydrostatic and alveolar pressure. • At the base of the lungs blood flow is high since perfusion pressure exceeds alveolar pressure and hence vascular resistance is low. • At the apex of the lungs blood flow is low because perfusion pressure is less than alveolar pressure. • This compresses the arterioles and vascular resistance is increased. Ventilation-Perfusion mismatch • Normally ventilation and perfusion are reasonably well matched • In pathological states ventilation-perfusion mismatch occurs. • If alveoli are ventilated without being perfused  increase in dead space (alveoli do not take part in gaseous exchange). • Shunting: non-ventilated alveoli remain perfused (blood perfusing the alveoli is poorly oxygenated thus blood leaving the lungs is not fully saturated). • Lung ventilation/Perfusion ratios:  Functionally: alveoli at apex are under-perfused (over-ventilated).  Alveoli at the base are under-ventilated (over-perfused).  V/Q ratio is: HIGHER at the APEX (top) of the lung & LOWER at the BASE (bottom) of the lung. V-Q Ratio • Both ventilation and perfusion increase from apex to base. • However perfusion “Q” increases faster than ventilation “V” • At the apex V > Q • At the base Q > V • V/Q decreases from apex (top) to base (bottom) V/Q disturbances Uniform ventilation Deoxygenated blood Mixed venous blood Uniform blood flow Expected conditions Arterial blood Oxygenated blood htps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjgOA7l8urE No ventilation to A Not fully saturated in oxygen Poorly oxygenated blood Absolute shunt Uniform blood flow to A & B No blood flow to A Alveolar dead space Uniform ventilation to A & B Implications of the V/Q ratio Ventilation/Perfusion Increased Ventilation-Perfusion ratio: - Increased alveolar PO2 - Decreased alveolar PCO2 Decreased Ventilation-Perfusion ratio: - Decreased alveolar PO2 - Increased alveolar PCO2 V/Q disturbances Increased V/Q ratio: Alveolar dead space • When Ventilation > Perfusion • V/Q > 0.8 • Increased PAO2 • Decreased PACO2 Causes of non-uniform perfusion: - Pulmonary emboli. - Compression of pulmonary capillaries (higher alveolar pressures). - Alveoli collapse. - Pneumothorax - Shock (pulmonary vascular hypotension) - Tumours Increased V/Q ratio: Intrapulmonary shunting • Caused by significant alveolar hypoventilation, relating to normal perfusion.  e.g., V/Q <0.8 • Outcome:  Poorly oxygenated blood redirected to the left side of heart.  Results in decreased PaO2  Assessment: O2 therapy Causes of V/Q mismatching Caused uneven resistance to airflow.  Emphysema (collapsed airways)  Asthma (Bronconstriction)  Bronchitis (Inflammation) Non-uniform compliance in the lungs:  Fibrosis  Pulmonary vascular congestion  Atelectasis (collapsed lung) Regulation of perfusion Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction • Diverts blood away from poorly ventilated alveoli. • In response to global hypoxia. • Increased pulmonary artery pressure. • Causes pulmonary capillaries to increase ventilation and perfusion matching. • Limitations:  Pulmonary arteries have small amount of vascular smooth muscles.  Hypoxic vasoconstriction increases right ventricle workload.  Thus increased pulmonary artery pressure causes pulmonary oedema. Reduced ventilation, increased perfusion Increased PCO2 Reduced PaO2 Reduced alveolar smooth muscle contraction Constriction of pulmonary vessels Reduced airway resistance Increased vascular resistance Increased ventilation Reduced perfusion Matching of ventilation and perfusion 8. Transport: O2 & CO2 Transport of O2 and CO2 between the lungs & tissues • Molecular O2 is carried in the blood. • 3% dissolved in plasma → Contributes to the PaO2. • 97% loosely bound to each Fe of haemoglobin (Hb) in RBCs → 4 O2 per Hb → Contributes to SaO2. Terms used to describe ways O2 is transported: 1. Oxyhaemoglobin (HbO2) – oxygen bound to haemoglobin. 2. Reduced haemoglobin/ deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb): when no O2 is bound. 3. Saturated haemoglobin. 4. Partially saturated haemoglobin. Oxygen saturation calculation  PO2 (mm Hg) - is the tension generated by dissolved O2 in plasma.  CO2 (mlO2/dL blood) = (1.34 x [Hb] x %Hb sat) + αPO2  Constant: α = 0.003 ml/dL/mm Hg  CaO2 (mlO2/dL blood) = (1.34 x [Hb] x %Hb sat) + αPO2  = (1.34 ml/gHb x 150g/l x 0.97) + (PO2 x 0.003) O2 and Haemoglobin (Hb) Rate of loading and unloading of O2 is regulated by: PaO2 Temperature Blood pH PaCO2 Concentration of BPG (bisphoshoglycerate; diphosphoglycerate/ 2,3 BPG)  Influence of PO2 on Hb-O2 Saturation:  Oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve shows how binding and release of O2 is influenced by the PO2. Factors Influencing Hb Saturation • Increases in temperature, H+, PCO2, & BPG (in RBC). • Modify the structure of haemoglobin and decrease its affinity for O2. Occurs in systemic capillaries: • Enhance O2 unloading. • This shifts the O2-haemoglobin dissociation curve to the right (decreased affinity) Decreases in these factors shift the curve to the left. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ2eCRN02f4 • Effect of carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions on the curve. • At lung: movement of CO2 from blood to alveoli will decrease blood CO2 & H+ • This shifts the curve to left and increase O2 affinity to Hb allowing more O2 transport to tissues. • At tissues: the reverse occurs. Bohr’s effect CO2 transport CO2 is transported from the tissues to the alveoli in 4 ways:  As the bicarbonate ion formed inside the RBC.  Bound to the globin portion of the haemoglobin molecule.  Forming carbaminohaemoglobin (23%).  Dissolved in the plasma (7%).  As the bicarbonate ion formed outside the RBC (70%).  Each 100 ml of blood carry 4 ml of CO2 from the tissues  Transport of CO2 from the tissues to the lungs in venous blood. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEdt7ykNzAw 9. Regulation of respiration Breathing = automatic, rhythmic, centrally-regulated, with voluntary control.  Generation and maintenance of a respiratory rhythm.  Modulation of rhythm by sensory feedback loops and reflexes, to allow for adaptation.  Recruitment of respiratory muscles appropriate for level of gas exchange. Respiratory centres in the brain  Pontine respiratory group  Pneumotaxic centre  Apneustic centre  Ventral respiratory group  Dorsal respiratory group Phrenic nerves to the diaphragm and the intercostal nerves to the external intercostal muscles Dorsal respiratory group:  Processes inputs from lungs and chemoreceptors.  Provides excitatory inspiratory stimuli to phrenic motor neurons.  Play the main role in the control of respiration. Ventral respiratory group:  Inactive during normal breathing.  Function during increased pulmonary ventilation.  Neurons contribute to both inspiration and expiration. Pontine respiratory group:  Primary function is to limit inspiration.  Increases rate of respiration.  Important in rhythmical respiratory cycle. Pneumotaxic centre (Apneustic centre):  Promote inhalation. 1. Peripheral Chemoreceptors Pain (fractured rib – on inspiration 2. Central Chemoreceptors Located in the ventro-lateral medullary surface of the CNS. Stimulated by:  Change in pH of the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF), but NOT directly.  Affected by changes in blood pH.  Stimulated by increased CO2  More sensitive to a change in PaCO2 than peripheral chemoreceptors.  Stimulated when a person hypoventilates.  Relatively insensitive to [O2] and thus hypoxia. • Control of respiration by O2 less important than CO2. • CO2 and H+ are the major controller of respiration. • CO2 & H+ stimulate both central & peripheral chemoreceptors. • CO2 & H+ can stimulate the respiratory centre directly. • O2 acts on the peripheral chemoreceptors. Oxygen vs Carbon dioxide • The [ ] of O2 is regulated by O2-Hb buffer system. • O2 remains normal even in hypoventilation. • CO2 has no buffer system. • Hypoventilation increases [CO2]. • H+ is the primary stimulus. • But, does not cross blood-brain barrier. • Δ Blood H+ has less stimulus on neurons. • CO2 has less stimulus on neurons but strong indirect effect. • CO2 easily crosses BBB. 10.

Pulmonary ventilation 2. Red blood cells 3. Diffusing capacity 4. Vascularity of tissues 5. Ability of cells to use oxygen Natural acclimatization of people living in high altitude: • Increase chest size • Reduced body size • Increased pulmonary vasculature • Increased right heart size • Increased Hb affinity for oxygen 1, Increased Pulmonary ventilation Breathing air with reduced O2 Reduced PaO2 Chemoreceptors stimulation Impulses to respiratory centre Respiratory rate Pulmonary ventilation 2, Increased red blood cell count Altitude PAO2 PaO2 Erythropoietin production RBC production Tissue oxygenation 3, Increased diffusing capacity Altitude PaO2 Chemoreceptor stimulation Impulses to vasomotor centre Sympathetic impulses Heart rate Heart contractility Bronchodilation Pulmonary blood flow Lung volume Diffusing capacity 4, Cellular oxygenation Effects of 2,3 Bisphosphoglyceric acid (BPG) Altitude PAO2 2,3 BPG Hb affinity to O2 O2 unloading by Hb Tissue oxygenation Chronic mountain sickness 1.

Hypoxia Reduced/Insufficient O2 at the cell level Different types:  Anaemic hypoxia - Reduced number of red blood cells.  Stagnant hypoxia - Reduced blood flow.  Histotoxic hypoxia - Reduced oxygen utilization by cells.  Hypoxic hypoxia - Reduced partial pressure of oxygen in blood.

Disorders of pulmonary circulation Pulmonary Hypertension Right heart failure (Cor pulmonale) Two types: Primary arterial hypertension. • Causes decreased blood flow. • Ventilation > Perfusion (Increased V/Q ratio). Secondary pulmonary hypertension . • Occurs as secondary pathology from primary disease. • E.g., COPD or Congenital heart failure. • Caused by abnormal high pressure in vessels supplying the lungs. • Used to diagnose Obstructive & Restrictive lung disease.  Obstructive lung disease : Speed and amount of expired air is decreased.  Restrictive lung disease : Lung tissue damage prevents full expansion and recoil. Pulmonary function test Types of pulmonary func�on tests Volume-displacement spirometers • Measures forced vital capacity – volume of air expelled. • Measure volume of air expired in one second. • Can detect lung disease. • Helps determine FEV 1/FVC (≥70%) Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) device • Measures the rate of air flow - during expiration. • Asses expiratory muscle strength. • Can detect obstruction to airflow.

Examples of Restric�ve lung diseases 1, Pneumothorax May result from:  Fractured ribs.  Bullet wounds.  Stab wounds Issues: a. Atmospheric air enters pleural space. b. Reduced transpulmonary pressure. c. Lung collapses. d. Inspiratory difficulty. 2, Neuromuscular disease  Implicated in most restrictive lung diseases.  Weak muscles of inspiration.  Reduced lung volumes. 3, Spinal cord injury • Curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis). Causes:  Osteoporosis.  Osteomalacia.  Poliomyelitis. Presentation:  Thoracic cage abnormality.  Reduced lung volumes. 4, Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome 5, Acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) Surfactant dysfunction Obstructive lung diseases • Struggle with expiration (cannot get air out of the lungs) • Increased resistance to air flow • Air remains in the lungs (Hyperinflation + Increased lung volume) • Increased mucus production • Increased P aCO2 • Decreased alveolar ventilation. • Decreased PEFR • Decreased FEV1 • Decreased PaO2 • FEV1/FVC ratio < 70% (0.7) Asthma Disease of the airways. Characterized by:  Narrowing of airways.  Airway inflammation.  Difficult expiring.  Thick mucus secretion.  Oedema in bronchioles  Increased responsiveness to airway stimulus.  Spasm of bronchiolar smooth muscle. Asthma�c response/a�ack Asthma membranes • β2-adrenergic adrenergic receptor agonist: Increase cAMP. • Anti-inflammatory drugs: Corticosteroids. • β-adrenergic receptor agonist binds to the β-2 adrenergic receptors: relaxes bronchiolar smooth muscles. • Bronchodilation reduces airway resistance. • Improves FEV 1 & FEV1/FVC ratio. Chronic Obstructive pulmonary diseases Characterised by recurrent obstruction to airflow. Bronchioles clogged with mucus. Damaged alveoli. Constricted/narrowed airway = reduced ventilation. Causes (of COPD): 1. Smoking is the most common cause  80% to 85% of COPD cases are linked to smoking 2. Asthma predisposes to COPD 3. Deficiency of α1-antitrypsin 4. Hypersensitive airways  Symptoms are absent in the early stages of COPD  Symptoms only appear at the advanced stage of the disease Hyperinﬂa�on in COPD Increased CO2 in COPD Chronic bronchi�s • Caused by cigarette smoking. • Inhibits alveolar macrophages. • Inhibits antiproteases: Increases Proteolytic enzymes activity. • Results in:  Hypertrophy of mucus producing cells.  Increased mucus production.  Airway obstruction/narrowing.  Inflammation & fibrosis of lower passageways.  Cyanosis.  Right sided heart failure.  Bronchial oedema.  Chronic productive cough. Produc�ve cough in bronchi�s Emphysema • Chronic progressive disease. • Destruction of alveoli. • Air enters but can not leave. • Increases work of breathing . • Reduced PEFR, FVC, FEV 1 Results from:  Deficiency of alpha 1-antitrypsin.  Enlargement of air spaces caused by destruction of alveolar walls. Reduced surface area for gas exchange.  Increased compliance.  Loss of lung elastic recoil. Coughing in emphysema Right sided heart failure leads to oedemaRight sided heart failure in COPD Collapse of the airways during expiration in emphysema Respiratory muscles relax Thoracic cavity decreases in size Intrathoracic pressure increases Reduced recoil pressure Patient compresses abdominal muscles to exhale The increased intrathoracic pressure collapses bronchioles Air trapped in the alveoli Treatment of COPD 1. Smoking cessation – slows down progression of the disease 2. Breathing exercises to restore function of the diaphragm 3. Use of bronchodilators: β2- adrenergic agonists & Nicotinic receptor antagonists. 4. Corticosteroids – reduction of inflammation 5. Oxygen therapy Care must be taken in oxygen therapy because if PaO2 rises above 60 mm Hg, the hypoxic drive that drives ventilation through peripheral chemoreceptors may be diminished leading to hypoventilation. Other respiratory challenges: Hypoxaemia Respiratory failure to maintain blood O2 > 60 mm Hg Type 1: - Failure to deliver O 2 into the lungs. - Hypoxaemia without hypercapnia (Increased P aCO2 > 45 mm Hg). Type 2: - Ventilation fails to remove CO 2. - Hypoxaemia with hypercapnia (Increased P aCO2 > 45 mm Hg). Hypoxaemia • Inadequate level of blood oxygen. • Deficient blood oxygen level • Assessed by: Low P aO2 and Low % Hb saturation. Mechanisms of hypoxaemia (low PaO 2) • Low inspired PO 2: Decreased diffusion gradient • Hypoventilation. • Under normal conditions:  Increased Ventilation (V) – increased PaO2  BUT ventilation is decreased . Dyspnoea: shortness of breath  Increased deoxygenated Hb.  Blood has dark red blue colour.  Bluish skin appearance. Acute Hypoxia & Hypercapnia Low PaO2: a. Impaired CNS. b. Cyanosis. c. Cardiac arrhythmias. d. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. High PaCO2: a. Impaired CNS/muscle function. b. Low arterial pH. c. Peripheral vasodilation. d. Cerebral vasodilation. Low PaO2: a. Polycythaemia. b. Pulmonary hypertension. c. Fluid retention/ right sided HF. d. Cyanosis. High PaCO2: a. Renal compensation.  Increased arterial HCO 3- b. CSF compensation.  Increased csf HCO3- Chronic Hypoxia & Hypercapnia Two types of respiratory failure: 1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure Caused by:  Impaired diffusion  V/Q mismatch 2. Ventilation failure Caused by  Depression of the respiratory centre  Neuromuscular dysfunction  Chest wall deformities  Upper airway obstruction Respiratory failure 1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Impaired diffusion • Impaired gas exchange between alveolar air and pulmonary blood. Caused by:  Interstitial fibrosis.  Pulmonary oedema.  Pneumonia.  Impaired diffusion may cause hypoxaemia but not hypercapnia.  Can be corrected by administering high [O 2] Untreated hypertension Increased afterload to the left ventricle Increased workload to the left heart Left ventricular hypertrophy Left heart failure Respiratory problems lead to cardiac problems Hypoxemic respiratory failure may result from heart failure due to untreated hypertension Heart failure Decreased cardiac output Increased left arterial pressure Blood backup in pulmonary circulation Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure Fluid filtration out of the capillaries Pulmonary oedema Impaired diffusion Types of ventilatory failure 1. Dysfunction of the respiratory centre  Cerebrospinal accident can impair respiratory centre.  Narcotic overdose. 2. Neuromuscular dysfunction  Poliomyelitis  Guillain -Barre syndrome  Myasthenia gravis 3. Chest wall deformities  Kyphosis & Scoliosis 4. Upper airway obstruction  Upper airway obstruction  Foreign body in the larynx causes hypoventilation. Ventilatory failure Increased ventilation increased PaCO2 and decreased PaO2 Oxygen therapy may be detrimental in some cases of respiratory failure.Oxygen therapy • Recommended in patients with acute respiratory failure. • Important in maintaining P aO2 & PaCO2. • Delivers positive -pressure ventilation.
