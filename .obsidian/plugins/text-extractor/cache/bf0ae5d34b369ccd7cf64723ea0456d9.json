DNA Chemistry • Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA): • Present in all living systems (also some viruses). • Contain information that regulates every aspect of cellular activity. • DNA typically exists as a double-strand. • DNA is a polymer (poly = many, meros = part) • Polymers comprise many repeating units (monomers). • Nucleotides are the monomers that form the DNA polymer (also RNA). DNA structureNucleotide structure • Nucleotides are the subunits of nucleic acids. • Composed of three functional groups: • 5-carbon sugar (pentose). • 1’ carbon: nucleobase (guanine, adenine, thymine (uridine in RNA) or cytosine). • 5’ carbon: Phosphate group (negative charge). • Base is either a purine or a pyrimidine. or Bases, Nucleosides and Nucleotides • Nucleoside mono-, di- and triphosphate: • Adenosine monophosphate (AMP). • Adenosine diphosphate (ADP). • Adenosine triphosphate (ATP). • Nucleoside + phosphate (1 or more) Nucleotide. The Human Genome • Comprised of two parts: • Mitochondrial genome. • Nuclear genome. The Human Genome • Comprised of two parts: • Mitochondrial genome. • Nuclear genome. • Contains hereditary information • “genes”. • What is a gene? • “locatable region of genomic sequence, corresponding to a unit of inheritance, which is associated with regulatory regions, transcribed regions and/or other functional sequence regions”. GenesThe Human Genome • Mitochondrial genome: • Small. • Circular. • Encode some components required by mitochondria. • Maternal inheritance. • Nuclear genome: • Complex. • ~26 000 genes. • Bulk of genetic information. • Composed of 23/24 different chromosomes. • Linear. • 22 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes (XX, XY). • Mendelian inheritance. The Mitochondria • Mitochondria play a central role in cellular energy provision. • The organelles are surround by a double membrane and contain their own genome. • The mammalian mitochondrial genome is transmitted exclusively through the female germ line. • Mitochondria are not self-supporting entities but rely heavily for their functions on imported nuclear gene products. The Mitochondrial Genome • Circular double-stranded molecule • H (heavy) and L (light) strands. • H strand is guanine-rich. • ~16.6 kilobases. • Each cell contains thousands of copies. • Most of the genome is highly conserved. E The Mitochondrial Genome • 37 genes: • 28 on H strand. • 9 on L strand. • ~ Two thirds of mitochondrial genes (24/37) are non-coding RNA genes. • 22 transfer RNA (tRNA). • 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA). • Remaining 13 mitochondrial genes code for polypeptides. • Form part of mitochondrial respiratory complexes. • Involved in oxidative phosphorylation  ATP production. The Mitochondrial Genome Much of the mitochondrion is encoded by the nuclear genome. Mitochondrial Genome MapThe Nuclear Genome • An estimated 5% of the human genome is highly conserved. • 1.1% make up protein-coding genes. • Remaining 4% comprises RNA genes. • rRNA, tRNA. • 85-90% of the genome is transcribed. The Nuclear Genome • Approximately 3.1 billion base pairs (bp) in size. • 99% of DNA in cell. • 3.1 giga base pairs (Gbp)/ 6.2 giga bases. • Not all of the nuclear genome has been sequenced. • Some regions are refractory to sequencing. • Condensed DNA heterochromatin  transcriptionally inactive • Open DNA  euchromatin transcriptionally active. • 2.9 Gb of the nuclear genome is transcriptionally active. • 200 million bases permanently condensed (heterochromatin). mitochondrial DRA The Nuclear Genome • Consists of linear DNA molecules: • Chromosomes (DNA + associated proteins). • 24 different chromosomes. • Autosomes: 1-22. • Sex chromosomes: X & Y. • 2 Copies of each chromosome: • Diploid number (2n)  number of chromosomes somatic cell (gamete + gamete). • Haploid number (n) number of chromosomes in gamete. The Nuclear Genome • Contains at least 26,000 genes. • Number constantly being revised. • 1 gene per 120 kilobases. • Most are polypeptide-coding. • ~6000 genes encode RNAs that are not translated. • C. elegans (1 mm long worm) has 959 somatic cells, genome is 1/30 that of humans, contains 19,099 protein-coding genes & >1000 RNA-coding genes. • Therefore, genome complexity is not parallel to biological complexity. Packaging the Nuclear Genome • 46 DNA molecules (chromosomes) = ~6 billion bases. • Humans have ~2 meters of DNA per cell. • How is DNA packaged inside each µm scale cell nucleus while remaining accessible for gene transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair? • Fact highlights mechanisms: • Govern genome organization during any activity. • Maintain the physical organization of chromosomes at all times. The Cell Cycle State Phase Description Resting G0 Cell has left the cycle and has stopped dividing. Interphase Gap1 G1 Cells increase in size. The G1 checkpoint control mechanism ensures that everything is ready for DNA synthesis. Synthesis S DNA replication. Gap2 G2 Gap between DNA synthesis and mitosis. The cell continues to grow. The G2 checkpoint control mechanism ensures that everything is ready to enter the M (mitosis) phase and divide. Cell division Mitosis Cell growth stops at this stage and cellular energy is focused on the orderly division into two daughter cells. A checkpoint in the middle of mitosis (Metaphase Checkpoint) ensures that the cell is ready to complete cell division. Packaging the Nuclear Genome • Physiological state of DNA = chromatin. • Basic regulatory unit of genomes. • DNA bound to mostly histone = nucleosomes. • DNA + 2 copies of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. • Wrapping of DNA around nucleosomes shortens the lenght of chromosomes 7-fold. • Histones are subject to post-translational modifications: • Methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation... • Regulates the activity of genomic regions within nucleosomes + how they interact with each other and the DNA. Mitosis 3D Nucleus: The Nuclear Lamina • Double membrane organelle – separates transcription machinery from cytoplasm (protein production). • Interacts with several subnuclear structures. • Nuclear envelop (NE) and NE transmembrane proteins = nuclear lamina. • Can bind different proteins. • Chromatin interacts with the nuclear lamina via lamina associated domains (LAD).

Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) Genes • Spliceosomal snRNA: • 70 different genes identified that encode the 9 spliceosomal snRNA. • Together with various proteins form the spliceosome. • Important in splicing introns out of RNA. • U1, U2, U4, U5, U6 form part of the major spliceosome. • U4atac, U6atac, U11, U12 form part of the minor spliceosome. • Non-spliceosomal snRNA: • Typically single copy genes (reflect rare functions). • U7 snRNA processes 3’-ends of histone mRNA. • 7SK regulates RNA polymerase II. • U1 and U2 also have non-spliceosomal activity. Spliceosomes and Splicing 1. Spliceosomes consist of a complex of proteins and small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPS) which recognize splice sites on the pre- mRNA transcript. • Also contains catalytic RNA molecules = Ribozymes. 2. Each splicing event removes one intron. • A specific adenine nucleotide in the intron sequence attacks the 5’ splice site and cuts the sugar phosphate backbone of the RNA at this point. 3.
