Dome shaped umbrella cells will become flattened Lumen Umbrella shaped cells Note: Umbrella cells are large, elliptical often binucleated cells with prominent nucleoli, vacuolated cytoplasm and apical plaques containing uroplakins. They cover multiple underlying transitional cells in a parasol-like fashion. Intermediate cells are cuboidal to low columnar while basal cells are more cylindrical, can be flat when bladder wall is stretched and lie on continuous basement membrane.
