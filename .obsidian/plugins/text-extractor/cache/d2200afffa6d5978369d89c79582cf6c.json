AUTOCRINE Intercellular Communication Paracrine: Signalling molecules are released into the extracellular space and act locally on neighboring cells. Signalling molecules rapidly degraded Molecular Biology of Cell, 4th Ed, Alberts Contact-dependent signalling/ Cell to cell signalling: Cells need to be in direct membrane-membrane contact. Synaptic signalling: Performed by neurons that transmit signals electrically along their axons and release neurotransmitters at synapses, which are often located far away from the cell body. Intercellular CommunicationIntercellular Communication Endocrine: Depends on endocrine cells, which secrete hormones into the bloodstream that are then distributed widely throughout the body. Why do cells need to communicate? Adapted NORMAL FUNCTION Part 2: Principles and Components of Hydrophobic Signal Transduction Principles of Signal Transduction: Intracellular Receptor (Hydrophobic signalling) •Components: –Ligands –Receptors –Transcription factor •Steroid ligand binds to specific receptor inside the cell •Ligand and receptor form a transcription factor that results in production of specific proteins Hydrophobic Signalling Hormone response element (HRE) – resembles enhancer elements Ligand Receptor Transcription factor Part 3: Principles and Components of Hydrophilic Signal Transduction 00 Principles of Signal Transduction: Membrane Receptor (Hydrophilic signalling) • Protein/polypeptide ligands bind to specific receptor on membrane • Transmembrane receptor converts extracellular signal into intracellular chain of biochemical events which amplifies the signal • For signalling pathways, information is conveyed either by diffusible elements usually referred to as second messengers or through protein– protein interactions via their domains resulting in signal transduction • Common theme: activation of protein kinase • Final result o Proteins with altered function o Transcription factors activated: production of new proteins O ÉE O_O Domains of Proteins Domain O Interaction Domains in Signal Transduction Domain-Peptide Motif DNA PI-3,4,5-P Domain- Phospholipid PH SH2 pTyr CatalyticDNAB Domain-DNA DNAB: DNA binding domain Kinase: catalytic domain of kinase PH: Plecktrin homology domain SH2: Src homology 2 domain To o Adaptor G protein Kinase Transcription factor Scaffold protein Ligand: Protein hormone Membrane Receptor General Hydrophilic signalling Pathway Components Note: Not all the components are present in every signalling pathways. 8 1. Ligands •Ligands are the extracellular signalling molecules •Bind to specific receptors •Also known as: 1st messenger, hormones •E.g.s: chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, hormones O 010 to Types of Membrane Receptors Three main types of membrane receptor: •Those without kinase activity e.g. G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) receptors •Those with intrinsic kinase activity e.g. Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) •Those associated with kinase e.g. cytokine receptor, T Cell Receptor (TCR) O O O 2. Membrane Receptors Cell targeted must have specific receptor Response depends on o relative numbers of receptors for that hormone on or in the target cells o affinity (strength) of the bond between the hormone and the receptor Hydrophilic ligand receptors have extracellular domains that interact with specific ligand Hydrophilic ligand receptors have domains/motifs in the cytoplasm that interact with intracellular signalling molecules o o Types of Receptor A.

Adaptors •Relatively small proteins with usually no more than two or three domains whose function is to link two proteins together •Proteins with SH2 domains bind to phosphorylated tyrosine amino acids. Different SH2 domains recognise the P-tyrosine associated with different amino acids forming the sequence motifs. •Other domains in adaptor protein bind to domains in next protein in signalling pathway SH2 Receptor Adaptor How Adaptors Function YY 4. G proteins •Named because they bind GTP or GDP •When GDP bound –inactive •Activated by exchange of GDP for GTP i.e. when GTP bound active •Have intrinsic GTPase activity i.e. convert GTP back to GDP by removing terminal phosphate •Two types: •Heterotrimic: Alpha subunit binds GTP/GDP e.g. Gs, Gq •Small monomeric e.g Ras RAS Small Monomeric G Protein (RAS) Inactive GTP Active Pi Intrinsic GTPase activity RAS GDP GEF GEF: Guanosine exchange factor RAS GDP GDP Inactive Signalling through hydrophilic pathways recruits a GEF which exchanges GDP for GTP on the monomeric G protein RAS. GDP is released. This activates RAS. RAS’s intrinsic GTPase activity converts GTP back to GDP and RAS is once again inactive Kinase ATP + PROTEIN PROTEIN - P + ADP 5. Protein Kinases: Phosphorylation of Proteins Reaction is essentially unidirectional because of large amount of energy released when phosphate bond in ATP is broken Kinases are enzymes that: • add phosphate from adenosine triphosphate ATP, • to amino acid with OH group •Serine •Threonine •Tyrosine en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ATP_chemical_struc... Protein Phosphorylation + + Protein Phosphorylation • More than one site on a polypeptide chain can be phosphorylated • Phosphorylation adds two negative charges (phosphate group) to protein –conformational change •Activity •Interactions •Location • Target proteins can be phosphorylated by more than one kinase –Thus kinases activated by different signalling pathways can result in phosphorylation of the same protein • NB in signalling pathways and regulation of cell cycle 6. Scaffold Proteins •Large proteins able to bind various other proteins to bring them together in a complex •Have no enzymatic activity •They can be phosphorylated at various sites and thus recruit many different proteins with SH2 domains. 7. Transcription Factors •Proteins that bind to promoters of genes and either increase or decrease transcription of gene •Promoter contains conserved consensus sequence which binds general transcription factors and other specific sequences which bind specific transcription factors eg NFκB, AP-1. •Specific Transcription factors gives specificity to signal. •Genes with promoters with same sequences will bind same TFs giving a combined response.

Part 4: Receptor Tyrosine Kinase signalling Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) signalling Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling •Currently more than 60 known receptor tyrosine kinases which are involved in cellular signalling pathways •Regulate key cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, development, angiogenesis and survival. •Unregulated activation of this pathway, can lead to cancer as well as to benign proliferative conditions. Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling •Also play a role in inflammatory diseases and diabetes. •Targeted molecular therapies against members of the RTK receptor family were among the first to be used –Trastuzumab: Herceptin (anti-HER2) –Gefitinib (anti-EGFR), –many others are presently used and being developed. Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling: Ligands • This pathway regulates cellular responses to growth factors. • Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is produced by macrophages, platelets and epithelial cells in various organs, including kidney, salivary gland and stomach. It contains a hydrophobic domain allowing it to be anchored in the plasma membrane • Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) has crucial roles during development It is produced by platelets, smooth muscle cells, activated macrophages, and endothelial cells amongst others. Some are secreted in an inactive form and are cleaved by proteases in ECM and activated • Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is particularly important in the control of development. The heparan sulphate proteoglycans play an important role in cell signalling by binding growth factors such as FGF and PDGF, which thus serves to restrict their action to areas close to their sites of release Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling: Ligands • Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a major role in angiogenesis • Angiopoeitins: The primary function of the angiopoietins is to control angiogenesis. Also NB in cell adhesion of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to the stem cell niche All of these growth factors play important roles in wound healing. y y y y y y y y y y y y Ligand: GF, EGF, PDGF Adaptor proteinAdaptor SH2 Gene activation Receptor:RTK, EGFR, PDGFR RTK Pathways PI3K SH2 MAPK pathway PI3K pathway Phosphoinositide 3 kinase Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling •Upon binding of ligand to its RTK receptor, dimerisation and conformational changes occur which activate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor and it phosphorylates tyrosine residues within its cytoplasmic portion. •Either the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) or phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3-K) pathways or both may then be activated. y y y y y y y y y y y y Ligand: Growth Factor: EGF, PDGF RAS Receptor: RTK: EGFR, PDGFR Y : Tyrosine aa Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling: MAPK Tyrosine kinase activated GDP Inactive RAS (GDP) attached to membrane Ligand binds and causes dimerisation of receptor Change in shape of RTK, activates its tyrosine kinase activity which phosphorylates tyrosine amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail y y y y y y Ligand: Growth Factor: EGF, PDGF The SH2 domain of the Adaptor protein binds to phosphorylated tyrosine in receptor tail SH2 Adaptor RAS Receptor: RTK: EGFR, PDGFR Y : Tyrosine amino acid Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling: MAPK Tyrosine kinase activated GDP y y y y y y Ligand: Growth Factor: EGF, PDGF G protein : RASSH2 Adaptor RAS Receptor: RTK: EGFR, PDGFR GTPGEF GEF: Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor binds to adaptor protein domain and exchanges GDP on inactive RAS for GTP and activates RASY : Tyrosine aa Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling: MAPK Tyrosine kinase activated GDP RAS Small Monomeric G Protein (RAS) Inactive GTP Active Pi Intrinsic GTPase activity RAS GDP GEF GDP Guanine nucleotide exchange factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling: MAPK y y y y y y Ligand: Growth Factor: EGF, PDGF Adaptor protein GEF: Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor G protein : RAS RAS Gene activation TF Receptor: RTK: EGFR, PDGFR GTP Proliferation GEF MAPK: Mitogen activated protein kinase cascade activated resulting in activation of MAPK which phosphorylates proteins and transcription factors MAPK cascade Y : Tyrosine aa SH2 Adaptor MAPK MAPK pathway • The phosphorylated tyrosine amino acids in tail of receptor bind adaptor proteins • These bind GEFS that donates a GTP to a small monomeric G-protein, RAS, and activates it. • This activates the MAPK phosphorylation cascade resulting in the phosphorylation of enzymes, other kinases and transcription factors. • This cascade leads to altered transcription of genes that are important for the cell cycle and hence proliferation • This pathway plays an important role in proliferation and many proteins within it are proto-oncogenes PI3K Pathway y y y y y y PIP2PIP3 Ligand: Growth factor: EGF, PDGF Receptor: RTK: EGFR, PDGFR Kinase: Lipid Kinase: PI3K (Phosphoinositide 3 kinase) binds to phosphorylated tyrosine in the receptor tail via its SH2 domain.
