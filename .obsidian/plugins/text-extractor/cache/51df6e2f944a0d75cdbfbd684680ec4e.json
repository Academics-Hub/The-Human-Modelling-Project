This depends on glucose uptake and glycolysis.

Metabolic flux in the fasting/postabsorptive state Food Liver Adipose tissue Skeletal muscle Pancreas (α-cells) Glucagon Portal vein GIT Glucose Glucose Metabolic flux in Type-1 diabetes mellitus (no insulin) Triacylglycerols Glycerol Glycogen Pyruvate Lactate Fatty acids accumulate in blood Amino acids Amino acids X TAGs accumulate in blood X Ketones accumulate in blood Glycogen Glucose accumulates in blood Protein Fatty Acids Fat Lymphatics • In type 1 diabetes mellitus the pancreas is unable to produce insulin, resulting in increased glucagon secretion and a very low insulin/glucagon ratio. • Because of the low insulin concentration, glucose is not taken up into insulin-dependent tissues and glucose accumulates in the blood. • Low insulin also inhibits glycolysis. • Because of the increased glucagon, glycogenolysis is stimulated and gluconeogenesis increases, further increasing blood glucose. • The lack of insulin allows proteolysis of muscles and glucagon stimulates conversion of both muscle and dietary amino acids to glucose. Amino groups are converted to urea. • The lack of insulin inhibits lipoprotein lipase in the adipose tissue, preventing lipolysis of dietary triacylglycerol in the chylomicrons, while lack of glucose uptake into adipocytes inhibits lipogenesis. Thus, triacylglycerols accumulate in the blood. • Increased glucagon stimulates hormone sensitive lipase, which hydrolyses stored triacylglycerol, increasing release of free fatty acids into the blood. • Increased free fatty acid concentrations lead to increased β-oxidation. • Because of the gluconeogenesis in the liver, oxaloacetate is depleted and acetyl-CoA from β-oxidation accumulates and is converted to ketone bodies (acetoacetate, acetone and β-hydroxybutyrate). • Excess production of ketone bodies exceeds the ability of the peripheral tissues to metabolise them and ability of the kidneys to excrete them, resulting in an accumulation that lowers the blood pH causing acidosis. Metabolic flux in type I diabetes mellitus Consequences of metabolic derangements in Type-1 diabetes mellitus 1. Glucose accumulation: Osmotic diuresis and hypertonic dehydration 2. Triacylglycerol and fatty acid accumulation: Cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis) 3. Ketone accumulation: Ketoacidosis 4. Chronically, lack of insulin also leads to: Peripheral neuropathy (death of nerve cells due to sorbitol accumulation in nerves) Glaucoma (movement of fluid into fluid of eyeball causing swelling) Weight loss (breakdown of protein and fat) Stiffening of arteries Food Liver Adipose tissue Skeletal muscle Pancreas (β-cells) Insulin Portal vein GIT Metabolic flux in Type-2 diabetes mellitus (insensitivity to insulin) Triacylglycerols Amino acids Amino acids X TAGs accumulate in blood X Glycogen Glucose accumulates in blood Glucose Glucose Glycogen Pyruvate Fat Fat Lymphatics • Type 2 diabetes mellitus results from insulin resistance (decreased sensitivity of cells to insulin). • Initially, patients produce more than normal amounts of insulin in response to increased blood glucose that results from consumption of carbohydrates. • This hyperinsulinemia and impaired glucose tolerance, which precede type 2 diabetes are linked to obesity and can often (but not always, depending on the patient) be slowed and sometimes reversed by losing weight. • Patients develop type 2 diabetes when they cannot produce enough excess insulin to overcome insulin resistance. • Insulin resistance decreases uptake of glucose into insulin-dependent tissues. Thus, glucose accumulates in the blood, resulting in hyperglycaemia. • Insulin resistance increases glucagon secretion, which increases gluconeogenesis and further increases blood glucose. • Insulin resistance does not affect fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ACC, continues to be stimulated by insulin), so the liver makes malonyl-CoA which is used to make fatty acids and triacylglycerols. • Insulin resistance decreases uptake of triacylglycerol into adipose tissue (decreased activation of lipoprotein lipase, LPL). • This increases blood concentrations of triacylglycerol. • Decreased inhibition of HSL by insulin and increased glucagon stimulates lipolysis in adipose tissue. This increases the plasma free fatty acid concentration. • Increased malonyl-CoA inhibits CPT1 (i.e. transfer of FAs into the mitochondrion) and hence inhibits β-oxidation of fatty acids, leading to conversion of fatty acids to TAGs.
