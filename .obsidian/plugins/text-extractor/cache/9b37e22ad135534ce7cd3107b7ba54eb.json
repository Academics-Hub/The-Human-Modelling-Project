Introduction • Radiologic examination of the lower limb concentrates mainly on the bony structures. • This is so as most of the muscles, tendons, and nerves blend into a homogeneous mass. • It is often utilized in the context of trauma to investigate fractures and dislocations as well as degenerative changes. Anteroposterior Radiograph of the hip joint • The inferior margin of the femoral neck forms a continuous curve with the upper margin of the obturator foramen (Shenton’s line). • Interruption of the Shenton line can indicate (in the correct clinical scenario): • Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) • Fractured neck of femur • Excessive external rotation of the normal hip can also disrupt the Shenton line, however, there is no displacement of the femoral head Hip Joint Dislocation Case courtesy of Leonardo Lustosa, Radiopaedia.org, rID: 98970 https://www.orthobullets.com/trauma/1035/hip-dislocation Femoral Shaft Fracture Case courtesy of Dr Samir Benoudina, Radiopaedia.org, rID: 84287 https://ota.org/for-patients/find-info-body-part/3724 Normal MR Imaging Anatomy of the Thigh https://www.mri.theclinics.com/article/S1064-9689(11)00050-X/fulltext Knee Joint • In the AP view the lower part of the shaft of the femur, the lateral and medial epicondyles, and the adductor tubercle are easily visualized. • The patella is seen superimposed in front of the lateral and medial femoral condyles. • The joint surfaces, separated by a wide space occupied by the articular cartilage and the semilunar cartilages, are easily recognized. • The intercondylar notch of the femur and the intercondylar eminence of the tibia are well shown. Knee Joint • The medial and lateral condyles of the tibia are seen. • The head of the fibula partly overlaps the lateral condyle of the tibia. • The neck of the fibula and the upper parts of the shafts of the fibula and tibia are usually clearly seen. • The intercondylar eminence of the femur and its summit is overlapped by the femoral condyles. • The tibial tuberosity is seen on the anterior surface of the bone. 1.
