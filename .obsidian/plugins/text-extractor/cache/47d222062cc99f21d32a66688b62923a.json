JOVANOVIĆ  Cells  Extracellular matrix which includes:  Fibers and  Ground substance Connective tissue’s main constituents Classification of connective tissue proper CONNECTIVE TISSUE PROPER Loose or Areolar Connective Tissue Dense Connective Tissue Dense regular Connective Tissue Dense Irregular Connective Tissue • Slides: 120 – 1, 120 – 2, 120 – 3 Loose (areolar) connective tissue – Mesentery spread Stain: Haematoxylin, acid fuchsin and elastic stain This is a whole mount spread of mesenchymal tissue. It consists of a sheet of loose connective tissue with simple squamous epithelium - mesothelium on each side and a thin “filling” of loose connective tissue in between them. Look at the schematic drawing of the mesentery available in your histology practical manual in order to understand the “sandwich” concept! Mesentery spread Slide: 120 - 3 In the following slide it will be difficult to distinguish between mesothelial cells and fibroblasts. Fibroblasts generally have more flattened nuclei while mesothelial cells have faded, oval nuclei (you will see mesothelial cells faded, as you will be looking through the loose areolar connective tissue which is a “filling inside a sandwich”. Elastic fiber Mast cell Ground substance Capillary Fibroblast nucleus Mesothelial cell nucleus Slide: 120 - 2 Macrophages with ink inclusions Elastic fiber Collagen fiber Slide: 122 Non lactating mammary gland Dense irregular connective tissue Mammary gland ducts Adipose tissue Dense irregular connective tissue Elastic fibres cannot be distinguished with H and E. See slide 28 where aorta was stained with elastic stain. Adipose tissue Randomly arranged collagen fibres Fibroblast nucleus situated on the edge of the collagen fibres Mammary gland duct Small arteriole Capillaries Fibroblast nucleus Randomly arranged collagen fibers Randomly arranged collagen fibers Ground substance Randomly arranged collagen fibers Fibroblast nucleus Slide: 50 Musculo-tendinous junction (H and E) Tendon - Dense regular connective tissue Tendon (Dense regular connective tissue) Muscle (Striated skeletal muscle) Note the difference in fibre density, ground substance and cellularity seen in the basic three types of connective tissue proper. These criteria are used to classify the type of connective tissue. Regular arrangement of collagen fibers Ground substance Fibroblast nucleus Note the junction (dashed line) between the tendon on the left and the muscle on the right. Note the single direction and regular organisation of the collagen fibres of the tendon. The fibroblast nuclei are arranged along the edge of the collagen fibres within the very restricted ground substance. Slide: 28 Aorta (Elastic stain) Elastic tissue The inset shows the wall of a aorta which has been stained with elastic stain for visualization of elastic fibres. The wall of the aorta is made up of numerous dark staining, wavy elastic fibres. In between the elastic fibres are smooth muscle cells (not visible in the tissue stained with elastic stain) which produce and maintain the elastic fibres. Elastic fiber Smooth muscle Slide: 25 Liver (Silver impregnation method) Reticular tissue Liver parenchyma Portal tract The majority of the tissue is stained light brown with silver stain and represents the hepatocytes (liver cells) organized in cords. The reticular fibres are seen as a dark brown meshwork surrounding and supporting the hepatocytes Hepatocytes Reticular fibres","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
