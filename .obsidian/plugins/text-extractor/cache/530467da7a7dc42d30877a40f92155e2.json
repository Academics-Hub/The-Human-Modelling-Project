External intercostal muscle ACTION: Most active during expiration , supports intercostal space , moves ribs inferiorly Internal intercostal muscleInnermost intercostal muscle Other muscles Functions Subcostal May depress ribs Transversus Thoracis Depresses costal cartilage **acts with internal intercostal muscles Anterior Intercostal arteries - Two small arteries in each of the 9 spaces – The upper 6 pairs- from internal thoracic artery ( a br. from the 1st part of subclavian a) – The lower 3 pairs- from musculophrenic artery Posterior Intercostal arteries – One in each of the 11 spaces – 1st & 2nd pairs arise from superior Intercostal artery of costocervical trunk (2nd part of subclavian artery) – The lower 9 pairs arteries & subcostal artery arise from descending thoracic aorta. • In each space the posterior Intercostal artery and its collateral branch anastomose with the 2 anterior Intercostal arteries Anterior Intercostal veins • 2 in each space. • 7th,8th & 9th join the venae commitantes of musculo-phrenic artery • 6th,5th & 4th join venae commitantes of internal thoracic artery • 3rd,2nd &1st join internal thoracic vein – Internal thoracic vein drains into Brachiocephalic vein Posterior Intercostal veins • One in each of the 11 spaces. • On the right: • 1st drains into Rt. Brachiocephalic vein. • 2nd,3rd & sometimes the 4th unite to form Rt. Superior Intercostal vein (B) which drains into azygos vein. • From 5th to 11th & subcostal veins drain into azygos vein. • On the Left: • 1st drains into Lt. brachiocephalic v. • 2nd,3rd& sometimes the 4th join to form Lt. Superior Intercostal vein which drains into Lt brachiocephalic vein. • 5th,6th,7th, & 8th form superior hemiazygos vein to azygos vein • 9th,10th.11th &Subcostal form inferior hemiazygos vein to azygos vein. Intercostal Nerves • anterior primary rami of spinal thoracic nerves from T1 to T11 • T12 is called Subcostal • Each nerve runs in the Intercostal space inferior to the Intercostal vessels Thoracic CavityMediastinum and its subdivisions BOUNDARIES of mediastinum ✓ Superior: superior thoracic aperture ✓ Inferior: Diaphragm ✓ Anterior: Sternum ✓ Posterior: Thoracic vertebrae ✓ Lateral: Lungs & pleurae Superior Mediastinum Boundaries Superior Superior thoracic aperture Inferior Horizontal plane at level of T4/T5 Anterior Manubrium Posterior T1-T4 vertebrae Lateral Lungs & pleura Contents ✓ Remnant of thymus ✓ Brachiocephalic veins & superior vena cava ✓ Pulmonary trunk & pulmonary a. ✓ Arch of the aorta & its branches ✓ Trachea ✓ Vagus nerve ✓ Oesophagus ✓ Cardiac plexus ✓ Left recurrent laryngeal nerve ✓ Thoracic duct & lymphatics Boundaries Superior Horizontal plane at level of T4/T5 Inferior Diaphragm Anterior Body of sternum & xiphoid process Posterior Pericardium Lateral Lungs & pleura Anterior Mediastinum Contents ✓ Remnant of thymus gland Boundaries Superior Horizontal plane Inferior Diaphragm Anterior Pericardium Posterior T5-T12 vertebrae Lateral Lungs & pleura Posterior Mediastinum Contents ✓ Oesophagus ✓ Vagus nerve ✓ Thoracic duct ✓ Azygous vein ✓ Descending aorta ✓ R&L sympathetic trunks ✓ Lymph nodes Middle Mediastinum Contents ✓ Pericardium & heart ✓ Great vessels: ascending aorta, superior vena cava, Pulmonary trunk ✓ Cardiac plexus ✓ Phrenic nerve & pericardiophrenic vessels Boundaries ✓ Space enclosed by the pericardium between the mediastinal pleurae & lie in the inferior mediastinum ✓ Diaphragm inferiorly ✓ Largest division of inferior mediastinum Root of lung Pericardium Superior vena cava Phrenic n. & pericardiacophrenic a. right vagus n.
