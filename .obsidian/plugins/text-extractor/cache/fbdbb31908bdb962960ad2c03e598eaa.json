COURSE BRIEF 1.1 PURPOSE OF COURSE The purpose of this course is to provide knowledge of anatomical sciences and develop multiple skills as a foundation for prospective health care professionals. 1.1.1 MORPHOLOGICAL (GROSS) ANATOMY This is a course in morphological anatomy and consists of regional dissection of most of the human body. Those regions not dissected will be studied by using prosected human specimens. The basic aspects of the central nervous system, head and neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, perineum, back, upper and lower limbs will be covered. 1.1.2 HISTOLOGY This is a course consisting of lectures, practicals and tutorials dealing with the histology and, where relevant, the ultrastructure of the primary tissues and organ systems. 1.1.3 EMBRYOLOGY This is a course consisting of a series of lectures in which the development of the embryo and fetus, and the development of all major systems of the body will be covered. 1.2. COMPETENCIES This is an outline of the competencies a student should be able to fulfil at the end of ANAT2020. Specific and comprehensive objectives are provided in this section to direct student learning. Primary Competencies: - Appreciate of general body form and structure. - Acquire critical knowledge of certain specified anatomical structures / regions. - Recognise the implications of normal anatomical variations. - Acquire sufficient knowledge to appreciate the anatomical basis of physical examination. Secondary Competencies: - Develop skills to work in a team within a social context and medical environment. - Integrate anatomical information with clinical data. - Develop self-directed learning and problem-solving skills. - Acquire dexterity skills. Tertiary Competencies: - Recognize the cadaver as a person with psycho-social, ethical and medical concerns. - Integrate the core concepts of life and death. 1.3 CRITICAL COURSE OUTCOMES - Identifying and solving problems in which student responses display responsible decisions using critical and creative thinking. - Working effectively with others as a member of a team, group, organisation or community. - Organising and managing oneself and one’s activities responsibly and effectively. ANAT 2020 2 2 COURSE OUTLINE 2.1 MORPHOLOGICAL (GROSS) ANATOMY The aims and objectives of the morphological anatomy component of this course are to give the second year medical/health science/biomedical engineering student a basic understanding of the structure and function of the entire human body. The students will be introduced to the basic and applied anatomical structure and function of body on macroscopic level. Reference will be made to clinical application in order to highlight the importance of structures. As a result, the student should be able to apply this knowledge to corresponding anatomical structures and provide explanations for relevant clinical scenarios. In general, students are required to identify, name, describe, discuss and provide well labelled diagrams. In addition, students will be required to explain the anatomy underlying specific clinical scenarios. These scenarios are included in the objectives list. The course comprises of lectures, tutorials (including Problem Solving Exercises), practical dissection of most areas of the human body and study by means of prosected specimens of those areas not dissected. Attendance at practical sessions (histology, dissection or demonstrations) and tutorials (including problem solving exercises) is COMPULSORY and failure to attend these sessions without a valid medical certificate or an acceptable written report will result in the refusal of a Satisfactory Performance (SP) clearance. ALL OF THE MATERIAL DEALT WITH IN PRACTICAL SESSIONS (HISTOLOGY, DISSECTION OR DEMONSTRATIONS), TUTORIALS AND LECTURES WILL BE EXAMINED. The following is a breakdown of the different regions covered during the course of the year and the approximate time spent on them: ▪ Upper limb 4 weeks ▪ Thorax 3 weeks ▪ Head and neck 4 weeks ▪ Neuroanatomy 4 weeks ▪ Abdomen, pelvis and perineum 7 weeks ▪ Lower limb 4 weeks ANAT 2020 3 2.2 HISTOLOGY AND EMBRYOLOGY The aim of the abbreviated Histology course is to provide the student with the opportunity to familiarise him/herself with the microscopic appearance of most of the tissues of the body. This is accomplished by first concentrating on the primary tissues i.e., Epithelium, Connective Tissue, Muscle and Nerve. Following this, all the major organ systems of the body are studied and closely integrated with the study of morphological anatomy. The course comprises lectures, practicals and pre- and post-practical tutorials. Videos, CD- ROMS, and demonstration slides and posters are available for self-study. A Histology Practical Manual will be provided. Embryology is taught by means of lectures only, although a number of videos are available for self-study. Some tutorial sessions may be arranged. The development and implantation of the early embryo as well as the development of all major systems will be dealt with. Note that knowledge of Embryology will be tested in BOTH the Morphological Anatomy and the Histology components of tests and examinations. 3 TESTS AND EXAMINATIONS 3.1 YEAR’S RECORD AND ALLOCATION OF MARKS In accordance with Rule G.17 (1) students are hereby informed that tests taken by them during the course of the academic year will count towards the end-of-year mark. The year’s record based upon these tests will contribute fifty percent (50%) towards the End- of-Year total. “The use of electronic devices including but not limited to smart watches, cell phones and tablets is strictly prohibited during a Test and Exam and these devices are banned from Test and Exam venues”. 3.2 TESTS 3.2.1 Three End of Region tests and four End of Block tests will be written during the course of the year and will include questions from all components of the course i.e., Morphological Anatomy, Histology and Embryology. The School of Anatomical Sciences reserves the right to make use of images to support the assessment of anatomy knowledge across all components i.e., Histology and Embryology as well as Morphological Anatomy irrespective of the method of testing i.e., MCQ and/or spot tests. Note that the knowledge required, and the testing, will be cumulative throughout the year. Two different methods of testing (or any combination of them) will be used: 1. Test consisting of Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). A combination of both x-type and single answer MCQs may be used. ANAT 2020 4 2. Practical (spot) tests where a student has to identify different structures and answer questions within a given time period using the Riddel programme in the Computer Lab. 3.2.2 Absence from any of the tests will require a valid medical certificate, certified by Campus Health, or a formal document with reason(s) for the absence with the Faculty Office of Student Success (OSS) properly informed. Whichever document that applies should be communicated to the course coordinators within 5 days of the test. Please note that NO DEFERRED TESTS WILL BE GIVEN IN LIEU OF MISSED TESTS. 3.2.3. TEST DATES FOR 2023 Description Type of Assessment Weight (marks) Date Weekly Ulwazi quiz Varied method 30 Year long End of Region Test 1 Multiple Choice Questions 40 27 Feb End of Block 1 Test Multiple Choice Questions 100 20 Mar End of Region Test 2 Multiple Choice Questions 40 08 May End of Block 2 Test Practical Test (Spot) 100 09 Jun End of Region Test 3 Multiple Choice Questions 40 31 Jul End of Block 3 Test Multiple Choice Questions 100 29 Aug End of Block 4 Test Practical Test (Spot) 100 18 Oct TOTAL FOR YEAR MARK = 550 MARKS 3.2.4. Each End of Region test will cover all the work for that region/period and each End of Block tests from the beginning of the year, i.e., cumulative. The year mark will contribute 50% to the final Examinations mark. 3.3 SUBMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS PLEASE NOTE: A 40% subminimum for each of the Morphological (Gross) Anatomy and Histology/Embryology components of the course will be implemented. The implications of this are as follows: 3.3.1 EXEMPTION FROM EXAMINATIONS 3.3.1.1 ANAT 2020 5 Students who have attained a YEAR MARK of 60% or more after writing ALL End of Region and Block Tests will be exempted from the final examinations PROVIDED THAT THEY HAVE ATTAINED A MINIMUM OF 40% IN EACH OF THE TWO COMPONENTS. 3.3.1.2 Should any student fail to achieve 60% in the year mark and /or fail to attain a minimum of 40% in each of the components they will be required to write the full final examination comprising of the two components (Morphological anatomy and Histology/Embryology). 3.3.1.3 Failure to take a test, even with a valid reason, will result in disqualification from the “Exemption” rule. The student will have to write the Final Examination 3.3.1.4 Students who have qualified for “Exemption” may still elect to write the final examination. However, this may result in either an increase or decrease in the final mark depending on performance in the End of Year examination. If a student elects to write the final examination despite qualifying for exemption, the final examination mark will be included as their final mark. 3.4 FINAL EXAMINATIONS 3.4.1 Students who have attained a FINAL COURSE MARK of 50% and above AFTER THE EXAMINATION will pass the course PROVIDED THAT THEY HAVE ATTAINED A MINIMUM OF 40% IN EACH OF THE COMPONENTS IN THE FINAL EXAMINATION. 3.4.2 Failure to meet Subminimum at Final Examination Students with a pass mark of 50% and above but who have not attained the subminimum of 40% in any of the two components will have to write the full supplementary examination. 3.5 SUPPLEMENTARY EXAMINATIONS Students who have attained a SUPPLEMENTARY EXAM MARK of 50% will pass the course. The subminimum requirement will not apply at the supplementary examination. 3.6 GENERAL INFORMATION ON FINAL EXAMINATIONS 3.6.1 ANAT 2020 6 The Continuous Assessments (all End of Regions and End of Block Tests) will contribute 50% to the End of Year final mark while the End of Year examinations proper will contribute the remaining 50%. 3.6.2.

STUDY COMPONENT: HISTOLOGY ANAT 2020 HISTOLOGY OBJECTIVES Histology objectives In this section of the course, the students will be introduced to the basic histological structure and function of the primary tissues and organ systems at light microscopic level. Reference will only be made to ultrastructure where deemed relevant and necessary. The student should be able to apply this knowledge to corresponding anatomical structures and embryological development. Histology should also be related to the function of the human body in both normal and pathological conditions. General Objectives This is an outline of the objectives a student should be able to fulfil at the end of the course. Specific and more comprehensive objectives may be obtained from the Histology Practical Manual. Students are required to make a diagrammatic representation at different levels of magnification of all tissues and organs studied (see Histology Practical Manual). In addition to the Histology Manual, students are required to use the Road maps that contain the labelled photomicrographs of all primary tissues and organ systems to complement their study of the specific topic. After combining the information obtained from the lectures (1), histology practical manual (2) and road maps (3) the student are required to study the Olyvia slides (4) in order to identify the specific structure including the related details previously studied using 1, 2 and 3.

The 12 th set of nerve and vessels are called subcostal nerve and vessels. • The arteries come from two sources: anteriorly from the internal thoracic artery and one of its terminal branches (musculophrenic artery), and posteriorly from the thoracic descending aorta. • The veins drain in two directions: anteriorly to the internal thoracic veins and posteriorly to the azygos system of veins and the brachiocephalic veins. • You will have the opportunity to identify the azygos veins later when the posterior thoracic wall will be dissected. The knowledge of the arrangement of these nerve and blood vessels is important if one is to avoid damage to them when an incision (cut) is being made in the intercostal space. The nerves and blood vessels supply the intercostal muscles and the overlying skin, including the breast. ANAT 2020 61 THE PLEURAL SACS 1. What is the two-layered membrane called that encloses the lung? 2. Name the outer layer of the pleura. What is its position in relation to the thoracic wall? 3. Name the inner layer of the pleura. What is its position in relation to the lungs? 4. What is the potential space between the two pleural layers called? 5. Examine the inside of the anterior thoracic wall. 6. Peel off a part of the parietal pleural membrane from the innermost intercostal muscle so as to have a feel of this membrane. 7. What are the different parts of the pleural layers? 8. Note that the pleural cavities are larger than the lungs. The extra pleural spaces in the inferior parts of the thoracic cavity and around the anterior margins of the left and right lungs are the pleural recesses. They allow for the expansion of the lungs during inspiration. 9. What is the function of the pleural membrane? 10. What is the nerve supply of the parietal and visceral pleural layers? NOTE: The left and right pleura do not communicate and are separated by a movable septum called the mediastinum (to study at a later stage) but are connected by a tubular fold of pleura that surrounds the roots of the lungs. The anterior thoracic wall would have been cut for you. Pull the cut segment of the thoracic cage inferiorly towards the abdomen. The parietal pleural membrane would most probably have been pulled onto the deep surface of the anterior thoracic wall. THE LUNGS Practical Anatomy Examine the lungs in situ (i.e., in their natural positions). They appear to fill up the entire thoracic cavity. The two lungs are however, separated by the mediastinum. 1. What are the main structures in the mediastinum? (No details at this stage). 2. Remove the lungs and compare the two lungs and determine their major differences (especially the size, shape, and weight, number of fissures and lobes and cardiac impressions). 3. Are the impressions likely to be present in the living state? 4. Make an incision into one of the lungs (Groups X1, X2 and Z1 to cut the left lung and Groups Y1, Y2 and Z2 the right lung) and examine the cut surface (preferably with the aid of a hand lens). NOTE: Microscopic study of the lungs and bronchi will later help you to understand the structural arrangement that enables the lungs to perform their gaseous exchange function. THE BRONCHIAL TREE Identify a bronchus at the root of the same lung that you are dissecting. Follow it for some distance into the substance of the lung to confirm that it divides repeatedly into smaller bronchi. The right lung receives three lobar bronchi while the left lung receives two. Review the names of the bronchopulmonary segments in each lung. ANAT 2020 62 NEUROVASCULAR COMPONENTS Two sets of arteries enter the lung tissue: Pulmonary arteries & Bronchial arteries 1. Identify these blood vessels. 2. What are the differences between these two arteries in terms of the type of blood that they convey? Two sets of veins leave the lung tissue: Pulmonary veins & Bronchial veins 1. Identify the pulmonary vein (the bronchial vein may be difficult to identify). 2. What are the differences between these two veins in terms of the type of blood that they convey? 3. What is the nerve supply of the visceral pleura and the lungs?

It is continuous with the larynx above at the level of the 6th cervical vertebra. (The cervical part of the trachea will be seen later). It terminates inferiorly by dividing into the principal bronchi at the level of the sternomanubrial joint (disc between thoracic vertebrae 4 and 5). 1. Identify these landmarks on the articulated skeleton. 2. Examine the trachea and ascertain that: • It consists of C-shaped plates of hyaline cartilage, which open posteriorly • The posterior surface, which lies on the oesophagus, is made up of smooth muscle (trachealis muscle) • It divides into the 2 principal bronchi, which, unlike the trachea, consist of irregularly arranged C-shaped cartilages. 3.

What is the arterial supply, venous drainage and nerve supply of the oesophagus? THE THORACIC DUCT This is the main lymphatic duct that receives lymph from the abdomen, pelvis, lower limbs, left mediastinal nodes, left side of the head, neck and face. 1. Identify the thoracic duct posterior to the right border of the lower part of the oesophagus and follow its course cranially as far as possible. You should be able to see its terminal part in the neck at a later stage. 2. Where does it originate? 3. Which lymphatic duct receives lymph from the right side of the head, face, neck and face? THE DIAPHRAGM This fibromuscular septum separates the thoracic from the abdominal cavity. It has 3 main sites of origin: costal, xiphisternal and vertebral. 1.

Make a list of the extra-ocular muscles and indicate the movements that they produce and the nerves that supply them, and 2. With the aid of “Practical Anatomy” and atlas, identify the extra-ocular muscles. The nerves of the orbit The cranial nerves II, III, IV, V and VI and autonomic nerves are the nerves of the orbit. Cranial nerves III, IV and VI innervate the extra-ocular muscles. The cranial nerves II and V supply sensory innervation to the coats of the eyeball. The autonomic nerves innervate the constrictor and dilator muscles of the iris. ANAT 2020 74 1. What are the names of the cranial nerves mentioned above? 2. Identify the optic nerve. 3.

Through which bony passage does the ophthalmic nerve enter the orbit? 7. Identify the branches of the ophthalmic nerve (nasociliary, lacrimal and frontal). 8. Where, in general terms, are these branches of the ophthalmic nerve distributed? The blood vessels of the orbit The ophthalmic artery, the artery of the eye and orbit, enters the orbit with the optic nerve through the optic canal. It winds round the lateral surface of the optic nerve and then passes medially in the orbit. It gives rise to several branches by which it supplies the contents of the orbit. 1. Identify the ophthalmic artery. 2. Which main artery gives rise to the ophthalmic artery? There are 2 ophthalmic veins (superior and inferior). You may not be able to see these veins in the specimens provided, but it is important to remember that these veins provide important communication channels between the cavernous sinus (in the cranial cavity) and the veins of the face and scalp (scalp = soft tissue covering the skull). The lacrimal apparatus The lacrimal apparatus is located in the upper lateral corner of the orbit, within the fossa for the lacrimal gland of the frontal bone. The gland is responsible for the secretion of lacrimal fluid via a number of excretory ducts. This fluid is then conveyed over the eye ball by the eyelids, before accumulating in the lower medial corner of the eye where it either spill onto the cheeks as tears or is drained into the nasolacrimal sac. Identify the following parts of the lacrimal apparatus on the specimens provided while tracing the production and flow of lacrimal fluid: • The lacrimal gland. • The excretory glands of the lacrimal gland • The lacrimal canaliculi • The lacrimal puncta • The lacrimal papillae • The lacrimal lake • The lacrimal sac • The nasolacrimal sac Where does the nasolacrimal duct drain? THE EAR Refer to “Practical anatomy” (Page 311) and identify the parts of the pinna of your partner. Using a model of the ear note, the following aspects listed below. ANAT 2020 75 The External ear 1. The tympanic membrane (eardrum) is at the medial end of the external acoustic meatus. 2. The external acoustic meatus is not straight. Therefore, in order to be able to see the tympanic membrane with an otoscope, the pinna should be pulled up. The Middle ear (tympanic cavity) 1. This cavity lies between the external ear and the inner ear. Remember that this is the cavity of the ear that is connected to the nasopharynx by the Eustachian tube. Infection in the nasopharynx may therefore spread via this tube to the middle ear, resulting in otitis media (infection of the middle ear cavity). Because of the continuity of the middle ear cavity with the mastoid antrum, mastoiditis may complicate otitis media. 2. Learn to draw this cavity (Figure in Pract Anat). 3. It contains the three auditory ossicles. 4. Learn the names and arrangement of these ossicles. The joints between them are synovial joints. Inflammation of the joints (arthritis) will result in impairment of the affected ear. 5. The stapedius and tensor tympani muscles which protect the tympanic membrane and cochlea against the effects of excessive vibration of the auditory ossicles in response to very loud noises. Learn the function and innervation. The inner ear 1. The bony labyrinth, which is a complex series of passages, lined with endosteum. 2. The membranous labyrinth, a replica of the bony labyrinth, which lies inside the bony labyrinth. 3. The cochlea which contains the cochlear duct in which the organ of Corti (sense organ of hearing) resides. 4. The vestibule, which has the 3 semicircular canals projecting from it and housing the otolith organ (sense organ of balance, which responds to gravity). 5. The facial nerve and vestibulocochlear nerve pass through the internal acoustic meatus into the inner ear. Otitis media that spreads beyond the confines of the middle ear may affect the facial nerve and result in facial nerve palsy. THE NOSE The nose, which draws air into the respiratory passages, and contains the olfactory apparatus and the openings of the paranasal air sinuses, may be divided into the: 1. External nose, which is a protuberance on the face, and which varies greatly in size and shape from one individual to the other, and 2. Nasal cavities, which are separated from one another by the nasal septum. OSTEOLOGY Examine the following bony landmarks on a dried skull: • the anterior nasal aperture (piriform aperture) that leads into the nasal cavities • the nasal bones, which form the upper boundaries of the anterior nasal aperture • the nasion, a depression that is located at the frontonasal suture • the maxilla, which forms the lateral border of the anterior nasal aperture • the nasal spine where the two maxillary bones meet in the midline ANAT 2020 76 • the perpendicular plate of ethmoid and vomer, which form the bony septum of the nasal cavities • the choanae, by which the nasal cavities open into the nasopharynx • the superior, middle and inferior nasal conchae, which are bony shelves in the lateral walls of the nasal cavities Boundaries of the nasal cavities Define the following boundaries of the nasal cavity: Floor, roof, lateral wall and medial wall (the septum). Blood and nerve supply to the nose 1. Which main arteries supply the walls of the nasal cavities? 2. The veins generally follow the arteries. Which other veins do they communicate with? (See “Practical Anatomy”). 3. What is the significance of these communications in spread of infections? 4. Which main nerves carry general and special sensation from the walls of the nasal cavities? PARANASAL SINUSES The paranasal sinuses may be regarded as diverticula of the nasal cavities because they open into the lateral walls of these cavities. Learn to draw the structures as illustrated in “Practical anatomy” to illustrate the openings of these sinuses in one of the lateral walls of the nose. 1. Which bones of the skull have air spaces in them? 2. Do all of these air sinuses qualify, by definition, to be called “paranasal” sinuses? If not, which one is exempt? 3. What are the functions of the paranasal sinuses? 4. How may infections in the nasal cavities affect these sinuses? 5. Compare, in table format, the location and drainage of the following paranasal sinuses: • Frontal sinus • Maxillary sinus • Ethmoidal sinuses (anterior, middle and posterior groups) • Sphenoidal sinus LYMPHATICS OF THE HEAD AND NECK (Refer to Clinically Oriented Anatomy for details) Describe the lymphatic drainage of the following structures: 1. The face and scalp 2. The lips 3. The tongue 4. The salivary glands 5. The tonsils 6.

Flex your neck and, at the same time, turn your face to one side against resistance and observe the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which stands out on the opposite side of the neck. You will soon see how this muscle divides the neck into two main triangular areas. 4. Attempt to identify the laryngeal prominence (Adam’s apple) on your partner. This is the usually sharp upper anterior border of the thyroid cartilage. It is usually more visible in males than females. 5. Feel for the hyoid bone in the angle between the anterior aspect of the neck and the jaw. With your fingers on it, swallow saliva and feel the movement of this bone under your fingers. ANAT 2020 78 SUPERFICIAL STRUCTURES OF THE NECK Superficial structures Identify and study the positions and important immediate relations of the following structures: • Fascia: investing layer of deep fascia • Muscles: trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, inferior belly of omohyoid and infrahyoid muscles • Blood vessels: external jugular veins • Nerves: branches of the cervical plexus and spinal accessory • Gland: submandibular gland • Lymph nodes: superficial cervical lymph nodes Cervical fasciae Apart from the superficial fascia (tela subcutanea; hypodermis) that is immediately deep to the skin, there is a deep fascia that consists of 3 layers. The most superficial of these is the investing layer. It invests the neck like a stocking but splits to enclose the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles and the inferior belly of omohyoid. Immediately above the manubrium of the sternum, the investing fascia splits into two to create the suprasternal space. This space contains the lower ends of the 2 anterior jugular veins, the venous arch that connects them, a few lymph nodes and the sternal ends of the 2 sternocleidomastoid muscles. • Look for these structures. • What are the names of the other two layers of the deep fascia of the neck? • Which structures do they enclose? • What is the clinical and structural significance of these 3 layers of the deep cervical fascia? • Learn to draw the structures as depicted in Figures in “Practical Anatomy”. Muscles 1. Identify the trapezius, sternocleidomastoid and infrahyoid muscles. The latter lie anterior to the trachea and cartilages of the larynx. 2. What are the actions and innervation of these muscles? Blood vessels 1. Identify the anterior and external jugular veins as they descend vertically across the superficial surfaces of the sternocleidomastoid muscles. 2. How are these veins formed? 3. Where do these veins terminate? 4. Which tributaries do they receive before their termination? NERVES Cervical plexus A. Cutaneous branches: Dissect carefully through the investing layer of deep fascia and identify the nerves that emerge from the deep surface of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at about the midpoint of its posterior border. These are the supraclavicular, transverse cervical, great auricular and lesser occipital nerves. They are the cutaneous branches of ANAT 2020 79 the cervical plexus derived from the anterior primary rami of C2-C4 segments of the spinal cord. Ansa cervicalis: These are motor branches of the cervical plexus. They are derived from the anterior primary rami of C1-C3 segments of the spinal cord and innervate the infrahyoid strap muscles as well as the geniohyoid and thyrohyoid muscles. You will see these muscles later and you do not have to look for the nerves. B. Spinal Accessory nerves 1. Look for these nerves as they descend postero-inferiorly on the surface of the levator scapulae and disappear deep to the anterior border of the trapezius muscle on both sides. 2. Which muscles do these nerves innervate? 3. Supposing the accessory nerve on one side is cut, what will the individual not be able to do? GLANDS Submandibular gland Carefully reflect the investing layer of deep cervical fascia from the lower border of the mandible and identify the submandibular gland immediately deep to this border. Study its anatomy. Cervical Lymph nodes These are disposed in 2 groups: Superficial group These are located around the upper part of the external jugular vein. Deep These are located deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (see Clinically Oriented Anatomy). The jugulo-omohyoid and jugulo-digastric nodes are of particular clinical importance. 1. From which structures do they receive lymph? 2. In which clinical conditions may they be implicated? TRIANGLES OF THE NECK For ease of description, the neck is divided into 2 main triangular areas, namely the anterior and posterior triangles. The anterior triangle is further divided into carotid, submandibular, submental and muscular triangles. NOTE: Your prescribed textbook, Clinically Oriented Anatomy by KL Moore, AF Dalley and AMR Agur, has a slightly different naming convention for triangles of the neck (namely Posterior- posterior to the anterior border of Trapezius, Lateral- anterior to the anterior border of Trapezius; and Anterior triangle –as described here). For reference, the Lateral Triangle in Clin Anat will henceforth be referred to as the Posterior Triangle, both in text and lectures. ANAT 2020 80 THE ANTERIOR TRIANGLE OF THE NECK Carotid triangle 1. Define the boundaries of the carotid triangle. 2. Identify the contents of this triangle and take note of their relationships to one another. 3. Identify the two terminal branches of the common carotid artery i.e., internal and external carotid arteries. At this stage, learn to draw Figure in Pract Anat. 4. What are the branches of the external carotid artery? 5. What are the branches of the vagus/accessory nerves in the neck? Submandibular triangle 1. Define the boundaries of this triangle. 2. Identify the contents of this triangle. 3. Remove as much of the submandibular gland as is necessary for you to see the relationship between it and the facial artery and vein. Submental triangle 1. Define the boundaries of this triangle. 2. Know that the submandibular and submental triangles combine to form the floor of the mouth. They contain the important submental lymph nodes, which drain the lower lips ipsilaterally and contralaterally. This implies that cancer on one side of the lower lip will spread to lymph nodes in the opposite triangle as well as to those on the same side. THE THYROID GLAND: This is an endocrine (ductless) gland that clasps the front and sides of the cervical tubes (larynx and trachea; pharynx and oesophagus) like a shield at the level of the bodies of the 5 th, 6 th and 7th cervical vertebrae. Morphology and relations 1. Identify the thyroid gland and define its morphological parts. 2. Verify the immediate relations of the thyroid gland. 3. On which tracheal rings does the isthmus lie? 4. Does the thyroid gland in the cadaver have a third (pyramidal) lobe? 5. If so, what is its embryonic origin? Blood vessels 1. Identify the thyroid arteries and veins. 2. How many arteries and veins supply this gland? 3. What are the origins of the thyroid arteries? 4. Where do the thyroid veins drain? Innervation The thyroid gland receives its innervation from postganglionic nerves that are derived from the superior, middle and inferior cervical sympathetic ganglia. ANAT 2020 81 They are vasomotor nerves, which travel to the gland along the branches of the vagus nerve and the arteries that supply the gland. What does the term “vasomotor” mean? Lymphatic drainage Vessels lie in interlobular fascia near arteries and communicate with capsular network of lymph vessels. They drain into: • Prelaryngeal lymph nodes (LN) that drain to superior cervical lymph nodes • Pretracheal LN and Paratracheal LN that drain into inferior deep cervical LNs Laterally, vessels along superior thyroid vein drain via the following nodes: • Inferior deep cervical LN→Brachiocephalic LN → Thoracic duct Applied anatomy What will be the effect of an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre) on the trachea and oesophagus? THE LARYNGEAL NERVES: Remove the thyroid gland and look for the recurrent, external and internal laryngeal nerves. Recurrent laryngeal nerves 1. Look for the left and right recurrent laryngeal nerves in the grooves between the trachea and the oesophagus. 2. At what level does each of these nerves originate from the corresponding vagus nerve? 3. Which structures do they wind around as they leave the vagus nerves? Note: The terminal part of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is also known as the inferior laryngeal nerve. Superior laryngeal nerves 1. These are branches (one on each side) of the vagus nerve. Each divides into the external and internal laryngeal nerves. 2. Identify the superior laryngeal nerve lateral to the hyoid bone. 3. Attempt to locate the external and internal laryngeal nerves. The external laryngeal nerve crosses the superior thyroid vessels deep to the apex of the lobe of the thyroid gland and supplies the cricothyroid muscle. The internal laryngeal nerve pierces the thyrohyoid membrane to supply the laryngeal mucous membrane above the vocal fold.

Which structures are supplied by each of these branches? CERVICAL PLEXUS Please refer to section “superficial structures of the neck” for content. Practice drawing the plexus. THE LAST FOUR CRANIAL NERVES: These are the: • Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) • Vagus nerve (CN X) • Accessory nerve (CN XI) • Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) These nerves are closely related to the internal jugular vein, the internal carotid artery and to one another, at the base of the skull. The first three leave the cranial cavity through the jugular foramen, while the hypoglossal leaves through the hypoglossal canal. They all lie between the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery. 1. Identify the jugular foramen and hypoglossal canal on the dry skull. 2.

THE INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY The internal carotid artery leaves the neck and passes into the cranial cavity to supply the brain, by passing through the carotid canal and the upper part of the foramen lacerum in the petrous part of the temporal bone of the skull. 1. With the aid of your atlas, identify these bony parts on the dry skull. 2. Does the internal carotid artery supply any structure in the neck? THE VERTEBRAL ARTERIES You must have seen the left and right vertebral arteries as they originated from the first part of the corresponding subclavian arteries in the posterior triangles of the neck. 1. Identify one of these arteries again and follow it cranially to the transverse foramen of the sixth cervical vertebra. 2. Define the three parts of the vertebral artery in the neck.

Use a piece of chalk to mark out the outline of the calotte to be removed. This line should pass immediately above the external ear (auricle) and 3 – 5 cm above the external occipital protuberance. This will provide a wide enough space for the removal of the brain. When this has been done, the technical staff will cut through the exposed bone for you. Remove the calotte. REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN This will be shown to and done for you by a demonstrator. THE SCALP This is the soft tissue covering the skull. It is more than just the skin covering the skull. It is made up of five layers. 1. Identify these 5 layers of the scalp on your cadaver.

Which are the superficial veins that drain the brain? 2. How is the great cerebral vein formed? 3. Where does this vein terminate? The essential questions that you should be able to answer about each of the cranial nerves are: 1. What is the name and Roman numeral of this nerve? (Note: when referring to a cranial nerve, both the name and Roman numeral must be given. e.g., optic nerve – CN II) Add cranial nerve names to Figure in Practical Anatomy) 2.

Main branches, if you have come across them elsewhere (e.g., terminal branches of the facial nerve on the face) 8. List of the structures innervated (i.e., distribution) 9. Main functions – see Neuroanatomy textbook by Crossman & Neary. THE BRAINSTEM The brainstem is the narrow, almost cylindrical part of the brain that connects the spinal cord to the cerebrum and cerebellum. It consists of three parts, which appear to be demarcated from each other in their anterior aspects. However, the three parts are structurally continuous with each other, with no internal demarcation. Internally are found tracts, cranial nerve nuclei, other nuclei, the reticular formation etc. Look at cross sections of the different parts of the brainstem to appreciate the complexity of the internal organisation. 1. What are the three parts of the brainstem? 2. Which structures connect the three parts of the brainstem to the cerebellum? The midbrain 1. Examine the anterior, posterior and lateral aspects of the external surface of the midbrain and identify their main features. 2. Identify the boundaries and contents of the interpeduncular fossa. 3. Which structures of the interpeduncular fossa (boundaries and contents) are constituents of the midbrain, and which belong to the hypothalamus? Which belong to neither? 4. List the nerve fibres contained in the crus cerebri. 5. With which functions are the superior and inferior colliculi associated? 6. Which cranial nerves have their nuclei in the midbrain? The pons 1.

ANAT 2020 92 THE CRANIAL NERVES AND STRUCTURES AT THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE MIDBRAIN AND THALAMUS Identify all the cranial nerves and note where CN III to CN XII emerges from the brainstem. Be specific when you give the point of attachment/emergence, e.g., for CN XII, the hypoglossal nerve, the answer “medulla oblongata” is not good enough; it should be “from the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata lateral to the pyramid/between the pyramid and the olive”. The superior and inferior colliculi These are four elevations on the posterior aspect of the midbrain. Collectively they are called the corpora quadrigemina. The geniculate bodies These are four elevations found at the back of the thalami, two on each thalamus. They are the lateral and medial geniculate bodies. The lateral geniculate body is structurally associated with the superior colliculus of the midbrain and the optic tract and therefore functionally with the visual pathway. Follow the optic tract around the crus cerebri to the lateral geniculate body. 1. Gently separate the cerebellum from the cerebrum to visualise the superior and inferior colliculi. The membranes should be removed to get a clear picture. The pineal body is imbedded in the membranes; try to preserve it. 2. Identify the brachium of the superior colliculus. 3. The medial geniculate body is similarly associated with the inferior colliculus and the auditory pathway. 4. Identify the medial geniculate body inferomedial to the lateral geniculate body. 5. Identify the brachium of the inferior colliculus. 6. Where is the transverse cerebral fissure of the brain and which dural fold occupies most of it when the brain is still in the cranial cavity? SECTION OF THE MIDBRAIN AT THE LEVEL OF THE SUPERIOR COLLICULI 1. Cut through the midbrain at the level of both the superior and inferior colliculi. 2. Learn to draw a well labelled diagram of sections at these two levels. 3.

ANAT 2020 99 UNIT THEME 5: ABDOMEN Capability statement By completion of this section the student must be able to understand the basic and applied anatomical structure and function structures within the abdomen. The student should be able to apply this knowledge and provide the anatomical basis underlying specific clinical scenarios pertaining to diseases and injuries to the abdomen. Embedded knowledge Students must know and understand the following before studying the sub-unit theme: • Anatomical terminology & orientation • Anatomy of the thorax SUB-UNIT THEME 5.1: ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL AND INGUINAL CANAL WEEK 25: SPECIFIC OUTCOMES • Describe the general arrangement of the dermatomes of the anterior abdominal wall • Describe the general arrangement and attachments of the muscles and aponeuroses of the anterior abdominal wall • Define the boundaries (wall) and describe the contents of the rectus sheath • Identify the folds on the deep surface of the anterior abdominal wall and state what they represent • Define the walls and describe the contents of the inguinal canal • Describe and explain the principle of the formation of inguinal hernias • Differentiate between the different types of inguinal hernia • differentiate between an inguinal hernia and a femoral hernia WEEK 25: DISSECTION SPECIFIC OUTCOMES DERMATOMES 1. Revise the definition of the word “dermatome”. The skin of the anterior abdominal wall receives its nerve supply mainly from the intercostal nerves, which are derived from the anterior primary rami of T7 – T11 and from the subcostal nerve (T12). These nerves descend obliquely and anteriorly beyond the costal margin to supply the skin of the anterior abdominal wall. Two dermatomes form important reference points for marking out the remaining ones. 2. The skin of the epigastrium (area below the xiphoid process of the sternum) is innervated by T7. 3. The umbilicus and the skin that extends obliquely superiorly and laterally from it, is innervated by T10. 4. What is the usefulness of the knowledge of dermatomes in clinical practice? ANAT 2020 100 THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL 1. Follow the dissection instruction in the Practical Anatomy textbook. 2. Identify a few of the cutaneous nerves. Remember that the cutaneous nerve that supplies the skin around the umbilicus is derived from T10 segment of the spinal cord. 3. Note that the deep fascia of the anterior abdominal wall is thinner than the one that covers limb muscles. What is the advantage of having minimal deep fascia in the abdominal wall? Muscles of the anterior abdominal wall: The knowledge of the attachments of the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall is essential to the understanding of the inguinal canal, linea alba and the rectus sheath, all of which are of great clinical importance. Therefore, the detailed attachments of these muscles must be learned. The 3 pairs of flat muscles are the: • External oblique muscle • Internal oblique muscle • Transversus abdominis muscle Note that the three muscles correspond to, and are in the same plane as, the 3 intercostal muscles of the thoracic wall. 1. Identify these abdominal muscles. 2. Note the orientation of their muscle fibres. 3. What are the attachments and nerve supplies of these muscles? The two long muscles: These are the rectus abdominis muscles. They lay vertically, one on either side of the midline of the anterior abdominal wall. 1. Note that the lateral border of the muscle is gently curved laterally and is called the semilunar line (linea semilunaris). 2. Identify where this line crosses the 9th costochondral junction. This is an important landmark as it overlies the fundus of the gallbladder on the right side. The horizontal line that joins these points on both sides is the transpyloric plane. You will see the importance of this plane later. 3. The rectus abdominis muscle is enclosed in an aponeurotic sheath that must be cut open before the muscle can be seen. 4. Study the attachments of the rectus abdominis muscles. 5. What are the blood supply and innervation of these muscles? 6. What are the functions of these muscles? The rectus sheath: The aponeuroses of the three flat muscles enclose the intermediate parts of the rectus abdominis muscle to form the rectus sheath (see Figure in Practical Anatomy). The proximal and distal parts of these muscles lie on costal cartilages and transversalis fascia respectively. ANAT 2020 101 Therefore, the rectus sheath is incomplete in these parts. 1. Identify the 3 flat muscles and their aponeuroses. 2. Follow each aponeurosis to the midline of the anterior abdominal wall where they form the linea alba and ascertain its contribution to the formation of the rectus sheath at 3 levels: above the costal margin, above the umbilicus and above the pubic symphysis. 3. Is the linea alba very vascular? 4. How does the degree of vascularity of the linea alba influence the choice for making abdominal incisions and subsequent wound healing in this part of the abdominal wall? 5. What are the contents of the rectus sheath? 6. Learn to draw and label the structures as depicted in Figure in Pract Anat. DEEP SURFACE OF THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL Make incisions through the whole thickness of the anterior abdominal wall along vertical lines that begin just below the costal margins and extend inferiorly to the iliac crest in the mid-axillary lines. Extend the inferior end of the incisions forward to the level of the anterior superior iliac spine. Join the top ends of the vertical incisions. This sets the anterior abdominal wall free, which can now be turned inferiorly. 1. Identify the median, medial and lateral umbilical folds on the posterior surface of the anterior abdominal wall. 2. What structures lie within these folds? 3. Identify the falciform ligament. 4. Why does it persist? 5. To which organ does the falciform ligament attach superiorly? DIVISIONS OF THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL The anterior abdominal wall is often divided into 9 areas by imaginary lines (Addison’s planes).

THE POSTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL The posterior abdominal wall consists of the lumbar vertebrae, the lower ribs, the posterior part of the diaphragm and the psoas major, psoas minor (if present) and quadratus lumborum muscles. Lying on the posterior abdominal wall are the abdominal aorta and its branches, the inferior vena cava and its tributaries, the sympathetic trunk and nerves, which are terminal branches of the lumbar plexus. 1. Identify these structures and note their relationship to one another. Practical Anatomy contains relevant and simple line drawings to illustrate these structures (Figures 5.55 – 5.57). 2.

Embedded knowledge Students must know and understand the following before studying the sub-unit theme: • Anatomical terminology & orientation • Anatomy of the abdomen SUB-UNIT THEME 6.1: THE MALE AND FEMALE PELVIS – PELVIC GIRDLE & PERITONEUM WEEK 28: SPECIFIC OUTCOMES By the end of this week, the student should be able to: • Describe the components of the pelvic girdle, their main bony features and surface markings • Differentiate between male and female pelvic bones, • Distinguish between the true pelvis and the false pelvis • Describe the bony components of the pelvic wall • Differentiate between male and female pelvic bones and pelvic cavities • Appreciate the continuity of the pelvic cavity with the abdominal cavity • Describe the reflections of the pelvic peritoneum • Identify anatomical features and major relations on diagnostic images, e.g., CT, MRI, radiographs WEEK 28: DISSECTION SPECIFIC OUTCOMES THE PELVIC GIRDLE: 1. Which bones constitute the pelvic girdle? 2. Identify the following landmarks on the pelvis: • Anterior superior and inferior iliac spines • Iliopubic crest and pubic tubercle • Obturator foramen (and bony groove that is concerted to a canal) • Ischial tuberosity and spine • Posterior superior and inferior iliac spines • Iliac crest and tuberosity THE PELVIS: The pelvis consists of a musculoskeletal wall (pelvic wall), which encloses a cavity (pelvic cavity). The bony structure of the pelvic wall is bound together and to the vertebral column by strong ligaments. This is necessary as the pelvis transmits the weight of the body to the bones of the lower limb. The cavity of the pelvis contains the urinary bladder and rectum as well as the internal organs of reproduction (internal genitalia) in males and females. ANAT 2020 111 The major differences between male and female pelvis result mainly from the fact that the female pelvis is designed for childbearing. Compare the male and female pelves in table format. Question What are the major differences between the male and female pelvis? SUBDIVISIONS OF THE PELVIC CAVITY As a part of the lower limb, you studied the parts of the pelvic bones and in week 21, you studied the sacrum and coccyx. The two pelvic bones, the sacrum and coccyx are articulated to form the bony pelvis. 1. Examine the articulated bony pelvis and identify its major parts. 2. Identify the pelvic brim (pelvic inlet), which demarcates the true pelvic cavity from the false pelvic cavity. 3. How do these two parts of the pelvic cavity differ from one another? 4. Why are they called true and false parts of the pelvic cavity? 5. What are the main differences between the male and female pelvic cavities? CONTINUITY OF PELVIC AND ABDOMINAL CAVITIES Examine the pelvis of the cadaver and: 1. Define the true and false parts of the pelvic cavity. 2. Confirm that there is no muscular partition between the abdominal and pelvic cavities. Recollect that the coils of small intestine (which are abdominal structures) extended to the iliac fossae, which are parts of the pelvic cavity. The iliac fossa is therefore common to both the abdomen and the pelvis. Some pelvic organs sometimes extend to the abdominal cavity, for example a pregnant uterus. This is possible because of the continuity of the two cavities. For this reason, the two cavities are sometimes called the abdominopelvic cavity. PELVIC FASCIA AND PELVIC PERITONEUM The viscera in the pelvis are surrounded by loose, fatty connective tissue called the pelvic fascia. For descriptive purposes, this fascia may be divided into the visceral pelvic fascia, which immediately surrounds the viscera, and the parietal pelvic fascia, which lines the pelvic wall. The viscera and the surrounding fascia are then covered above (and to some extent on the sides) by the pelvic part of the peritoneum, which is simply called the pelvic peritoneum. Study the reflections (outline) of the pelvic peritoneum from the posterior surface of the anterior abdominal wall to the rectum and note the pouch between the urinary bladder and the rectum (in the male) and between the urinary bladder and the uterus (in the female). 1. Describe the peritoneal reflections, endopelvic fasciae and ligaments of the pelvis 1. What are the names of these pouches? 2. Note the presence of an additional, but deeper pouch between the uterus and the rectum in the female. 3. What is the name of this pouch? 4. Which abdominal structures are normally present in these pouches? 5. Since the pouches between the uterus and the rectum and between the urinary bladder and the rectum are the most dependant (lowermost) parts of the peritoneal cavity, fluid (blood, serous fluid or infected fluid) may collect in them. ANAT 2020 112 6. Peel away the peritoneum from the pelvic viscera. Dissect around these viscera in order to convince yourself that they are surrounded by fascia 7. Why is this fascia of the loose type? ANAT 2020 113 SUB-UNIT THEME 6.2: PELVIC VISCERA (URINARY BLADDER, MALE & FEMALE INTERNAL GENITALIA) WEEK 28 (cont.): SPECIFIC OUTCOMES By the end of this week, the student should be able to: • Describe the basic anatomy, including the relations, of the urinary bladder in males and females • Describe the basic anatomy and relations of the male internal genitalia • Describe the basic anatomy and relations of the female internal genitalia • Describe the peritoneal relations, shape, blood supply and immediate relations of the rectum in males and females • Identify the internal iliac artery and its major branches • Describe the muscular components of the pelvic wall • Identify muscle groups of the pelvic diaphragm and the perineal body. • Identify anatomical features and major relations on diagnostic images, e.g., CT, MRI, radiographs WEEK 28 (cont.): DISSECTION SPECIFIC OUTCOMES PELVIC VISCERA THAT ARE COMMON TO BOTH SEXES The urinary bladder and rectum are common to the male and female pelvis. The Urinary Bladder This organ may not be readily identifiable in the cadaver because it is usually empty and pressed down posterior to the body of the pubic bone and the pubic symphysis. 1. Identify the urinary bladder in this location and dissect it clear of the pubic bone. 2. Describe the anatomy of the bladder 3. What are the immediate relations of the urinary bladder? 4. Note that there is a small space between the bladder and the pubic bone. What is the name of this space? 5. You should study the morphological features of the urinary bladder. 6.

ANAT 2020 114 THE MALE INTERNAL GENITALIA The internal genitalia of the male are the seminal vesicles, the prostate gland, the ductus (vas) deferens and the urethra. If the cadaver is a female, team up with the students on a nearby table with a male cadaver for this segment of the dissection. 1. Identify these structures in the male cadaver. 2. Study the prostatic urethra. 3. The prostate gland enlarges (hypertrophies) frequently in old age. This hypertrophy may be a benign one (not life threatening) or it may be due to a carcinoma. 4. What is the possible effect of prostatic hypertrophy on the prostatic urethra? 5. Identify the ductus deferens and the ureter at the pelvic brim. Follow the ureter to the urinary bladder and the ductus deferens to the seminal vesicle. Note the very important relationship between the ductus deferens and the ureter (See Figure 5.61). 6. Explain the structure & organisation of seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts and ductus deferens. 7. Describe the anatomy of the prostate and bulbo urethral glands. THE FEMALE INTERNAL GENITALIA The female internal genitalia are the uterus, the uterine tubes, the ovaries, the vagina and the urethra. The uterus, uterine tubes, ovaries and vagina are covered to varying extents by pelvic peritoneum. The uterine tube, in particular, is draped by a double layer of peritoneum, which is called the broad ligament. 1. Identify these structures in the female cadaver. If the cadaver is a male, you need to team up with members of a table with a female cadaver. 2. Which of the female internal genitalia may expand into the abdominal cavity and under what conditions? 3. List the structures of the female internal genitalia 4. Describe the function of the ovaries and the boundaries of the ovarian fossa 5. List the parts of the uterine tubes 6. Describe the uterus, its positions and the relationship between the uterus and other pelvic structures 7. Describe the functions and relations of the vagina THE PELVIC WALL The demonstrator will select a few cadavers in which the pelvic organs will be removed in order that the pelvic wall may be accessible. The pelvic organs in the other cadavers will be left intact for future revision exercises. When you have removed these organs, examine the pelvic wall. It consists of bony, muscular and neurovascular components. Bony components 1. Study the articulated bony pelvis again to determine the parts that contribute to the wall of the pelvis. 2. Identify these bony parts as far as possible in the cadaver. ANAT 2020 115 Muscular components 1. Identify the piriformis and obturator internus muscles. 2. Can you still remember the nerve that passed into the gluteal region, inferior to the piriformis muscle? What is its name? Neuromuscular component This consists of the internal iliac artery and its branches, the accompanying veins, lymphatics, sympathetic trunk and branches of the sacral plexus. Identify the following: • Internal iliac artery, which is the main artery of the pelvis • Lumbosacral trunk • Sciatic nerve, the nerve of the back of the thigh and the leg and foot and • Sympathetic trunk THE PELVIC DIAPHRAGM This is the muscle of the pelvic floor. It is perforated by the outlets of the gastrointestinal tract (anal canal), the urinary tract (urethra) and the reproductive tract (vagina). It also forms the roof of the soft tissue area that surrounds these outlets (the perineum). 1. What are the different muscle components of the pelvic diaphragm? 2. Identify these different components. 3. Are these muscles of skeletal or smooth type? 4. What type of nerves supplies them? 5. What are the other functions of the pelvic diaphragm? 6.

ANAT 2020 116 SUB-UNIT THEME 6.3: THE PERINEUM THE MALE AND FEMALE EXTERNAL GENITALIA WEEK 29: SPECIFIC OUTCOMES By the end of this week, the student should be able to: • Describe the developmental process that resulted in the formation of the spermatic cord • Describe the layers of the spermatic cord • Describe the coverings and the basic structure of the testis • Describe the origin, course and termination of the ductus deferens • Describe the anatomy of the penis • Describe the component parts of the female external genitalia • Describe the boundaries of the perineum and how it is subdivided into urogenital and anal triangles • Demonstrate the position and boundaries of the male and female deep perineal pouches • Demonstrate the position and boundaries of the male and female superficial perineal pouches • Describe the contents of the perineal pouches in both sexes • Describe the position, boundaries and contents of the ischio-anal fossa • Describe the anatomy of the anal canal • Describe the position and arrangement of the internal and external anal sphincters • Identify anatomical features and major relations on diagnostic images, e.g., CT, MRI, radiographs WEEK 29: DISSECTION SPECIFIC OUTCOMES THE SPERMATIC CORD The testis developed in the posterior abdominal wall at about the level of the first lumbar vertebra. From this position, it descended through the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall into the scrotum in the perineum. In its course, it took a fold of the peritoneum and of every other layer of the anterior abdominal wall around itself and the ductus deferens. Therefore, the ductus deferens and accompanying neurovascular structures, together with the tissue layers that surround them form the spermatic cord. 1. Identify the spermatic cord as it descends across the surface of the pubic bone. 2. Follow the spermatic cord proximally and determine the n opening through which it exits the anterior abdominal wall. 3. Dissect through the spermatic cord and identify the ductus deferens. What makes it different from the other structures in the spermatic cord? 4. What are the other contents of the spermatic cord? 5. Tabulate the layers of the spermatic cord against the layers of the anterior abdominal wall from which they are derived. THE TESTIS Since the testis descended through the anterior abdominal wall, it necessarily has the same tissue coverings as the ductus deferens, with the addition of a smooth muscle layer called the dartos muscle. These coverings constitute the wall of the scrotum. The testis lies in the scrotal sac. ANAT 2020 117 1. What is the function of the dartos muscle? 2. Make an incision through the scrotal wall to release the testis. 3. If the outer coat of peritoneum (parietal tunica) has been cut and reflected with the scrotal wall (this is usually the case in the cadaver), you will see a shining surface to the testis. This is due to the presence of a visceral tunica on the surface of the testis 4. What is the name given to the two coats (tunica) and the cavity between them? 5. What is the name of the embryonic proximal continuation of this sac that is normally obliterated as the testis descends? 6. Identify the epididymis and its different parts. 7. Follow the ductus deferens proximally to determine its course through the spermatic cord, inguinal canal and pelvic cavity. 8. Cut the testis into two and examine its internal structure. 9. Identify the mediastinum testis, the tunica albuginea and the region between these two where the seminiferous tubules are concentrated. THE PENIS Compress the penis between your fingers and notice the firmness of its texture. This is due to the presence of 3 bundles of erectile tissue called the corpora cavernosa (two) and corpus spongiosum. 1. Examine the dorsal surface of the penis and identify the dorsal vein of penis. 2. Divide the penis transversely into two and identify the structures seen on the cut surface. 3. Reflect the coverings of the distal stump of the penis and follow the corpora cavernosa to the glans penis, taking note of their continuation with the glans. 4. Put a probe into the external urethral orifice and confirm the presence of the probe in the corpus spongiosum. 5. Follow the corpora cavernosa of the proximal stump as far into the perineum as possible and ascertain their attachment to the ischiopubic rami of the pelvic bones. 6. What are the names of the muscles that you find associated with the erectile tissues? THE FEMALE EXTERNAL GENITALIA Examine the anterior part of the perineum where the female external genitalia are located. 1. Identify the mons pubis, the area of skin on the anterior surface of the pubic bone, which usually bears a lot of hairs. 2. Identify the labia majora, labia minora and the clitoris. 3. Does the clitoris contain the same three erectile tissues as are in the penis? 4. Does the urethra pass through clitoris? The space between the labia minora is generally referred to as the vagina. But, in fact, it leads to the vaginal vestibule. The vestibule contains the vaginal introitus (or vaginal opening), and the external urethral orifice. 1. Identify the vaginal introitus and the external urethral orifice. 2. Put a finger (respectfully) in the vaginal introitus and assess the capacity and limits of the vaginal cavity. 3. Put a probe into the urethra and feel for it in the urinary bladder (if the urinary bladder is still present). 4. Dissect through the skin of the labia minora and identify the bulbs of the vestibule and the greater vestibular glands. What are the male equivalents of these structures? ANAT 2020 118 THE PERINEUM This is the lowermost part of the trunk, which lies between the upper medial surfaces of the thighs and surrounds the openings of the three tubular systems, namely the anal canal (gastrointestinal tract), the urethra (urinary tract) and the vagina (genital tract). It is diamond- shaped, with the angles at the pubic symphysis, coccyx and ischial tuberosities. 1. Define the boundaries of the perineum. 2. Which imaginary line is used to divide the perineum into two triangular areas? 3. What are the names of these triangles? 4. Where is the surface marking of the perineal body? THE DEEP PERINEAL SPACE (POUCH) This is the potential space, which lies inferior to the medial free borders of the levator ani muscle. A fascial layer, which is attached to the perineal body posteriorly and the ischio- pubic rami anterolaterally enclose the space. It leaves a small gap between its anterior margin and the pubic symphysis for the passage of the deep dorsal vein of the penis or clitoris. Inside the space is a triangular sheet of muscle called the deep transverse perineal muscle. The central fibres of the muscle surround the urethra forming the external urethral sphincter in the male. Similar muscle fibres surround the vagina in the female forming the sphincter vaginae. Together with its covering fascia, the muscle is called the urogenital diaphragm. 1. Which blood vessels and nerves are present in this space? 2. What is the name of the gland that is present in this space in the male? 3. What are the named parts of the fascia covering the muscle? 4. Which of the male internal genitalia rests on the superior surface of the superior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm? THE SUPERFICIAL PERINEAL SPACE (POUCH) This is the fascial space inferior to the urogenital diaphragm, which encloses the external genitalia in both sexes. The space is bounded externally by the membranous layer of superficial fascia called Colles’ fascia, which is an extension of the fascia from the anterior abdominal wall to the perineum. Hence, the superficial perineal space is continuous with the space under the membranous layer of superficial fascia in the anterior abdominal wall. 1. Define the outline of the perineal fascia (Colles’ fascia). 2. What is the territorial spread of urine following a rupture of the urethra in the superficial perineal spaces of the male and female? THE ISCHIO-ANAL FOSSA The ischio-anal fossa is a wedge-shaped fat-filled space between the anal canal and the ischium of the pelvic bone. The space is to allow for the expansion of the anal canal when necessary. 1. What are the boundaries of the ischio-anal fossa? 2. What are the other contents of the ischio-anal fossa? 3. Considering the large amount of fat that is present in the fossa, what do you think is the disadvantage of an infection of the ischio-anal fossa? ANAT 2020 119 THE ANAL CANAL The anal canal begins at the ano-rectal junction and slopes postero-inferiorly to its opening. The anal canal developed from two sources. This fact explains the dual source of the blood supply, nerve supply and lymphatic drainage of the anal canal. 1. What are the two sources from which the anal canal developed? 2. Identify the beginning of the anal canal. 3. What are the characteristic features of the mucosa of the anal canal? 4. What are the relations of the anal canal? 5. What are the arterial blood supply and venous drainage of the anal canal? 6. It is a useful exercise at this stage to review the locations of the porto-systemic anastomoses and the effects of portal hypertension at these sites. 7. What is the nerve supply of the anal canal? 8. What is the lymphatic drainage of the anal canal? 9. Which muscles form the sphincter of the anal canal and how are they arranged?

Differentiate, in table format, between a femoral hernia, direct inguinal hernia and indirect inguinal hernia in terms of location and relations. ANAT 2020 126 NOTE: The femoral canal opens superiorly into the abdominal cavity and may be the route by which an abdominal structure could descend, under pressure, into the upper part of the thigh. Such an abnormal protrusion is called a hernia. In this case, it is a femoral hernia. Nerve of the anterior compartment: This is the femoral nerve. 1. Identify this nerve just inferior to the inguinal ligament and follow it distally until it breaks up into its terminal branches. 2. What is the name of the nerve plexus from which this nerve arises? 3. Revise the names of the muscles that this nerve supplies. Arteries of the anterior compartment: 1.

Follow the femoral artery and vein through the apex of the femoral triangle to the popliteal fossa where you have already seen them. The narrow intermuscular passage, through which the femoral artery and vein pass from the femoral triangle to the popliteal fossa, is the adductor (subsartorial) canal. 3. Identify, name, schematically illustrate and describe the course and name the origin of the femoral artery, deep artery of the thigh, medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries, and the obturator artery. 4. Identify, name, schematically illustrate and name the origin of the arteries that form the cruciate anastomosis on the level of the lesser trochanter. 5.

Why might stripping the lesser saphenous vein for varicose veins leave the patient with a tingling in her little toe? 4. Why will a patient complain of pain and paraesthesia in the medial side of the lower leg following stripping of the greater saphenous vein for varicosities? 5. Describe the so-called \"venous pump\" of the leg. 6. Illustrate by means of labelled diagrams the difference between direct and indirect venous perforators. 7. A patient admitted to the emergency department requires an instant intravenous line. His veins are collapsed so the attending physician performs a \"cut-down\" on the greater saphenous vein. Where would he find it? Provide an anatomical reason for your answer. 8. Illustrate, by means of a well labelled diagram, the location of the venous perforators of the lower limb and their connections. ANAT 2020 127 Lymphatic drainage 1. Explain the lymphatic drainage of the lower limb. 2. Explain how infection can spread from the foot to the groin area via the lymphatic system. THE ANTERIOR COMPARTMENT OF THE LEG AND THE DORSUM OF THE FOOT NOTE: This compartment lies between the lateral surface of the tibia and the anterior intermuscular septum. The deep fascia of the lower limb extends from the thigh to the leg where it is known as the crural fascia. It is continues with the periosteum of the tibia. Around the ankle joint, the crural fascia forms fibrous bands. 1. Identify the superior and inferior extensor retinacula, superior and inferior peroneal retinacula and flexor retinaculum 2. Which important artery and nerve passes underneath the extensor retinacula to supply the dorsum of the foot? Muscles: These are the extensors (dorsiflexors) of the foot. They are: • Tibialis anterior • Extensor digitorum longus • Fibularis (peroneus) tertius • Extensor hallucis longus 1. Identify these muscles. 2. Which of these muscles supports the medial longitudinal arch of the foot? 3. Which nerve supply these muscles? 4. Why would damage to the nerve supplying these muscles result in the patient presenting with a “drop foot”? Nerves: 1. Identify again the common fibular (peroneal) nerve as it winds around the neck of the fibula. 2. Trace this nerve through the lateral compartment to the anterior compartment of the leg. 3. What will be the effect of a severe injury to this nerve in a fracture of the neck of the fibula? Arteries: 1. Identify again the popliteal artery and its terminal branches (anterior and posterior tibial) in the popliteal fossa as well as the fibular (peroneal artery). 2.

Identify the trifurcation of the popliteal artery and the anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery and fibular artery on an arteriogram. THE MEDIAL COMPARTMENT OF THE THIGH In this compartment are four muscles that adduct the thigh at the hip joint, one that flexes and laterally rotates the thigh and one that laterally rotates the thigh and steadies the head of the femur in the socket. Muscles Four of them are arranged in three layers. • interior layer – pectineus and adductor longus (same plane) • intermediate layer – adductor brevis • posterior layer – adductor magnus Medially is gracilis. This extends from the pelvic bone to the tibia. Deep to the adductor group of muscles is obturator externus. This also extends from the pelvic bone to the femur. Nerves: 1. What is the main nerve of this compartment? 2. How would the patient be affected should this nerve be injured? 3. Which other nerves may supply the pectineus and the adductor magnus muscles? ANAT 2020 129 Blood vessels: The blood vessels in this compartment are the profunda femoris artery and vein. The profunda femoris artery has 4 main branches called arterial perforators. These are not to be confused with “venous perforators”. 1. Distinguish between the term “arterial perforator” and “venous perforator”. 2. What are the anatomical differences between the two types of perforators? 3. Which main artery gives rise to the profunda femoris artery? 4. Names the braches of the profunda femoris artery that participate in the cruciate anastomosis. THE LATERAL COMPARTMENT OF THE LEG: This is also called the fibular (peroneal) compartment.
