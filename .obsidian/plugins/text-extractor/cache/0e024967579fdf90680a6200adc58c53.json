Articular Surfaces • The head of the femur articulates with the horse-shoe shaped acetabulum of the hip bone to form the hip joint. • Head of femur • It forms more than half of a sphere. • It is covered by the articular hyaline cartilage except around the fovea capitis for ligamentum teres. • The acetabulum • It has three features; a horseshoe-shaped lunate surface, acetabular notch & acetabular fossa. • The lunate surface is the only articular area and covered by an articular cartilage. • Considering the femoral head is bigger than the acetabulum, the space is increased by the acetabular labrum. Acetabular Labrum • The acetabular labrum triangular shaped and fibrocartilaginous in structure. • It forms a rim around the margin of the acetabulum. • It plays a critical role in the joint stability as it deepens the acetabulum and holds the head of femur in position. Joint Capsule • The joint capsule is a strong and dense fibrous sac which encloses the joint. • It is thicker anterosuperiorly and thin posteroinferiorly attaches as follows; • On the hip bone: • Attaches to the outer aspect of the acetabular labrum and transverse acetabular ligament. • On the femur: • Attaches anteriorly to the intertrochanteric line and posteriorly 1 cm in front of the intertrochanteric crest. • Capsule fibres • Inner circular fibres • Forms a collar around the femoral neck (zona orbicularis). • Outer longitudinal fibres • Accompanied by blood vessels and are reflected along the neck toward the head to form the retinacula. • The blood vessels supply the head and neck of the femur Synovial Membrane • It lines the capsule and is attached to the margins of the articular surfaces. • It covers the portion of the neck of the femur that lies within the joint capsule. • It ensheathes the ligamentum teres and covers the fat pad of the acetabular fossa. • A pouch of synovial membrane frequently protrudes through a gap in the anterior wall of the capsule, between the pubofemoral and iliofemoral ligaments. • This forms the psoas bursa beneath the psoas tendon Ligaments • The iliofemoral ligament • It is a strong and inverted Y-shaped ligament. • Its base is attached to the anterior inferior iliac spine above. • Both limbs of the Y attaches to the upper and lower parts of the intertrochanteric line. • This strong ligament prevents overextension during standing. Ligaments • The pubofemoral ligament • It is triangular shaped ligament with the base attaching to the superior ramus of the pubis. • The apex attaches below to the lower part of the intertrochanteric line. • It functions to limit extension and abduction. • The ischiofemoral ligament • It is spiral shaped and attaches to the body of the ischium near the acetabular margin. • Its fibers pass upward and laterally to attach to the greater trochanter. • It functions to limit extension of the hip joint. Ligaments • The transverse acetabular ligament • The acetabular labrum forms this ligament as it bridges the acetabular notch. • It serves as a conduit for nerves and blood vessels by converting the notch into a tunnel. • The ligament of the head of the femur • It is flat and triangular with its apex attaching to the pit on the head of the femur (fovea capitis). • Its base attaches to the transverse ligament and the margins of the acetabular notch. • It lies within the joint and is covered by synovial membrane. LigamentsRelations of the Hip JointStability of the Hip Joint • To prevent its dislocation, stability is given by the following features • Depth of the acetabulum and narrowing of its mouth by the acetabular labrum. • Three strong ligaments (iliofemoral, pubofemoral, and ischiofemoral) strengthening the capsule of the joint. • Strength of the surrounding muscles, e.g., gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, etc. • Length and obliquity of the neck of femur. Bursae Around the Hip Joint • These are seven in number: • Four under glutens maximus (g. max) • Between g. max and smooth area of the ilium • Between the g. max and lower part of the outer aspect of the GT • Between g. max and ischial tuberosity (ischial bursa). • Between the tendon of g. max and vastus lateralis (gluteofemoral bursa). • Under g. med; between it and upper part of the lateral aspect of the GT • Under g. min; between it and anterior aspect of the GT. • Under psoas tendon (psoas bursa); communicates with the joint cavity in about 10% of individuals. Blood Supply to the Hip Joint • Medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries (MCFA & LCFA) • They most times branch off from the profunda femoris artery but sometimes from the femoral artery and gives off retinacular arteries. • The retinacular arteries • They form the major blood supply to the hip joint. • They branch off from the either the lateral or medial circumflex femoral arteries. • Those arising from the MCFA are more in number as they easily go through the unattached posterior border of the joint capsule. • Those from the LCFA are fewer because of the presence of the thick iliofemoral ligament • The artery to the head of the femur, • It branches off the obturator artery and traverses the ligament of the head. Blood Supply to the Hip JointNerve Supply to the Hip Joint • The femoral nerve via the nerve to rectus femoris. • The obturator nerve directly from its anterior division. • The nerve to quadratus femoris. • The superior gluteal nerve. • Articular twigs from the sciatic nerve. Movements • Flexion • Enabled by the iliopsoas, rectus femoris, and sartorius and by the adductor muscles. • The degree of flexion depends on whether the knee is flexed or relaxed. • If the knee is flexed, the hip joint can be flexed until the thigh almost reaches the anterior abdominal wall. • When the knee is extended, flexion is limited by the tension of the hamstring group of muscles. • Extension (a backward movement of the flexed thigh) • It is performed by the g. max. and the hamstring muscles. • It is limited by the tension of the iliofemoral, pubofemoral, and ischiofemoral ligaments. Movements • Adduction • Performed by the adductor longus and brevis and the adductor fibers of the adductor magnus. • These muscles are assisted by the pectineus and the gracilis. • adduction is limited by contact with the opposite limb and by the tension in the ligament of the head of the femur. • Abduction • Enabled by the g. med. and min., assisted by the sartorius, tensor fasciae latae, and piriformis. • Abduction is limited by the tension of the pubofemoral ligament Movements • Lateral rotation • Carried out by the piriformis, obturator internus and externus, superior and inferior gemelli, and quadratus femoris, assisted by the g. max. • Lateral rotation is limited by the tension in the iliofemoral and pubofemoral ligaments. • Medial rotation • Carried out performed by the anterior fibers of the g. med and glut. min and the tensor fasciae latae. • Medial rotation is limited by the ischiofemoral ligament • Circumduction • It is a combination of the previous movements. Knee Joint • The knee joint is the largest and most complicated joint in the body. • It is the major weight-bearing joint in the body. • It is susceptible to degenerative changes with increase in age leading to osteoarthritis. • It is primarily a synovial joint of the hinge variety but allows some degree of rotatory movement. • The joint between the patella and femur is a synovial joint of the plane gliding variety. Articulating Surfaces • Articular surfaces of medial and lateral condyles of the femur. • Trochlear surface of the femur. • Articular surface of the patella. • Articular surfaces of medial and lateral condyles of the tibia. Stability of the Knee Joint • Structurally, the knee joint is relatively weak because of the incongruence of its articular surfaces. • The tibial condyles are too small and shallow to hold the large convex femoral condyles. • The femoropatellar articulation is also not quite stable because of their shallow articular surfaces and due to an outward angulation between the long axes of the femur and tibia. Factors Maintaining the Stability of the Knee Joint • Strength and actions of the surrounding muscles and tendons. • Medial and lateral collateral ligaments maintain side-to-side stability. • Cruciate ligaments maintain anteroposterior stability. • Iliotibial tract helps in stabilizing a partly flexed knee. Joint Capsule • The capsule is attached to the margins of the articular surfaces and surrounds the sides and posterior aspect of the joint. • On the front of the joint, the capsule is absent, permitting the synovial membrane to pouch upward beneath the quadriceps tendon, forming the suprapatellar bursa. Joint Capsule • On each side of the patella, the capsule is strengthened by expansions from the tendons of vastus lateralis and medialis. • Behind the joint, the capsule is strengthened by an expansion of the semimembranous muscle called the oblique popliteal ligament. • An opening in the capsule behind the lateral tibial condyle permits the tendon of the popliteus to emerge. Ligaments • Extracapsular Ligaments • The ligamentum patellae • The fibular (lateral) collateral ligament • The tibial (medial) collateral ligament • The oblique popliteal ligament • Intracapsular Ligaments • The cruciate ligaments • Anterior & posterior cruciate ligaments • The Menisci Extracapsular Ligaments • The ligamentum patellae • It is attached above to the lower border of the patella and below to the tuberosity of the tibia. • It is, in fact, a continuation of the central portion of the common tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle. • The lateral collateral ligament • It is cordlike and is attached above to the lateral condyle of the femur and below to the head of the fibula. • The tendon of the popliteus muscle intervenes between the ligament and the lateral meniscus. Extracapsular Ligaments • The medial collateral ligament • It is a flat band and is attached above to the medial condyle of the femur and below to the medial surface of the shaft of the tibia. • It is firmly attached to the edge of the medial meniscus. • The oblique popliteal ligament • It is a tendinous expansion derived from the semimembranosus muscle. • It strengthens the posterior aspect of the capsule. Intracapsular Ligaments- Cruciate Ligaments • The cruciate ligaments are two strong intracapsular ligaments that cross each other within the joint cavity. • They form the main bond between the femur and the tibia throughout the joint’s range of movement. • Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) • It is attached to the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia and the posterior part of the medial surface of the lateral femoral condyle. • It prevents posterior displacement of the femur on the tibia. • In the flexed knee joint, the ACL prevents the tibia from being pulled anteriorly. Intracapsular Ligaments- Cruciate Ligaments • Posterior Cruciate Ligament • It is attached to the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia and the anterior part of the lateral surface of the medial femoral condyle. • The PCL prevents anterior displacement of the femur on the tibia. • With the knee joint flexed, the PCL prevents the tibia from being pulled posteriorly. Intracapsular Ligaments- Menisci • The menisci (lateral and medial) are C-shaped sheets of fibrocartilage. • The peripheral border is thick and attached to the capsule, and the inner border is thin and concave and forms a free edge. • The upper surfaces are in contact with the femoral condyles. • The lower surfaces are in contact with the tibial condyles. • Each meniscus is attached to the upper surface of the tibia by anterior and posterior horns. Intracapsular Ligaments- Menisci • Medial Meniscus • It is nearly semilunar in shape and wider behind than in front. • It is adherent to the deep part of tibial collateral ligament and firmly attached to the tibial plateau by coronary ligaments. • Lateral Meniscus • It is nearly circular in shape with almost a uniform width. • The posterior horn of the lateral meniscus is attached to the medial condyle of femur by the anterior and posterior meniscofemoral ligaments. Bursa Around the Knee Joint • Anterior Bursae • Subcutaneous prepatellar bursa (bursa of housemaid’s knee). • It lies deep to the skin in front of lower half of the patella and upper half of the ligamentum patellae and tibial tuberosity. • Subcutaneous infrapatellar bursa between the skin and smooth lower part of the tibial tuberosity. • Deep infrapatellar bursa, between ligamentum patellae and tibial tuberosity. • Suprapatellar bursa between the anterior surface of lower part of the femur and deep surface of the quadriceps femoris. Bursa Around the Knee Joint • Lateral Bursae • The bursa between the fibular collateral ligament and tendon of biceps femoris. • The bursa between the fibular collateral ligament and tendon of popliteus. • The bursa between the tendon of popliteus and lateral condyle of femur. • This bursa is really a synovial tube around the tendon of popliteus; hence it communicates with the joint cavity. Bursa Around the Knee Joint • Medial Bursae • The bursa, which separates the tendons of sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus from each other and from the tibial collateral ligament (bursa anserine). • The bursa between the tendon of semimembranosus and medial collateral ligament. • The bursa between the tendon of semimembranosus and medial condyle of the tibia. • Posterior Bursae • The bursa between the lateral head of gastrocnemius and capsule of the joint. • The bursa between the medial head of gastrocnemius and capsule of the joint (Brodie’s bursa). Relations of the Knee Joint • Anteriorly: Tendon of the quadriceps femoris, patella, ligamentum patellae, patellar plexus of the nerves, and prepatellar synovial bursa. • Anteromedially: Medial patellar retinaculum. • Anterolaterally: Lateral patellar retinaculum and iliotibial tract. • Posteriorly: Popliteal vessels, tibial nerve, and oblique popliteal ligament. • Posterolaterally: In the upper part, tendon of biceps femoris and common peroneal nerve; in the lower part, lateral head of gastrocnemius and plantaris. • Posteromedially: In the upper part, sartorius, gracilis, semimembranosus, and semitendinosus. Relations of the Knee JointBlood Supply • Blood supply is by the arterial anastomosis around the knee, which is formed by: • Five genicular branches of popliteal artery. • Descending genicular branch of femoral artery. • Descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery. • Two recurrent branches of the anterior tibial artery. • Circumflex fibular branch of the posterior tibial artery. Nerve Supply • The knee joint has rich nerve supply by: • Femoral nerve through its branches to vasti, especially to vastus medialis. • Tibial and common peroneal nerves through their genicular branches. • Obturator nerve through its posterior division. Movements • Flexion • The biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus muscles, assisted by the gracilis, sartorius, and popliteus muscles, produce flexion. • Flexion is limited by the contact of the back of the leg with the thigh. • Extension • Extension is produced by the quadriceps femoris and is limited by the tension of all the major ligaments of the joint. • Medial Rotation • The sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus produce medial rotation. • Lateral Rotation • The biceps femoris produces lateral rotation. Locking and Unlocking • Locking of the knee • When the foot is on the ground, the locking is defined as the medial rotation of femur on the tibia during the terminal phase of extension of the knee. • When the knee is locked it becomes rigid and all the ligaments of the joint are tight. • Unlocking of the knee • When the foot is on the ground, the unlocking is defined as the lateral rotation of the femur on the tibia during initial phase of the flexion. • The unlocking is brought about by the popliteus muscle. • When the knee is unlocked, it can be further flexed by the hamstring muscles. Proximal Tibiofibular Joint • Articulation • It is a synovial, plane, gliding joint and articulation is between the lateral condyle of the tibia and the head of the fibula. • Capsule • The capsule surrounds the joint and is attached to the margins of the articular surfaces. • Ligaments • Anterior and posterior ligaments strengthen the capsule. • The interosseous membrane, which connects the shafts of the tibia and fibula together, also greatly strengthens the joint. • Synovial Membrane • The synovial membrane lines the capsule and is attached to the margins of the articular surfaces. • Nerve Supply • The common peroneal nerve. • Movements • A small amount of gliding movement takes place during movements at the ankle joint. Distal Tibiofibular Joint • Articulation • It is a fibrous joint and articulation is between the fibular notch at the lower end of the tibia and the lower end of the fibula. • Ligaments • The interosseous ligament is a strong. • Flat bands of fibrous tissue connecting the two bones together in front and behind the interosseous ligament. • The inferior transverse ligament. • Nerve Supply • Deep peroneal and tibial nerves. • Movements • A small amount of movement. Clinical Significance of the Knee Joint • Osteoarthritis • Degenerative wear and tear of articular cartilages of the joint leading to pain during movement. • Injuries to cruciate ligaments. • The anterior cruciate ligament is more commonly damaged than the posterior ligament. • Arthroscopy of the knee joint • It is an endoscopic examination of the interior of the knee joint cavity with minimal disruption of the tissues. • Knee replacement • This is usually done after removal of damaged parts of the bone following osteoarthritis. • It involves the connection of a plastic tibial component and metal femoral component to the remaining part of the bone ends.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
