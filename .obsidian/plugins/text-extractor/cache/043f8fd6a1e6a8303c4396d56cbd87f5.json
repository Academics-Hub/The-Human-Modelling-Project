The thickness of the wall is related to the function of the vessels Identify the different blood vessels by their open lumina, size and the thickness of their walls. Also identify in all vessels, the three tunics that make up the walls of the vessels. Elastic artery Slide 28 A photomicrograph showing a large artery. Note that this blood vessel was stained for elastic only, as a result, no other detail will be seen. Note the prominent elastic laminae (EL) in the tunica media (M). M A IEL A photomicrograph showing a large artery. Note that this blood vessel was stained for elastic only, as a result, no other detail will be seen. Note the many fenestrated elastic laminae (EL) in the tunica media (M). The tunica intima (I) stains darker in this section. I M EL Neurovascular bundle Slide 26 A photomicrograph showing a muscular vein (V) and artey (A). V A Identify the medium-sized artery with a thick wall. Tunica media is the thickest layer in arteries M A I A photomicrograph showing a muscular artery. The wall of the artery is made up of tunica intima (I), media (M) and adventitia (A). Note that the tunica media is the thickest layer in this blood vessel. M A I A photomicrograph showing the three tunics in a muscular artery: Intima (I), Media (M), and Adventitia (A). M A I L L-Lumen, I-Tunica intima, M-Tunica media, A-Tunica adventitia Lumen E M IEL CT A high magnification photomicrograph showing the structure of a muscular artery. E-Erythrocytes, CT-Subendothelial connective tissue, IEL-Internal elastic lamina, M-Tunica media L CT E IEL EL SM L-Lumen, E-Endothelium, CT-Subendothelial connective tissue, IEL- Internal elastic lamina, EL-Elastic lamina, SM-Smooth muscle nucleus A photomicrograph showing a large arteriole (Art) and a small artery (Artery) Art Artery A photomicrograph showing the structure of a small artery. Note the prominent internal elastic lamina (IEL) IEL A photomicrograph showing a small artery. Note the number of layers in the tunica media. Also note the prominent internal elastic lamina and the thin tunica adventitia E I SM A photomicrograph showing an arteriole. The tunica intima consists of the internal elastic lamina (I), and the enDothelial cells (E). Tunica media consists of smooth muscle cells (SM) M A photomicrograph showing a capillary (encircled). Note that a capillary can only accommodate one (1) erythrocyte A photomicrograph showing a capillaries (encircled). E SM A photomicrograph showing capillaries (encircled) and an arteriole. Note the nuclei belonging to endothelial cells (E) and smooth muscle (SM) of the arteriole. A photomicrograph showing the structure of a muscular vein. Note that the tunics of veins are not as well-defined as tunics of arteries. Usually veins have thinner walls than their accompanying arteries. I-Tunica intima, M-Tunica media, A- Tunica adventitia Lumen I M A A photomicrograph showing the structure of a muscular vein. Note that tunica adventitia (A) is the thickest layer. Tunica media consists of smooth muscle. M A A photomicrograph showing valves (arrows) in a muscular vein A photomicrograph showing the structure of a venule. Note the endothelial lining (E), and one (1) layer of smooth muscle in the tunica media. Also note that the blood cells within the lumen have been lysed. E SM A photomicrograph showing a venule (V), and a capillary (C). V C A photomicrograph showing the structure of a venule. Note the flattened endothelial lining (E) E E P C A photomicrograph showing the structure of the interventricular septum. E-Endocardium, P-Purkinje fibres, C-Cardiac muscle fibres M E A A photomicrograph showing the structure of the interventricular septum.
