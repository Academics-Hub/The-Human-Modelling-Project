The oesophagus has a folded lumen, while the trachea is identified by the basophilically stained c-shaped ring of cartilage A photomicrograph showing the structure of hyaline cartilage. Note the fibrous perichondrium (P) on the periphery containing chondroblasts (Cb) and friboblast-like cells (F). IM-Interterritorial matrix Cb F F IM IM IM P P IM A photomicrograph showing the general features of hyaline cartilage. Note the peripheral perichondrium (P) and the chondrocytes are arranged in isogenous groups (encircled). IM-Interterritorial matrix Cb C TM A photomicrograph showing the structure of hyaline cartilage. Cb- Chondroblast, C-Nucleus of a chondrocyte, TM-Territorial matrix IM IM TM IM-Interterritorial matrix, TM-Territorial matrix, Isogenous group (encircled). Fibrocartilage Slide 79 A photomicrograph showing the structure of fibrocartilage. Note that the chondrocytes are dispersed among the collagen fibers (C). The chondrocytes may be found isolated or arranged in rows. C A photomicrograph showing the structure of fibrocartilage. The chondrocytes are housed in lacunae and arranged in rows (encircled). GS-Ground substance space, C- Collagen fibres C GS GS Elastic cartilage Slide 51 P A photomicrograph showing the structure of elastic cartilage. Cb-Chondroblast, C-Nucleus of a chondrocyte. Note the presence of elastic fibres in the matrix. P- Perichondrium Cb Elastic fibres C A photomicrograph showing the structure of elastic cartilage. C-Chondrocyte in lacuna. Cancellous bone Slide 67 This slide is a section through the nasal cavities and air sinuses. Look for an eosinophilically stained trabecula (spicule) of spongy bone in this section. Nasal cavity Mucosa Bone A photomicrograph showing a section through the nasal septum. Mucosa Bone Mucosa Bone A photomicrograph showing a section through the nasal septum. Bone BV A photomicrograph showing a section through the nasal septum. Note the many blood vessels (BV) in the connective tissue below the epithelium. Os End Os Os-Nucleus of osteocyte, End-Endosteal lining Bone marrow cavity Endosteum A photomicrograph showing the structure of a spongy/cancellous bone. Encircled note the osteocytes in lacunae. Lamella Endosteum Marrow cavity A photomicrograph showing the structure of a spongy/cancellous bone. Periosteum Endosteum Bone marrow cavity A photomicrograph showing the structure of a spongy/cancellous bone. Compact bone Slide 1 and 3 P E Bone Matrix A photomicrograph showing the general structure of compact bone. P-Periosteum, E-Endosteum A photomicrograph showing the structure of compact bone. Note the many roughly rounded osteons making up the bone matrix. IL A photomicrograph showing the general features of an osteon/Harvesian system. HC-Harvesian canal, IL-Interstitial lamella, Os-Osteocytes in lacunae Endosteum HC Canaliculi Os Osteocytes in lacunae showing canaliculi, creating an spider-like appearance (arrows) VC Note the Volkmann’s canal (VC) joining the two Harvesian systems IL HC Os A photomicrograph showing the general features of an osteon/Harvesian system. HC-Harvesian canal, IL-Interstitial lamella, Os-Osteocytes in lacunae Os Sharpey’s fibers Bone matrix A photomicrograph showing the general features of compact bone. Note the many Harvesian systems and the presence of Sharpey’s fibres attaching bone to the periosteum.
