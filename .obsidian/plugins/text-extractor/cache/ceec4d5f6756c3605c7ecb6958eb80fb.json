clinically: ▪ Pathways for fluid accumulation ▪ Infection and inflammation spread 10 ▪ Transverse mesocolon → ▪ Subdivides into two compartments: ▪ Supracolic ▪ Infracolic ▪ Connected by paracolic gutters 11 ▪ Also called omental bursa ▪ Posterior to stomach and lesser omentum ▪ Superior recess extends behind liver ▪ Inferior recess between layers of the greater omentum ▪ Permits free movement of stomach ▪ Communicates with greater sac via omental foramen (epiploic foramen) 1213 ▪ Pouches of peritoneum formed by peritoneal folds ▪ Duodenal recesses ▪ Caecal recesses: ▪ Superior ileocaecal ▪ Inferior ileocaecal ▪ Retrocaecal ▪ Intersigmoid recess ▪ Subphrenic recesses ▪ Hepatorenal recess 14 ▪ Paramesenteric gutters ▪ Right ▪ Left ▪ Paracolic gutters ▪ Right ▪ Left ▪ Right paracolic gutter → extensive connections: 1.Pelvis 2.Hepatorenal recess 3.Omental bursa 4.Right subphrenic recess 15 ▪ Right paracolic gutter: either superior or inferior depending on position of patient ▪ Accumulation on the right, between mesentry of jejenum and ileum and ascending colon (no exit) ▪ To the left of the root of the mesentery, between mesentery of jejenum and ileum and descending colon (exit inferior) ▪ Left paracolic gutter: towards inferior since phrenocolic ligament block superior drainage in supine position Phrenicocolic ligament Falciform ligament 16 ▪ Peritoneum damage → inflammation and healing → fibrous scar tissue → adhesions ▪ Abnormal attachments between viscera → chronic pain ▪ Can lead to complications: ▪ Volvulus → intestinal obstructions ▪ Treated by adhesiolysis https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zbigniew-Adamiak- 2/publication/273887668/figure/fig4/AS:614076786937858@1523418723234/Peritoneal-adhesions-between-the- intestines-and-the-mini-laparotomy-incision.png https://www.clinical-medicine.panafrican-med-journal.com/content/article/3/145/full/fig/fig1.png","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
