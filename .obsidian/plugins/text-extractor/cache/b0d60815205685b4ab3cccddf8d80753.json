The Na+-K+ pump actively transports Na+ out of and K+ into the cell keeping the concentration gradient of Na+ high in the ECF and the concentration gradient of K+ high in the ICF. 2. K+ drives the membrane potential to K+‚Äôs equilibrium potential (-90mv), whereas Na+ drives the membrane potential to Na+‚Äôs equilibrium potential (+60mv) 3. However, K+ exerts the dominant effect on the resting membrane potential because the membrane is more permeable to K+. 4. The resting membrane is slightly permeable to Na+ and the relatively small net diffusion of Na+ inward neutralizes some of the potential that would be created by K+ alone. 5.

Na+ inactivation gate open At resting potentialThreshold reached At threshold (around -50mV, voltage at which gate opens), Na+ activation gate rapidly opens and permeability of Na+ rises. Action potential begins Na+ enters cell, causing depolarization Peak of action potential At peak (+30mv, voltage when sodium inactivation gate closes and potassium gate opens) of action potential, Na+ inactivation gate closes Repolarisation The permeability of Na+ falls. At the same time, K+ activation gates open and K+ permeability rises. K+ leaves cell causing repolarisation Hyperpolarisation Na+ activation gate closes and inactivation gate opens at RMP. Further outward movement of K+ through still-open K+ channel briefly hyperpolarises membrane. After hyperpolarisation (return to resting potential) Once K+ channels close, membrane returns to resting potential Refractory period ‚Ä¢ During repolarisation, Na+ channels are closed and incapable of opening, therefore another AP cannot occur = refractory period ‚Ä¢ During hyperpolarisation it is harder to generate an AP, but not impossible = relative refractory period (because membrane is more negative) Role of Na+/K+ ATPase pump ‚Ä¢ In order for an action potential to occur the gradients of Na+ and K+ must be kept constant ‚Ä¢ BUT if nothing replaced the K+ in the cell and the Na+ outside of the cell, eventually the gradients would be destroyed ‚Ä¢ Na+/K+ ATPase pump maintains these gradients Extracellular ion concentration: effects on RMP & AP a.
