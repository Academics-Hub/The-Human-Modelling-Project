The 1st and 2nd muscles pull the second toe medially and laterally while the 3rd and 4th muscles pull the relevant toes laterally away from the 2nd toe. A similar arrangement exists in the hand in relation to the middle finger. This is the reason for the axis of the hand being through the middle finger while the axis of the foot is through the 2nd toe. Now investigate the deep tendons of sole. The tendon of tibialis posterior enters the sole from behind the medial malleolus, and attaches to the tuberosity of the navicular bone. From the tuberosity, display the tendinous slips spreading over the tarsal and metatarsal bones (Fig. 7.25). The slips are also attached to the ligaments of the sole, especially to the long plantar ligament, exposed by the removal the quadratus plantae. Follow the tendons of peroneus longus and brevis downwards and forwards. At first they are within a common synovial sheath, but further forward the sheaths are separated by the peroneal tubercle. The peroneus brevis tendon inserts into the tubercle on the base of the 5th metatarsal bone. The tendon of peroneus longus lies below the peroneal tubercle from where it curves around in a groove on the lateral surface of the cuboid bone to plunge medially into the sole to be attached to the lateral surface of the medial cuneiform bone and the adjacent base of the first metatarsal bone (Fig. 7.26). tendon of tibialis posterior -------------------- ----------- tendon of peroneus longus tuberosity of navicular -------------------- medial cuneiform ---------------------- M L FIGURE 7.26 THE DEEP TENDONS OF THE SOLE 7.6 TIlE ANTERIOR ASPECT OF TIlE THIGH Revise the bony landmarks on an articulated skeleton. On the cadaver, continue the elevation of the skin flaps from groin to ankle. Removal of the skin exposes the tela subcutanea which contains veins and nerves. The major channel is the great saphenous vein, which begins at the medial side of the dorsal venous arch on the foot, passing in front of the medial malleolus to run along the antero- medial side of the leg. It passes behind the medial condylar prominences of the tibia and femur, and then along the antero-medial side of the thigh to the saphenous opening in the deep fascia (Fig. 7.27). At this point it dips deeply to join the superficial femoral vein by passing through the saphenous hiatus (opening) (Fig. 7.28). 200 Practical Anatomy ! inguinal ligament i femoral artery posterior wall of sheath pectineus: FIGURE 7.30 TRANSVERSE SECTION OF THE FEMORAL SHEATH 7.6.3 The Anterior Compartment of the Thigh By blunt dissection, identity the muscles in the anterior compartment of the thigh: the iliopsoas group, sartorius and the large bulk of the quadriceps femoris group (Fig. 7.31). reflected .-. __ . head straight head A FIGURE 7.31 RECTUS FEMORIS (A), VASTUS LATERAUS (B), VASTUS MEDIAUS (C) AND VASTUS INTERMEDIUS (D) Sartorius is the superficial muscle of the anterior compartment. It is an elongated strap-like muscle which acts across two joints. Above, it is attached to the anterior superior iliac spine and the adjacent part of the notch below. The muscle sweeps medially to attach to the upper part of the medial surfacer of the tibia, in front of the insertions of gracilis and semitendinosus. Free the central component of the quadriceps group, rectus femoris, and elevate it to expose the underlying vastus intermedius which seems to form a common mass with vastus medialis. The vastus lateralis also has a connection with the lateral side of vastus intermedius. The Pelvic Girdle and Lower Limb 201 Rectus femoris and vastus intermedius insert into the upper and side surfaces of the patella, while vastus lateralis and vastus medialis give strong medial and lateral aponeurotic sheets which insert into the sides of the patella, the sides of the ligamentum patellae and to the tibia on either side of the ligamentum patellae. The lower fibres of vastus medialis become more horizontal in their attachment to the patella, thus preventing it from dislocating laterally when the quadriceps contracts. Vastus lateralis is covered on its outer surface by the iliotibial tract (band). While dissecting in the upper reaches of the thigh it is worthwhile studying the muscles covering the hip joint. These are iliacus and psoas major. The fibres of iliacus pass mostly vertically downwards from the iliac fossa while the fibres of psoas, arising from the vertebral column, pass downwards and laterally. The two muscles pass under the inguinal ligament and then partially join (iliopsoas), passing over the hip joint and inserting into the lesser trochanter of the femur and its surroundings. To visualise the lower attachments, dislocate pectineus medially.

Free the sartorius muscle over its entire length and, lifting it forwards, follow the femoral vessels and nerves to see that they disappear under a layer of connective tissue. The fascia forms a bridge between vastus medialis and adductor longus; it is stronger below where it spans the groove between vastus medialis and adductor magnus (Figs. 7.32 & 7.33). Open the roof of the canal by a longitudinal incision and examine its contents: 202 Practical Anatomy • the femoral artery; • the femoral vein, which has inclined laterally behind the artery; • the descending genicular artery arises near the distal end of the femoral artery; • the saphenous nerve, lateral to the femoral artery above; • the nerve to vastus medialis lies lateral to the femoral artery . .......................... sartorius (cut) FIGURE 7.32 THE ADDUCTOR CANAL A rectus femoris : .................... adductor longus .................. adductor magnus ................... adductor canal ................ vastus medialis ................... rectus femoris .................. sartorius (cut) i································ vastus medialis vastus lateralis ·············~~III~I!II;~~~ .............. sartorius L vastus intermedius .......... . .. ... , .................... fascial roof of adductor canal . ....... adductor canal ...... adductor longus ...... adductor magnus p FIGURE 7.33 TRANSVERSE SECTION OF THE ADDUCTOR CANAL M The Pelvic Girdle and Lower Limb 203 On the canal, the vessels may be overlain by the subsartorial plexus of nerves consisting of a union of the saphenous nerve, the anterior cutaneous branches of the femoral nerve, and the anterior branch of the obturator nerve. 7.6.5 The Neurovascular Components IdentifY the five branches of the femoral artery in the femoral triangle (Fig. 7.29). There are three superficial branches - supeificial circumflex iliac artery, supeificial epigastric artery and external pudendal artery. The two deep branches are a second external pudendal artery which supplies the scrotum or the labium majus, and the profunda femoris artery. The profunda (deep) femoral artery comes off the posterolateral side of the femoral artery, passes downwards in the femoral triangle lying successively upon iliacus, psoas, pectineus, adductor brevis. At the lower border of adductor brevis, it dips under adductor longus to lie on adductor magnus. While it lies between adductors longus and magnus, it gives perforating branches to both. It is separated from the femoral artery by adductor longus and by the femoral and profunda veins. In its upper part it gives three branches: • the lateral femoral circumflex artery which lies deep to rectus femoris and sartorius. This gives an ascending branch which passes deep to tensor fasciae latae to form an anastomosis with the superior gluteal artery, on the surface of gluteus minimus. A transverse branch supplies vastus lateralis and a descending branch accompanies the nerve to vastus lateralis; • the medial femoral circumflex artery arising opposite the lateral artery. It plunges deeply between the psoas tendon and pectineus to supply the muscles and the hip joint; and • the deep external pudendal artery passing medially behind the femoral vein and over adductor longus to supply the external genitalia. The femoral vein and tributaries correspond to the branches of the femoral artery. It also receives the branches of the lateral and medial circumflex femoral veins, and the great saphenous vein. The femoral nerve is the nerve of the extensor (anterior) compartment of the thigh. The nerve enters the femoral triangle by passing deep to the inguinal ligament, lateral to the femoral vessels. Mter a short course it divides into anterior and posterior subdivisions. The anterior divisions give off anterior cutaneous branches and branches to pectineus and sartorius. The posterior branch gives off muscular branches to the quadriceps femoris and a single cutaneous branch. 7.7 TIlE ANTERIOR ASPECT OF TIlE LEG Examine an articulated skeleton and a living lower limb. Many of the features can be ascertained by palpation. Below the patella the powerful ligamentum patellae is easily found, passing to the tuberosity of the tibia which is also easily found. From the tuberosity the anterior subcutaneous surface of the tibia can be followed down to the medial malleolus. On the lateral side of the subcutaneous border of the tibia, the extensor muscle mass of the anterior compartment is palpable. The large tibial condyles may be felt on either side of the patellar ligament and the head of the fibula is palpable behind and below the lateral condyle. The shaft of the fibula is covered by the peroneal muscles, except for the lower Scm which is subcutaneous and leads to the lateral malleolus. In the foot the tarsal and metatarsal bones may be palpated through the overlying extensor tendons. On the medial side of the foot, about 2cm below the medial malleolus is a palpable bony prominence, the sustentaculum tali. About 2cm anterior to this structure is the tuberosity of the navicular bone. Anterior to this is the medial cuneiform bone, followed by the metatarsal of the great toe and its phalanges. 204 Practical Anatomy On the lateral side of the foot, the most prominent bony points are the lateral malleolus and the tubercle of the 5th metatarsal bone. 7.7.1 Superficial Structures As in the thigh, the superficial structures should be studied first. Begin by locating the venous arch on the upper surface of the foot. Follow its ends to the medial and lateral malleoli. On the medial side it continues anterior to the malleolus as the great saphenous vein. On the lateral side it continues posterior to the malleolus as the small saphenous vein. Carefully elevate these two veins, noting that the great saphenous vein is joined by one or two tributaries emerging through apertures in the deep fascia, and that the posterior arch tributary receives a series (2-5) of communicating veins, similarly passing through apertures in the deep fascia. The saphenous nerve follows the great saphenous vein throughout its course in the leg, supplying the medial aspect of the leg, and the medial aspect of the heel and foot. On the lateral aspect of the leg locate the lateral cutaneous nerve of the leg, a branch of the common peroneal nerve. Further down locate the musculo-cutaneous nerve, emerging in front of the fibula and supplying the dorsum of the foot and medial four toes. The sural nerve, a branch of the tibial nerve, runs with the small saphenous vein and receives the sural communicating nerve from the common peroneal nerve. It supplies the back and outer side of the leg, and the back and outer side of the heel and foot and little toe. 7.7.2 The Anterior Compartment of the Leg Removal of the fat exposes the deep fascia of the leg. On the anterior aspect of the leg the fascia covers the extensor muscles and is reinforced by fibres from the tendon of biceps femoris. The fascia gives origin to the underlying anterior group of muscles, and laterally it covers the peroneal muscles. Below, it is attached to the fibula and forms a strong sheath over the peroneal tendons as they pass behind the lateral malleolus. Locate the superior and inferior extensor retinacular fibres at the ankle (Fig. 7.34). The superior extensor retinaculum extends over the tendons and sheaths between the anterior borders of the tibia and fibula, a short distance above the ankle. Inferior extensor retinaculum has a single lateral attachment to the upper anterior surface of the calcaneus and a double attachment medially, to the medial malleolus and to the deep fascia of the medial margin of the foot. The upper extension covers all the tendons, while the lower extension lies behind the tendon of tibialis anterior. FIGURE 7.34 RETINACULA OF THE ANKLE (ANTEROLATERAL ASPECT) Divide the fascia above, between and below these fibres to leave them intact. Divide the fascia longitudinally along the anterior border of the tibia and remove it laterally and medially by releasing its attachments to the underlying muscles. Continue the removal over the foot, to the base of the toes. This exposes the muscles in the anterior compartment of the leg (Fig. 7.35): The Pelvic Girdle and Lower Limb 207 branch of the peroneal (fibular) artery, lying between the tibia and the fibula. Occasionally, the artery is so large that a pulse may be felt between the lower ends of tibia and fibula in the living patient. It forms an extensive anastomosis in front of the ankle with the lateral malleolar branch of the anterior tibial and with branches of the dorsalis pedis artery. 7.8 TIlE UPPER SURFACE OF TIlE FOOT The tendons passing under the inferior extensor retinaculum have varying synovial sheaths which do not extend under the superior retinaculum, except that of tibialis anterior which may pass under the superior retinaculum. Clean the tendons down to their attachment to bone. The tendon of extensor hallucis longus attaches to the base of the distal phalanx and often into the base of the proximal phalanx. The tendon of extensor hallucis brevis inserts into the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe. The tendons of extensor digitorum longus pass to the remaining toes to be inserted into the bases of the distal two phalanges. Raise the long extensor tendons to expose the underlying extensor digitorum brevis muscle. Remove the fascia and epimysium over extensor brevis and follow it upwards to its attachment to the upper lateral region of calcaneus. The tendons pass to the four lateral toes, the one to the big toe sometimes being called extensor hallucis brevis (Fig. 7.37) . ................ extensor digitorum brevis .......... extensor hallucis brevis FIGURE 7.37 EXTENSOR DIGITORUM BREVIS AND EXTENSOR HALLUCIS BREVIS Clean and follow the musculo-cutaneous nerve and the dorsalis pedis artery downwards from the inter-malleolar line. The lateral branch of the nerve passes deep to the extensor digitorum brevis which it supplies. From there it supplies the tarsal joints and the lateral metatarsal-phalangeal joints. The medial branch of the nerve accompanies the dorsalis pedis artery and runs to the cleft between the great and second toes, en route giving a branch to the first dorsal interosseous muscle and the joints of the big toe. The dorsalis pedis artery emerges from under the superior retinaculum lateral to the tendons of extensor hallucis longus and passes down the upper surface of the foot in the direction of the cleft between the great and 2nd toe (Fig. 7.36). Between the bases of the first and second metatarsals it gives a branch which penetrates into the sole (perforating artery) to join the lateral plantar artery forming the plantar arterial arch. Branches of the dorsalis pedis are variable but are usually the medial and lateral tarsal arteries (the lateral being the largest) and the arcuate arteries passing deep to extensor digitorum brevis and giving digital branches to the toes. 210 Practical Anatomy Divide the synovial membrane and its contained ligament and pull the femoral head away from the acetabulum. Study the interior of the acetabulum, noting the remnants of the cartilaginous labrum around its edge. At the lower border, the acetabular notch is spanned by the transverse acetabular ligament. The interior of the acetabulum has a semilunar smooth area and a centro-inferior rough area. The semilunar area is covered with articular (hyaline) cartilage and the rough area is bounded by the transverse acetabular ligament enclosed by synovial membrane attached to its edge. It may be possible to see some small vessels piercing the transverse ligament and these will pass along the ligament of the head to reach the femoral head. These vessels are branches of the obturator and medial circumflex femoral arteries. A branch of the anterior division of the obturator nerve accompanies these vessels and thus, supplies the interior of the joint. 7.9.2 The Knee Joint The knee is a synovial joint of the hinge type, which also permits some rotation in the flexed position. There are three bones related to the knee joint: the distal end of the femur, the proximal end of the tibia, and the patella (knee cap). On a living model, feel the mobility of the patella. Beneath it, feel for the patellar ligament and its attachment to the front of the tibia. Study the knee on an articulated skeleton. Note the enlarged distal end of the femur. The two large condyles are separated in front by the articular surface of the patella, and behind by the intercondylar notch. The superior surface of the enlarged proximal end of the tibia is flat with a central intercondylar eminence which fits into the intercondylar notch of the femur. Anteriorly, there is a prominent tibial tuberosity for attachment of the patellar ligament. Isolate and follow the lower attachments of sartorius, gracilis, semitendinosus and semi- membranosus. Sever each about 10cm from their attachments and turn them downwards. Divide rectus femoris and vastus intermedius about 10cm above the patella and elevate the lower half to expose the suprapatellar pouch and its muscle, articularis genus (Fig. 7.40). FIGURE 7.40 LONGITUDINAL SECTION THROUGH THE KNEE JOINT 214 Practical Anatomy ,k;o ............. / /N'j'n' tendon of quadriceps femoris ----------- --------------- suprapatellar bursa FIGURE 7.44 BURSAE RELATED TO THE FRONT OF THE KNEE JOINT On the medial side the bursae are all subtendinous: • the sub tendinous bursa of sartorius lies deep to sartorius as it crosses the upper aspect of the medial tibial condyle; • the anserine bursa separates the tendons of sartorius, gracilis and semitendinosus from the proximal part of the medial surface of the tibia and the tibial collateral ligament (Fig. 7.45); • the sub tendinous medial gastrocnemius bursa separates the medial head of gastrocnemius from the condylar capsule. • the semimembranosus bursa lies between the tendon of semimembranosus and the tibial collateral ligament. The 3 lateral bursae are also subtendinous: • the inferior bicipital bursa lies between the biceps tendon and the fibular collateral ligament; • the sub tendinous lateral gastrocnemius bursa lies between the lateral head of gastrocnemius and the condylar capsule; • the subpopliteal recess (or popliteal bursa) partly ensheaths the tendon of popliteus from below as it crosses the upper edge of the lateral tibial condyle. It is an extension of the synovial cavity of the knee joint. The knee movements are mostly flexion and extension. At full extension the medially sloping medial articular surface of the femur continues to engage in the upper surface of the tibia resulting in medial rotation of the femur in the tibia. After this rotation has occurred, the joint is said to be 'locked'. Recall the attachments of the popliteus muscle to the lateral femoral condyle, the lateral meniscus, and the back of the tibia. In 'locking', this muscle is placed on the stretch - before flexion can take place, the joint must be unlocked by popliteus pulling the lateral condyle and the lateral meniscus backwards to bring the parallel femoral articular surfaces into alignment on the tibia. In full flexion, the patella has minimal articulation with the femur; it does not articulate with the tibia in any position.

The joint is mainly a hinge joint. Note that the talus is wider anteriorly than posteriorly so that in dorsal (upper) flexion the wider part is 216 Practical Anatomy gripped by the malleoli, producing stability of the ankle. In plantar flexion the narrower part is between the malleoli allowing a small amount of side-to-side movement. On the cadaver, remove the flexor, extensor and peroneal muscles surrounding the joint, as well as the retinacula, fat and fragments of tissue in the region. There are strong medial and lateral ligaments and weak anterior and posterior ligaments attaching the bones to one another. Test the movements of the ankle on the cadaver. As the movements are produced, the soft anterior and posterior capsular ligaments will be seen to move. On the medial side of the joint, find the medial (deltoid) ligament, a triangular sheet of fibres attached above to the medial malleolus from where they diverge anteriorly to the tuberosity of the navicular bone and posteriorly to the sustentaculum tali and the adjacent inferior calcaneo-navicular ligament. The medial ligament has four named parts: tibionavicular, tibiocalcaneal, posterior tibiotalar and anterior tibiotalar (Fig. 7.46). On the lateral side of the joint, identify three ligaments (Fig. 7.47): • the anterior talofibular ligament connecting the malleolus to the side of the talus; • the calcaneofibular ligament between the tip of the lateral malleolus and lateral surface of calcaneus; and the posterior talofibular ligament running horizontally from the malleolar fossa to the talus. FIGURE 7.46 THE MEDIAL UGAMENT OF THE ANKLE JOINT posterior talofibular ligament ........ ---- .. . .-r-------------------------- anterior talofibular ligament ............. calcaneofibular ligament FIGURE 7.47 LATERAL UGAMENTS OF THE ANKLE JOINT The Pelvic Girdle and Lower Limb 217 Collectively these three ligaments are referred to as the lateral ligaments of the ankle. The blood supply to the ankle joint is from the circum-malleolar arterial network (the anterior tibial, peroneal and posterior tibial arteries). The nerve supply is from the deep fibular and tibial nerves. Because of the shape of the mortise and the shape of the talus, movements at the ankle are restricted to dorsal flexion (movement of the foot upwards) and plantar flexion (movement of the foot downwards). 7.9.5 .Joints of the Foot Revise the bones of an articulated foot, noting the articulating surfaces of the various tarsal bones. The calcaneus is the largest and most posterior bone. It is surmounted by the talus, and between the two is the subtaloid joint. The talus and calcaneus are linked together by the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament. Viewed from below, it is obvious that the foot has longitudinal and transverse arches (Fig. 7.19). The integrity (shape) of the arches is maintained by the shape of the bones, the presence of ligaments, and the presence of muscles. Remove all the plantar muscles on the foot and clear away all muscle attachments to underlying ligaments. The most obvious ligament is the long plantar ligament extending from the calcaneus, anterior to the tubercles, and attaching to the bases of the 2nd to 5th metatarsal (Fig. 7.26). Clear the sides of the ligament and divide it transversally at about its middle. Reflect the cut edges, and find deep to it the plantar calcaneocuboid ligament (or short plantar ligament). This ligament extends from the calcaneus to the cuboid laterally with a medial extension to the navicular (Fig. 7.48). talus ................... --- ----------------- calcaneus ----------------------- cuboid FIGURE 7.48 THE PlANTAR CALCANEONAVICUlAR AND PlANTAR CALCANEOCUBOID UGAMENTS Locate the groove on the undersurface of the sustentaculum tali and the tuberosity of the navicular. Situated between these two points is the calcaneonavicular ('spring') ligament. The ligaments just described are the so-called main ligaments of the sole. The remainder of the ligaments are referred to as ancillary ligaments. The transverse ligaments form the capsule of the synovial joints between the tarsal bones and between the tarsals and metatarsals. There are also interosseous ligaments between the tarsal and 218 Practical Anatomy metatarsal bones. The fragile dorsal ligaments form the capsules of the tarsal and metatarsal joints. The neurovascular supply to the tarsal joints is from the medial and lateral plantar arteries and nerves. The movement in which the sole tends to face m edially is called inversion, and where it faces slightly outwards is called eversion. The inversion is the greater of the two movements because it is augmented by the gliding of the navicular upon the fixed talus. Eversion is limited by the restricted gliding of the cuboid on the lateral cuneiform. Observe the obliquity of the subtalar articulating surfaces. The calcaneus may rotate medially and laterally under the fixed talus. Inversion and eversion are complete movements and include adduction and abduction respectively in their movements. The addition of the terms supination and pronation to foot movement terminology has further confused terminology relating to the subject. The muscles causing inversion are tibialis anterior and tibialis posterior; those causing eversion are peroneus longus and brevis. 7.9.6 Joints of the Toes These joints are substantially similar to the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the fingers. Due to the shortness of the transverse tarsal ligament in the foot, the metatarsal heads are held together more closely than those of the hand. This makes the toes more difficult to dissect. Chapter Eight The Head and Neuk 8.1 SURFACE ANATOMY The neck is regarded as one of the more difficult reglOns to dissect, largely because of the multiplicity and concentration of its contents. Begin by examining an articulated skeleton and then a living subject. The neck is the narrowed region between the mandible and mastoid process above, and the shoulder girdle below. On both identifY the: • tip of the chin • suprasternal notch • clavicle • mastoid process and occipital bone Ask the living model to grimace and note the corrugated strands of muscle between the lower border of the mandible and the clavicles. These are the platysma muscles and, because these muscles are attached to the skin, this action will be reflected in the skin. Now place a hand on the side of the face and ask the model to turn the head forcibly against the hand. Note the two muscular bars that reach up to behind the ear ~ the front one is the sternocleidomastoid muscle while the back one is called the trapezius (trapezion, G = four-sided). A triangle is formed by the clavicle, the trapezius and the sternocleidomastoid, with its apex at the mastoid process behind the ear. This anatomical region is called the posterior triangle of the neck. Clearly, if there is a posterior triangle, there must be an anterior triangle and this is found anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Simple observation indicates that the right and left anterior triangles meet in the midline of the neck and it is convenient, therefore, to make the midline the boundary of both the right and left anterior triangles. To visualise these two triangles more clearly, stand at the left shoulder of the model. Define a large back-to-front Z by starting at the tip of the chin and running a finger back along the lower border of the mandible to the mastoid eminence behind the ear. From here, run the finger obliquely 222 Practical Anatomy the lower ends of the two anterior jugular veins the venous arch connecting them a few lymph nodes the sternal ends of the left and right sternocleidomastoid muscles. deep lamina : superficial lamina i : mandible ligamentum nuchae ill) ~ ... ~ £1)-·· .. ·.-_-.... ___ --. hyoid bone ~ f)-Ir------- ---- investing layer ~! ~:r----------::::::----thyroid angle (1 ~ __ ---- cricoid arch ~ -- -- _ -------------- tracheal cartilages ~ ~--. \\ ui..\\--------- suprasternal space , \",,-:: \\ '\\) \\ --'--- manubrium sterni A : nuchal ligament B FIGURE 8.3 (A) MIDSAGITTAL SECTION OF NECK SHOWING INVESTING LAYER OF DEEP FASCIA (B) TRANSVERSE SECTION OF NECK SHOWING DEEP EXTENSIONS OF FASCIA Follow the investing layer upwards. It is attached to the hyoid bone and, above that to the lower border of the mandible. This lamina is the more superficial of two laminae into which the investing fascia has again split, this time to enclose the submandibular salivary gland (Fig. 8.4). In later dissections it is seen to enclose the parotid gland. The superficial layer becomes attached to the lower edge of the zygomatic arch, the external acoustic meatus and the masseteric fascia. Posteriorly, the investing layer attaches to the superior nuchal line and mastoid process on each side and, in the posterior midline, to ligamentum nuchae (nucha, Fr = nape). zygomatic arch -----........ t FIGURE 8.4 CORONAL SECTION OF THE PAROTIDO-MANDIBULAR REGION AND THE FLOOR OF THE MOUTH (ORAL DIAPHRAGM) suprahyoid area submandibular triangle po't'dO~~~,?: ............. \\ ....... . carotid triangle ------------------------------- infrahyoid area -------------------------------- ---- The Head and Neck 225 midline i::, anterior belly of digastric I lower border of mandible anterior border of sternocleidomastoid FIGURE 8.7 SUBDIVISIONS OF THE ANTERIOR TRIANGLE (ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MIDUNE) 8.3.1 Anterior Triangle The posterior boundary of the anterior triangle is the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. The other sides are the anterior midline of the neck and the lower border of the mandible. The investing fascia has already been removed. Note the anterior jugular vein (jugulum, L = hollow of neck) being on the medial aspect of the sternocleidomastoid (Fig. 8.8). It begins beneath the chin and traces a variable path down to a point, a thumbwidth above the sternum where it pierces the deep fascia. As we have discovered earlier, the investing fascia is a continuous sheet across the midline which is attached above to the lower border of the mandible. Here it splits to enclose the submandibular salivary gland and the digastric tendon, and extends up behind the mandible eventually to enclose the parotid gland. occipital ----- posterior external jugular posterior auricular ------------ external jugular -------- FIGURE 8.8 VEINS OF THE FACE AND SCALP transverse facial maxillary retromandibular --------- supraorbital \\1Ih··----·-----supratrochlear H-',.--------angular facial anterior jugular 226 Practical Anatomy Before dealing with the four smaller triangles within the anterior triangle, define the superior belly of omohyoid and mobilise it to show its continuity with the inferior belly deep to sternocleidomastoid.

Identity the digastric fossa on an isolated mandible. Between its anterior and posterior bellies, the digastric muscle has an intermediate tendon which is tethered to the hyoid bone by a fibrous loop. Just behind the loop, find the attachment of the stylohyoid muscle to the hyoid bone. Note that the stylohyoid splits to embrace the intermediate tendon of the digastric just prior to that attachment. You have now encountered two of the six muscles with intermediate tendons (see box). Muscles with an intermediate tendon Digastric Omohyoid Superior oblique (eye) Occipito-frontalis - (galea aponeurotica) R ectus abdominis - (tendinous inscriptions) Buccinator and superior constrictor - (pterygomandibular raphe) Semispinalis capitis The smaller triangular subdivisions of the anterior triangle of the neck will now be easily recognisable. 8.3.2 Submental Tri~ngle Define the anterior bellies of the digastric muscles which form the sides of the triangle. Note that there is a sheet of muscle between and above them which meets in front and forms the floor of the triangle. These are the fibres of the left and right mylohyoid muscles which meet in a central raphe. T he base of the triangle is the hyoid bone and the contents are the clinically important submental lymph nodes. The submental triangle contains a number of important lymph nodes. The two sides are usually regarded as one triangle from a clinical point of view. Importantly, the lymph drainage from the lower lip is ipsi- and contralateral. This means that cancer on one side of the lower lip will spread to lymph nodes in the opposite triangle as well as to those on the same side. 8.3.3 Muscular T.-iangle When the deep fascia has been cleared away, the muscular triangle w ill be immediately obvious, being between the superior belly of omohyoid and midline of neck (Figs. 8.6 and 8.7). Begin by cleaning the thin infrahyoid muscles which form the floor of the triangle. Be careful to preserve their nerve supply which enters each muscle from beneath and laterally. Next to omohyoid lies the sternohyoid. Cut it near its upper attachment to reveal the thyrohyoid and sternothyroid muscles beneath it. These are all supplied by branches of the ansa cervicalis (ansa, L = loop), (C 1, 2,3, see box on Infrahyoid Strap Muscles p 228). Deep to the thyrohyoid muscle note the thyrohyoid membrane which is pierced laterally by the internal laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal artery (a branch of the superior thyroid artery). If you now cut through the sternothyroid you will see beneath it, the cricothyroid muscle, attached to The Head and Neck 227 the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. Below it are visible the two fleshy lobes of the thyroid gland with the superior thyroid vessels passing down the curved upper surfaces of each lobe of the gland. 8.3.4 Submandibular Triangle Remove any remnants of deep fascia covering the triangle and redefine its boundaries: lower border of mandible above, two bellies of digastric muscle below. To review this triangle, look at Figs. 8.6 and 8.9, and imagine what the triangle would look like without the submandibular gland. Now hold the gland by its anterior border and pull it gently backwards, dissecting it free of its surroundings. Clear the anterior belly of the digastric muscle and then the underlying mylohyoid muscle. Do not damage the posterior edge of mylohyoid where it terminates beneath the submandibular gland, because this is a critical landmark area. Enucleate the superficial part of the gland to expose the intermediate tendon of the digastric and follow this tendon backwards into the posterior belly of the digastric. After mobilising the submandibular gland and its associated lymph nodes, note the facial vein which passes backwards and across the pole of the gland to join the retromandibular vein. Once defined and studied, remove the veins. To find the submental artery (a branch of the facial artery) pull the gland downwards and look behind the angle of the mandible. Trace it forwards, as it supplies the surrounding muscles and anastomoses with neighbouring arteries. It is joined from behind by the mylohyoid nerve (motor branch of trigeminal), which should be traced forwards to its termination in the mylohyoid muscle and also the anterior belly of digastric. Now that the superficial part of the gland has been enucleated, note that it has a deep part passing over the posterior free edge of mylohyoid, so that the duct may open into the mouth. Thus, the posterior free edge of mylohyoid divides the submandibular gland into deep and superficial parts. Redefine the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle, passing from the body of the hyoid bone to the posterior end of the mylohyoid line. Emerging deep to this free border, find the large hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) which lies on a thin vertically oriented muscle, the hyoglossus (Fig. 8.9). Note that hyoglossus separates the lingual artery and nerve, the nerve being superficial and the artery being deep to the muscle. Now define the posterior edge of the hyoglossus muscle. If the muscle is retracted forwards and at the same time the posterior belly of digastric and its associated stylohyoid is pulled downwards, the fibres of the middle constrictor of the pharynx, covered by the fragile buccopharyngeal fascia will be seen. The fibres of the middle constrictor radiate backwards, forming part of the floor of the carotid triangle, but its upper fibres extend into the submandibular triangle . posterior belly of digastric ............... . hypoglossal nerve ...................... . facial vein ................... . external carotid artery ........................... . middle constrictor -----.-.------------.-... --------- lingual artery hypoglossus: FIGURE 8.9 RIGHT SUBMANDIBULAR TRIANGLE ...................................... masseter . ................. facial vein . ..... --- facial artery .------ anterior belly of digastric mylohyoid fibrous loop for digastric tendon The Head and Neck 229 8.3.5 Carotid Triangle This is the fourth triangular subdivision of the anterior triangle of the neck. Locate the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) (Fig. 8.11). It appears high up in the triangle, between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein, from under cover of the posterior belly of digastric. Follow it forwards as it arches above the level of the greater horn of the hyoid and note how it crosses successively: the internal carotid, external carotid, and lingual arteries, and the hyoglossus muscle. Notice how the hypoglossal nerve passes beneath the origin of the occipital artery, and is pinned down by the sternocleidomastoid branch of the occipital artery (Fig. 8.12). The internal jugular vein is a massive channel lying in the anterior triangle and may require removal to allow proper display of deep structures. Before removing it identifY the common facial vein entering it near the angle of the mandible, the middle thyroid vein opposite the thyroid gland and the inferior root of the ansa cervi calis lying on its surface. The facial and middle thyroid veins should be divided but the root of the ansa should be dissected away. This may be difficult to find as it is thin and fragile and, in fact, may have been removed with the fascia overlying the vein.

If it is dissected upwards, the posterior aspect of the carotid sheath covering the common carotid artery on the medial side and the vagus nerve (CN X) posteriorly is exposed. Separate the vagus nerve along its entire length. Locate its superior laryngeal branch near the greater horn of the hyoid bone. If the vagus nerve is traced down into the upper thorax it is evident that it passes between the subclavian artery and vein. Follow the nerve downwards and dissect out the origin of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Note that on the right side it curves up beneath the subclavian artery while on the left, it dips beneath the aortic arch (Fig. 8.14). 230 Practical Anatomy internal carotid artery occipital artery hypoglossal nerve ------------~ sternocleidomastoid branch of ---------- ----- - occipital artery superior root of ansa cervical is ------------ ---- ----- i external carotid artery ------ ---- lingual artery FIGURE 8.12 RELATION OF HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE AND CAROTID ARTERIES Next, locate the common carotid artery (karos , G = deep sleep). Expose the large artery from below upwards until the bulge of the carotid sinus is found. This is near to the bifurcation of the common carotid (about two finger breadths beneath the angle of the mandible). Using Fig. 8.13 as a guide, define the branches of the external carotid artery in the following order: • Superior thyroid artery which arises just after the bifurcation below the tip of the greater horn of the hyoid bone. It descends towards the upper pole of the thyroid gland upon which it slides down to anastemose with its fellow of the opposite side. superficial temporal------------------------ --- ---------- .---.-------------------- maxillary posterior auricular -------------- occipital ------------- -----------.-.---.------.------ ascending pharyngeal ··- --·---------facial external carotid ------.-------------------- ·-·-·-----------------lingual internal carotid ---------- common carotid -------.--.----- ------.-.-------------------- superior thyroid FIGURE 8.13 BRANCHES OF THE RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY The Head and Neck 231 • Lingual artery arises just opposite the tip of the greater hom of the hyoid and loops upwards on the middle constrictor, before passing deep to the posterior edge of the hyoglossus muscle (Fig. 8. 9). • Facial artery is given off slightly higher than the lingual and ascends deep to the posterior belly of the digastric and stylohyoid muscle to enter the submandibular triangle. Here it forms a loop, grooving the deep surface of the submandibular salivary gland as it ascends, and the lateral surface as it descends again. These three branches arise from the anterior aspect of the external carotid. The following three arise from the posterior aspect. Occipital artery comes off high up, under cover of the posterior belly of the digastric. As it passes backwards a sternocleidomastoid branch crosses the hypoglossal nerve (Fig. 8.9). • Posterior auricular artery arises posteriorly above the origin of the occipital artery. It runs parallel to the occipital artery and supplies the ear and occipital region. • Ascending pharyngeal artery arises from the medial aspect of the external carotid whence it ascends on the pharyngeal wall to the base of the skull. • Maxillary and superficial temporal arteries are the terminal branches. If the carotid artery is retracted it will be possible to return to two nerves which were dealt with earlier - the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves (Fig. 8.14), originating from the vagus nerve. Note that the vagus nerve gives off the superior laryngeal branch high up, above the level of the hyoid. IdentifY and trace this nerve down and note how it divides, behind the carotids, into an upper branch, the internal branch and a lower branch, the external branch. The internal laryngeal nerve pierces the thyrohyoid membrane together with a small artery called the superior laryngeal artery (a branch of the superior thyroid). This is a sensory nerve and supplies sensation to the mucous membrane of the interior of the larynx above the vocal folds. It probably carries parasympathetic fibres (from the vagus) which drive the glands in the laryngeal wall. The external branch descends to the cricothyroid muscle which it supplies. The next move is to find the recurrent laryngeal nerve. This may present difficulties, but there are two ways to locate it. On the right side of the neck, follow the vagus downwards until it crosses the subclavian artery. Here the vagus gives off the recurrent nerve which turns backwards around the artery and then 'recurs' up the neck between the trachea and oesophagus. On the left side, if the thorax has already been dissected, the vagus gives off the left recurrent nerve as it crosses the lower edge of the aortic arch. It is easy to lose the recurrent nerve in these procedures and a better way to locate it is by the surgeon's method. Retract the common carotid artery laterally and locate the inferior thyroid artery crossing at right angles behind the carotid, at the lower border of the thyroid gland. ~he recurrent nerve is related to the artery and lies in the tracheo-oesophageal groove. Both nerves pass upwards to reach the lower border of the thyroid cartilage where they enter the larynx behind the cricothyroid joint. The recurrent laryngeal is a mixed nerve - it is sensory to the interior of the larynx below the vocal cords and is motor to all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. It probably also carries parasympathetic fibres. Now find and trace the recurrent laryngeal nerve up to where it is crossed by the inferior thyroid artery. The recurrent nerve is accompanied into the larynx by the inferior laryngeal artery, a branch of the inferior thyroid artery. Since the recurrent and superior laryngeal nerves supply voluntary muscle, these cannot be of vagal origin because the latter supplies smooth muscle. The recurrent and superior laryngeal nerves may in fact be traced to the cranial part of the accessory nerve (See Fig. 8.14). Review the three layers of fascia in the neck by studying Figs. 8.16 and 8.17. Running in front of the vertebral column is the anterior longitudinal ligament to which the prevertebral fascia is attached. This is important in tuberculosis of the spine which may result in a central abscess protrusion. In quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) the infection is laterally placed. 232 Practical Anatomy Confirm that the internal jugular vein, the carotid artery and the vagus nerve were all enclosed within the carotid sheath. Remember that a loop of nervous tissue was embedded in its anterior wall - the ansa cervicalis. Behind its posterior wall is another nerve element - the sympathetic trunk, which must now be defined. Lateral to the sheath, note a chain of lymph nodes behind which emerge the nerves of the cervical plexus - the upper and lower deep cervical lymph nodes. In the previous section the most complex part of the neck - the carotid triangle - was dissected. Before dissecting the sympathetic chain, revise on the cadaver, the carotid triangle. It is bounded by sternocleidomastoid, superior belly of omohyoid and posterior belly of digastric. The floor is formed in front by the thyrohyoid muscle, the hyoid bone and the hyoglossus muscle. Behind, the floor is formed by the middle and inferior constrictors of the pharynx and the thyrohyoid membrane in the gap between them. jugular foramen ---.-- recurrent laryngeal n .....

Posterior to the carotid sheath lies the cervical sympathetic chain. Pull the common carotid artery and vagus nerve forwards. With longitudinal sweeps of the forceps scrape away the areolar tissue to expose the sympathetic chain. The chain possesses three ganglia - superior, middle and inferior. Not infrequently the inferior ganglion is fused with that of the first thoracic segment to form the stellate ganglion. The superior laryngeal nerve, from the vagus, and its two branches, the internal and external laryngeal nerves have been defined. High up in the triangle note the hypoglossal nerve. 8.4 TDYROm GLAND Before proceeding review the structures shown in Fig. 8.15. Note that this figure was drawn without the thyroid gland. Imagine the thyroid in place - a large ductless endocrine gland which 234 Practical Anatomy clasps like a shield the front and sides of the four visceral tubes of the neck - the pharynx, larynx, oesophagus and trachea - at the level of the bodies of vertebrae C 5, 6 and 7. The thyroid gland (thyreos, G = shield) has a very thin true capsule, which is continuous with its stroma, and an outer false capsule of pre tracheal fascia (Fig. 8.16) which binds it firmly to the larynx above and to the trachea below. This is the reason for the gland moving up and down with the larynx during swallowing. ---------- -------------- ---- inferior constrictor ------:,- -- --- superior thyroid vessels ------------- - external laryngeal nerve cricothyroid ------------------- ------- inferior thyroid artery -------------------------- pyrarnidal lobe ---------- ----------------- recurrent laryngeal nerve FIGURE 8.18 DEEP REIATIONS OF THE THYROID GIAND - LEFT LOBE REMOVED The gland has two lobes joined near their lower poles by an isthmus which lies in front of the second, third and fourth tracheal rings. Each wing-shaped lobe covers the upper six tracheal cartilages as well as the cricoid and the lower one-third of the thyroid lamina behind the oblique line (Fig. 8.18). Find the superior thyroid artery and notice how it passes down the upper inner border of the gland, accompanied by the superior thyroid vein. Pull the lobe of the thyroid gland medially and identify the common carotid laterally and again identify the inferior thyroid artery which comes up from its origin at the thyrocervical trunk to reach the back of the thyroid by passing behind the carotid sheath. Also look for the recurrent laryngeal nerve which lies snugly between trachea and oesophagus. Finally, look for the small yellowish parathyroid glands, one at the level of the cricoid cartilage and one near the lower pole. They are generally embedded in the fascial sheath, but may lie within the thyroid gland itself which makes them difficult to find. The thyroid and structures deep to it will be dissected later. 8.5 STERNOCLEIDOMASTOID MUSCLE AND RELATED STRUCTURES So far in this chapter the anterior aspect of the neck has been dissected. It has been an intensive process designed to give an understanding of one of the most complex parts of the body, the clinical importance of which cannot be overemphasised. Two final sections of the front of the neck remain. They are the structures deep to sternocleidomastoid muscles and the posterior triangle. The Head and Neck 235 The sternocleidomastoid is a broad, straplike muscle which has a superior attachment to the lateral surface of the mastoid process and the lateral half of the superior nuchal line of the skull. Inferiorly it has two attachments: (a) the sternal head which is a rounded tendon attached to the front of the manubrium sterni lateral to the jugular (suprasternal) notch, and (b) the clavicular head which is attached to the upper surface of the medial third of the clavicle (Fig. 8.19). The muscle is innervated by the spinal accessory nerve and fibres from nerves C 2 and 3. Note that this nerve supply is similar to that of another neck muscle, the trapezius which develops from the same primordial mass of mesodern. Cut the sternal and clavicular attachments and reflect the sternocleidomastoid up to its cranial attachment, preserving the spinal accessory nerve which enters its upper part. The vagus nerve (eN X) in the carotid triangle has been found previously. Expose it again and trace the nerve down and around the subclavian artery on the right side of the body. Here, look for the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Once found, pull on it to help to trace it as it ascends between the trachea and the oesophagus. On the left side, trace the vagus nerve down to where it enters the inlet of the thorax between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery. Note that the lift recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks around the aortic arch . This is simply because embryologically, the aortic arch and the first part of the right subclavian artery are homologous, both being derived from the fourth branchial arch arteries. superior nuchalline···············,~\"'\\\\(I;O::; clavicular head ........................... . ....................... sternal head FIGURE 8.19 STERNOCLEIDOMASTOID MUSCLE Trace the recurrent laryngeal nerve up to about the level of the lower pole of the thyroid gland, where it will be associated with the inferior thyroid artery which comes in horizontally. Now trace the inferior thyroid artery out laterally, and look for the sympathetic chain which passes down posteriorly but sometimes anterior to it. Follow the artery further laterally to expose its origin from the thyrocervical trunk, which comes off the subclavian artery. Once at the thyrocervical trunk, find and trace the transverse cervical artery laterally. Note how it pins the phrenic nerve on to the anterior surface of the scalenus anterior muscle (Fig. 8. 20). Note that the phrenic nerve is the only nerve in the neck which runs from lateral to medial. Clear the scalenus anterior muscle and find the subclavian artery which emerges from behind its lateral border. In the arterial triangle formed by the carotid, subclavian and inferior thyroid arteries, remove veins and look for the vertebral artery coming directly from the subclavian artery. Trace this artery up and into the vertebral foramen of the transverse process of C 6 vertebra. 236 Practical Anatomy longus capitis ---- longus colli ----- sympathetic trunk ------- inferior thyroid artery -------- middle cervical----- ganglion thoracic duct ---- vertebral artery ------ , cupula of pleura---- ----------- --- levator scapulae ----------- scalenus medius ----- --------- scalenus anterior ----------- phrenic nerve ---------- -- ascending cervical artery ---------- transverse cervical artery ------ - suprascapular artery -------Ieft sublcavian artery ~-----------------Ieft subclavian left brachiocephalic vein common carotid artery FIGURE 8. 20 STRUCTURES DEEP TO STERNOCLEIDOMASTOID 8.6 THORACIC DUCT AND DEEP CERVICAL LYMPH NODES The thoracic duct is a pale and flattened vessel which may be found in the angle of the junction of the lift internal jugular vein and the subclavian vein. It runs upwards for a short distance before arching outwards, behind the carotid sheath and its contents, but in front of the plane of the subclavian artery. That is, it passes in front of the vertebral artery, the inferior thyroid artery and the phrenic nerve, but behind the vagus nerve and the common carotid artery. It terminates in or near the commencement of the lift brachiocephatic vein. It receives lymph from: • both lower limbs • abdomen except upper surface of liver • left half of thorax • left upper limb o left side of head and neck Two clinically important lymph nodes are associated with the carotid sheath. Jugulodigastic node lies on the internal jugular vein at the level of the greater horn of the hyoid, just above the entry of the common facial vein. It is often enlarged in tonsillitis or cancer of the posterior third of the tongue. Jugulo-omohyoid node lies on the internal jugular vein just above the intermediate tendon of omohyoid. It receives lymph from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, both directly and via the submental lymph nodes, submandibular nodes and the upper deep cervical nodes. It may be enlarged in diseases such as cancer of the anterior part of the tongue. Right lymphatic duct enters the angle between the right internal jugular and the right subclavian veins. It receives lymph from: • right upper limb • right side of chest • right half of head and neck • upper surface of liver The Head and Neck 237 8.7 POSTERIOR TRIANGLE Recall that the side of the neck is divided into two large triangles, anterior and posterior, having a common boundary, the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The posterior triangle is bounded by sternocleidomastoid in front, anterior border of trapezius behind and the middle third of the clavicle below (Fig. 8.21). The apex of the triangle is on the superior nuchal line, where the two muscles meet. The roof is formed by the investing layer of deep fascia which extends between the two muscles, and has already been removed. The floor is formed by the prevertebral fascia. While many of the structures contained within the posterior triangle have already been defined, there are some which need further dissection. Review the contents of the triangle as follows: (1) External jugular vein, formed by the union of the posterior branch of the retromandibular vein with the posterior auricular vein, below the lower pole of the parotid. Before it opens into the subclavian vein, it receives the transverse cervical vein (see Fig. 8.9). occipital artery ------------------------------ trapezius ---------------------------- ----------------------------- sternocleidomastoid splenius capitis ------------------------- ----------------------------- exit of cutaneous nerves spinal accessory nerve ---------------------- ---------------------------------- external jugular vein levator scapulae ----------------- scalenus medius ------------ ----------------------- trunks of brachial plexus and subclavian artery --------------------------------------------- subclavian vein FIGURE 8.21 POSTERIOR TRIANGLE (2) Cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus have already been found (see Fig. 8.5). Radiating from the middle third of the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid, they are: (a) Lesser occipital nerve (C 2) which ascends behind the posterior edge of sternocleidomastoid; (b) Great auricular nerve (C 2, 3) which ascends towards the ear, giving a small branch to the skin over the angle of the mandible; (c) Transverse cervical nerve runs forwards across the muscle and the (d) Supraclavicular nerves which descend deep to platysma and cross the clavicle in medial, intermediate and lateral sets. (3) Accessory nerve has also been defined. In the posterior triangle it runs from sternocleidomastoid down to trapezius, both of which it supplies with motor fibres. (4) Omohyoid - inferior belly. This is a slender muscle, previously defined, which runs forwards and upwards in the direction of the cricoid cartilage. As its name implies, it subsequently turns more superiorly to reach the hyoid. this muscle belly divides the posterior triangle into a large upper occipital triangle and a smaller subclavian triangle. (5) Occipital vessels have already been defined. (6) Transverse cervical artery which crosses the lower part of the occipital triangle just above the inferior belly of omohyoid, on a deeper plane. (7) Brachial plexus. Define the three trunks of the brachial plexus formed from the anterior primary rami of nerves C 5, 6, 7, 8 and T 1. Note that C 5 and 6 join to form the upper trunk and C 8 and T 1 join to form the lower trunk and that C 7 proceeds laterally alone. (8) Lymph nodes. Some of the deep cervical lymph nodes lie alongside the spinal accessory nerve, while others are related to the jugular veins. The Head and Neck 239 Begin by identifying the origin of the vertebral artery which arises from the upper aspect of the first part of the subclavian artery, deep to the vertebral vein. Because both artery and vein lie deep to the carotid sheath, this should be retracted medially so that they can be identified. Note how the two vessels ascend towards the foramen of the transverse process of C 6 vertebra. Next, clear the origin of the internal thoracic artery at the lower aspect of the first part of the subclavian. This vessel will be described later (Fig. 8.23). The third branch of the subclavian is the thyrocervical trunk. It arises from the first part of the subclavian artery lateral to the origin of the vertebral and soon divides into three branches in a rather irregular manner: Locate the large suprascapular artery which is the first branch, and which courses laterally across the phrenic nerve which it pins down on to the lower end of scalenus anterior (see Fig. 8.20). rollow it downwards as it passes deep to the clavicle. Note that in the posterior triangle it crosses in front of the trunks of the brachial plexus and in front of the subclavian nerve, but deep to the inferior belly of omohyoid. Trace its course in the supraclavicular fossa towards the superior border of the scapula, in association with the suprascapular nerve. Note that the artery crosses above the superior transverse scapular (suprascapular) ligament while the nerve passes below it. The superior transverse scapular ligament bridges the scapular notch. Identify this notch on a prepared scapula. The suprascapular artery gives branches to the shoulder and acromioclavicular joints, and will be discussed later. 11 The transverse cervical artery runs laterally above the suprascapular artery. At the medial edge of levator scapulae it divides into a supeificial and a deep branch. It also pins the phrenic nerve to the surface of scalenus anterior. III Inferior thyroid artery arises near to the medial edge of scalenus anterior. To locate the artery pull the carotid sheath structures laterally with a retractor and feel for the anterior tubercle (of Chassaignac*) on the transverse process of C 6. This is the lead to the carotid pulse. Note how the artery runs up alongside scalenus anterior to the level of the anterior tubercle. Here it turns medially, in front of the vertebral artery and vein, but behind the carotid sheath, and in close association with the sympathetic trunk. Follow the artery as it reaches the lower pole of the thyroid gland. Note its relation to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Note also that a branch of the inferior thyroid artery, the inferior laryngeal artery ascends with the nerve, deep to the lower edge of the inferior constrictor, to enter the laryngeal part of the pharynx. It supplies the lower half of the larynx. It also supplies the lower parathyroid glands while upper glands are supplied by superior thyroid arteries. A second branch of the inferior thyroid artery is the ascending cervical artery which continues upwards between scalenus anterior and longus capitis. III Finally, locate the costocervical trunk . Follow it upwards and backwards over the suprapleural membrane to the neck of the first rib, where it divides into the deep cervical artery (to the deep muscles of the neck) and the supreme intercostal artery (to the upper two intercostal spaces) on the inside. The upper two intercostal spaces are not supplied by 'intercostal arteries' in the usual way. This is because these two spaces are above the level where it is possible for the aorta to give intercostal branches. Consequently, they receive their supply from major branches of the aorta; from the costocervical trunk on the inside and from the first branch of the axillary artery on the outside. The subclavian artery is a large vessel and because it rises above the level of the first rib it is prone to traumatic injury. This damage may result in torrential haemorrhage . • Eduard Chassaignac (1804-1879), French surgeon . The Head and Neck 241 cervical nerves, connected by a series of three loops. Start the dissection by identifying the large anterior ramus of C 4, emerging from under cover of the lateral edge of scalenus anterior at about the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. Note that it lies on scalenus medius and is in series with the anterior primary ramus of C 5, which partly forms the upper trunk of the brachial plexus (Fig. 8.24). Look again at the phrenic nerve by removing its covering of prevertebral fascia. Note the major contribution which it receives from the anterior ramus of C 4, and lesser twigs from C 3 and C 5. Using this twig from C 3, identify the anterior ramus of C 3 as it emerges between scalenus medius and longus capitis behind it. A strong loop connects C 3 to C 4 near the lateral edge of scalenus medius. Then find the loop between C 3 and 2, and define the ventral ramus of C 2 where it emerges between longus capitis and scalenus medius. -~,,------------------------------------ rectus capitis anterior longus capitis ------- 1,[1\\,1 1:11\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\",1,111 II --------------------- rectus capitis lateralis --------------------- levator scapulae longus colli ----------------------------------;0;;-;,,';:1,'/1111/(, ----------- scalenus medius C7 ------------------------------- C8---------------- contribution from T1 ----------------------------------,:,:,:;,',',:,,\"'-- ____ ro-.. ----. phrenic nerve: scalenus anterior i upper trunk of brachial plexus lower trunk of brachial plexis i middle trunk of brachial plexus FIGURE 8.24 THE LOOPS OF THE CERVICAL PLEXUS A concept which must be understood is that, as with anterior rami at lower levels, those of C 2 to T 1, pass laterally into the anterior or hypaxial muscles, all of which are thus supplied by anterior rami. These muscles lie in front of the coronal morphological plane (which is demarcated by the transverse processes of the vertebrae). In the cervical region, the transverse process proper is represented by the posterior tubercle and the posterior root of the transverse process. In contrast, the anterior tubercle and the costal process represent the costal element in a cervical vertebra. Muscles posterior to (or behind) the coronal plane are called epaxial and are supplied by posterior rami. In the cervical region, these are all the muscles attaching behind the posterior tubercles - the exception being superficial muscles like trapezius which, by migration, have secondarily acquired an attachment to cervical spinous processes. 244 Practical Anatomy 8.10.1 The Last Four Cranial Nerves These nerves are closely related to the internal jugular vein, the internal carotid and to one another at the base of the cranium. Recall that cranial nerves IX, X and XI leave the cranial cavity through the jugular foramen in front of the internal jugular vein, while nerve CN XII leaves through the hypoglossal canal. A little lower down, the hypoglossal nerve CN XII is joined by the other three nerves, so that all four come to lie anteromedial to the jugular vein, separating it from the internal carotid artery (Fig. 8.27). For a short distance, their order is numerical: IX, X, XI, XII, but soon they part company, with the spinal accessory going backwards and the glossopharyngeal IX turning forwards, superficial to the internal carotid artery, but deep to the external carotid. Remember that nerve IX is a mixed nerve which subserves swallowing, taste (posterior 1/3 of the tongue), salivation (parotid) and monitors the carotid body and carotid sinus as well as supplying the stylopharyngeus muscle. It also receives a small amount of sensation from around the external ear. The vagus CN X enters the carotid sheath and descends vertically in the posterior groove between vein and artery. It is also a mixed nerve which subserves speech, lifting of the palate, swallowing and also communicates with thoraco-abdominal structures and receives a small amount of sensation around the external ear. The accessory nerve CN XI inclines posteriorly, usually superficial to the vein, towards the posterior triangle. A somatic motor nerve, it turns the head and lifts the shoulders. The hypoglossal nerve has a rather tortuous course compared to its three companions - it curls backwards around IX and X. It crosses the internal carotid artery and gives off the superior root of ansa cervicalis as it does so. To complicate matters, it then hooks under the origin of the occipital artery and across the external carotid and the loop of the lingual artery, as it heads for the tongue. The hypoglossal nerve is a somatic motor nerve (like the accessory) and it supplies the muscles of the tongue. Finally, remember that the last two cranial nerves (XI and XII) communicate with the cervical plexus, whereas three (IX, X and XII) receive branches from the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion.

On the right, it is one of the two terminal branches of the brachiocephalic trunk, arising behind the right sternoclavicular joint. On the left, it is a branch of the aortic arch, arising behind the left side of the manubrium sterni in the superior mediastinum. Each common carotid artery ascends in the neck from behind its respective sternoclavicular joint, within the carotid sheath. It lies first lateral to the trachea and oesophagus and then lateral to larynx and pharynx (Fig. 8.28). medial contour of internal carotid artery superior cervical ganglion thyroid cartilage --- ___ _ ~ ..... - inferior thyroid artery -------------- thoracic duct ----------- inferior cervical ganglion The Head and Neck 245 J]------------------------- loop between C1 and C2 H--··---------------------loop between C2 and C3 -------------------- loop between C3 and C4 --------------------------- ascending cervical artery ----------------------- phrenic nerve ------------------------- scalenus anterior ---------------------- vertebral vein overlying artery -------------------- transverse cervical artery --------------- suprascapular artery ------- 3rd part of subclavian artery -------- subclavian vein internal jugular vein 1 st part of subclavian artery common carotid artery FIGURE 8.28. RELATIONS OF THE LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY. (STIPPLED AREA IS UPWARD EXTENSION OF ARTERY) At about the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage the common carotid artery bifurcates, in the carotid triangle, into the internal and external branches_ The internal carotid is the more direct continuation of the two branches_ It ascends in the carotid sheath, in front of the transverse processes of Ci,\" 2 and 3, and enters the base of the skull through the carotid canal in the petrous part of the temporal bone_ It enters the cranial cavity via the upper part of foramen lacerum and pursues a tortuous course_ before it ends by dividing into the anterior cerebral, middle cerebral and posterior communicating arteries_ The external carotid arises at the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage and ascends to the posteromedial aspect of the neck of the mandible, where it divides into two terminal branches, the maxillary and superficial temporal. It is anterior to the internal carotid, and passes deep to the posterior belly of digastric and the stylohyoid before it enters the parotid region_ En route it gives branches which have been dealt with before_ These are: • Superior thyroid artery, supplies the upper pole of the thyroid gland_ • Ascending pharyngeal artery, lies on the buccopharyngeal fascia_ • Lingual artery, supplies the tongue_ • Facial artery, supplies the structures in the submandibular triangle and the face_ • Occipital artery, passes backwards to supply the muscles at the back of the neck and the posterior part of the scalp (recall that the hypoglossal nerve XII hooks under its origin)_ • Posterior auricular artery, supplies the scalp and mastoid area_ • Superficial temporal artery, supplies the parotid gland and the temporal part of the scalp _ The pulse of the superficial temporal artery may be easily felt on the temple in front of the ear. • Maxillary artery is the larger terminal branch and will be dealt with elsewhere (see p_ 292)_ 248 Practical Anatomy The pharynx is a muscular tube which extends from the base of the skull to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage where it becomes the oesophagus (at the level of C 6). Its muscular wall consists of five paired voluntary muscles, three of which, called the constrictors, arise from a central raphe behind and are incomplete in front to allow the nose, mouth and larynx to open into the pharynx (Fig. 8.31). The other two pairs of muscles are palatopharyngeus and stylopharyngeus, which will be dealt with later. IdentifY the origin of the inferior constrictor beneath the thyroid gland. Above, clean its origin from the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage, under cover of the strap muscle sternothyroid. Below, it arises from a curved fibrous arch spanning the cricothyroid membrane. Now clean the area of the middle constrictor. This is best done by feeling for the hyoid bone. The middle constrictor arises from the greater hom of the hyoid bone and from the inferior aspect of the stylohyoid ligament, from where it fans upwards and backwards to meet its fellow in a central pharyngeal raphe. If the finger passes down from the hyoid, it will encounter the soft thyrohyoid membrane. Cut through this membrane in a horizontal plane just beneath the hyoid; this mobilises both the pharynx and the larynx. Pull the larynx forward and free the entire structure by cutting through the neurovascular supply on either side. Confirm that the constrictors meet their fellows of the opposite side in a posteromedian pharyngeal raphe. The raphe is attached above to the pharyngeal tubercle on the occipital bone (Fig. 8.31). . ........ pterygomandibular raphe B FIGURE 8.31 PHARYNGEAL MUSCLES FROM BEHIND (AJ, THE SIDE (BJ It should also now be clear that the muscular wall of the pharynx is formed by three fan-shaped constrictors on each side, each overlapping the other from below upwards like tumblers placed one within the other. (The superior constrictor will be dissected later.) The constrictors have a strong internal lining of fascia called the pharyngobasilar fascia and a thin external lining called the buccopharyngeal fascia. The cervical pharynx is supplied by the ascending pharyngeal artery from the external carotid, and is drained by the pharyngeal venous plexus which lies on the muscular wall, deep to the buccopharyngeal fascia. The area derives its innervation from the pharyngeal plexus formed by the pharyngeal branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) and of the vagus (X), and also branches from the superior cervical ganglion. The lymph of the pharynx is drained by retropharyngeallymph nodes. 250 Practical Anatomy 8.13 LARYNX AND CERVICAL TRACImA Now examine the lower part of the oesophagus which begins behind the cricoid cartilage (level of C 6), and note that it has an outer longitudinal and an inner circular muscular coat. Confirm its relations: • behind is the body of C 7, clothed by longus colli muscle; • in front is the trachea with the recurrent laryngeal nerve on each side, lying in the tracheo- oesophageal groove. The right and left relations differ somewhat: • on the right is the right lobe of the thyroid gland, the right carotid sheath and lower down the apex of the pleura; • on the lift are the left thyroid lobe, the left carotid sheath and, lower down, the left subclavian artery and apex of the pleura. The thoracic duct adheres to the left side of the oesophagus. When teaching the section on the larynx, demonstrators are often asked, 'What is the detail required in the dissection of the larynx? How much do we need to know?' The larynx is complicated and beginners do not need to know the minutiae of its anatomy. You do, however, have to know its basic structure and its function. For now, accept that it is the site of sound manufacture and also the site of passage of the endotracheal tube or bronchoscope and is thus an area of obvious clinical importance. 8.13.1 Cartilaginous Skeleton of the Larynx To understand the anatomy and physiology of the larynx requires primarily an understanding of the anatomy of the cartilaginous framework of this area. The larynx is formed by three unpaired and three paired cartilages. Unpaired thyroid cricoid epiglottis Paired arytenoid corniculate cuneiform Thyroid cartilage. This consists of two plates of hyaline cartilage which meet at an acute angle in the midline. A prominence in this angle forms externally the laryngeal prominence or Adam's apple. In the midline the upper edge has a deep, superior thyroid notch (Fig. 8.31). The posterior edge of each thyroid plate sweeps up to form the superior cornu (cornu L = horn). Within this convexity there is a tubercle, named the superior tubercle which is connected to the inferior tubercle on the lower border of the thyroid cartilage by the oblique line. The latter is a useful landmark because it provides the attachment for three muscles: • inferior constrictor • sternothyroid in front of the inferior constrictor and • the thyrohyoid in front of sternothyroid. Cricoid cartilage is classically described as a signet ring of hyaline cartilage at the level of C 6 (krikos, G = ring). The anterior part of the ring is narrow and is referred to as the arch of the cricoid, whilst the posterior, wider part is the lamina of the cricoid (Fig. 8.35). The cricoid is also described as a little mandible. On the upper border, close to the midline on each side, is an oval facet for the arytenoid cartilage. Like a mandible, the lower border is more or less horizontal, while the upper border slopes upwards and backwards.

(A = ANTERIOR VIEW; B = LATERAL VIEW). ARROWS INDICATE MOVEMENT OF CRICOID AND ARYTENOID CARTILAGES WHEN CRICOTHYROID CONTRACTS. Examine the cricoid cartilage on the cadaver. It lies between the thyroid cartilage and the first tracheal cartilage. It is connected to the first by the cricothyroid ligament and to the second by the cricotracheal ligament. The cricothyroid ligament does not only connect the edges of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages; the greater part of the ligament actually passes upwards, deep to the thyroid cartilage, to be attached posteriorly to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage (Fig. 8.36) and anteriorly to the angle of the arytenoid. The free upper edge is a most important structure, the vocal ligament, and it lies within the vocal fold. The cone-shaped part of the cricothyroid ligament extending from the cricoid to the vocal ligament is known as the conus elasticus (Fig. 8.36). Epiglottis. This is a leaf-shaped structure composed of elastic cartilage which is attached by a strong thyro-epiglottic ligament to the back of the thyroid cartilage. If the laryngeal inlet which was exposed when cutting through the larynx and pharynx at the lower border of the hyoid bone is examined, the mucosal folds associated with this are are seen. They are: • aryepiglottic folds • vestibular folds (so-called 'false vocal cord') and • vocal folds (so-called 'true vocal cords') (Fig. 8.37). Arytenoid cartilages are the first of the paired cartilages of the larynx (arytaina, G = wine glass). Each arytenoid cartilage is perched on the sloping upper border of the cricoid lamina. It consists mostly of hyaline cartilage, with the exception of the apex, which is elastic cartilage. Each arytenoid is pyramidal, with the base resting on the cricoid and its apex pointing upwards (Fig. 8.38). 252 Practical Anatomy aryepiglottic fold ----- ~ vestibule ------------~~- ------- q\"\"drnOg\"::~:\"~:,:: ••••••••••••• ~ \\ '=lfOldl~ rima glottidis ------- IJIi infraglottic cavity -------------:~-------­ ;',111 FIGURE 8.36 CORONAL SECTION OF LARYNX SHOWING VESTIBULAR AND VOCAL FOLDS ---- ----- ----------- --- epiglottis ---------- vestibular fold aryepiglottic fold ------------------- -------------- vocal fold L ___________________ cuneiform tubercle ~------------------------------corniculate tubercle FIGURE 8.37 LARYNGEAL INLET FROM ABOVE The medial angle of each triangular arytenoid cartilage is called the vocal process, for attachment of the vocal ligament, while the lateral angle is the muscular process, for attachment of posterior and lateral crico-arytenoid muscles, and the transverse and oblique arytenoid muscles.

The Head and Neck 253 8.13.2 Dissection of the Larynx To visualise the interior of the larynx, cut down the middle of the anterior aspect of the laryngeal cartilages - between the thyroid lamellae. Note that in elderly persons the cartilages may be calcified and hence rather difficult to cut. Now open the lamellae forcibly until the cricoid cartilage cracks. Make a midline incision through the mucous membrane down the opened larynx. Expose the cracked edges of the cricoid and dissect off the mucous membrane to identify the upper edge of cricoid and the cricoarytenoid joint. The arytenoids are best found by palpation between thumb and finger (Figure 8.39). Now hold the larynx in one hand and grasp the arytenoid with a pair of forceps - move the one on the other to demonstrate the cricoarytenoid joint. Follow the triangular arytenoid cartilage up to its apex. Feel for the vocal process of the arytenoid. Notice the vocal fold passing from it to the laryngeal prominence. Also explore the laryngeal ventricle and its upper vestibular fold. In the midline, between the arytenoid cartilages, find the arytenoideus or interarytenoid muscle. Cut through the vocal cord with a scissors to examine its internal anatomy - here find the vocal ligament which has on its lateral side the vocalis muscle. 7' ~ ....................... corniculate cartilage ~ ~ , ~ vestibular fold ................... 1i1.·~~~-::1 ff ~: ..................... laryngeal ventricle vocal fold .................. rL.l... .... , } f J.

Remove carefully the mucous membrane from the laryngeal surface to expose four little laryngeal muscles (Fig. 8.40). First trace the fan-shaped posterior cricoarytenoid from the back of the cricoid lamina upwards and laterally to the muscular process projecting from the arytenoid. The oblique arytenoids form an X which reaches from the muscular processes of the arytenoid below to the arytenoid apices above, and then continue upwards and forwards to the sides of the epiglottis as the aryepiglottic muscles. Superficial to the X is the transverse arytenoid muscle already identified from the interior of the larynx. Bearing in mind that exposing the structures of the larynx is a difficult dissection and that the tiny laryngeal muscles are not easily displayed, investigate the lateral aspect of the larynx by detaching the cricothyroid muscle from the lower border of the thyroid cartilage. Reflect it down to its cricoid origin to reveal the deeper lateral cricoarytenoid muscle which arises from the arch of the cricoid and runs up to the front of the muscular process of the arytenoid (Fig. 8.41). 254 Practical Anatomy circular fibres of oesophagus FIGURE 8.40 POSTERIOR LARYNGEAL MUSCLES Thus far only the complex musculature of the larynx has been dissected. To extend the usefulness of the dissection the function of these muscles should be considered. Firstly, study the movement which takes place at the cricothyroid joints. They are hinge joints so that when the cricothyroid contracts the cricoid cartilage moves upwards towards the thyroid cartilage. The effect is to increase the tension of the vocal cords. This alters the pitch of the emanating sound (Fig. 8.35B). Next, study the action of the posterior and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles. To do this, tug gently on the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle and observe the effect on the rima glottidis. The vocal fold is pulled laterally, that is, it is abducted. Hence, if the muscles on either side contract simultaneously, they will widen the rima glottidis. This alters the shape from a triangle to that of a diamond (Figure 8.42). . ............................. epiglottis aryepiglotticus ............................... . . ................ hyoid thyro·epiglotticus ....................... . ............... thyrohyoid membrane . .. ,:, .•................ thyroid laminae (partly resected) lateral crico-arytenoid ................. ;==.\" .. , .•... .-.; ...................... thyro-arytenoid posterior crico-arytenoid ............. . t;H;<\"'\\\\\" ....

This nerve, which arises chiefly from C 4, descends over the front of scalenus anterior under cover of the fascia, crossing the muscle from lateral to medial. It is itself crossed transversely, superficial to the prevertebral fascia, by the transverse cervical artery above the clavicle and the supra-scapular artery lower down, behind the clavicle. Scalenus anterior, key muscle of the prevertebral region, attaches to the anterior tubercles of C 3, 4, 5 and 6. Define these attachments and its inferior attachment to the scalene tubercle and adjoining ridge on the first rib between the grooves for the subclavian artery and vein (Figure 8.44). Behind the scalenus anterior, identifY the subclavian artery, the cervical pleura and the roots of the brachial plexus. Also find the scalenus medius muscle and define its superior attachment to the costotransverse bars ofC 2 to C 7. Now mobilise the third (lateral) part of the subclavian artery and the lower trunk of the brachial plexus by pulling them forward and note the attachment of scalenus medius to the upper surface of the first rib. Find the roots of the long thoracic nerve (C 5, 6) where they emerge from scalenus medius below the dorsal scapular nerve (C 5). Trace the long thoracic nerve down and find the root from C 7 which joins it near the medial edge of scalenus medius. The long thoracic nerve has been encountered already, and supplies the serratus anterior muscle segmentally. Define the attachment of scalenus posterior, the deepest of the three scalene muscles. It runs from the posterior tubercles of C 4, 5 and 6 to the outer surface of the 2nd rib. FIGURE 8.44 (A) SCALENUS ANTERIOR; (B) SCALENUS MEDIUS; (C) SCALENUS POSTERIOR 8.14.2 Homologous Nature of the Scalene Muscles As seen earlier, the scalene muscles extend from the anterior tubercles and costotransverse bars of the cervical vertebrae to the upper two ribs. The anterior tubercles and costotransverse bars are homologues of ribs in the neck. This point leads to another way of thinking about the scalene muscles; they may in fact be regarded as homologues with the trilaminar intercostal musculature of the thorax and abdomen (Fig. 8.45). Since the scalene muscles are attached above to homologues of ribs and below to actual ribs, they may in fact be regarded as intercostal muscles. In addition, they The Head and Neck 259 A word of caution, though. Remember that in the thorax and abdomen the neurovascular plane lies between the second and third muscle layers from the suiface. In the neck this plane is between scalenus anterior and scalenus medius, and this is where the passage of the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery takes place. The subclavian vein is exceptional, however, and passes in front of scalenus anterior, (presumably because it is a 'low pressure structure' and would be easily compressed if it were between the scalene muscles). In summary, the scalene muscles present the same, though imperfect, basic pattern of a trilaminar musculature with a neurovascular plane between the first and second layers from the surface. 8.14.3 Prevertebral Muscles and the Vertebral Artery There are three prevertebral muscles: longus colli, longus capitis and rectus capItIS anterior (Fig. 8.46). Elevate the cervical visceral tubes to define their attachments. [Earlier it was noted that there are tiny slips of muscle which run between the transverse processes of consecutive vertebrae.] In the space between the transverse processes of C 5 and C 6, remove some of these intertransverse muscle fibres to expose the vertebral artery enmeshed in a sympathetic plexus and a loose venous plexus. The artery will be seen ascending through the foramina of the transverse processes. This part of the artery is the transversarial portion. Recall that the first part of the artery is between its origin and C 6 and constitutes the prevertebral part, the third part within the suboccipital triangle is the atlantic part and the fourth part is the intracranial part. Again, note that the parts of the artery are named according to position (cf parietal pleura; cords of brachial plexus). Behind the prevertebral part of the vertebral artery, find the anterior ramus of C 6, which passes laterally and downwards in the neurovascular plane, that is between scalenus anterior and medius. 8.15 CUPULA PLEURAE This is the final section on the neck. Looking back you will realise that, although it has been a difficult dissection, the neck and its anatomy can be made easier by dividing it up into morphological cores around which we have built a three-dimensional concept of the form and function of the particular area. The last core idea presented here links the neck with the thorax. The cupula (cupa, L = cup) or dome of the pleura rises above the first rib to form the domed apex of the pleural cavity and also the floor of the root of the neck. Protected by scalene muscles, and suprapleural membrane, the cupula has many important relations, all of which have already been identified (Figure 8.47). Look at the dome-shaped cupula pleurae. Notice that between the cupulae of the two sides are the larynx, trachea and the thyroid gland. Now consider the relations of each cupula. In front, notice the anterior relations: • Subclavian artery grooves the pleura a little below its apex. Re-identifJ its branches in this area - the vertebral, thyrocervical and costo-cervical trunks passing upwards, and the internal thoracic artery passing downwards. • Vertebral vein before it joins the brachiocephalic vein. • Subclavian vein anterior to scalenus anterior. • Vagus nerve. • Recurrent laryngeal nerve from its curve around the lower surface of the subclavian artery or aorta. • Phrenic nerve lies on the pleura after leaving the medial edge of scalenus anterior. Behind, find the neck of the 1st rib and its related structures, the supreme intercostal artery, the stellate ganglion and the anterior ramus of T 1. The Head and Neck 261 Above, identify the suprapleural membrane which forms a cap over the pleura. It attaches to the 1st rib in front and to the transverse process of C 7 behind. Laterally, note the scalenus anterior and medius muscles. Medially, there are the common carotid and subclavian arteries, trachea, oesophagus, recurrent laryngeal nerves and thoracic duct. FIGURE 8. 47 RELATIONS OF THE CUPULA PLEURAE 8.16 THE FACE 8.16.1 Surface Anatomy ------- scalenus medius ---------- phrenic nerve - vagus nerve ----- subclavian artery ----------- subclavian vein internal thoracic artery internal jugular vein common carotid artery Broadly speaking, this section is concerned with the anatomy of the face and its related structures such as the paro~id gland and the muscles of mastication. It is an area of some complexity and clinical significance. Surface anatomy is fundamental to an understanding of this region, and so the superficial morphology of the face should be carefully studied and understood even if you find that much of it is already familiar. Examine the face of a living model. Each face is individual and different. In fact, the most recognisable, distinctive and memorable feature of a human being is his or her face. Note the colour _ of your model's skin, note the presence of moles, freckles and hairy areas. Note the prominence or flatness of the nose or the chin, note how full the lips are or how round the eyes. Now ask your model to smile, or grimace or wink. These movements of facial expression are controlled by small subcutaneous muscles which receive their motor supply from the facial (CN VII) nerve. If one had to select an area of neuromuscular evolution that has been outstandingly successful, one should undoubtedly choose the facial expression of human emotion. Evidence for this is only too clear if one considers the achievements of actors, politicians and film stars. However, when it comes to understanding how the face may be moved in ways that range from the sublime to the grotesque, few would grasp its complexity. This is because the muscles of facial expression are thin, friable and not easily defined. Development of the face is signalled by the arrival of neural crest cells from the cranial neural folds. 264 Practical Anatomy 8.17 SKIN REFLECTION AND TELA SUBCUTANEA OF THE FACE 8.17.1 Skin Incisions Place a wooden block under the shoulders. Make a midline incision from the tip of the chin up to the lower margin of the lip (Fig. 8.50). At the vermilion border, make an elliptical cut around the mouth. From the middle of the upper lip carry the incision up over the bridge of the nose, over nasion and up to glabella. Now carry out a wide incision starting above the eyelids and encircling each orbit. This dissection requires great care and should be performed cautiously with a sharp knife. Elevate the skinflap at the lower border of the lower lip, keeping close to the skin so as to minimise damage to the underlying orbicularis oris muscle. Then remove the skin of the lip to expose orbicularis oris fully. Because this muscle, and all the other muscles of facial expression, are inserted into the skin, patches of damage by the dissector are almost inevitable. FIGURE 8.50 SKIN INCISIONS ON THE FACE (INTERRUPTED UNES REPRESENT THE INCISIONS) Begin at the bridge of the nose and reflect the skin laterally, again keeping close to its deep surface so as to minimise damage to subcutaneous structures. Pull the skin down across the eyelids and cut it at the palpebral margin. Now cut across the zygomatic process and reflect the skin down to the earhole. The muscles of facial expression will now be exposed together with the superficial nerves and arteries of the face. 8.17.2 Muscles of Facial Expression At first sight (Fig. 8.51), the muscles of expression appear to be confusing. However, the student is not required to identifY nor memorise all of them. In general, these muscles are arranged either as closers (sphincters) or as openers of the facial orifices. Hence they may conveniently be divided into four groups - around the eye, the nose, the mouth and the ear. They consist of striated muscle and their fine control is an important means of conveying mood and meaning in human communication. All (save one - the levator palpebrae superioris) receive motor innervation from the cranial nerve VII, while proprioceptive sensation (sensation from within) from them is conveyed through the faciotrigeminal communications to one or other of the three divisions of cranial nerve (eN V).

Muscles of facial expression do not move the skeleton. Instead, they produce their effect by moving the skin. Through the evolution of these fine facial muscles, humans are capable of a much wider range of facial expressions than other primates. Begin the dissection of these muscles by using a sharp scalpel to remove the thin layer of connective tissue which covers the underlying muscles. Take care not to damage nerves or vessels while trying to identity as many facial muscles as possible. The first muscle to dissect is the orbicularis oris which encircles the mouth. At the angle of the mouth, find depressor anguli oris which is a fanshaped muscle that originates from the lower border of the mandible and runs upwards to converge at a point above the angle of the mouth (Fig. 8.51). It is superficial to a little square muscle that runs from the lower border of the mandible to the lower lip - the depressor labii inferioris. Zygomaticus major is easily identified at the angle of the mouth where it reaches to the zygomatic bone. A muscle sheet, consisting of zygomaticus minor, levator labii superioris and levator labii superioris alaeque nasi is variable and will be seen more medial to zygomaticus major. If a cut is made through the origin of depressor labii inferioris and it is reflected, the deeper muscles of the mouth - mentalis, levator anguli oris and buccinator - may be identified. Note that 266 Practical Anatomy an artery, the facial artery runs between levator labii superioris and levator anguli oris. Buccinator forms the cheek and will be discussed later (p. 275). Muscles of the nose are variable and not easily identified. The only important muscle to be identified here is nasalis. Around the eye is the orbicularis oculi which consists of two parts: one related to the eyelids or palpebral part, and one related to the orbit or orbital part. 8.17.3 Superficial Nerves and Vessels Remember that the cutaneous nerves of the face are derived from cranial nerves - and the dissection is anterior to the junction of cranial and spinal nerve-fields (Fig. 8.52). FIGURE 8.52 CRANIAL AND SPINAL NERVE-FIELDS OF THE FACE (THE HEAVY LINE INDICATES THE JUNCTION BETWEEN CRANIAL - ANTERIOR- AND SPINAL NERVE FIELDS - POSTERIOR). In general it is difficult to dissect out all the muscles of facial expression. Coping with all the cutaneous nerves of the face is even more difficult. Referring to Figure 8.53, work through the following structures, identifYing only those marked with an asterisk: • *Supraorbital nerve. Its medial branch pierces the frontalis muscle above the supraorbital margin a thumb's breadth from the midline. Its lateral branch pierces the epicranial aponeurosis a little more laterally and superiorly. • Supratrochlear nerve. Small branches pierce frontalis and orbicularis oculi above the medial end of the supraorbital margin, medial to the supraorbital nerve. • Infratrochlear nerve.

The common facial vein, therefore, is a major communicator between superficial and deep venous systems. 8.17.5 Three Facial Foramina Three nerves and accompanying vessels emerge from bony foramina on the front of the skull, which lie in the same sagittal plane. They are the supraorbital foramen; the infraorbital foramen and the mental foramen ( Fig. 8.49). • Supraorbital foramen transmits the supraorbital nerve, which is the terminal branch of the ophthalmic, and the supraorbital artery, a branch of the ophthalmic artery from the internal carotid. • Infraorbital foramen transmits the infraorbital nerve, which is a terminal branch of the maxillary nerve, and the infraorbital artery from the maxillary artery which is a branch of the external carotid. • Mental foramen transmits the mental nerve, from the mandibular nerve, and the mental artery from the maxillary artery. 8.17.6 External Ear and Nose The external ear consists of two parts - the auricle and the earhole or external acoustic meatus. Cut into the ear. You will find that it is made up of elastic cartilage with the exception of the earlobe which is made up of fibro-areolar tissue. There are a number of vestigial and three extrinsic muscles of the auricle, none of which needs dissecting. The blood supply is from the posterior auricular artery and the superficial temporal artery. The auricle has an interesting and curiously complex sensory nerve supply (Fig. 8.55). Three of the four nerves which supply the external ear; • the auriculotemporal (from the posterior division of the mandibular nerve); • the great auricular (from anterior primary rami of C 2 and 3); and • the lesser occipital (anterior primary ramus of C 2), have already been exposed. On the internal aspect of the posterior wall of the earhole, look for the auricular branch of the vagus which enters the meatus between the cartilage and bone. There is some evidence that this nerve terminates in the spinal nucleus of CN V. The external acoustic meatus is the auditory passage, about 2,5 cm long, and leads to the tympanic membrane. It consists of an outer, cartilaginous one-third and an inner, bony two-thirds. The bony part is bounded by the tympanic part of the temporal bone on all sides except above, where the squamous part of the temporal bone forms the roof Confirm these features on a prepared skull. Remember that the meatus is slightly S-shaped and hence has to be straightened by pulling the cartilaginous part upwards and backwards, a manoeuvre employed when an auroscope is inserted into the canal to examine the tympanic membrane. Remove the muscle and fibrous tissue covering the skeleton of the nose, but leave the lacrimal sac, which lies just lateral to the bridge of the nose, intact. Find the external nasal branch of the nasocilliary nerve where it emerges between the bony and cartilaginous parts of the nose. The cartilaginous skeleton consists of five main and several additional cartilages. The main cartilages are: • two lateral cartilages above, • two major alar cartilages below and a • single median septal cartilage (Fig. 8.56). 270 Practical Anatomy riM'\" oeo;p'''' --------------------- auricular branch of vagus --------- auriculotemporal ----------------- great auricular --------------------- great auricular Facial aspect Cranial aspect FIGURE 8.55 INNERVATION OF THE AURICLE Examine the major alar cartilage.

The parotid is the largest of the salivary glands. It fits into the space between the mastoid process and the ramus of the lower jaw and has an extension forward on to the face. The Head and Neck 271 Begin the dissection by clearing the upper attachment of the sternocleidomastoid to the mastoid process. Clear the area in front of it but do not remove the retromandibular vein. Clear the upper attachment of the posterior belly of digastric muscle to the medial aspect of the mastoid process. On a prepared skull, identifY the mastoid process and the styloid process. Find the stylomastoid foramen through which the facial nerve (CN VII) emerges. With this mental picture of the osteology of the region, return to the cadaver and locate the retromandibular vein (Fig. 8.57). This vein is the key to the dissection of the parotid gland and the facial nerve. Find the vein at the angle of the jaw and follow it up across the posterior belly of digastric. By open-and-close dissection with scissors follow the vein into the substance of the gland, until two nerves crossing it from behind are visible. Follow these back to where they unite to form the facial nerve. Trace it to its origin from the stylomastoid foramen. Retrace the nerve forward into the gland and note that it first divides into two, after which the upper division splits into two, temporal and zygomatic branches and the lower division gives rise to the buccal, marginal mandibular and cervical branches (Fig. 8.58). Now that these branches have been identified as the branches of the facial nerve, dissect them out through the substance of the gland and on to the face. As the nerve emerges from the stylomastoid foramen it gives branches to the adjacent muscles - the posterior belly of digastric and one of the three styloid muscles, the stylohyoid. It also gives off the posterior auricular branch to occipitalis and to the extrinsic muscles of the ear. The remaining branches supply the muscles of facial expression. superficial temporal vein ------------------- posterior auricular vein --------- retromandibular vein ------------- posterior branch of ---------- 'etcom~d;b\"'\" ') transverse facial vein maxillary vein iddle temporal vein facial vein : anterior branch of retromandibular vein FIGURE 8.57 VENOUS PLANE OF THE PAROTID Find the supeificial temporal artery and follow it downwards into the parotid gland. After completely freeing the artery and the facial nerve, remove the entire gland, preserving the parotid duct which leaves the gland to cross masseter, after which it pierces the buccinator muscle to enter the mouth opposite the second upper molar tooth. With the aid of Figure 8.59, study the upper part of the external carotid artery and its upper three branches. Note that it would enter the gland low down on its posteromedial aspect, and emerge on the anteromedial aspect a little higher up. Its posterior auricular branch runs backwards and upwards, along the upper edge of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. The Head and Neck 273 Having completed the removal of the parotid, the parotid bed should now be studied. This area of the body is a useful landmark at the junction between head and neck (see boxes p. 274). Clinically this area features in significant morbidities such as mumps, tumours and Sjogren's syndrome. The parotid bed occupies a pyramidal space. On a prepared skull examine the bony boundaries of the bed. Note the posterior border of the ramus of the mandible in front, the mastoid process behind, the external acoustic· meatus above and the styloid process of the temporal bone medially (Fig. 8.60). Now revise the muscles related to the parotid bed over these bony boundaries. Anteriorly, the ramus is covered by the masseter muscle (maseter, G = chewer) laterally and by the medial pterygoid (pteryx, G = wing) medially. Posteriorly, the mastoid process serves as attachment to the sternocleidomastoid laterally and the posterior belly of digastric medially. Medially, the styloid process of the temporal bone is enveloped by three slender muscles - Stylopharyngeus, stylohyoid and styloglossus, and gives attachment to two ligaments - the stylomandibular and stylohyoid ligaments. head of mandible posterior edge of ramus external acoustic meatus outline of mastoid process styloid process posterior belly of digastric sternocleidomastoid FIGURE 8.60 THE PAROTID BED Above, the gland is related to the external acoustic meatus and the capsule of the temporomandibular joint. The parotid space is lined with the investing layer of deep cervical fascia which splits to enclose the gland. The superficial lamina is closely adherent to the gland and is attached above to the zygomatic arch. The deep lamina is attached to the lower edge of the tympanic part of the temporal bone and to the styloid process. Antero-inferiorly, the fascia is thickened to form the stylomandibular ligament between the styloid process and the angle of the mandible. It intervenes between the parotid and submandibular glands. The Head and Neck 275 8.18 THE MANDmLE The dissection thus far has encompassed a study of the muscles of facial expression, the course of the facial artery and vein, and the study of the parotid gland and its related structures. By now the parotid has been removed completely so that its bed is clearly displayed; the styloid and its three muscles, the tympanic part of the temporal bone and the auricular cartilage, the mastoid process and its muscles and the ramus of the mandible have also been displayed. Study the mandible by reviewing the bony landmarks on a prepared bone and on a living subject. The head of the mandibular condyle may be easily felt in front of the tragus when the mouth is opened and closed. Below the condylar head is the neck, below which the posterior border of the ramus of the mandible may be felt. This ends below at the angle of the mandible. Feel for the anterior border of the ramus parallel to the posterior border, through the cheek, or more easily from within the mouth. Place the index finger in the upper labial fold and feel the alveolar margin of the maxillary dental arcade from the incisors in front to the molars further back. Behind the last molar, the finger will move across a little hump, the maxillary tuberosity, and, a little deeper and higher it will feel a sharp projection, the pterygoid hamulus (hamus , L = hook). Running down from the hamulus feel a band of fibrous tissue in the lateral wall of the mouth called the pterygomandibular raphe (raphe, G = seam). In front of the raphe, on sucking a finger, the contraction of buccinator muscle within the cheek may be felt. Behind the raphe, on swallowing, the contraction of the superior pharyngeal constrictor may be felt. Note that the mucosa behind the raphe is very sensitive to touch and a gagging reflex may be evoked. This is because the raphe is the junction between oral mucosa supplied by the trigeminal nerve in front and the pharyngeal mucosa supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve behind. Slide a finger down the raphe to the mandible behind the last molar, near the posterior end of the mylohyoid line. On swallowing, the contraction of the mylohyoid may be felt. Confirm the bony landmarks on a prepared skull and mandible. Muscles of mastication. Embryonically, both the upper and lower jaws are derived from the first or mandibular pair of branchial arches. The muscles of mastication, together with the mylohyoid, anterior belly of digastric, tensor tympani and tensor veli palatini muscles are also derived from the mandibular arch. Hence, they are all innervated by a branch of the nerve of the first arch, the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN Viii). There are four muscles of mastication - temporalis, masseter, medial and lateral pterygoid. Temporalis muscle is a large fan-shaped muscle which arises from the side of the skull where its contraction can easily be seen in the living. To define it, free the temporal fascia from the zygomatic arch and reflect it upwards. Some of the superficial fibres of the muscle are attached to the deep surface of the fascia (Fig. 8.63). The fascia and muscle end at the superior temporal line of the skull. Note that the anterior fibres are vertical (elevators) whereas the posterior fibres tend to be horizontal (retractors). FIGURE 8.63 TEMPORAUS MUSCLE 278 Practical Anatomy mental spine of the mandible to the hyoid bone (Fig. 8.68). Above each geniohyoid, the fleshy genioglossus muscle arises from the upper mental spine (Fig 8.69). Its lowest fibres are attached to the hyoid, above the geniohyoid. Most of its fibres end freely in the substance of the tongue and form the greater part of that organ. FIGURE 8.67 MYLOHYOID MUSCLE FIGURE 8.68 GENIOHYOID MUSCLES FIGURE 8.69 GENIOGLOSSUS 8.20 TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT Dissection. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a synovial joint of modified hinge type which is formed between the head of the mandible, and the articular (glenoid) fossa and eminence of the temporal bone. An articular disc divides the joint into upper and lower compartments. While its lower surface is concave to fit the convex head of the mandible, the upper surface of the disc is concavoconvex to fit the articular tubercle and the glenoid fossa (Fig. 8.70) - (glene, G = socket). To expose the joint, clear all muscular and fascial remnants off the zygomatic process. On the inferior border of the posterior part of the process, find the temporomandibular ligament the fibres of which stretch across to the lateral and posterior surfaces of the mandible. Careful dissection will 280 Practical Anatomy 8.20.1 Movements of the TMJ General considerations. For most students, the biggest obstacles to overcome when learning the movements of the TMJ are: • the fact that the TMJ is not purely a hinge type of joint, and • that there are in fact two joints linked by a rigid horse-shoe-shaped bar called the mandible. Hence, if something is chewed on the right molar teeth, movement in the right TMJ will be accompanied by complementary movement in the left TMJ. The third thing to understand is that the TMJ is divided into an upper and lower compartment by the articular disc. Movement occurs in both upper and lower compartments. In the lower compartment, the head of the mandible rotates beneath the inferior surface of the articular disc. In the upper compartment the disc itself and the mandibular head glide forward together on the articular tubercle. Opening (or depression). Study an articulated skull and mandible. Note the limited space between the tympanic plate and the posterior surface of the ramus of the mandible. Depress the mandible (open the mouth) with a pure hinge movement. See how this small space is reduced or obliterated. Logically, for the mouth to open further space has to be created, and this is made possible by the forward movement of the condyle on ~o the glenoid tubercle. Note now that the jaw may be widely opened. Hence, when the mouth is opened two types of movement take place in the TMJ - a hinge movement of the mandibular head (Fig. 8. 71A) and a gliding movement of the head forwards onto the articular tubercle (Fig. 8. 71B). Because true hinge movement occurs in the hollow posterior half of the disc, and because head and disc can move together, there is a nett translation of the mandibular head forwards and downwards along a path parallel to the contour of the tubercle. The lateral pterygoid muscles are responsible for drawing the disc and mandibular head forwards, while depression of the lower jaw itself is achieved by gravity and the digastric muscles as well as by platysma. transverse axis of hinge movement FIGURE 8.71 HINGE (A) AND GLIDING (B) MOVEMENTS AT THE TMJ path described by transverse axis of head as the disc and head glide forward on to the articular tubercle Closing (or elevation). When the mouth closes, the two components of opening are reversed. The elevators are the temporalis and masseter muscles and medial pterygoid muscles; while return of the disc to the fossa is effected by elastic tissue in its posterior attachment and by temporalis. The Head and Neck 281 Protrusion and retrusion. Both heads of the mandible slide forwards or backwards across the articular tubercles but there is no depression of the mandible. Pterygoid muscles protrude and posterior fibres of temporalis retract the mandible. Side-to-side (or grinding). These are produced by alternate operations of the pterygoids on the two sides. RELATIONS OF THE TMJ Superficial to the TMJ are the parotid gland, the temporal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve VII, the transverse facial vessels, the superficial temporal vessels and the auriculotemporal nerve. Anterior are the tendons of the lateral pterygoid and the masseteric nerve and vessels. Posterior are the retromandibular plexus, the parotid gland, the external acoustic meatus and the auriculotemporal nerve. Medial relations are more difficult and need you to refer back to a dry skull as well. Note that the tympanic part of the temporal bone separates the glenoid fossa from the carotid canal. More anteriorly is the spine of the sphenoid, medial to the fossa. Hence, the auriculotemporal nerve, chorda tympani and sphenomandibular ligament are medial relations, as are the middle meningeal and lesser petrosal nerves. 8.21 TIlE MOUTH 8.21.1 Interior The mouth or oral cavity is a space bounded by the lips anteriorly, the cheeks or buccae laterally, the palate above and by the muscular floor of the oral cavity below. The oral cavity communicates with the outside through the opening between the lips. Behind, it communicates with the pharynx through the fauces. The cavity is divided by the horse-shoe-shaped dental arch into a vestibule and the oral cavity proper (Fig. S.72). The vestibule of the mouth is the slit-like space between the lips and cheeks on the one hand, and the teeth and gums on the other. When examining this area, bear in mind that many cadavers will be of older individuals who may have lost some or all of their teeth in life. Pull the lips away and note the gingivae or gums which cover the alveolar processes of the maxilla and mandible. The sulcus between the lips and the gums is bridged in the midline by folds of the mucous membrane - the upper and lower frenula ifraenum, L = bridge). The lips are composed of muscle and glandular tissue and are covered on the outside by skin and on the inside by mucous membrane. The lateral boundary of the oral vestibule is the cheek which is formed by the buccinator muscle, covered by mucous membrane on the inside. The posterior boundary of the cheek is marked by an elevated fold produced by the underlying pterygomandibular raphe which runs from the pterygoid hamulus above to the posterior end of the mylohyoid ridge below. Feel the inner aspect of the cheek opposite the second upper molar and find a small elevation of the mucous membrane, called the parotid papilla, which is the opening of the parotid duct into the oral vestibule. Within the cheek, feel for a rounded structure covered by a thin capsule which lies between the buccinator and masseter muscles. This is called the buccal pad of fat. It is oflarge size in infants and decreases in size with age. Examine the teeth. Beginning anteriorly, there are two incisors, a canine, two premolars and three molars on each side, above and below. The crown of the tooth is the part that projects from the gingiva (gum) to occlude with one or more teeth of the opposite jaw. The neck of the tooth lies between the crown and the root, which is housed in the alveolus. 284 Practical Anatomy elevation surrounded by a circular trench. On the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, note the transverse or vertical folds, called foliate papillae, situated on each side of the tongue just anterior to the palatoglossal arch. Note also the transverse rows of papillae which tend to run parallel to the sulcus terminalis - the conical papillae and red, fungiform papillae, low and broad, over the tip and sides of the tongue. Finally, identifY the filiform papillae, minute and tasselated, covering the presulcal part and giving it a velvety appearance. N ow lift the tip of the tongue, in the cadaver or in a living person, and note the structures beneath it (Fig. 8.74). L ____________________________________________ sublingual caruncle FIGURE 8.74 INFERIOR SURFACE OF THE TONGUE In the midline identifY the frenulum linguae, a fold of mucosa connecting the tongue to the floor of the mouth. The elongated elevation of the sublingual salivary gland on each side of the frenulum has been identified. Medial to these, find the orifice of the submandibular duct, visible on a raised papilla, the sublingual caruncle. Also find the deep lingual artery and vein parallel to the midline, lateral to which is the plica fimbriata, running towards the apex of the tongue (plicare, L = to fold; fimbria, L = fringe). 8.22 TIlE TONGUE To visualise the inner workings of the tongue, ask a person to show his or her tongue, to move it in all directions, and also to try and roll it into a tube (inability to do this is an inherited trait). Make a midline incision along the full length of the cadaver tongue. When the two halves are separated it is evident that the anterior two-thirds consists of the radiating fibres of genioglossus which run from the superior mental spine of the mandible into the substance of the tongue, in a fan shape. Some of its lowest fibres attach into the body of the hyoid bone. Now make a transverse section of the tongue, about 4-5 em from its tip to reach the loop of the lingual artery. Dissect the artery downwards and backwards and note the plane of cleavage between hyoglossus superficially and genioglossus on a deeper plane. In the superficial half of each section are the fine, and ill-defined fibres of the intrinsic muscles of the tongue. Trace the lingual artery back behind the origin of its sublingual branch and note that its plane of entry into the tongue is between hyoglossus and the middle constrictor muscle. By contrast, the hypoglossal nerve has as its plane of entry the space between mylohyoid and hyoglossus (Fig. 8.75). Follow the lingual artery back to its origin from the external carotid artery. The hyoglossus muscle is the key muscle to the area beneath the tongue, called the suprahyoid region. Define the superficial relations of hyoglossus. The hypoglossal nerve crosses the lower part and the tiny suprahyoid branch of the lingual artery does likewise (Figs 8.75 and 8.76). The Head and Neck 285 In front of hyoglossus, the geniohyoid muscle passes from the lower tubercle of the mental spine to the hyoid bone; filling the angle between it and the hyoglossus is the genioglossus muscle (Fig. 8.76). stylohyoid i, posterior belly of digastric i , !:::::: SUbman: dibular ganglion lingual nerve !::: : deep part of submandibular gland i : lingual artery (4th part) : : middle constrictor: i lingual artery (1 st part) i suprahyoid branch i hypoglossal nerve, FIGURE 8.75 SUPERFICIAL RELATIONS OF HYOGLOSSUS styloglossus! stylohyoid ligament stylopharyngeus -------------- glossopharyngeal nerve IX -------------- lingual artery (1 st part) 1 middle constrictor i hyoglossus FIGURE 8.76 EXTRINSIC MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE hyoglossus i submandibular duct i anterior belly of digastric sublingual gland i lingual artery (3rd part) i geniohyoid Behind the hyoglossus is the middle constrictor (Fig. 8.75). Above the hyoglossus, identify styloglossus. Stylohyoid and the posterior belly of the digastric are superior to the deeper half of the hyoglossus (Fig. 8.75), while the mylohyoid muscle lies in front of its more superficial part. The deep part of the submandibular gland lies on the hyoglossus. Between gland and muscle is the The Head and Neck 287 The uvula itself is made up of the musculus uvulae. The muscles of the soft palate all develop from the fourth pharyngeal arch. The sensory nerve supply to the soft palate is from palatine branches of the maxillary nerve and also from the glossopharyngeal nerve eN IX. Tensor veli palatini has its motor supply from the mandibular eN Viii and the other muscles have theirs from the accessory nerve eN XI. In front of the hamulus find the depression of the greater palatine foramen and dissect its emergent nerve and vessels. 8.24 OROPHARYNX The visceral tubes of the neck - pharynx, larynx, oesophagus and trachea - have already been dissected. Briefly review the positions and attachments of the following: 1. Styloglossus. 8. Palatopharyngeus 2. Stylopharyngeus. 9. Facial artery. 3. Stylohyoid. 10. Superior thyroid artery. 4.

Between the oral and nasal cavities hangs the mobile soft palate. Behind the three cavities are the nasal, oral and laryngeal parts of the pharynx. The nasal part of the pharynx is wide and lies behind the nasal cavity and above the soft palate. In the cadaver, probe behind and above the soft palate with a finger to feel the choanae (choane, G = funnel). There are two, one on either side of the nasal septum which is formed behind by the vomer (vomere, L = vomit). To visualise this region, check on a prepared skull for the following; each choana is an The Head and Neck 291 Unlike the upper jaw, lower teeth and gingivae have different sensory supplies. The dentist who wishes to fill a lower tooth will administer a block injection into the inferior alveolar nerve before it enters the mandibular canal. However, for an extraction of a tooth, the gingivae also need to be anaesthetised. These are supplied by the buccal nerve from the anterior division of the mandibular (eN Viii). 8.26 INFRATEMPORAL FOSSA The infratemporal fossa is a hypothetical region which lies at the base of the skull, between the ramus of the mandible and the pharynx. On a prepared skull, look for its lateral wall, the ramus of the mandible. The front wall is the back of the maxilla which ends below in the maxillary tuberosity. The posterior wall is more difficult to visualise - it is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone and the styloid process. The roof or superior surface is formed by the greater wing of the sphenoid and the squamous temporal bone. Find the foramen ovale and foramen spino sum in this area. The infratemporal fossa has a medial wall made up of bones and muscle - the lateral pterygoid plate and the muscles of the upper pharynx (tensor palati, levator palati and superior constrictor). Having defined its boundaries, briefly look at its communications: • infront it communicates with the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure • above with the temporal fossa through the gap bounded by the zygomatic arch • medially with the pterygomaxillary fossa through the pterygopalatine (-maxillary) fissure • above with the cranial cavity through foramina ovale and spino sum in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. Finally, look at the pterygoid plates. Note the pterygoid fossa between the medial and lateral pterygoid plates (pteryx, G = wing). Both plates are part of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid and hang down like the legs of a bird in flight. At the base of the medial pterygoid plate, find the scaphoid fossa (skafe, G = boat-shaped) whence originates the tensor palati muscle. Infection of the infratemporal fossa may arise through extension from a wisdom tooth infection and is often difficult to diagnose. Although there is no evidence of facial swelling, the patient will experience severe pain, dysphagia and trismus. Begin dissecting the infratemporal fossa by passing the handle of a scalpel beneath the zygomatic arch and cutting through it at its anterior and posterior roots with a saw blade. Remove the arch and clear the remnants of masseter and fat beneath it. Cut vertically through the coronoid process. Grasp the fragment of coronoid process in a strong forceps and reflect the temporalis muscle upwards. Remove the pad of fat overlying the anterior border of temporalis. Note two planes of cleavage here: • between the fleshy anterior part of temporalis and the posterior surface of the maxilla and • between the deep surface of temporalis and the superior surface of the lateral pterygoid muscle. It is in this latter plane of cleavage that the maxillary artery is found, where it ascends a fingerwidth in front of the temporomandibular joint. Think of the maxillary artery as the key to this area and keep it in mind as the dissection proceeds more deeply (Fig. 8.83). The infratemporal fossa is of considerable clinical significance because of its involvement in abscess formation and the spread of infection. It also contains a number of structures of clinical importance: The Head and Neck 293 meningeal branch and the inferior alveolar artery (Fig. 8.85). The middle meningeal artery ascends between the lateral pterygoid muscle and sphenomandibular ligament. Near the skull it is embraced by the two roots of the auriculotemporal nerve before it enters the skull through foramen spinosum. The inferior alveolar artery descends posterior to the inferior alveolar nerve between the ramus and the sphenomandibular ligament, to enter the mandibular foramen. Just before entering the foramen it gives off the mylohyoid branch. In the mandibular canal it gives branches to the mandible and the roots of the lower teeth. It ends by branching into a mental branch, which emerges on to the face through the mental foramen, and a branch to the front teeth, which anastomoses with that of the opposite side. The second (or pterygoid) part is that portion of the maxillary artery which crosses the lateral pterygoid muscle. Note that it runs forwards and upwards (Fig. 8.84), superficial or deep to the lateral pterygoid, and medial to the coronoid process of the mandible. It passes into the cleft between the two heads of the lateral pterygoid muscle. Find its muscular and buccal branches. The buccal artery accompanies the buccal nerve to supply the buccinator muscle and the skin and mucosa of the cheek. 1 st part of maxillary artery ! 2nd part of maxillary artery external carotid artery ..... pterygomaxillary fissure FIGURE 8.83 COURSE OF THE MAXILLARY ARTERY superficial temporary artery ! middle meningeal artery ................... __ \"'\" .. ..\".,.,.....,:\\ .... ,<. ..... -1 .......... deep temporal .... buccal branch .... inferior alveolar artery FIGURE 8.84 MAIN BRANCHES OF THE MAXILLARY ARTERY The third (or pterygopalatine) part of the maxillary artery is the portion beyond the lateral pterygoid muscle. It passes deeply through the pterygomaxillary fissure to enter the pterygopalatine fossa. Though these branches cannot be seen at present, their anatomy should be considered as follows: 294 Practical Anatomy • The posterior superior alveolar artery descends on the back of the maxilla, where its dental branches enter through the alveolar foramina to supply the posterior teeth and gums. • The infraorbital artery traverses the infraorbital fissure to reach the orbit. It runs forwards with the infraorbital nerve in the infraorbital sulcus and canal and emerges on the face through the infraorbital foramen. Whilst in the floor of the sulcus, it gives off anterior superior alveolar arteries to the canine and incisor teeth. • The descending palatine artery descends in the greater palatine canal and divides into the greater and lesser palatine arteries which emerge through the corresponding foramina on the hard palate. 8.26.4 Nerves of the Infratemporal Region Examine the lateral pterygoid muscle. It passes backwards and slightly laterally, along the roof of the infratemporal fossa, to be attached to the neck of the mandible and to the articular disc. Find the pterygoid venous plexus which obscures the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid muscle. The plexus drains into the maxillary vein, which ends by uniting with the superficial temporal vein to form the retromandibular vein . It also has connections to the cavernous sinus. Remove the pterygoid venous plexus to find the branches of the mandibular nerve which will be found at both the upper and lower borders of the lateral pterygoid muscle (Fig. 8.85). The mandibular division of the trigem.inal nerve (V) ~nters the infratemporal fossa through the foramen ovale and contains both motor and sensory neurons. IdentifY four branches of the mandibular nerve (Fig 8.85). • The masseteric nerve which appears between the upper border of the lateral pterygoid muscle and the zygomatic arch where it traverses the mandibular notch (between the coronoid and condylar processes) to enter masseter. • The deep temporal nerves which appear deep to the zygoma and above the lateral pterygoid muscle to enter the temporalis muscle. • The lingual nerve which appears from the lower border of the lateral pterygoid and descends towards the back of the last lower molar. • The inferior alveolar nerve which appears behind the lingual nerve. It descends on the superficial surface of the medial pterygoid muscle and the sphenomandibular ligament to enter the mandibular canal. auriculotemporal n. ........ . ............ masseteric n . ....... lateral pterygoid .......... lingual n. inferior alveolar n. medial pterygoid FIGURE 8.85 MANDIBULAR NERVE AND PTERYGOID MUSCLES The Head and Neck 299 gland (Fig. 8.91).

The pocket between the lid and the eyeball is called the lower conjunctival fornix. There is a similar fornix under the upper eyelid (Fig. 8.96). 302 Practical Anatomy orbicularis oculi (orbital plane) orbicularis oculi (palperal part) ---------- superior tarsus .-' conjunctiva ..... superior conjunctival fornix orbital septum inferior tarsus ----.. -----------. orbital septum ----------------------- FIGURE 8.96 SAGITTAL SECTION THROUGH THE EYELIDS frontal bone : superficial lamina of aponeurosis : of levator palpebrae superioris i : deep lamina of aponeurosis of levator I : D : palebrae superioris .0:\" \\: ': ~~\": , levator palpebrae superioris \"~:- o~O:;,=·'c:. .. ----==-i~ While holding the lower eyelid away from the eyeball, inspect (with a handlens if necessary) the inner edge of the lid to find a row of small openings of the ducts of the tarsal glands.

Elevate it completely by separating it from the surrounding structures but noting the various nerves as they emerge through the muscle. These are: • lacrimal (eN Vi), infratrochlear (eN Vi), supratrochlear (eN Vi), supraorbital (eN Vi); • zygomaticofacial (eN Vii), infraorbital (eN Vii). The Head and Neck 303 Remove the muscle to expose, deep to it, the fibrous orbital septum, which is attached to the orbital margin and to the anterior surface of the tarsal plates. The tarsal plates are plaques of dense fibrous tissue within the eyelids. Make a transverse incision through the fascia in the middle of the eyelids and peel the fascia upwards and downwards to expose the tarsal plates while taking note of the aponeurosis of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle in the upper eyelid (Fig. 8.96). Note that the aponeurosis has two laminae, the deep attaching to the upper edge of the tarsal plate while the superficial perforates the orbital septum to insert into the skin of the eyelid. The tarsi (tarsal plates) are lined directly by conjunctiva and are held together by the medial and lateral palpebral ligaments which are attached to the orbital margin (Fig. 8.97). Note also that the lacrimal sac lies behind the medial ligament but in front of the orbital septum. Strictly, it is not within the orbital cavity, as the orbital septum may be regarded as the anterior limit of the orbit. 8.27.1 Lacrimal Gland In the upper outer margin of the orbit, find the palpebral part of the lacrimal gland, lying superficial to the orbital septum. Follow the gland through the septum to find the larger orbital part. The excretory ducts of the gland empty into the lateral part of the superior conjunctival fornix. The gland is supplied by the lacrimal branch of the ophthalmic artery and is driven by the greater petrosal branch of the nervus intermedius (eN VII). 8.27.2 Lacrimal Sac Identity the medial palpebral ligament and follow it to its bony attachment to the lacrimal crest and frontal process of maxilla. Detach the ligament from the bone and, turning it laterally, expose the lacrimal sac. Open the sac with scissors and pass a probe downwards along the nasolacrimal duct until it appears under the inferior concha of the nose. Note that the lacrimal ducts originate at the puncta of the eyelids, form an ampulla and then proceed medially to the sac. ,/ tear duct ,/,/,/ -' lacrimal sac ~~~~\"\" .. \"\" .... ~~~~iii •• ~--------medial palpebral ligament \"\"\"\" '\"'----; 11\\\\·\\\\\\\"- / ' / ampulla - - -- ---------- nasolacrimal duct papilla and punctum - ----- inferior concha FIGURE 8.98 LACRIMAL APPARATUS Tears secreted by the lacrimal gland are washed over the cornea by movement of the eyelids. The tears are normally collected into the puncta and pass to the lacrimal sac from where they are conveyed to the nose. When crying occurs, the volume of tears produced is too great to be drained away naturally, and they overflow on to the cheeks. 304 Practical Anatomy 8.27.3 Movement of the Eyelids The eyelids, mainly the upper, are responsible for opening the palpebral fissure. The lower eyelid does not possess an 'opener' muscle. The upper lid is activated by the levator palpebrae superioris muscle which is composed of two laminae: • superficial lamina : is composed of voluntary (striated) muscle and arises from the orbital roof, just anterior to the optic canal. It attaches mainly by an aponeurosis to the upper surface of the tarsal plate but some of the fibres attach to the skin of the eyelid (Fig. 8.96). This part of the muscle is supplied by the oculomotor nerve (eN III) . • deep lamina (of Muller*): arises with the superficial lamina and is inserted into the upper edge of the tarsal plate. It is involuntary (smooth muscle) in nature and is supplied, therefore, by sympathetic fibres from the plexus around the ophthalmic artery. Damage to the cervical sympathetic system results in weakness or paralysis of the involuntary component of this muscle, resulting in 'ptosis' (drooping) of the eyelid. In the cadaver, identifY, isolate and detach the aponeurosis oflevator palpebrae from the tarsal plate. With scissors, cut the orbital septum around the orbital margin and remove the septum and eyelids, to expose the eyeball, leaving behind the levator palpebrae and such nerves as persist. The embalming process often causes the human eyeballs to shrink making them less than suitable for dissection and study. However, a good idea of the structure of the eyeball may be obtained from a study of a fresh or embalmed ox eye. It is advisable to obtain at least two or three, for study. 8.27.4 Dissection of the Ox Eye Begin at the edge of the cornea (the transparent part) and with scissors snip through the circular attachment of the tough bulbar fascia. Proceed backwards, removing fascia, fat and muscles until the optic nerve is reached. About halfway between the front and back of the eyeball, note the presence of the venae vorticosae lying on the surface of the eyeball at the quadrants. In the region of the optic nerve, the short ciliary nerves and vessels enter the eyeball through minute openings in the sclera. This region is the lamina cribrosa and, here also, the axons of the optic nerve find exit from the eyeball. Hold the ox eye firmly on a cork dissecting board and with a sharp knife, divide the eyeball into halves, through the centre of the cornea and the stump of the optic nerve (Fig. 8.99). Examine the hemisection of the eyeball beginning with the cut edge. Note that the cornea is transparent while the part behind the cornea is opaque. Study this part with a handlens and note the following features: • an outer fibrous layer of sclera to which the fascia and muscles were attached; • an intermediate coat of pigmented choroid which, when followed forwards, forms the ciliary body and iris; • an inner gray layer of retina which is often not firmly attached to the choroid and may float away. In the anterior part, note the transparent lens which divides the eyeball into anterior and posterior spaces (Fig. 8.100). * Muller, Heinrich (1820-1864), German anatomist. lens iris cornea: iridocorneal angle i i The Head and Neck 305 ,,! posterior chamber ' 1/ suspensory ligament of lens macula sinus venosus sclerae (Schlemm) conjunctiva __________ ciliary muscle ------------ ciliary processes ------- ora serrata -;------------ sclera ---------- choroid -------- retina vitreous chamber optic nerve disc optic nerve FIGURE 8.99 HORIZONTAL SECTION OF THE EYEBALL !: posterior chamber i anterior chamber : anterior space : posterior space iris diaphragm FIGURE 8.100 DIVISONS OF THE EYEBALL Examine the anterior surface of the lens with a handlens and note the presence of the pigmented iris diaphragm. Now it is possible to see that the anterior space may be divided into anterior and posterior chambers which communicate with one another through the central opening of the iris - the pupil (Fig. 8.99). The large space behind the lens contains the vitreous humour, a colourless jelly surrounded by a thin membrane, the vitreous membrane. The chambers in front of the lens contain a colourless fluid called aqueous humour. Take a second eyeball and cut it transversely through the equator (halfway between front and back). Study the posterior half noting the position of the optic disc, where the fibres of the retina congregate before leaving the eyeball and, a little to the lateral side, the macula. In a good light observe the interior of the anterior half of the eyeball. Note that the lens overlies the pupil which may be seen as an elliptical opening by looking at a light through the lens.

It contains both somatic and autonomic components. The somatic nerves are derived from the ophthalmic nerve (CN Vi). They pass through the ganglion to enter the eyeball as the short ciliary nerves, to supply common sensation to the eyeball but especially to the cornea. The autonomic component contains both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibres. The sympathetic fibres originate in the superior cervical ganglion and supply the blood vessels of the eyeball and the dilator pupillae muscle. The parasympathetic fibres originate in the Edinger- Westphal nucleus of the midbrain; they synapse in the ganglion and supply the ciliary muscle and the sphincter pupillae. 8.28 AUDITORY APPARATUS This organ of hearing and equilibrium may be considered as having external, middle and inner components. The external ear consists of the auricle and the external auditory meatus (canal) leading from the concha to the tympanic membrane. The middle ear (tympanic cavity) resides in the petrous part of the temporal bone, to the lateral side of the inner ear. The inner ear or labyrinth is also in the petrous bone and consists of an elaborate series of canals and cavities within the bone - the osseous labyrinth. Within the osseous excavations, is suspended the membranous labyrinth. The inner ear has two components, the vestibular apparatus and the cochlea (hearing organ). Although these are intimately connected, they subserve different functions. A proper dissection of the middle and inner ear components is not only difficult and time- consuming but requires special instruments and considerable skill. The account which follows will, therefore, be descriptive and elementary. 8.28.1 The External Ear Examine an external ear of a living subject and of the cadaver. It consists of flexible elastic cartilage covered with skin and has the general features displayed in Fig. 8.108. As in lower animals, the human ear may be moved by muscles, the anterior, superior and posterior auricular muscles which are supplied by the facial nerve (CN Vii). The skin of the auricle is supplied by the auriculo- temporal nerve (CN Viii), the great auricular (C 2,3) and the lesser occipital nerves (C 2). An additional nerve from the superior ganglion of the vagus nerve supplies part of the external auditory canal but is thought to end in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, an idea which would conform more to the embryonic development of the auricle. scaphoid fossa -------------... antitragus ................ -------- FIGURE 8.108 GENERAL FEATURES OF THE EXTERNAL EAR 312 Practical Anatomy The deepest part of the auricle is the concha where the external auditory meatus takes origin. It is an osseo-cartilaginous tube, the outer one-third being cartilaginous and the inner two-thirds, bony. This tube is continuous with the cartilage of the auricle and is covered with skin containing hair follicles, sebaceous and ceruminous (wax) glands. The meatus is curved slightly forwards and downwards (Fig. 8.109) and may be straightened by pulling the auricle upwards and backwards. This manoeuvre is essential before inserting an auroscope. --- ------------------ ear drum external auditory canal----------------- FIGURE 8.109 SHAPE OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITORY CANAL The meatus ends at the tympanic membrane (ear drum) which consists of a core of connective tissue covered on the outer surface by skin and on the inner side by mucous membrane. In terms of its embryonic development, it is supplied on the outside mostly by the auriculotemporal branch of the mandibular nerve (eN Viii) and on the inside by the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (eN IX). The membrane is translucent and set at an angle so that its lower edge of attachment to the bone is more medial than the upper attachment. The handle of the malleus is attached to its medial collagenous surface and the chorda tympani (taste) nerve passes along its inner surface. The reason for this peculiar arrangement is evident from the embryonic development of the ear and the anterior two-thirds of the tongue (Fig. 8.110). Since the trigeminal nerve has no taste component, taste fibres for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue must be obtained from a pretrematic branch from the nerve of the next pharyngeal arch, namely, the facial nerve (eN VII). The only connecting link between the first and second pharyngeal arches is the tympanic membrane (Fig. 8.111) and the nerve must necessarily pass through this bridge. The nerve passes obliquely from above downwards, to leave via the petrotympanic fissure. In making an incision in the ear drum to allow the escape of pus in middle ear disease, the position of the incision is critical otherwise the chorda tympani is severed, resulting in loss of taste in the area of supply. FIGURE 8.110 NECESSARY COURSE OF CHORDA TYMPANI FROM PHARYNGEAL ARCH II TO ARCH I The Head and Neck 313 ------------------------------ head of malleus --------------------- handle of malleus --------------------- ear drum ------------------- course of chorda tympani p A ---------------------- cone of light position of incision FIGURE 8.111 FEATURES OF THE EAR DRUM AND COURSE OF CHORDA TYMPANI IN THE EAR DRUM The ear drum is oval in shape and has an area of about 70 sq.mm. At the end of the attachment of the handle of the malleus there is a small dimple in the membrane - the umbo. Below and anterior, the normal drum exhibits a cone of light, when viewed with an auroscope. This area oflight indicates the normal position of the drum and is due to the reflection of light. If the drum is blown out or sucked inwards the cone of light disappears, indicating an abnormal position of the drum. 8.28.2 The Middle Ear If the ear drum is removed, the cavity of the middle ear is entered. This cavity is irregular and of peculiar shape and to simplifY its study it is best regarded as a box (Fig. 8.112) within the petrous part of the temporal bone. fenestra vestibuli i : ridge produced by facial nerve ridge produced by lateral semicircular ......... -.... ----- canal auditus ad __________________ _ antrum mastoid antrum ------------------- pyramid ---------------f£.·'-\\'\"-,·,f-· mastoid air cells .------------ mastoid process ----------- ------------------ temporal lobe of brain i7ffi)~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .. --------... --------- tegmen tympani frill of remains of ear drum ___ ._1>1_ .• _ ••. _._. _________ • ____ semicanal for tensor tympany ----·kl-----· ------------------ medial wall of box ------ internal carotid artery ------ pharyngotympanic tube -'-.-.. petrotympanic fissure promontory \" o --i-------- internal jugular vein stylomastoid foramen FIGURE 8.112 BOX-UKE ARRANGEMENT OF THE MIDDLE EAR crus ... commune FIGURE 8.117 UTRICLE AND SEMICIRCULAR CANALS osseous canal membranous canal ampulla The Head and Neck 317 FIGURE 8.118 RELATIONSHIP OF THE LEFT AND RIGHT SEMICIRCULAR CANALS Note the relationship between the canals in the right and left temporal bones where the left anterior is parallel to the right posterior and vice versa. Each canal has an ampulla at one end which contains a group of ampullary hair cells. These act as mechanoreceptors and respond to the movement of the endolymph when the position of the head changes (Fig. 8.119). The utricle also has a thickened plaque of neuroepithelial hair cells (the macula) covered with a gelatinous material in which are embedded crystals of calcium carbonate. These cells are known as the otolith organ and respond to the effects of gravity (Fig. 8.120). FIGURE 8.119 AMPULIARY HAIR CEllS FIGURE 8.120 OTOLITH ORGAN IN THE WAll OF THE UTRICLE AND SACCULE Both the ampullary hair cells and the cells of the otolith organ are the sensory receptors for cells situated in the vestibular ganglion which resides in the internal auditory meatus. The cochlear system lies between the middle ear cavity and the semicircular canals. It consists of a complex set of tubes coiled into a spiral. An understanding of its construction may be obtained by imagining it to be unwound into straight tubes. The one tube, doubled over in the middle, forms the scala vestibuli and scala tympani, the bend being called the helicotrema (Fig. 8.121A). A second tube, the scala media or cochlear duct, fits between the two portions of the original duct (Fig. 8.121B), the cross section resembling 320 Practical Anatomy 8.29 NOSE, NASAL CAVITIES AND PARANASAL SINUSES The nose, which contains the olfactory apparatus, and into which the paranasal sinuses open, may conveniently be divided into: • the external nose, a protuberance on the face, which varies greatly in size and shape from individual to individual • the nasal cavities, separated from one another by the nasal septum Examine a prepared skull and note the large pyriform aperture leading into the nasal cavities. The aperture is bounded above by the nasal bones which end superiorly in a depression at the frontonasal suture. The depression is called nasion. The sides are formed by the maxillae which join below forming the nasal spine and the anterior part of the palate. Look into the pyriform aperture to see the vertical bony nasal septum formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone above and the vomer bone below. Anteriorly, there is a deficiency in the septum and this normally contains a plate of cartilage which completes the septum (Fig. 8.126). Follow the base of one of the cavities posteriorly to discover that it opens into the nasopharynx through a large opening called the choana. i perpendicular plate of ethmoid septal cartilage ..... o major alar cartilage ..... . vomer FIGURE 8.126 EXTENT OF NASAL SEPTUM Using a flashlight, study the lateral wall of the nasal cavity. Note the large inferior bony projection - the inferior concha - and a slightly smaller middle concha above. Each concha covers a hollow called a meatus. If the middle concha is broken away, it is evident that in the middle meatus there is a curved cleft, the hiatus semilunaris, containing a bulge of bone, the bulla ethmoidalis. Because the nasal cavity narrows from below up, it is seldom possible to see the superior concha or the spheno-ethmoidal recess, the uppermost posterior corner of the cavity. Occasionally, there is a very small ridge of bone above the superior concha called the concha suprema or the highest nasal concha. The supreme, superior and middle conchae are parts of the ethmoid bone but the inferior concha is an independent bone articulating with the maxilla and the palatine bone. The opening of the pharyngotympanic tube (of Eustachio) is about 1 cm posterior to the end of the inferior concha (Fig. 8.127). Examine the external nose of the cadaver and note that the upper bony part (the bridge of the nose) is hard, fixed and immobile, while the lower part is soft and flexible. The flexibility is due to the presence of a cartilaginous skeleton supporting that part of the nose (Fig. 8.128 A & B). The cartilages are attached to the periosteum of the pyriform aperture and are joined in the middle by the cartilaginous septum. 322 Practical Anatomy From the study of the skull and the cadaver, it is apparent that the nasal cavity has boundaries: • The floor: upper surface of the palatine process of the maxilla (anterior 3/ 4) and the horizontal plate of the palatine bone (posterior 1/ 4); • The lateral wall: nasal and lacrimal bones, nasal surface of maxilla, alar and lateral cartilages (anteriorly); the superior, middle and inferior conchae (slightly posteriorly); • The roof cribriform plate, nasal spine of frontal bone, nasal bone (anteriorly), anterior surface of body of sphenoid (posteriorly); • The medial wall: nasal septum consisting of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, the vomer and the septal cartilage (Fig. 8.126). 8.29.1 Arterial Supply of Nasal Cavity It is supplied by three arteries: • anterior and posterior ethmoidal branches from the ophthalmic artery, entering from the orbit to supply lateral wall and septum; • sphenopalatine branch from the maxillary artery entering the cavity through the posteriorly placed sphenopalatine foramen to supply the lateral wall and the septum; • nasal branch of the greater palatine artery, reaching the cavity through the incisive foramen to supply the floor and the septum after forming an anastomosis with the sphenopalatine artery. 8.29.2 Venous Drainage of Nasal Cavity The veins of the nose form a vast submucous plexus especially over the middle and inferior conchae and the lower part of the septum. The veins generally follow the arteries but also have connections with the ophthalmic and facial veins as well as with the intracranial veins via the cribriform plate and foramen caecum which contains an emissary vein. 8.29.3 Lymphatic Drainage of Nasal Cavity Lymphatics from the external nose and anterior part of the cavity drain to the submandibular nodes while the posterior part of the cavity drains to the upper deep cervical nodes. 8.29.4 Paranasal Sinuses The nasal cavities are almost completely surrounded by paranasal sinuses which may be regarded as diverticula of the cavities. Because of the proximity of the orbits to the nasal cavities, the sinuses are also relations of the orbits. The sinuses are rudimentary in infancy and develop as the skull grows and the teeth erupt. Their presence has given rise to two common theories of function: • to lighten the weight of the skull • to provide resonance for the voice. However plausible these theories may appear to be, it is questionable if either is true. The sinuses are, however, of considerable clinical importance since infection in them is a common occurrence. They are lined by mucous membrane similar to that of the nasal cavity. The cells of the lining possess cilia especially near the openings and the cilia facilitate emptying of the cavities. The sinuses occur in specific places in the skull and are: • Frontal sinuses: cavities of variable size in the diploe of the frontal bone; they drain into the anterior part of the hiatus semilunaris in the middle meatus (Fig. 8.130). • Ethmoid sinuses: consist of a series of thin-walled cells, the anterior, middle and posterior Chapter Nine Central Nervous System In former times, it was possible for the Department of Anatomy to supply each pair of students with one whole brain and one hemi-sectioned brain. An abundance of neuro-anatomical material was available from the Department of Pathology in which numerous autopsy examinations were performed. With the passage of time, it seems that physicians have become more astute and have either cured their patients or have sent them home to save hospital beds. This has resulted in fewer and fewer autopsies being performed and this, in tum, has resulted in a serious reduction in the supply of neuro-anatomical material to the Department of Anatomy such that it has become almost impossible to supply students with the quality or quantity of material provided previously. More and more, the Department has been forced to use the brains removed from dissection cadavers and these are almost invariably damaged because of the difficulty in removing a fixed and hardened brain from the restricted cranial cavity. 9.1 TIlE OBJECTIVES The dissection system presented here has been devised with three objectives in view: • to complete the whole dissection, seeing and studying everything, in one brain and spinal cord; • to display the numerous 'hidden' features which are frequently missed by traditional methods; • to make use of the embryology of the central nervous system in understanding structure and function. Sometimes a student will be presented with a brain which has already been removed from the cadaver. At other times it might be necessary for the student to remove the brain. In the fresh cadaver this is a relatively simple procedure as the brain is soft and flexible and easily shifted from side to side to give access to deep structures which must be divided before the brain can be removed. In the embalmed cadaver, removal of the brain can be a difficult procedure as the brain has been hardened by fixation and can be shifted only with difficulty. Forcible movement will damage the fragile organ. It is advisable before attempting to remove the brain, whether it is fresh or embalmed, to understand: Central Nervous System 325 • the basic structure of the Central Nervous System (CNS) and its membranous surroundings and • the cranial cavity and vertebral column which houses the brain and spinal cord. 9.2 STRUCTURE OF TIlE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord. The brain is housed within the cranial cavity of the skull while the spinal cord is housed within the vertebral canal of the vertebral column. Both brain and spinal cord are covered by membranes (meninges) and by fluid (cerebrospinal fluid - CSF). The details of these structures will be studied later. Consider the brain first. Fundamentally, it consists of three parts - the cerebrum (forebrain or large brain), the cerebellum (hindbrain or small brain) and the brainstem, consisting of the midbrain, pons and medulla oblongata, which joins the cerebellum to the cerebrum. All three parts are situated in the cranial cavity but the cerebrum and cerebellum are separated from one another by a strong membrane, the tentorium cerebelli, which is shaped somewhat like a 'tent' (Fig. 9.1A). Since the cerebrum and cerebellum are separated from one another and the brainstem joins them, it follows that the tentorium cerebelli must have an aperture in it to allow the brainstem to connect the parts above and below the tentorium (Fig. 9 .1B). In addition, the cerebrum and cerebellum are divided into right and left hemispheres by deep clefts, the cleft between the cerebral hemispheres being on it upper surface and the cleft between the cerebellar hemispheres being on its under surface. The cleft between the cerebral hemispheres is called the sagittal fissure and is occupied by a strong membrane of dura mater called the falx cerebri while the cleft between the cerebellar hemispheres is called the vallecula cerebelli and is occupied by the falx cerebelli (Fig. 9.1 C) . : sagittal fissure A i vallecula cerebelli FIGURE 9.1 (A) SHAPE OF THE TENTORIUM CEREBEU1j (B) TENTORIAL NOTCH (NOTE THE FALX CEREBELLI) (C) POSTERIOR VIEW OF CEREBRUM AND CEREBELLUM INDICATING FISSURES Examine the calotte of a prepared (dried) skull. Study the outer surface of the calotte first and note the coronal suture (from side to side), the sagittal suture (front to back) and the lambdoid suture at the back (forming an inverted V). These sutures are immovable joints and demarcate the bones forming the calotte. Occasionally, there is a suture in the centre of the frontal bone (metopic suture) (Fig. 9.2A). In the parietal bones and in the mastoid regions there are usually one or more holes called the parietal emissary and mastoid emissary foramina. These contain veins which connect the inner veins of the cranial cavity with the outer veins of the scalp. When the pressure in the cranial cavity (a rigid box) rises, the blood escapes through the emissary veins to the exterior to relieve the pressure. Turn the calotte over to view its interior. Note firstly that the cut edge of the calotte has inside and outside layers of compact bone (the inner and outer tables) between which is a layer of 326 Practical Anatomy cancellous bone - the diploe - which contains the bone marrow of the skull. In a young skull the suture lines are visible on the inside and outside whereas in an old skull the sutures may be obliterated to varying degrees. There is usually a ridge running from front to back indicating the position of the superior sagittal venous sinus (Fig. 9 .2B). In addition, there are well-marked grooves on the inside of the calotte, produced by the middle meningeal artery and its branches. In the foetal skull, the fontanelles overlie the superior sagittal sinus.

Further back are the anterior ethmoidal foramina followed by the cribriform plate, transmitting the olfactory nerves, and then the posterior ethmoidal foramina, transmitting the posterior ethmoidal nerves and vessels. Crossing the jugum sphenoidale, come to the anterior clinoid processes, medial to which are the optic canals carrying the optic nerves (CN II) and the ophthalmic arteries. Look into the orbit from the front and identify the canals in the upper medial reaches of the back of the orbit (Fig. 9.5). At the same time, note the presence of the superior orbital fissures just lateral to the optic canals. Now, on the inside of the skull, look under the lesser wings of the sphenoid and discover that the fissures can only be seen from behind by tilting the front of the skull downwards. / .......... optic canal FIGURE 9.5 POSITION OF OPTIC CANAL AND SUPERIOR ORBITAL FISSURE IN THE ORBIT The superior orbital fissures are large, and therefore contain a number of structures, namely the nerves driving the extrinsic ocular muscles: • the oculomotor nerve (CN III), the trochlear nerve (CN IV), and the abducent nerve (CN VI); • the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN Vi), the sensory nerve to the orbit and forehead; • the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins, going from the face to the cavernous sinus. A short distance behind the fissure on each side, is a round opening - the foramen rotundum which carries the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (CN Vii). A short distance behind the round opening is a large oval opening, the foramen ovale which carries the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN Viii). From this it follows that the trigeminal nerve (triplet) has three divisions and these are sometimes referred to as the ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular nerves. The oval opening has a small round opening lateral to it and a large opening medial to it (Fig. 9.3). Both of these carry arteries; the lateral is the foramen spinosum (because underneath it is related to the spine of the sphenoid bone) and contains the middle meningeal artery and the nervus spinosum while the medial opening carries the internal carotid artery. This opening is sometimes referred to as theforamen lacerum Gagged foramen) but it often does not have jagged edges, for obvious reasons. The true foramen lacerum is visible from the under surface of the skull and in the living person contains a plug of hyaline cartilage. The medial opening is better referred to as the internal opening of the carotid canal. On the upper surface of th~ petrous part of the temporal bone there is a small 'semicanal' (a canal leading to a groove) running towards the internal opening of the carotid canal. This carries the greater petrosal nerve, a component of the nervus intermedius, a component of the facial nerve (CN VII). On the posterior surface of the petrous temporal bone is the opening of the internal auditory canal. This carries the facial nerve (CN VII), the nervus intermedius (CN VIIl/ 2) , the auditory nerve (CN VIII) and the labyrinthine (inner ear) blood vessels. Central Nervous System 329 Immediately below the opening of the internal auditory canal is a large foramen, often best seen from the under surface of the skull. This is the jugular foramen carrying the jugular venous bulb, the glossopharyngeal nerve (eN IX), the vagus nerve (eN X) and the accessory nerve (eN XI). Note that in some skulls the jugular foramen may be divided into 2, 3 or 4 smaller apertures, the various components passing through individual openings. Note also that the ridges and grooves on the inside of the occipital bone are directed towards the jugular foramina. Just behind the jugular foramen, there is often a small opening. This leads to the condylar fossa (on the outside of the skull) and carries an emissary vein from the marginal sinus to the exterior (Fig. 9.6), to the vertebral venous plexus. FIGURE 9.6 POSITION OF THE HYPOGLOSSAL CANAL AND EMISSARY FORAMEN AT THE FORAMEN MAGNUM N ow look directly into the foramen magnum from the inside of the skull and note the presence of the protruding occipital condyles. Tilt the skull horizontally to the left or right and note a fairly large aperture just above the condyle. This is the hypoglossal canal (sometimes called the anterior condylar canal) and carries the hypoglossal nerve (eN XII). Finally, consider the structures which pass through the foramen magnum. These are: the apical ligament of the dens, the tectorial membrane, the lower end of the medulla oblongata, the dura, arachnoid and pia mater, the spinal roots of the accessory nerve, the vertebral arteries and the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, as well as the sensory divisions of the 1st and usually 2nd cervical nerves. From the above description, two generalisations may be made: • the foramina are placed in serial order from before backwards and the cranial nerves are related to them in that fashion. It is evident that the cranial nerves have Latin names as well as a numerical identity. It is necessary to know both the forms of identity as they are constantly used interchangeably. Thus, in the clinic a condition may either be referred to as an 'oculomotor palsy' or a 'third nerve palsy'; another patient may have 'facial palsy' or 'seventh nerve palsy'. Students often find it difficult to remember the names and the numbers together and a mnemonic sometimes helps this situation. The following sentence may prove helpful. It relates the first letters of the Latin terms with the serially placed numbers. On Old Olympus Towering Tops A Finn And German Viewed Some Hops o = Olfactory; 0 = Optic; 0 = Oculomotor; T = Trochlear; T = Trigeminal; A = Abducent; F = Facial; A = Auditory; G = Glossopharyngeal; V = Vagus; S = Spinal accessory; H = Hypoglossal. These are numbered in serial order from one to twelve. • although the main items passing through the foramina have been described, for example nerves or blood vessels, in reality, the contents of the foramina are, for the most part, neurovascular bundles, containing nerves, veins and arteries. 330 Practical Anatomy Having studied the interior of the prepared skull, it is now necessary to prepare the cadaver for the removal of the calotte. 9.4 REMOV AL OF TIlE CALOTTE With the cadaver lying on its back, place a large wooden block under the shoulders so that the head is elevated from the table and the neck is extended. If the scalp has been dissected already, the procedure is made somewhat easier. If the scalp has not yet been dissected, make a sagittal incision down to bone from the root of the nose (nasion) to the external occipital protuberance (inion) and then a coronal incision to the same depth from the root of ear to ear. Elevate the four flaps thus produced by placing a periosteal elevator under the pericranium and stripping them off, leaving behind bare bone (Fig. 9.7). The stripping should reach to the supra-orbital ridges in front and to below the external occipital protuberance posteriorly. At the sides of the skull, the elevation should extend deep to the attachments of the temporalis muscles, that is, to at least to 2.5cm below the superior temporal lines. Study the layers of the scalp as the flaps are raised. These are: skin, dense connective tissue, aponeurosis, loose connective tissue, periosteum. At the front and back of the aponeurosis, the muscle fibres offrontalis and occipitalis muscles will be found. These are muscles of facial expression and are supplied, therefore, by the facial nerve (eN VII). They are joined by the aponeurosis which may be regarded as an intermediate tendon. FIGURE 9.7 (A) INCISIONS IN THE SCALPj (B) ELEvATION OF THE QUADRANTS Now, viewing the exposed skull from the side, determine the position of its greatest length; place an elastic band around the skull in that position and mark the bone with suitable ink (Fig. 9 .8). After cutting, this provides the greatest aperture of the skull. It adds to the difficulties if one attempts to remove a brain through an aperture which is smaller than the brain's diameter. In the average skull, the greatest diameter for this purpose is in a line about 2cm above the supra-orbital ridges to about 2cm above the external occipital protuberance. Make a saw-cut along the marker line, through the outer table and diploe. Try to avoid cutting through the full thickness of the skull so that the underlying dural covering of the brain is preserved as far as possible. Insert a chisel or similar instrument into the saw-cut and with a twisting action break the inner table around the cut. When the bony calotte has been loosened completely, it is held down by the adherent dura and endocranium. By passing a flat blunt instrument between bone and endocranium, the calotte may be loosened and removed. Note that the interior of the calotte is 'bare bone', indicating that the endocranium (interior periosteum) is present on the surface of the dura mater, and indicating that dura and endocranium are closely adherent. Central Nervous System 331 FIGURE 9.8 POSITION OF AN ElASTIC BAND TO INDICATE THE GREATEST DIAMETER OF THE SKULL 9.5 EXAMINATION OF TIlE EXPOSED DURA MATER Examine the dural surface and note the groove of the superior sagittal sinus running the entire length of the dural envelope. It is usually in the centre of the head but not necessarily so, and may consist of more than one channel. On each side of the dura, note the middle meningeal arteries dividing into anterior and posterior branches. Now cut the dura around the edge of the skull and note that the underlying arachnoid mater adheres to it loosely. Scrape away some of the arachnoid and turning the dura back, note that its interior surface is smooth and shiny. Thus, the outer surface is rough because of the presence of the endocranium and the inner surface is smooth after removal of the arachnoid. Mostly, the dura and endocranium are firmly adherent but in some places they separate to form venous sinuses which are lined with endothelium. The attachment of the dura mater to the interior of the calotte is fairly 'loose' but it is firmly attached to the bones of the cranial base. Having cut the dura completely around the edge of the skull, cut it with scissors, from front to back about 1 em from the superior sagittal sinus. This exposes the cerebral hemispheres covered with arachnoid mater (Fig. 9.9). Note that there is a fold of dura lying between the two hemispheres - this is the falx cerebri (falx = sickle-shaped). With scissors detach the the fold from the crista galli in front and pull the falx and dura backwards until resistance is encountered. This is due to the attachment of the falx to the tentorium cere belli (Fig. 9.10). With long scissors between the hemispheres, divide this attachment from before backwards until the falx comes adrift. Now, the the upper and lateral surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres, covered with arachnoid mater are fully exposed. ------------------ middle meningeal artery ~~~~~~~~\\----- sagittal sinus cut edge of dura mater ------- lacuna of sagittal sinus FIGURE 9.9 SUPERIOR ASPECT OF THE DURA MATER, SAGITTAL SINUS, MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY AND BRAIN 332 Practical Anatomy FIGURE 9.10 FALX CEREBRI AND TENTORIUM CEREBELLI Study the falx cerebri noting its shape. On its superior convexity lies the superior sagittal sinus, being narrow in front and broad at the back where it enters the confluence of sinuses (Fig. 9.11). The superior cerebral veins flow into the sinus and these can be seen entering in a forward direction. Note that the falx has a lower concave border in which lies the inferior sagittal sinus. This sinus enters the straight sinus which lies along the upper surface of the tentorium cerebelli. FIGURE 9.11 VENOUS SINUSES RELATED TO THE FALX CEREBRI AND TENTORIUM CEREBELLI Go back to the prepared skull and note that on the inside at the internal occipital protuberance, which is the position of the confluence of sinuses, the ridge for the superior sagittal sinus sweeps to the right side, into the transverse sinus, while on the left, the drainage into the transverse sinus, is from the straight sinus (Fig. 9.12). The next step is to remove the brain.

Removal of the brain may be effected in one of two ways: • If the brain is flexible, each cerebral hemisphere may be raised from the underlying tentorium cerebelli so that the 'tent' may be cut away from its attachments on both sides and the brain removed as a whole. • If the brain is hard and inflexible, one hemisphere may be raised so that the brainstem may be divided at the level of the tentorial notch. This procedure has the merit of allowing a study of the tentorium cerebelli in its pristine glory. Mter the tentorium and venous sinuses have been studied, the 'tent' is divided around its fixed attachment and the lower part of the brain may be removed. The brain- stem and cerebellum may then be placed in relationship to the previously removed part of the brain. To remove the brain, raise the frontal lobes with the fingers to view the anterior fossae; elevate the olfactory bulbs from the cribriform plate by blunt dissection. Continue the pull on the hemispheres until the large white optic nerves are visible; divide these with a sharp scalpel and find, close to them, the internal carotid arteries which should be divided with scissors. Then find, somewhat further back, in the midline, the stalk of the pituitary gland (itifundibulum of hypophysis cerebri) and divide it with scissors. If the oculomotor and trochlear nerves come into view, divide them with scissors. If they do not come into view, it may be necessary to disengage the temporal lobes from the middle cranial fossae. This may be difficult as they are 'trapped' by the lesser wings of the sphenoid bone. It may be necessary to insert an instrument such as the handle of a teaspoon into each fossa to 'ease' the lobes out of the cavities. When this has been achieved, the oculomotor and trochlear nerves may be divided as well as the large trigeminal nerve emerging from the pons. At about this stage, it may be necessary to decide upon the subsequent technique to be used. If the brain is very hard from prolonged fixation and is in danger of disintegration, it is probably best to divide the brainstem through the midbrain as it passes through the tentorial aperture. This is best achieved by the use of a scalpel from either side or with an angled knife. It is important to be sure that the basilar artery is properly divided otherwise the arterial system and circle of Willis may be irreparably damaged. Cutting the brainstem in this way, results in a specimen as shown in Fig. 9.13. If the brain is preserved but is still relatively flexible, the hemispheres may be elevated, first on one side and then on the other so that the tentorium may be divided leaving a fringe of about lcm along its attachments. FIGURE 9.13 ApPEARANCE OF AN 'UP-TURNED' BRAIN WHEN DIVIDED THROUGH THE MIDBRAIN AT THE LEVEL OF THE TENTORIAL NOTCH 334 Practical Anatomy This done, the brain may be lifted away from the clivus to expose the remaining nerves and blood vessels, which should be divided. Pass a narrow-bladed scalpel into the foramen magnum and, as far down the vertebral canal as possible, divide the spinal cord. The vertebral arteries should be divided with scissors on either side. Lift the brain out of the cranial cavity; if it does not come easily, check that the spinal cord and vertebral vessels have been properly severed. Do not forcibly remove the brain against resistance as this inevitably results in damage and a damaged brain is difficult to study. If the brain is firm or hard, it may be studied immediately; if it is soft and flexible, it will require further fixation. Pass a long needle with fine thread laterally through the pons and suspend the brain in a container of 10 per cent formaldehyde solution for four weeks, making sure that the solution is changed completely every week. If the brain is to be kept for a longer period after the initial fixation, it may be stored in 5 per cent formaldehyde solution provided that the solution is changed at fortnightly intervals. It may be necessary to add an antifungal agent such as thymol to the solution. Removal of the brain exposes the soft-tissue structures within the braincase which should now be studied. 9.7 STUDY OF THE STRUCTURES OF THE INTRACRANIAL BASE The first thing to do is to reconstitute the tentorium cerebelli into its normal position since it may have been cut to release the lower part of the brain. This may be done by placing one or two stitches in it to hold it in position. This should be easy if the required fringe around its cut edge has been left intact. It is now possible to see the extent of the posterior cranial fossa by looking into the central aperture of the tentorium. The tentorium cerebelli is formed by a double layer of dura, the superficial layer being continuous with that attached to the ridge on the petrous temporal bone; at the edge of the aperture (tentorial notch), the dura 'turns back' to form the deep layer which, passing laterally, is reflected on to the back of the petrous temporal bone. At or near the edge of the aperture are one or more venous sinuses. These can be seen by taking microscope sections of the edge. They are diagnosed by the fact that they possess no muscular layer. At the back, the two layers enclose the transverse sinuses. Study the tentorium by determining its peripheral attachments. Note that it is attached to the inside of the occipital bone, and if this attachment is followed laterally with a finger, the attachment goes forwards to the ridge on the petrous bone and from there medially to the pointed end of the petrous bone. From there it is attached to the posterior clinoid processes by the petroclinoid ligaments. By doing this, the attached border of the tentorium has been determined. Now observe the 'hole' in the tentorium. This is the tentorial notch which obviously has a 'free border' on either side (Fig. 9.14). The free borders begin posteriorly at the attachment of the inferior curved edge of the falx cerebri to the tentorium. Follow the free borders forward to discover that they are attached to the anterior clinoid processes. Place the index finger at the side of the body of the sphenoid and find a 'hollow' under the attachment of the free edge of the tentorium as it attaches to the anterior clinoid process. This hollow is sometimes called 'Meckel's cave' and houses the trigeminal ganglion and more deeply the cavernous sinus. If there is difficulty in visualising this, do the following: Consider the right-sided cave; hold the left hand in pronation and cross the middle finger over the index, leaving a small space between the fingers. Let the index finger represent the attached border of the tentorium and the middle finger the free border. Now, by supinating the hand slightly, it is evident that there is a hollow distally between the two fingers. This represents the position of the cave. Now go to the anterior cranial fossae and follow the dura backwards to the lesser wings of the sphenoid bone. Here it makes a sharp tum to enter the middle cranial fossa. Make a cut in the dura over the lesser wings and note the blood in the cut. This indicates that there is a blood sinus there - the sphenoparietal sinus. Pass a flexible probe into the sinus, or cut it open with fine scissors and Central Nervous System 339 In front, as the dura changes direction in passing from the anterior to the middle cranial fossa, at the edge of the lesser wing of the sphenoid lies the sphenoparietal sinus. Again, as the dura sweeps from the middle cranial fossa to the body of the sphenoid and into the sella turcica, the cavernous and intercavernous sinuses are found. Look again at the prepared skull and check the positions of the sinuses in the light of the above statements and with the aid of Fig. 9.19. Now, at last, it is possible to study the central nervous system itself. This will be done in two parts: • The brain and its membranes • The spinal cord and its surroundings. 9.10 THE BRAIN Before approaching this organ, it is necessary again to clarifY two matters: • The general classification of the brain may be stated as follows: Cerebrum = 2 hemispheres joined by corpus callosum Brain-stem = midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata Cerebellum = 2 hemispheres joined by vermis The brains tern is the link between cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord. • The brainstem is a vertical structure in the anatomical position (Fig. 9.20) although it may not appear to be so in the removed brain. FIGURE 9.20 TRACING OF MID-SAGITTAL SECTION OF HEAD AND NECK TO SHOW THE BRAINSTEM AS A VERTICAL STRUCTURE Some equipment is necessary for the study of the brain: Instruments required for dissection: • Sharp scalpel • Blunt and sharp pointed forceps • Dissecting scissors • Malleable probe or flexible wire • 'Brain knife'. This is a long-bladed knife used ordinarily for slicing ham. • Cork-covered dissecting board. • Rubber or plastic gloves • A wad of cotton wool or cloth to act as a cushion • Additional and useful material is a chalkboard and chalk, a drawing book, crayons or coloured pencils. 340 Practical Anatomy By the very nature of things, dissection must begin from the outside and proceed inwards. In spite of the intense desire to see what is inside the brain, there are so many interesting features on the surface that it is worth spending time to discover and identifY them and to consider their relationships to one another. When dissecting the brain it is necessary to observe two things: • The membranes and blood vessels are tough, and vigorous traction on them will result in damage to the underlying brain tissue. Therefore, after studying the membranes and blood vessels, remove them carefully with forceps and scissors. The cranial nerves are very fragile and are easily pulled out of the brain substance - preservation of these nerves requires special care. Removal of the membranes from between the two cerebral hemispheres may be difficult. • When cutting the brain with a knife it is advisable to avoid a sawing action as this creates uneven ridges which obscure the view and relationships of the underlying gray and white matter. For this reason knives must be razor sharp so that cuts may be made in one sweep. In making horizontal or coronal cuts, it is advisable to draw the blade towards the cutter in one sweep. This necessitates placing the handle of the knife as close as possible to the brain at the beginning of the stroke (Fig. 9.21). It is a good idea to wet the blade before making a cut. FIGURE 9.21 METHOD OF HOWING THE KNIFE PRIOR TO MAKING A CUT 9.11 ORIENTATION OF TIlE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM When the nervous system begins to develop it lies as a flat plaque along the length of the embryonic plate. Later it forms a tube and later still, the head end forms a series of dilatations and then a series of bends or flexures (Fig. 9.22). The end result of the bending is that the foremost part of the brain comes to lie at a right angle to the rest of the central nervous system. From Fig. 9.20 it is evident that the brain stem within the skull, beginning at the midbrain and ending at the medulla oblongata is a vertical structure and that the spinal cord follows the curvatures of the vertebral column but has a general vertical orientation. It seems reasonable to suppose that a student studying the brain would place it on the dissecting board in the same orientation as his/her own brain, that is, with the frontal lobes forward and the Central Nervous System 341 occipital lobes backwards. In turning the brain over to examine its inferior surface, it would seem reasonable too, to keep the frontal poles pointing forward. Because of this, the brain is often viewed from its under surface, that is, it is studied upside down. Place the brain in its anatomical position upon a thick pad of wet cloth or cotton wool: This holds it in position and prevents damage to its under surface. The frontal lobes are forwards and the occipital lobes point backwards. The extreme ends of the lobes are called the poles - thus, there are frontal poles, occipital poles and temporal poles. Hold the brain in two hands and, turning it from side to side, identifY the poles. The most obvious thing to see at this stage is that the whole surface of the brain is covered with a semitransparent membrane - the arachnoid mater. A A Division of the neural tube into prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon B Formation of the telencephalon (first flexure) C Flexion of the hindbrain (second flexure) D Flexion at the metencephalic-myelencephalic junction to form IV ventricle (third flexure) E Exaggeration of flexures to indicate that the brainstem becomes a vertical structure FIGURE 9.22 FLEXURES IN THE DEVELOPING BRAIN , , , I I \\ \\ , '\" , ' .. ..--- rhombic lip ______ ultimate posi~ion of __ - - - ~ ;,;~- cerebral hemispheres \\ , I -\" \" ------------- cerebellum \" --------------- IV ventricle --------------- medulla oblongata E Note that the upper part or cerebrum is divided into two hemispheres by a deep fissure, the sagittal fissure. Hold the brain up and look at the back to see the deep cleft between the cerebellar hemispheres, the vallecula cerebelli. Turn the brain over to see the under surface and note the brainstem. The midbrain cannot be seen adquately at this stage but the pons and medulla oblongata are easily seen. A closer look at the surface will reveal that the blood vessels lie beneath the arachnoid membrane and that the nerves protrude through holes in the membrane (Fig. 9.23). FIGURE 9.23 SHOWING NERVES EMERGING THROUGH THE ARACHNOID MEMBRANE Central Nervous System 343 vertex of the brain, these granulations spread laterally indicating that the sagittal sinus would be broader or would have lateral extensions in the region. These extensions are called venous lacunae . ................ superior sagittal sinus ........ arachnoid granulations ........ venous lacuna FIGURE 9.25 ARACHNOID VIlli RELATED TO THE SUPERIOR SAGITTAL SINUS It is important to understand the relationship of the arachnoid granulations and the superficial venous drainage of the hemispheres to the venous sinuses. Although similar arrangements may take place in other sinuses, they are much more common in the sagittal sinus and are easier to explain in this sinus. Look at Fig. 9.26, and note that: • The sinus communicates with a superficial vein of the scalp via an emissary vein, which also provides drainage of the diploic bone marrow. Emissary veins and sinuses have no valves and blood flow may, therefore, be in either direction - outwards or inwards. The main function of an emissary vein is to act as a safety-valve for increased intracranial pressure. So it follows that although the flow would ordinarily be from the sinus outwards, to relieve an increase of pressure in the cranial cavity, an infection of the scalp may enter the bone marrow or the cranial cavity via an emissary vein and produce osteomyelitis of the skull or sinus thrombosis - both unpleasant illnesses. • The arachnoid granulations protrude into the sinus and allow CSF to filter back into the blood circulation. Although the pressure of the CSF is fairly low (±130mm water = ±10mm Hg), the pressure in the sagittal sinus in the standing or sitting position may be negative, thus allowing a considerable gradient for absorption. Blockage of the arachnoid granulations by inflammation or clotted blood reduces the absorption of CSF and may result in the condition of hydrocephalus (water on the brain). • The superficial cerebral veins drain into the venous sinuses and, in order to do so, they must necessarily pass through the subarachnoid space and through openings in the arachnoid membrane to reach the sinuses. FIGURE 9.26 CORONAL SECTION TO SHOW THE SUPERIOR SAGITTAL SINUS WITH THE ENTRANCE OF THE CEREBRAL VEINS AND THE ARACHNOID VIlli AND EXIT OF THE EMISSARY VEIN 344 Practical Anatomy 9.12 SPACES BETWEEN THE MEMBRANES The membranes surrounding the brain are laid down in a laminar fashion and it would seem likely that there would be spaces between the layers. In fact, there are 'potential' spaces between dura and endocranium and between dura and arachnoid and an 'actual' space between arachnoid and pia mater. The actual space is called the subarachnoid space. It is already apparent that there is a potential space between the endocranium and the dura mater and it is evident from the fact that the middle meningeal artery and its branches lie in that space between the two layers. This is called the extradural space. If the artery is damaged due to a fracture of the thin area of the skull (temporal region), the high arterial pressure of the escaping blood will 'dissect' the dura off the underlying endocranium, resulting in a large collection of blood in the extradural space. This is called a space-occupying lesion and it obviously exerts pressure on the brain substance and displaces it (Fig. 9.27). These effects result in nervous and vascular signs and symptoms. This is a dangerous condition as death may supervene rapidly. FIGURE 9.27 EXTRADURAL HAEMATOMA WITH UNCAL HERNIATION There is also a potential space between the dura and the underlying arachnoid. This is called the subdural space. If, as a result of trauma (often minimal), a cerebral vein is sheared off, bleeding takes place into the subdural space with the formation of a subdural haematoma. The slowly enlarging haematoma also exerts pressure upon the surface of the brain, damaging its blood supply and resulting in altered brain function. If the blood leaks into the subarachnoid space, it may be found in the CSF on lumbar puncture, since the cerebral and spinal subarachnoid spaces are in continuity with one another. After the arachnoid covering of the brain has been studied it should be removed. Before doing this, note that the gyri and sulci of the hemispheres are dimly visible through the membrane and that the blood vessels lie beneath the membrane. 9.13 REMOVAL OF THE ARACHNOID MATER At this point it is important to emphasise that the arachnoid is a tough membrane and its removal should be performed carefully, otherwise the blood vessels, nerves and other parts of the brain will be irreparably damaged. The membrane must be completely removed otherwise when it is necessary later to cut the brain, the presence of the membrane and blood vessels will prevent proper slicing. With scissors make longitudinal cuts through the arachnoid at its uppermost surface where it dips between the hemispheres much as was done with the dura mater (Fig. 9.9). Grasp the lateral cut edge with the fingers and peel the arachnoid off the brain surface, using scissors or scalpel to cut any Central Nervous System 345 blood vessels which anchor the membrane to the cerebral surface. As the separation approaches the lateral fissure, the blood vessels become larger and more numerous and the use of the scissors becomes more frequent. Carry the removal over on to the under surface of the frontal and temporal parts of the brain. Turn the brain over on its cushion to expose its under surface. Continue the removal of the membrane on the under surface. Here, it is essential to be careful as lack of care will inevitably result in damage to important blood vessels and nerves. With scissors, free the brain surface, nerves and blood vessels from the overlying membrane. Be careful not to exert any pull upon the emergent nerves as they are fragile and will come adrift from the brain substance. This is especially so with the oculomotor nerve. When the whole of the surface of the brain (including the cerebellum) has been denuded of arachnoid, the gyri and sulci become very obvious. Removal of the arachnoid mater should expose the pia mater. However, the pia is a thin membrane which follows every nook and cranny of the brain surface. Since it carries the small blood vessels of the the nervous system, it also forms part of the choroid plexus which is a vascular structure. For practical purposes, the pia is not visible to the naked eye and is only seen in microscopic sections of the brain surface. 9.14 EXAMINATION OF FISSURES AND GYRI Turn the brain on to one of its sides on the wet cushion and look at its outline shape. The frontal, occipital and temporal poles are clearly evident. Between the temporal and occipital poles there is a gentle indentation into which the upper surface of the cerebellum fits (Fig. 9.28). Pass the handle of a scalpel gently into some of the sulci and note that they are of different depths. At one of the frontal poles cut off a slice of tissue about lcm thick and note that the brain tissue is definable into two layers, the outer of which is gray in colour and the inner white (Fig. 9.29). The outer layer is called the cortex and consists, microscopically, of nerve cells arranged in layers held by nerve fibres and supported by special cells (neuroglial cells). The white matter consists mainly of nerve fibres surrounded by a substance called myelin which is white in colour and acts as an insulating layer around the fibres. From the arrangement thus demonstrated, it becomes clear that the brain surface is convoluted and that much of the cortex is buried in the depths of the sulci (±65 per cent). __ cerebellar indentation ///\"\" FIGURE 9.28 CURVE IN THE TEMPORAL LOBE INTO WHICH FITS THE CEREBELLUM ............. gray matter (corex) ......... white matter FIGURE 9.29 SECTION OF THE FRONTAL LOBE TO SHOW GRAY AND WHITE MATTER 348 Practical Anatomy Immediately anterior to the parieto-occipital sulcus is an area called the precuneus. This is demarcated from an anteriorly placed area called the paracentral lobule. The word paracentral means next to the central fissure and as such the paracentral lobule is a combination of the medial extension of the somatosensory gyrus and the adjacent cortex. Anterior to the central fissure is the medial extension of the somatomotor cortex (Figs. 9.32 & 9.34). Follow the corpus callosum forwards around the genu to where the rostrum joins the lamina terminalis. In front of the lamina lies a small gyrus called the paraterminal gyrus and immediately below this area is a larger area called the subcallosal area. These areas are of considerable importance in the formation of the so-called limbic system. The paraterminal gyrus and the subcallosal area are together known as the septal area. genu of corpus callosum --------- ---------------------- paraterminal gyrus --------------- lamina terminalis ___________________________ 0' FIGURE 9.34 PARTS ON THE MEDIAL SURFACE OF THE HEMISPHERE gyrus rectus -.. ___ _ ~--------- parahippocampal gyrus ----------- --- ------- ----.------ - medial occipitotemporal gyrus ------------ --- ----- ------- FIGURE 9.35 GYRI ON THE INFERIOR SURFACE OF THE HEMISPHERE trunk of corpus // callosum If at this stage a hemi-sectioned brain is not available, the structures described above will be seen later, when the brain is divided sagittally, If the brain has been cut through the midbrain during removal, study the gyri and sulci on the under surface of the cerebral hemispheres (Fig. 9.35). On Central Nervous System 349 the inferior surface of each frontal lobe, the most medial gyrus is the gyrus rectus (straight gyrus) demarcated by the sulcus rectus, in which lies the olfactory tract. The more lateral gyri constitute the so-called orbital cortex because they lie on the surface of the orbital plate of the frontal bone, over the orbit. Further back is the temporal lobe, and running its entire length, on its medial side is the parahippocampal gyrus with the uncus (uncus = hook) near its anterior and medial surface. Note that the uncus is opposite the optic chiasma and the anterior perforated substance and that these structures may be obscured if the uncus is prominent. The parahippocampal gyrus is demarcated on its lateral side by the collateral fissure. More laterally, are the medial and lateral occipitotemporal gyri, the medial being separated from the parahippocampal gyrus by the lingual gyrus. Having dealt with the lobar and gyral pattern of the brain it is possible to examine its arterial blood supply. It is important to stress that the brain is being studied in an upside-down position and it is necessary to be careful about the use of positional terminology. 9.15 ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN The arachnoid mater has been carefully removed to expose the arteries and nerves on the under surface of the brain. The arterial supply of the brain is derived from two sources: • The internal carotid arteries, forming an anterior component; • The vertebral arteries, forming an inferior component. The two components are joined by the posterior communicating arteries and there is often a considerable difference in the diameter of the right and left sides in all the cerebral arteries. From a dissectional point of view, it is easier to study the posterior component first. Identity the vertebral arteries lying at the sides of the medulla oblongata and converging over the medulla to join at the junction between medulla and pons. Here they form the basilar artery which runs the length of the pons in the pontine furrow. At the junction of the pons with the interpeduncular fossa (midbrain), the artery divides into its two terminal branches, the posterior cerebral arteries. Throughout their courses, the vertebral and basilar arteries give branches (Fig. 9.36). r------------------------------------------- anterior communicating a. _::::::::::::> anterior cerebral a. ~~~pp~--- ______ ----- internal carotid a.

FIGURE 9.36 ARTERL4L SUPPLY OF THE BRAIN 350 Practical Anatomy The vertebral arteries give: • two posterior spinal arteries which supply the sides and posterior surface of the medulla and the posterior surface of the spinal cord; • two anterior spinal arteries which join to form one anterior spinal artery, supplying the anterior surface of the spinal cord; • two posterior inferior cerebellar arteries, supplying the sides of the medulla and the inferior surface of the cerebellum. The anterior inferior cerebellar arteries arise at approximately the junction of the vertebral arteries and supply the middle of the cerebellar hemispheres. The basilar artery gives a series of segmental pontine arteries, one of which is larger than the others and is the labyrinthine artery, supplying the inner ear. This artery may come off the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Just before the basilar artery terminates, it gives its subterminal branches, the superior cerebellar arteries, which supply the upper surfaces of the cerebellar hemispheres. Observe that the oculomotor nerve emerges from the interpeduncular fossa and passes between the superior cerebellar artery and the posterior cerebral artery. Occasionally the trochlear nerve, running in the cisterna ambiens, passes more laterally between the arteries. The distribution of the posterior cerebral artery is for the most part on the under and medial surface of the hemisphere and, as its name suggests, tends to supply the posterior part of the hemisphere as well as the under surface of the temporal lobe. Its major branches go to the occipital lobe as the parieto-occipital and calcarine arteries. Note that it has a branch which forms an anastomosis with the terminal part of the anterior cerebral artery (Fig. 9.37). Now consider the anterior (carotid) component of the arterial supply. IdentifY the optic nerves passing backwards to the optic chiasma. At the sides of the chiasma find the cut ends of the internal carotid arteries. Each has passed through the carotid canal in the petrous bone, has given off the ophthalmic artery, has negotiated the cavernous sinus, and now each gives off its three or four terminal branches (Fig. 9.36). These are: • the anterior cerebral artery • the middle cerebral artery • the posterior communicating artery • anterior choroidal artery. The anterior cerebral artery: pull the optic nerves and chiasma backwards to see these arteries passing above (note the terminology - the brain is upside down) the optic nerves and into the cleft between the two frontal lobes. They pass over the genu of the corpus callosum to supply the medial and superior parts of the two hemispheres. These arteries will be seen again later. Carefully follow the two arteries for a short distance to discover that they are joined by a short channel, the anterior communicating artery. Look at Fig. 9.37, which is a hemisection of the hemispheres, and there note the distribution and the branches of the anterior cerebral artery. Note that it rises up and then lies upon the surface of the corpus callosum, as the peri-callosal artery, giving off branches as it goes. In front, note the fronto- polar artery (its name gives away its distribution). This is followed by the calloso-marginal artery which, in turn, is followed by arteries going to the named parts of the brain - paracentral and precuneal arteries. By now the artery has reached the back end of the corpus callosum (splenium), where it forms an anastomosis with a branch from the posterior cerebral artery called the posterior peri-callosal artery. Sometimes at the region of the anterior communicating artery a fairly large branch runs backwards to the anterior perforated substance and supplies the structures which would ordinarily be supplied by the medial striate branches of the middle cerebral artery - this is the recurrent artery (of Heubner*). * Otto Heubner (1843-1926), German paediatrician. 356 Practical Anatomy Posteriorly, the midbrain consists of a plate upon which are situated four elevations, the superior and inferior colliculi (corpora quadrigemina). The superior are associated with the visual system and the inferior with the auditory system. Between the inferior colliculi is a thin membrane, the superior medullary velum, which extends downwards to become continuous with the lingula of the vermis. The membrane has, on its posterior surface, a ridge called the frenulum veli. The trochlear nerve (eN IV) emerges through the velum on either side of the frenulum. These will be seen clearly later when part of the temporal lobe is removed (Fig. 9.46). 9.19 PONS Anteriorly, it lies below the midbrain and presents as a large bulbous mass of white material. It has numerous transverse ridges and grooves on its surface and has in its centre a vertical shallow sulcus in which nestles the basilar artery. Laterally, the substance of the pons passes, as the middle cerebellar peduncle into the horizontal fissure of the cerebellum. Posteriorly, this aspect of the pons is obscured by the overlying cerebellum. It forms the upper part of the floor of the fourth ventricle, which is an expansion of the cavity within the brainstem and will be seen later when the cerebellum is split in two (Fig. 9.71). 9.20 MEDULLA OBLONGATA Anteriorly, it begins at a deep cleft at the lower end of the pons. It is bulbous above and tapers lower down until it joins the spinal cord. It posesses a deep median sulcus, on either side of which are two prominent ridges, the pyramids which are bounded laterally by lesser sulci. On either side of the pyramids are two slighter ridges upon which are two prominent 'bumps', the olives (Fig 9.43). Laterally, there is a groove behind the olives on the back of which is the prominent inferior cerebellar peduncle. Posteriorly, the right and left inferior cerebellar peduncles are evident. These diverge from the posterior aspect of the spinal cord and pass upwards to enter the cerebellum. If the medulla and cerebellum are gently separated, the lower part of the fourth ventricle is visible between the two with the inferior cerebellar peduncles passing upwards into the depths of the ventricle. Now make a drawing as illustrated in Fig. 9.43. This outline will be used as a template and it would be just as well to acquire the technique of drawing it. The next step is to study the cranial nerves as they emerge from the brainstem. In this connection, it should be noted that some of the nerves subserve a motor function and some a sensory function. It follows, therefore, that it might be sensible to follow motor nerves going away from the brainstem and sensory nerves going towards the brainstem. However, since they are being studied for the first time, they should all be considered as emerging from the brainstem. 9.21 STUDY OF THE CRANIAL NERVES ATTACHED TO THE BRAINSTEM In the following section, note that a description is given of how to find each nerve. This is because often a nerve has been destroyed on one side and occasionally on both sides, during removal of the brain. Despite this, it is necessary to know the site of origin of each nerve for anatomical and clinical purposes. Olfactory nerves (eN I): the olfactory bulbs may be present on the brain but have probably been left in the cranial cavity. Follow the olfactory tracts backwards in the sulcus rectus until they divide Central Nervous System 357 into medial and lateral olfactory striae, enclosing the anterior perforated substance on each side. This division occurs opposite the optic chiasma. Note that the medial stria turns to enter the sagittal cleft between the two frontal lobes, there to enter the paraterminal gyrus of that side, while the lateral stria passes between the frontal and temporal lobes to reach the small gyrus semilunaris .which may be seen if the temporal lobe is elevated slightly. The medial stria may be accompanied by the diagonal band of Broca which forms the posterior boundary of the anterior perforated substance. When present it accompanies the medial stria into the paraterminal gyrus. To see these parts it may be necessary to shave away a small strip of the medial part of the temporal lobe; if this is necessary do it only on one side. Optic nerves (eN II): these have been cut but they are identified by their protrusion forwards from the optic chiasma. Follow the optic tracts emerging backwards from the chiasma over the crura cerebri to where they disappear on the lateral sides of the crura. Insert these in the template. Oculomotor nerves (eN III): seek in the interpeduncular fossa on the medial side of the crura cerebri and find the stump of the nerve. It too has been cut. Insert this in the template. Trochlear nerves (eN IV): to find these nerves, it may be necessary to displace the temporal lobes laterally. If the nerves are present, they are very thin and thread-like, coming around the lateral sides of the crura cerebri. As previously mentioned, they are coming from the posterior aspect of the midbrain. The smallness of the nerves is attributed to the fact that they supply only one orbital muscle on either side (superior oblique). Again, it may be necessary to shave away part of the temporal lobe to visualise this nerve. Insert the trochlear nerves into the template and review the diagram. Two nerves (I and II) emerge in front of the brainstem and two (III and IV) emerge from the midbrain itself. Trigeminal nerves (eN V): to find these, the largest of the cranial nerves, it is necessary to go to the sides of the pons. They emerge just in front of the middle cerebellar peduncles. Sometimes they are split into a large sensory component and a sinall motor component. Insert these in the diagram. Abducent nerves (eN VI): these nerves are relatively small because, like the trochlear, they supply only one orbital muscle on each side (lateral rectus). To find them locate the junction between the pons and the medulla; they lie almost flat upon the pontine surface emerging from crevices just lateral to the pyramids. Insert these into the diagram. Facial (eN VII) and Auditory (eN VIII) nerves: these nerves emerge together from the cleft between the pons and medulla, but on the lateral sides. Before searching for these nerves make sure that all the membranes and blood vessels have been properly removed from the region otherwise the origins of the nerves will be obscured. The separation between the nerves is not always as clear as is shown in textbooks and, not infrequently, the nervus intermedius (eN VII) will be found between the two. This nerve is the sensory and secretomotor component of the facial nerve. Add these nerves to the diagram. Glossopharyngeal (eN IX), Vagus (eN X) and Accessory (eN XI) nerves: to locate these nerves, find the olives. The nerves emerge as a series of rootlets posterior to the olives, that is between the olives and the inferior cerebellar peduncles. Again, it is not easy to distinguish the individual nerves as the rootlets emerge in a serial fashion, in a downward direction. Insert these nerves in the diagram. Hypoglossal (eN XII) nerves: these nerves, which supply motor function to the muscles of the tongue, arise as a series of rootlets emerging from the medulla, anterior to the olives. Indicate them on the diagram. 358 Practical Anatomy Now, review the whole brainstem with the diagram and note that the cranial nerves emerge at specific points and in serial order. The cranial nerves form, to a great extent, the nerve supply both motor and sensory, to the head and neck regions and their serial nature depends upon the embryonic development of the head and neck structures. Their positions of emergence are related to their underlying cell stations (nuclei) in the brainstem. These cell stations are driven by impulses from the higher levels of the brain in the case of motor function and in the case of sensory function, they provide pathways for impulses going to higher centres. Using the blood vessels which were excised from the brain, place them upon the brain in their original position and note their relationship to the nerves presently displayed. Using another colour (preferably red) insert the blood vessels on the diagram (Fig. 9.45). This produces a composite picture of the brainstem showing its anatomy together with that of the nerves and blood vessels. Place the blood vessels in a dish of preserving solution so that they do not dry out . ................................... I ............ IV .................... VII .......................... VIII ................................ IX, X, XI ................................... XII FIGURE 9.45 BLOOD VESSELS SUPERIMPOSED UPON THE CRANIAL NERVES The next procedure in the dissection is to follow the optic tract, on the right side of the upturned brain, along and around the crus cerebri (in the cisterna ambiens) to where it enters the lateral geniculate body (LGB). lfthe brainstem has been divided during removal of the brain (Fig. 9.13), it is necessary only to displace the temporal lobe laterally or to take a shaving off the medial surface of the lobe (parahippocampal gyrus) to see the contents of the cisterna ambiens including the optic tract. Any residu.al membranes and/or blood vessels may now be removed under vision. If the brain has not been divided during removal, it is necessary to cut away the temporal lobe by progressive slicing to see the progress of the optic tract to the LGB. The cuts through the temporal lobe should be made at 5mm thickness so that the cross-sections may be examined closely (Fig. 9.46). This is because the temporal lobe contains a number of structures which will be seen again later from a different perspective. The main structures to be visualised in the temporal lobe are the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle which contains the hippocampus, the fimbria of the fornix and the choroid plexus; the optic tract lies in the cisterna ambiens. After about the second cut, it is evident that the temporal lobe is attached to the frontal lobe and the slices must be separated from the underlying brain with a scalpel.

At the next cut the pes hippocampi appears (Fig. 9.47A) , s~owing the digitations of the hippocampus. Further cuts show the S-shaped 'body' of the hippocampus (Fig. 9.47B). Remember that the object of this exercise is to follow the optic tract to the lateral geniculate body (LGB) , therefore look at Fig. 9.47 and note the proximity of the optic tract to the surface of the temporal lobe. Because of this proximity, it is important not to damage the tract when sectioning the temporal lobe. A choroid plexus .......... optic tract cisterna ambiens FIGURE 9.47 (A) SUCE THROUGH TEMPORAL LOBE; (B) DEEPER SUCE THROUGH TEMPORAL LOBE 360 Practical Anatomy Continue to section the lobe backwards, removing each slice, until the tract forms a bulge. The bulge is the lateral geniculate body (LGB) which, itself, lies upon a prominent piece of brain tissue - the pulvinar of the thalamus. To see the structures clearly, remove any residual membranes and blood vessels which may be present. Proceed around the side of the crus cerebri to the back of the midbrain, there to discover another, smaller prominence - the medial geniculate body (MGB). Note that as the optic tract passes around the crus cerebri, it gives off a separate bundle of fibres which is called the brachium of the superior colliculus (Fig. 9.48). In some texts, the two parts of the optic tract are called the medial and lateral roots. Look at Figure 9.46 to identifY the geniculate bodies and the brachium, which should be followed around the back of the midbrain. This leads to the back of the midbrain, a part which is filled with membranes and blood vessels. These should be carefully removed. This may present some difficulty as they are wedged between the cerebrum and the cerebellum. In the case of the whole brain, the next manoeuvre is to stand the brain on its frontal poles on the wet cushion. For this an assistant is required to hold it in position while the membranes are removed. The assistant, standing opposite, supports the cerebral hemispheres with the left hand while gently pulling the cerebellum away from the cerebrum with the right hand, to open the cleft between the two parts of the brain. In a good light and using scissors, divide the membranes around the back of the brainstem. Note that the pineal body is embedded in these membranes and will come away with the membranes if thay are pulled out. Look for the gland in the midline of the the mass of membranes using scissors and the 'close and open' method of dissection. Gradually remove the membranes, leaving the pineal gland in position. Removal of these membranes reveals the posterior surface of the midbrain, upon which are four elevations - the superior (large) and inferior (small) colliculi. Because the upward projection of the cerebellum may obscure the inferior colliculi, the superior medullary velum, the frenulum veli and the lingula of the vermis as well as the origin of the trochlear nerve, it may be necessary to shave away a small part of the upper cerebellum to visualise these structures properly (Fig. 9.48). Study Fig. 9.48 and compare it with the structures seen on the back of the midbrain. It shows the structures on the posterior aspect of the midbrain, visible through the gap between the cerebrum and the cerebellum. Projecting a bright light into the gap, remove the pineal body with scissors. Note that it is attached to two transverse bars of brain tissue, the upper being the habenular commissure and the lower being the posterior (optic) commissure. Follow the habenular (upper) commissure laterally and discover that it forms a triangular blob of tissue on either side - the habenular trigone. From this, strands of tissue, the striae medullaris thalami, proceed forwards over the supero-medial aspect of the thalami which are visible anterior to the pulvinar. These striae are more adequately seen from the medial aspect in a hemisection of the brain. -------------------- moae medeliae thalam;/\"\"/ habenular trigone /,,/-- ,/ habenular commissure /\",//' ------ optic tract _______ brachium of superior colliculus ----- ---------------------------- cerebellum FIGURE 9.48 STRUCTURES ON THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE MIDBRAIN (NOTE: III INDICATES THIRD VENTRICLE) Central Nervous System 361 Now, hold the brain in the right hand and in its anatomical position; allow the cerebellum to fall downwards by gravity. Do not pull forcibly on the cerebellum for fear of fracturing the midbrain. Follow the optic tract from front to back and note that it skirts the midbrain to enter the LGB. Note that the brachium of the superior colliculus passes above or deep to the MGB to enter the upper surface of the superior colliculus. Note also that there is a broad ridge connecting the medial geniculate body to the inferior colliculus - this is the brachium of the inferior colliculus. Note: the geniculate bodies and colliculi are merely 'bumps' on the brain surface. The elevations are raised by underlying masses of neurons or nuclei which are the functional elements of the elevations. Thus, the lateral geniculate bodies and the superior colliculi contain six layers of neurons which constitute their underlying nuclei, while the medial geniculate bodies and the inferior colliculi contain single masses of neurons forming their nuclei. Having studied the continuity of the structures around the side of the midbrain, and the structures constituting the back of the midbrain, it is now necessary to separate the pons, medulla and cerebellum from the cerebral hemispheres. This should be done by cutting through the midbrain between the superior and inferior colliculi. Any membranes and vessels tethering the two parts should be divided with scissors. If the brainstem has been divided during removal of the brain, the division, fortunately, is usually located near to the superior colliculi or to the cleft between the upper and lower colliculi. 9.22 STUDY OF THE SE(;TION OF THE MIDBRAIN AT THE SUPERIOR (;OLLI(;IJLI Division of the midbrain at this level reveals its characteristic outline and contents (Fig. 9.49). Note that the outline has two blunt projections (crura cerebri) pointing forwards and two rounded projections (colliculi) pointing backwards. Between the crura lies part of the interpeduncular fossa and within each crus there is a black area - the substantia nigra - whose cells contain melanin pigment (neuromelanin). This pigment is also present in the albino person. The part anterior to the black area is called the basis pedunculi. A short distance posterior to the substantia nigra on either side is a circular mass of gray matter - the red nuclei. Despite this name they are red or pink only in the fresh brain. Note that there is an open channel towards the back of the section; this is the aqueduct of the midbrain (cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius) which has within it a groove on either side. These grooves are the sulci limitantes. This channel is surrounded by a layer of gray matter, the periaqueductal gray matter which has the same relationship to the aqueduct as the gray matter of the spinal cord has to the central canal of the spinal cord. . ............. basis pedunculi ..............

On it draw a line dividing it into lateral halves. Then draw a line across the sulci limitantes to the edge of the diagram. Label the diagram as follows: the part beyond the black area as basis pedunculi; the black area as substantia nigra; the area behind the transverse line as tectum and the part between the substantia nigra and the transverse line as tegmentum. Now, bracket the basis pedunculi and the substantia nigra and call this area crus cerebri. Using a different colour outline the area which includes the crus cerebri and tegmentum and call it the cerebral peduncle (Fig. 9.49). A glance at Fig. 9.62 will indicate the reason for not including the tectum in the cerebral peduncle. It is obvious that the tectum stops at the posterior commissure and does not go upwards into the cerebral hemispheres while the anterior components of the midbrain do go into the hemispheres. Thus, the tectum cannot be part of the cerebral peduncle. Having studied the cross-section of the midbrain, place the remaining brainstem and cerebellum in a jar of preserving fluid to await further study. If the brain was removed whole, the removal of the cerebellum and lower brainstem will now permit study of the sulcal and gyral pattern of the under surface of the temporal and occipital lobes which has already been described (Fig. 9.35). 9.23 STUDY OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES Turn the brain on to its under surface on the wet cloth cushion, with the frontal lobes forward. The next procedure is to slice the right cerebral hemisphere horizontally. Again it is important to avoid a sawing movement especially when cutting large slices. Thus, it is necessary to use the whole knife blade and to cut the slice in one movement. In initiating the cut, place the handle of the knife as close as possible to the specimen. The cut is then made with one sweep of the blade (Fig. 9.21). To judge the position of the initial cut, pass the handle of a scalpel into the sagittal fissure until it meets the resistance of the corpus callosum at the bottom of the fissure. Hold the handle between thumb and forefinger at the brain surface to measure the depth of the corpus callosum. Place the scalpel at the side of the hemisphere to guage the depth of the first cut. The main objective of the first cut is to remain just above the corpus callosum. Place the cutting edge of the blade with the handle also against the brain. Make sure that the blade is horizontal from side to side and from front to back. Pull the knife steadily backwards while pressing inwards. At the end of the stroke, the cutting edge should be in the sagittal fissure. Remove the upper part of the hemisphere, dividing blood vessels and membranes as necessary. This exposes the greater part of the medial surface of the left hemisphere where the various parts may be seen as described previously (p. 347). Note particularly the presence and position of the anterior cerebral artery coming up over the anterior end of the corpus callosum (the genu) and then running backwards over its surface while giving off branches. After noting these, remove them to clear the corpus callosum and the cingular gyrus. Identity the callosal sulcus between corpus callosum and cingular gyrus; remove membranes and vessels from it and open the sulcus by pulling apart the left hemisphere and the cut surface of the right hemisphere and seek on the callosal surface for two faint ridges - the medial and lateral longitudinal striae. These lie upon a very thin layer of gray matter over the corpus callosum called the induseum griseum which cannot be seen with the naked eye. Having studied all these parts, run the index finger along the cut surface of the hemisphere, about 1 to 2cm from the midline and feel the faint hollow under the corpus callosum. This is the cavity of the lateral ventricle of the hemisphere (Fig. 9 .50). The next objective is to enter the ventricle which lies just below the corpus callosum without damaging its contents. The following cuts should not exceed 5 to 6mm in thickness and should be made parallel to the first, using the same technique. The next cut should pass just under the central part of the corpus callosum and this usually creates an opening of varying size in the roof of the body of the lateral ventricle (Fig. 9.51). The opening may be enlarged by distracting the two hemispheres but if this Central Nervous System 363 does not adequately display the contents of the ventricle, the opening may be further increased by paring away the corpus callosum to expose the body and anterior and posterior horns of the ventricle (Fig. 9.52). The structures lying within this part of the ventricle are all visible by looking into the ventricle from above.

The cavities of the cerebral hemispheres are the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle. The ventricle of the midbrain is reduced to a narrow tube, the aqueduct of the midbrain and that of the hindbrain is expanded into the fourth ventricle (Fig. 9.53). The lateral ventricles are bilateral and may be divided anatomically into cavities each with an anterior horn, a posterior horn and a temporal horn. The anterior horn protrudes into the frontal lobe, the posterior horn protrudes into the occipital lobe and the temporal horn into the temporal lobe. ---- ------------------------------------------ anterior horn of lateral ventricle ___ ------------ interventricular foramen ----- -------------------------- temporal horn of lateral ventricle ----------- ----------------------- body of lateral ventricle -------- ------ ------------------------------ lateral recess -- ---------------------------------- posterior horn of lateral ventricle FIGURE 9.53 VENTRICULAR SYSTEM (SUPERIOR VIEW) Why it is that the lateral ventricles are so named and the others are named numerically? It seems that in early days, the lateral ventricles were actually named as the first and second ventricles and because of possible confusion with sides, were renamed 'lateral' while the others retained their numerical connotation. The main part of the lateral ventricle lies under the corpus callosum and the structures which may be seen in it, are in its 'floor'. These are, from lateral to medial, the body of the caudate nucleus, the thin string-like stria terminalis lying next to the caudate body, the thalamostriate vein, a small part of the upper surface of the thalamus covered by the lamina affixa, the choroid plexus and the fornix_ If these structures are followed backwards, they are found to disappear into a hole which is the entrance to the temporal horn of the ventricle. Recall that when slices were cut off the temporal lobe, the hippocampus, the tail of the caudate nucleus and the choroid plexus as well as the slit-like temporal horn of the ventricular cavity were seen_ Using a little imagination, it becomes evident that the structures are set in the shape of a C, with their beginnings in the upper part of the ventricle and their ends in the temporal horn. Inevitably, the question should be, 'How did this come about?' It is a result of the embryonic development of the cerebral hemispheres. To understand this, consider briefly the embryonic development of the central nervous system_ The development of the nervous system begins as two longitudinal ridges on the ectodermal surface of the embryonic plate_ These are the neural folds and between them is the neural groove (Fig_ 9.54)_ The folds increase in height and the edges approach each other and fuse in the centre to form a tube_ The fusion proceeds towards either end until a complete tube with open ends is 366 Practical Anatomy Find in the specimen, the head of the caudate nucleus forming the lateral wall of the anterior end of the ventricular cavity. Exactly opposite find the septum pellucidum forming the medial wall of the ventricle and, pushing gently on it with the handle of a scalpel, note that it is very thin. It is usually a double membrane which becomes fused into one but it occasionally has a cleft or a cavity in it. This is the cavum septi pellucidi, sometimes called the fifth ventricle. This is a misnomer because it is not connected to the real ventricular system and does not contain CSF. The septum pellucidum forms the division between the two lateral ventricles, anteriorly. Locate the fornix immediately under the corpus callosum and follow it forwards over the surface of the thalamus. At its lowermost part, it moves away from the thalamus leaving a small opening. This is the interventricular foramen; pass a blunt probe into the hole and find that it enters the third ventricle (Fig. 9.55). This foramen joins the lateral (or telencephalic) ventricle to the third (or diencephalic) ventricle. Now find the stria terminalis and trace it forwards to where it disappears at the foramen and backwards to where it disappears into the temporal horn. The thalamostriate vein is closely related to the stria terminalis and its tributaries are distributed over the head of the caudate nucleus and adjacent structures. ------------------ genu of corpus callosum --- -------------- head of caudate nucleus - ---------------- thalamus FIGURE 9.55 ANTERIOR BOUNDARIES OF THE LATERAL VENTRICLE Medial to the vein, there is usually a small exposed area of thalamus. With fine forceps, pick up the choroid plexus and note that it is attached to the ependyma over the thalamus at the lamina affixa. The next structure is the strip of choroid plexus which begins at the interventricular foramen, passes over the upper surface of the thalamus and disappears into the temporal horn. Again, with fine forceps pull the choroid plexus laterally to see that it is also attached to the ependyma covering the fornix. Note that all the structures that have been studied are extra-ependymal. Now define more clearly the anterior reaches of the lateral ventricle. Its anterior extremity is bounded by the downward curved anterior end of the corpus callosum (forceps anterior or minor); the lateral boundary is formed by the head of the caudate nucleus and its medial boundary by the fragile septum pellucidum which extends from the inner surface of the genu of the corpus callosum to the columns of the fornices further back (Fig. 9.55). The anterior part of the lateral ventricle merges with the body over the thalamus, the roof of which is formed by the laterally extending corpus callosum and the floor being formed by the structures described previously. At about the junction of the body and the posterior extremity is the entrance to the down-going temporal horn. The posterior extremity of the lateral ventricle curves backwards into the occipital lobe. The roof and lateral wall are formed by the out-going fibres of the corpus callosum (tapetum) and forceps major. On the medial wall of the posterior horn are two elevations; the upper is the bulb of the Central Nervous System 367 posterior horn, produced by the pressure of the fibres of the forceps major (posterior); the lower is the calcar avis, produced by the deeply penetrating calcarine sulcus (Fig. 9.56). ... . ...................... calcarine fissure FIGURE 9.56 POSTERIOR HORN OF THE LATERAL VENTRICLE 9.25 FURTHER STUDY OF THE CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE Before attempting to explore the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, one or two more horizontal slices should be taken off the right hemisphere. These slices should be about 5mm in thickness and should continue until the internal capsule and its relations are fully exposed (Fig. 9.57). The internal capsule is indicated by an angulated strip of white matter lying between the caudate nucleus and the thalamus medially, and the lentiform nucleus laterally. Using the same cutting technique as before, make the first cut and remove the slice. Examine the new surface carefully; if it does not show the structures indicated in Fig. 9.57, take another slice. The reason for the possible discrepancy is that there is variation in the brain, as in all other organs, and the cuts need to be modified in relation to the configuration of the individual brain. To verity this situation, study other brains being dissected. It is useful, advisable and educational to look at other specimens because sometimes structures which are not obvious in one brain are very well shown in another. The detail of the structures is shown in Fig. 9.57, where it is also obvious that the structures are 'laminated', with layers of white matter between the gray matter. forceps anterior ___ anterior horn of lateral ventricle ...... :: ... head of caudate nucleus ...... anterior limb of internal capsule ..... putamen } ..... globus pallidus lentiform nucleus claustrum ....... \"\"!~\" ..... , posterior limb of internal capsule \"\"'\" thalamus ...... ,\"\"\", ........ entrance to temporal horn ....... forceps posterior (major) ............. posterior horn FIGURE 9.57 STRUCTURES REVEALED BY FURTHER CUTS BELOW THE LATERAL VENTRICLE Central Nervous System 369 the entrance to the horn, to be able to see into the horn, cutting forwards, medially and laterally, keeping the structures under vision, to eventually reach the ends of the original incisions. At this point the large block of brain tissue constituting the roof of the temporal horn may be removed. Sometimes the brain tissue fractures and must be removed in pieces. To complete the dissection, shave away carefully the medial and lateral walls of the horn with a sharp scalpel with due care for the contained structures. On the medial side, shave away the lentiform nucleus to expose the hippocampus and the fimbria of the fornix. The amygdaloid nucleus lies in the roof of the temporal horn and the tail of the caudate nucleus and the stria terminalis are closely associated with it.

The medial toe is covered with the cortex of the uncus which is the termination of the hippocampal gyrus and above it lies the amygdaloid nucleus. Along the medial border of the hippocampus lies the fimbria of the fornix (sometimes called the fimbria of the hippocampus). The fimbria is usually present in the nature of a flap and if the flap is lifted away from the parahippocampal gyrus, the dentate (resembling teeth) gyrus may be seen in the cleft. To the lateral side of the hippocampus is a bulge in the floor of the horn; this is called the collateral eminence and is due to the presence of the deep collateral fissure directly under it. The fissure lies just to the lateral side of the parahippocampal gyrus (Fig. 9.47B). Illustrate the structures in the temporal horn of the ventricle. Note that all the structures curve around the pulvinar, the most posterior bulge of the thalamus (Fig. 9.61A,B). To find the dentate gyrus, lift the fornix away from the hippocampus and look in the space created where the tooth-like gyrus will be seen. N ow follow the fornix from the fimbria (in the temporal horn) around the back of the thalamus (pulvinar), into the body of the ventricle, to the columns, lying in front of the anterior surface of the thalamus. Note that it passes under the corpus callosum. Follow the hippocampus and dentate gyrus backwards and note that as they approach the splenium of the corpus callosum (that is, its most posterior end) they pass around the back of the splenium, as a bundle, to reach the upper surface of the corpus callosum. This bundle is called the gyrusfasciolaris (Figs. 9.60 and 9.61A). On reaching 370 Practical Anatomy the upper smi.lce of the corpus callosum, it splits into twO narrow bands called the medial atld lateral longitudinal striae. These lie upon a very thin layer of gray matter called the itldllsell\", grise fllll , which covers the corpus callosum. At this stage the temporal lobe is attached to the brain only by the posterior part of the corpus callosum (forceps posterior and tapetum) and it now becomes necessary to separate the temporal lobe from the remaining hemisphere. c· ············· medial and lateral longitud inal striae corpus callosum head of caudate nucleus · gyrus fasciolaris column of fornix .........•....•...... , \\ .......• stria terminalis f ······· fibres of hippocampus and dentate gyrus mamillary body ··············· \\:) 'h' ............. crus of fornix amygdaloid nucleus ............•............

T HE ARROW INDICATES THE INTERVENTRICUUR fORAMEN With the flat of the blade of the slicing knife pressed against the medial surface of the remammg hemisphere and with the handle against the occipital lobe, divide the brain sagittally in its centre, with one cut. Examine the medial surface of the brain and note its features. 9.27 STUDY OF TilE ~IEDIAL SURFACE OF TIlE CEREBRAL 11E~IISPIIERE AND TIIiRD VENTRICLE This surf.lce includes the medial surfu.ce of the hemisphere, the cut surface of the corpus callosum, the wall of the third ventricle and the mid-section of the midbrain. Although we have already considered the medial surface of the henusphere, above the corpus callosum, study it again, noting especially the 374 Practical Anatomy The next cut should be through the anterior commissure (Fig. 9.67) and when the cut has been made the piece should be turned over and fitted to the large part to give the impression of bilaterality. It is unusual to obtain a complete representation of the anterior commissure, usually only a part of it is seen. Tills cut, will probably also pass through the optic chiasma . ...... corpus callosum FIGURE 9.67 CORONAL SECTION THROUGH THE ANTERIOR COMMISSURE Study the various structures from above. At the top is the corpus callosum and immediately below it is the cavity of the lateral ventricle. Dangling from the corpus callosum is the septum pellucidum with the columns of the fornices passing behind the anterior commissure. In the lateral ventricle, the body of the caudate nucleus is visible, lying far out in the cavity of the ventricle, with the internal capsule lying below it and with the lentiform nucleus lateral to it. It may be possible to see, in cross- section, the stria terrninalis and the thalamostriate vein lying medial to the caudate. The anterior end of the choroid plexus may also be visible. The following cut should pass through the mamillary bodies and w ill probably pass through the interthalamic connection if one is present and through the bodies of the fornices above. When the cut has been made, again place the piece against the larger part to give the impression of bilaterality. In this section (Fig. 9.68), note the columns of the fornices in the centre with the choroid plexus wedged between fornix and thalamus. The caudate nucleus is now much smaller and in the outer part of the lateral ventricle and lying next to it, the stria terrninalis. The wall of the third ventricle extends down to the floor of the interpeduncular fossa of which, the marnillary bodies form a part. The claustrum is still present. If another cut is made it should pass through the junction of the anterior two-thirds and posterior third of the thalamus. The general relationship of the structures is more or less the same as that in the previous section. The caudate nucleus has become very much smaller and the fornices are separated from the upper surface of the thalamus by the flattened choroid plexus which is seen to separate the lateral ventricle from the third ventricle. Preserve the remainder of the hemisphere and the slices in their correct order so that they may be studied again. Place all the material in a pot of preserving solution. 9.29 STUDY OF THE BRAINSTEM AND ATTACHED CEREBELLUM Remove the specimen from the preserving fluid and, after washing it in running water, hold it in its anatomical position which means that the brainstem should lie in a vertical position. View the specimen from its anterior aspect (Fig. 9.69). Note that the cerebellum is attached to the posterior 376 Practical Allaromy is increased mtracranial pressure, they are forced into the foramen with disastrous effects upon the medulla. The surface of the cerebellum is covered w ith membranes and blood vessels and when these are removed, the surface is found to consist of numerous narrow gyri separated by sulci. The gyri are set to one another like the leaves of a book and are called folia (leaves). Pass the handle of a scalpel into one or more of the sulci and note that they are f.1irly deep. In the midline of the organ there a blunt ridge runs from apex to base, ending in the vallecula. The vermis separates the bulk of the cerebellum into hemispheres (Fig. 9.70). The vermis on the upper part of the cerebellum is called the superior vermis and the bulges in the vallecula ce rebelli are the inferior Ilennis. Pass the handle of a scalpel into the sulcus previously opened and follow it across the vermis to the opposite side. This indicates that the gyri and sulci are continuous from side to side through the superior vermis. Al though it would appear that there is a loss of continuity from side to side in the region of the vallecula, there is, in £1ct, continuity through the structures of the inferior vermis, lying within the vallecula. superior vermis . horizontal fissure uvula . .. falx cerebelli ~ ;;;;~~~~~~~~~~==~ ••••••••••••.••••••••.•.•••.••••••. dura mater . t onsil occipital sinus FIG URE 9.70 POSTERIOR VIEW OF THE CEREBEllUM Now turn the specimen around so that the anterior surface faces forwards. Place the handle of a scalpel on one of the middle cerebellar peduncles and, avoiding the flocculus, slide the handle laterally lIlto the IlOrizorlfal fi ssure to open it around the entire hemisphere. Do this on both sides and note that the fissure goes all the way around the cerebellum. The horizontal fissure apparently has no anatomical or physiological significa nce. After this, try to locate the primary fissure which is on the upper posterior surface of the cerebellum about one-third of the distance from the top to the bottom of the organ. It is often difficult to locate it accurately because of the numerous adjacent folia. However, irs position can be found after the vermis has been sectioned, when it is found between the parts called the culmen and the declive. Now locate the cerebellar peduncles of which there are three, the superior, middle and inferior. To find the superior peduncle, look at the lateral side of the midbrain to find a f.1irly prominent ridge disappearing into the upper part of the cerebellum; the middle pedlwde is obvious from the front; the inferior is an upward continuation of the ridges on the posterior aspect of the medlllla . It is hidden under two bands called the gracile and cuneate fasciculi and is not immediately visible but it will be seen w hen the cerebellar vermis is split. Before attempting to split the cerebellum, investigate the cavity between the vallecula and the posterior aspect of the medulla. With an assistant holding the specimen upside down on the wet cushion, hold the cerebellum steady and gently pull the medulla away. With a good light, peer into the cavity thus created.

The cells are cuboidal in shape and show patchy ciliation, some cells being uniciliate, others multiciliate. Cilia are not often seen in many parts of the adult brain but one of the usual places where they are commonly seen is in the fourth ventricle. Since ependyma lines the brain cavities, it follows that all structures seen in the ventricular cavities are 'extra-ependymal'. The floor of the fourth ventricle is regarded as being rhomboid in shape with medullary striae crossing it at approximately its middle (Fig. 9.73). Not infrequendy the striae are very attenuated or even absent. When present, they divide the rhomboid into upper and lower triangles. The upper triangle lies approximately over the lower part of the pons while the upper triangle lies over the medulla. The floor is split by a median longitudinal fissure on either side of which is a medial eminence. On the lateral side of the eminence is a shallow groove which is the upward extension of the sulci limitantes of the central canal of the spinal cord. On the lateral sides of the sulci are flat areas known as the vestibular areas which extend to the outer limits of the rhomboid fossa. At approximately the middle of the medial eminence is a shallow indentation - the superior fovea and below the medullary striae is a similar one - the inferior fovea. In the upper reaches of the vestibular area is a small dark Spot containing neuromelanin - the locus caeruleus Oocus cinereus, substantia ferruginea) which is responsible for the production of noradrenaline. Hold the specimen to the light so that the bulge on the medial eminence becomes clear. This is the facial colJiculus produced by the fibres of the facial (CN VII) nerve passing over the the nucleus of the abducent nerve (CN VI) in the substance of the eminence. Sometimes, at the lowermost end of the medial eminence, there is a small triangular elevation, the hypoglossallriangle and immediately lateral to it is another triangle, the vagal triangle. These triangles together resemble a pen nib and are thus, called the calamus scriptorius. At the lower end of the floor of the ventricle lie the gracile and cuneate fasciculi which form the lower boundary of the area . The point at which they meet is called the obex. On the posterior surface of the inferior cerebellar peduncles is the attachment of the inferior medullary velum which is known as the taenia of the fourth ventricle. 384 Practical Anatomy The white matter has on its posterior surface a fissure which reaches inwards to the gray matter and on its anterior surface a groove. The entrance and exit points of the roots of the spinal nerves provide points for division of the white matter into funiculi. Thus, in Figure 9.82, the posterior funiculus is between the posterior fissure and the posterior root; the lateral funiculus is between the posterior and anterior roots; the anterior funiculus is between the anterior root and the anterior groove . posterior funiculus lateral funiculus ..... ....... . anterior funiculus --- anterior spinal artery FIGURE 9.82 BLOOD SUPPLY OF THE SPINAL CORD .. -;: posterior spinal arteries /i/ ,:' . ...................... radicular artery ---, '\\ \\ L ... .... spinal artery I I , ~ ..... segmental vessel (artery) 9.31 ARTERIAL SUPPLY AND VENOUS DRAINAGE OF TIlE SPINAL CORD In the upper reaches of the cord the arterial supply is from the posterior and anterior spinal branches of the vertebral arteries. The posterior branches supply the cord independently from its posterior surface (Fig. 9.82) while the anterior branches fuse to form a single artery which lies in the anterior furrow of the cord. These arteries receive a supplemental supply from the deep cervical, intercostal and lumbar arteries. These are segmental arteries which give spinal branches and these in turn give radicular branches which reach the cord along the roots of the spinal nerves. The venous drainage follows a similar pattern except that it has an additional drainage into the deep component of the vertebral venous system and the epidural veins. Since the central nervous system is a segmented organ, its blood supply and venous drainage are segmented. That of the brain is segmented and that of the spinal cord is derived largely from the segmental vessels supplying and draining the trunk such as the intercostal and lumbar vessels. Specifically, the arterial supply of the cord is derived from two main sources: • from the vertebral arteries; and • from the segmental arteries such as the deep cervical artery, intercostal arteries, lumbar arteries and sacral arteries. The branches from the vertebral arteries are the anterior and posterior spinal arteries which supply the cervical cord. The remainder of the cord is supplied by radicular arteries which emanate from the segmental arteries. The spinal arteries from the vertebral vessels are in two groups; the first branches are the two anterior spinal arteries which join to form a single trunk and run down the cord in the anterior median fissure . The second branches are the posterior spinal arteries which run down the cord in the posterior intermediate sulcus , giving branches which supply the posterior funiculus and anterior branches which anastomose with the posterior branches of the anterior spinal arteries. Thus, the Central Nervous System 385 spinal cord is supplied by a series of arterial circles which surround it. These circles are joined to one another by longitudinal connections. 9.32 VERTEBRAL VENOUS PLEXUS This plexus consists of two parts: • external component - surrounding the vertebral column; • internal component - within the vertebral canal and partly forming the venous drainage of the spinal cord. The plexus is devoid of valves and extends from the pelvis to the base of the skull where it makes connection with the marginal sinus, the vertebral veins, sigmoid sinus, occipital sinus, basilar plexus and condylar emissary veins. It thus forms an alternate route of venous drainage of the intracranial contents to the internal jugular veins. The external and internal plexuses are connected so that the whole vertebral column, inside and outside, is covered with a massive venous plexus. The internal component lies partly within the epidural space and partly within the subarachnoid space. One of the most important aspects of the internal venous arrangement, is the presence of the basivertebral vein which enters each vertebral body through a posterior aperture. This vein, after entering the body, breaks up into numerous branches permeating the marrow cavity of the vertebral body and then joins the external venous component. This vein may be regarded as an emissary vein, connecting the veins in a closed system (vertebral canal) with veins which can expand (external component) . Since the the venous system in the diploe and in the vertebral bodies are unvalved and break up into small channels, cancer cells and bacteria (e.g. tuberculosis) are easily trapped in these sites.
