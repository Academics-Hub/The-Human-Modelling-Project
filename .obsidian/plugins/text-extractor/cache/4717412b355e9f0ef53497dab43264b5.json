Angles of the Femur • Angle of inclination of femur • It is an angle between the long axes of neck and shaft of the femur. • It is also called neck–shaft angle. • The normal neck–shaft angle is 125° in adults. • Angle of femoral torsion • It is an angle between long axis of the head and neck of femur, and transverse axis of the femoral condyles. • It measures about 7° in males and 12° in females Parts of the Femur • Proximal part • The head, neck, and greater and lesser trochanter. • Shaft • The shaft of the femur is gently convex anteriorly with maximum convexity in the middle third where the shaft is narrowest. • Distal end • Enlarged to form medial and lateral condyles. • Both condyles project backward and are separated by the intercondylar fossa. • The most prominent points on the condyles are called epicondyles. Proximal End • The head • It is rounded in shape and articulates with the acetabulum of the hip bone to form the hip joint. • It has fovea (a small pit) which gives attachment to the ligament of the head of femur (ligamentum teres femoris). • Neck • It is 5 cm long, directed upward, medially, and slightly forward and connects the head with the shaft. • The angle between its lower border and the medial border of shaft is called neck–shaft angle and allows for a wide range of movement. • The neck presents two borders—upper and lower, and two surfaces—anterior and posterior. Proximal End • Greater trochanter (GT) • It is a quadrilateral prominence situated at the lateral aspect of the junction of neck and shaft. • It provides attachment for the gluteal muscles and on its medial surface lies the trochanteric fossa. • Lesser Trochanter (LT-a conical prominence) • It projects from the posteromedial surface of the femur inferior to the neck–shaft angle. • Its provides attachment to the iliopsoas muscle and can be fractured due to forceful contraction of the muscle. • Both trochanters are connected by an intertrochanteric line and intertrochanteric crest. Proximal End • Intertrochanteric line • It continues downward and medially below the lesser trochanter on the posterior aspect of femur as spiral line. • It provides attachment to two ligaments and two muscles: • Capsule of the hip joint and Iliofemoral ligament (strongest ligament in the body). • Vastus lateralis to its upper end and Vastus medialis to its lower end. • Intertrochanteric crest • It extends from the posterosuperior angle of GT to the tip of LT. • It has the quadrate tubercle which is round near the middle • The quadratus femoris attaches to the quadrate tubercle. Shaft • The shaft of the femur is rounded and slightly bowed (convex) anteriorly. • On the posterior surface is a rough line, the linea aspera, that serves as attachment for the adductors of the thigh. • The shaft becomes broader toward its distal end and forms a flat, triangular area on its posterior surface called the popliteal surface. • The linea aspera divides into • A medial lip • A lateral lip. Shaft • The outer (lateral) lip • It blends with the gluteal tuberosity superiorly, and continues downward as the lateral supracondylar lines • The inner (medial) lip • It continues as a narrow, rough spiral line which goes up to the LT and continuous with the intertrochanteric line. • It continues below as the medial supracondylar line, ending at the adductor tubercle. • The pectineal line • It is a small ridge running down the posterior surface of the shaft of the femur from the LT. • It provides attachment for the pectineus muscle. Shaft • Attachments • Attachments of intermuscular septa: • Medial intermuscular septum is attached to the medial lip of linea aspera. • Lateral intermuscular septum is attached to the lateral lip of the linea aspera. • Muscular attachments • Vastus lateralis, intermedius and medialis • Adductor longus, magnus brevis • Articularis genu, Gluteus maximus, Gastrocnemius, Plantaris Muscular AttachmentsLower End • Medial Condyle • Its most prominent point is called medial epicondyle, which provides attachment to the upper end of medial collateral ligament. • Posterosuperior to the medial epicondyle lies the adductor tubercle, which provides insertion to the ischial head of adductor magnus. • Its lateral surface forms medial boundary of intercondylar fossa. Lower End • Lateral Condyle • It is stronger than the medial condyle but less prominent. • Its lateral surface presents a prominence called lateral epicondyle which provides attachment to the fibular collateral ligament of the knee joint. • Smooth impression above and behind the lateral epicondyle gives origin to the lateral head of gastrocnemius. • A groove below and behind the lateral epicondyle provides attachment to popliteus in its anterior part. • Tendon of popliteus occupies the posterior part of this groove during full flexion at the knee joint. • Its medial surface forms the lateral boundary of intercondylar fossa. Lower End • Intercondylar Fossa (Intercondylar Notch) • It is a deep notch, which separates two condyles posteriorly. • It is limited posteriorly above by intercondylar line. • It presents medial and lateral walls and floor. • The medial wall provides attachments to the posterior cruciate ligament. • Lateral wall provides attachment to the anterior cruciate ligament. Ossification of the Femur • The femur ossifies from five centres: one primary and four secondary centres. • The primary centre appears in the midshaft at 7th – 8th week of IUL. • Secondary centres • Three at the upper end and • 1 for head; appears at 1 year. • 1 for greater trochanter; appears at 3 years. • 1 for lesser trochanter; appears at 13 years. • They all fuse via separate epiphyses at 18th year. • One in the lower end, appears 9 months at birth and fuses at 20 years. Clinical significance of the Femur • Fracture neck of femur: • It is very common in elderly particularly in women due to osteoporotic changes in the neck. • It may be intracapsular or extracapsular • Intracapsular • It could be subcapital or transverse cervical. • The retinacular vessels are usually injured and thus healing is delayed. • This could lead to avascular necrosis of the head of femur. • The affected limb is shortened and held in laterally rotated position • Extracapsular • It could be basal, intertrochanteric, and subtrochanteric. • Here avascular necrosis rarely occurs as the blood supply is not affected. https://orthoconditioning.com/femoral-neck-fracture-management/ https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328793129_Hip_Fracture_Anatomy_Causes_and_Consequences Clinical significance of the Femur • Fractures of the Femoral Shaft • They occur following a high energy injury but a low range fall in the elderly could lead to it. • It most times occur as a spiral fracture, which reduces the length of the leg. • The loss of leg length is due the bony fragments overriding, pulled by their attached muscles. • Adjoining tissues and neurovascular structures can be affected especially the femoral nerve and artery. • When the femoral artery is affected, it could lead to haemorrhage. The Patella • The patella is the largest sesamoid bone, found in the tendon of quadriceps femoris. • It is situated in front of the knee joint, hence it is also called knee cap. • It is a flattened and triangular bone with the base facing upward, and the apex downward. • Its anterior aspect is convex and rough, whereas its posterior surface presents a large articular surface Side Determination & Ossification • Hold the patella in such a way that: • Its apex faces downward and its base faces upward. • Its articular surface faces posteriorly. • The large lateral part of articular surface determines the side. • Ossification • It ossifies from several centres which appear during 3–6 years and fuse quickly to form a single centre. • The ossification of patella is completed at puberty. • Abnormal ossification may form two or three separate pieces of the patella (called bipartite or tripartite patella). Clinical significance of the Patella • Dislocation of the patella: • The patella has natural tendency to dislocate laterally due to upward and lateral pull by the quadriceps. • However, it is countered by three factors: • More forward projection of lateral femoral condyle. • More prolonged insertion of vastus medialis to the medial border of the patella than that of vastus lateralis on the lateral border. • Medial pull exerted by medial patellar retinaculum. • Fracture of the patella: It could result from • A direct blow on the patella that fractures it into two or more pieces • Forceful contraction of quadriceps femoris Tibia • The tibia is the large weight-bearing medial bone of the leg. • It articulates with the condyles of the femur and the head of the fibula above. • Below, it articulates with the talus and the distal end of the fibula below. • It has an • Upper end • Shaft • Lower end Upper End • The upper end has the lateral and medial condyles. • On the lateral aspect of the lateral condyle lies a facet for the fibula head. • On the posterior aspect of the lies the insertion of the semimembranosus muscle. • Between the articular surfaces lies the anterior and posterior intercondylar areas; • Lying between these areas is the intercondylar eminence. • The medial and lateral parts of the eminence are more prominent, giving rise to • the medial and lateral intercondylar tubercles. Upper End • Attachments to the Intercondylar Area • Anterior horn of Medial meniscus. • Anterior Cruciate ligament. • Anterior horn of Lateral meniscus. • Posterior horn of Lateral meniscus. • Posterior horn of Medial meniscus. • Posterior Cruciate ligament. Upper End • Tibial Tuberosity • It is a projection at the apex of rough triangular area located on the anterior aspect upper end of the tibia. • It is divided into an upper smooth and a lower rough part. • Upper smooth part provides attachment to the ligamentum patellae. • Lower rough part is related to the subcutaneous infrapatellar bursa which separates it from the skin. • Rough triangular area above the tuberosity is related to the deep infrapatellar bursa. The shaft • The shaft is triangular in cross section, presenting • three borders—anterior, medial, and lateral; • three surfaces—lateral, medial, and posterior. • Its anterior and medial borders, with the medial surface between them, are subcutaneous. • The anterior border is prominent and forms the shin. Borders • Anterior border (shin of the tibia) • It is the sharpest, subcutaneous, and sinuous in course. • It extends from the tibial tuberosity to the anterior border of medial malleolus. • Medial border • It extends from the medial condyle to the posterior border of medial malleolus. • The soleal line joins the medial border at the junction of its upper one-third with the lower two-third. • Lateral (interosseous) border • It extends from the lateral condyle to the anterior border of fibular notch. • It provides attachment to the interosseous membrane which unites the tibia and fibula. • Distally it provides attachment for the interosseous inferior tibiofibular ligament. The lower end • The lower end of the tibia is slightly expanded and its inferior aspect articulates with the talus. • The lower end is prolonged downward medially to form the medial malleolus. • The lateral surface of the medial malleolus articulates with the talus. • The lower end of the tibia shows a wide, rough depression on its lateral surface for articulation with the fibula. Side Determination • The side of tibia is determined by holding the bone vertically in such a way that: • Its expanded end with condyles faces upward. • Its tibial tuberosity and sharp sinuous anterior border of the shaft faces anteriorly. • Medial malleolus is on the medial side. • Superior surface of the upper end (tibial plateau) lies in a horizontal plane. Ossification • One primary • It appears in the middle of shaft at the age of seventh week of IUL. • Two secondary. • For the upper end: Appears at birth or after birth and fuses with the shaft at age 20 • For the lower end: Appears at 2 years and fuses with the shaft at 18 years. Clinical significance of the Tibia Bone • Osteomyelitis of the upper end of tibia • The upper end of tibia is the commonest site of acute osteomyelitis. • When this occurs, the knee joint is unaffected because the capsule of knee joint is attached near to the margins of articular surfaces proximal to the epiphyseal line. • Fracture of tibia • The tibia is commonly fractured at the junction of upper 2/3rd and lower 1/3rd of its shaft (narrowest regions). • Fractures in the lower 1/3rd of the shaft of tibia show delayed union or non-union because of the poor blood supply Clinical significance of the Tibia Bone • Intraosseous access • It isa an emergency procedure performed for vascular access when intravenous access is not possible. • It enables the delivery of fluids and medications directly into the bone marrow. • Two main sites are usually used; • Anteromedial surface, 2-3cm below the tibial tuberosity • Area close to the medial malleolus The Fibula • The fibula is very thin bone and lies lateral to the tibia. • It is connected to the tibia above and below via the tibio-fibular joint. • It is used for various orthopedic procedures and can be expended. • Like other long bone it has an upper end, shaft, and a lower end. • It subserves two important functions: • It provides attachments—muscles. • Its lower end along with the lower end of tibia forms a socket (tibiofibular mortise), to hold the talus in place. Upper End of Fibula • The upper end is the head and its slightly expanded in all directions making an irregular quadrate form. • Its superior surface has an articular facet for the articulation with the lateral condyle of the tibia. • An upward projection posterolateral to this facet is called styloid process. • Just below the head, the fibula constricts to form the neck. • The common peroneal nerve is related to the posterolateral aspect of neck • The anterior tibial artery on its medial aspect Shaft of Fibula • It is slim and its shape is moulded by attached muscles. • It has three borders • Anterior, posterior and interosseus • It has three surfaces • Medial, lateral and posterior Borders of the Shaft of Fibula • The Anterior Border • It begins just below the anterior aspect of the head. • Its lower end divides to enclose an elongated triangular area that continues with the lateral surface of the lateral malleolus. • The Posterior Border • It is rounded and its upper end is in line with the styloid process. • It continues below with the medial margin of the groove on the back of the lateral malleolus. • Interosseus or Medial Border • It lies just medial to the anterior border. • It ends below at the upper end of a roughened area above the talar facet of the lateral malleolus. Surfaces of Fibula • The medial surface • It lies between the anterior and interosseus borders. • In its upper two thirds, it is very narrow, measuring 1 mm or less. • The lateral surface • It lies between the anterior and posterior borders. • It is twisted backward in its lower part. • The posterior surface • It is the largest of the three surfaces. • It lies between the interosseus and posterior borders. • In its upper two thirds, it is divided into two parts by a vertical ridge called the medial crest. Lower End • It forms the lateral malleolus which participates in the formation of ankle joint. • The tip of the lateral malleolus is 0.5 cm lower than that of the medial malleolus. • It has the following four surfaces. • The anterior surface is rough and rounded. • • The posterior surface is marked by a groove. • • The lateral surface is subcutaneous. • The medial surface bears a triangular articular facet for the talus (anteriorly); and the malleolar fossa (posteriorly). Determination of Side • The side of fibula can be determined by holding it vertically in such a way that: • Its round end called head is directed upward. • Its relatively flattened end is directed downward. • A triangular articular facet on its lower end faces medially. • A depression at the lower end (malleolar fossa) lies behind and below the triangular articular facet at this end. Ossification of Fibula • It ossifies from one primary centre and 2 secondary centres • The primary centre • This centre is for the shaft, appears during the 8th week of intrauterine life. • A secondary centre • For the upper end- It appears during the 4th year, and fuses with the shaft by 17-19 years. • For the lower end appears during the first year and fuses with the shaft by 15-17 years. • The fibula ossification is an exception to the law of ossification. • By the law, the centre that appears first would fuse last • Its secondary centre for the lower end appears first also fuses first.. Muscular Attachments to the Tibia & FibulaClinical significance of the Fibula Bone • Bone grafts • Since the fibula does not take part in the transmission of body weight, it is a common source of bone for grafting. • Fibular fracture • The fibula is commonly fractured, 2 to 5 cm proximal to the distal end of the lateral malleolus. • It is often associated with ‘fracture dislocation of the ankle joint’. • Site of common peroneal nerve • The common peroneal nerve can be rolled against the neck of the fibula. • This is an important landmark in clinical examination of nerve.
