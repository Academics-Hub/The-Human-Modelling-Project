Intracellular diplococci - Neisseria ghonorrhea Intracellular VS Extracellular Pathogens Inclusion body of chlamydia trachomatis INTRACELLULAR Extracellular staphylococci in clusters Extracellular streptococci EXTRACELLULAR“Billboards” for the cell MHC presentation Or MHC RESTRICTION Major Histocompatibility Complex molecules Glycoproteins encoded in a large cluster of genes on chromosome 6 Potent effect on the immune response to transplanted tissue ▪MHC I - all cells = HLA-A (except RBC) HLA-B HLA-C ▪MHCII - antigen presenting cells (Macrophages, Dendritic cells, B lymphocytes) HLA DP HLA-DQ HLA-DR To whom does the cell present antigen? ▪CD4 binds to MHC II ▪CD8 binds to MHC I ▪Therefore T helper cells bind to cells expressing MHC II eg dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells function: Activate the macrophage, secrete cytokines ▪CD8 cytotoxic T cells bind to cells expressing MHC I ie any nucleated cell Function: Kill the infected cell Immunological SynapseImmunological synapse CD8 FAS-L Any cell MHCI and peptide CD8 Tc cell FAS TCR Immunological synapse CD4 CD28 CD40-L Antigen presenting cell eg dendritic cell, B cell MHCII and peptide CD4 Th cell B7 CD40 (B cell) TCR OR Immunological synapse –B cell CD4 CD40-L B cell MHCII and peptide CD4 Th cell CD40 TCR Antigen Adaptive Immune System B cells - Make antibodies T cells Helper T cells CD4 - Secrete cytokines Cytotoxic T cells CD8 -kill cells Th 1 Th 2 Th 17 T reg Cytokines Th1 , cytotoxic T cell response γ IFN Il 1 Il 12 Th2, antibody response Il 4 Il 5 Suppressive cytokines: Il-10, TGFβ Policing the Immune System ▪What if a pathogen downregulates MHC I on the cell surface? Policing the immune system ▪If cell infected –foreign peptides presented by MHC –killed by cytotoxic T cell ▪If MHC is downregulated –cell will be killed by a natural killer cell B cells & antibodies Function of antibodies ▪Neutralization ▪opsonization ▪Complement fixation ▪ADCC ▪Mast cell degranulation ▪Function of B lymphocytes: Antibody production As an ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELL Five functions of antibodies ▪ Neutralization ▪ Opsonisation ▪ Complement fixation ▪ Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ▪ Mast cell degranulation ▪ Sticky in an important place! Prevents entry or attachment of the pathogen ▪ macrophages bind the “stalk” of the antibody and “eat” the antigen/antibody complex ▪ Complement binds the “stalk” of the antibody and can kill the pathogen ▪ Natural killer cells bind the “stalk” of the antibody and can kill the pathogen ▪ Mast cells bind the “stalk” of the antibody, degranulate releasing vasoactive substances that can kill/harm pathogen Fab Fc Fab T lymphocytesEach T cell has a unique T cell receptor ▪“educated”in the thymusThe T cell receptor is VERY speific 1 change in an amino acid of a peptide or an MHC molecule presenting the peptide can prevent the TCR from binding to the MHC restricted peptideTh1 Th2 Th17 Naïve CD4 Il-17 Il-23 TGF-β Il-6 IL-12 IFN-γ Il-4 Il-5 Il-13 Il-4 Treg Cell-cell contact THYMUS Modified from Iwakura and Ishigame, JCI (2006)116:1218-1222 ? Il-10 (Tr1) Peripheral induction B cell secretes antibody that recognizes surface configuration of antigen eg lipid, protein etc ie the epitope is on the surface of the antigen T cell receptor recognizes short peptide fragment of antigen presented via a MHC molecule ie the epitope was only revealed after cellular processing of the antigen The T cell receptor is specific for the combination of the peptide AND the MHC molecule Cell processes large protein antigen into small peptide fragments B T MHC T cell receptor The same antigen produces different B and T cell epitopes: Immune System gone Wrong ▪The immune system generally defend us with minimal collateral damage. ▪Sometimes, however, mistakes are made! ▪Tuberculosis ▪HIV ▪Allergies ▪Autoimmune disease –Type I diabetes Thank you","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
