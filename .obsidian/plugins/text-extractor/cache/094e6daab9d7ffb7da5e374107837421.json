{"path":"Physiology/Physiology Slides/CNS motor learning guide for slides.pdf","text":"PHSL 2004 (2023): Motor and higher function physiology The present learning guide and tutorial questions are meant to be used together with the power point presentation without a voiceover provided (both the learning guide and power point show have been printed for you). By downloading this document and the accompanying power point slide without the voiceovers, only 2 documents are required for your learning purposes and this is sufficient to engage in an efficient active learning process. There are however a series of lectures (8 separate documents) with voiceovers provided (also converted into video-clips that can be readily played on your cell phones) for those students who prefer to first hear the information (passive learning) before applying themselves to a more active learning process. The following are the central points for each slide provided without the voiceover. The importance of this knowledge (application) is highlighted in a series of MCQ questions and cases provided in an APQ format with model answers given after each question. This will allow you to assess your understanding of the material immediately after you have engaged with a particular topic, before proceeding with the next section. This, process encourages continuous active learning. Obviously, the MCQs and APQs cannot be provided in the slides with voiceovers, but can only be found in the learning guide. Importantly, this course is not a repetition of textbook information, but is a synthesis of information from over a 100 text sources complied over 25 years of teaching of this topic together with 30 years of clinical experience. It is a comprehensive resource that engages in the application of key physiological principals. Please note that on-line practical demonstrations have been provided on the assessment of muscle power, tone and reflexes and cranial nerve and other functions. These should be used together with the following guide and the power point slides and can be found in the “Lessons” folder under “Central nervous system (motor)”. Although images of clinical abnormalities are provided in the power point presentation, video-clips are not. There are many video-clips given on-line of patients with the neurological abnormalities that will be described in this section of the course. Students should resource these examples themselves where indicated to obtain a better understanding of the problems noted. MOTOR FUNCTION Slide heading: Important terms and definitions often confused by students (a reminder) 1. A neuron consists of a cell body (soma), axon and presynaptic terminal. It is not a nerve (see below). 2. A nerve is a group of axons usually consisting of varying combinations of sensory, motor and autonomic neurons. Neither a neuron nor an axon are nerves. 3. A sensory neuron is a neuron with sensory receptors that when stimulated conveys sensory information to the brain. 4. A motor neuron is a neuron that when stimulated produces a motor response (such as muscle contracting). 5. A lower motor neuron (LMN)(also called an anterior or ventral horn cell, alpha motor neuron or gamma motor neuron) is the neuron providing the presynaptic terminal at the neuromuscular junction. The soma are found throughout the CNS (brain and spinal cord). 6. An upper motor neuron (UMN) is the neuron controlling LMNs. They are also found throughout the CNS. 7. Efferent refers to the direction of neuronal information travelling away from a point of reference (eg LMNs are efferent neurons). 8. Afferent refers to the direction of neuronal information travelling toward a point of reference (eg sensory neurons are afferent neurons). 9. An inteneuron (IN) is a neuron that connects two other neurons and may either inhibit or stimulate it when activated. 10. An agonist muscle refers to a muscle that when contracting produces a movement of interest. For example, for flexion at the elbow to occur the agonist is the biceps muscle. An agonist can be an antagonist for a different movement (see NB). 11. An antagonist muscle refers to a muscle that when contracting opposes a movement of interest. For example, for flexion at the elbow to occur the antagonist is the triceps muscle. An antagonist can be an agonist for a different movement (see NB). NB: Obviously for extension of the elbow the agonist is the triceps and the antagonist is the biceps. 12. Paresis refers to partial paralysis. 13. Hemiparesis refers to partial paralysis of the one side of the body. 14. Contralateral refers to opposite side of a region of interest. 15. Ipsilateral refers to same side as a region of interest. 18. Tracts. Are groups of axons which convey similar sensory or motor information. Next 3 slides: Show cross-sections (longitudinal and transverse sections) of main brain regions involved in different motor functions. These slides are for orientation purposes. Some basic neuroanatomy is required to allow for a complete understanding, but the essential anatomical areas are depicted. Motor function refers to the adequate production of smooth (coordinated) and effective (normal strength) movement in an automatic fashion (without thought). There are several brain regions required for these functions and the function of each will be highlighted. These include 1. Cerebral hemispheres involving the cortex (where the UMN is found) and internal capsule (where UMN axons travel) which produce (initiate) purposeful movement. 2. Cerebellum which coordinates movement 3. Basal ganglia which produce automatic movements (movement without thought). 4. Brainstem (midbrain, pons and medulla) and spinal cord, which contain the axons of UMNs shown in later slides and which are conveyed in tracts. 5. Motor neurons in the brainstem (extrapyramidal system) which mediate contraction of muscle necessary to maintain posture, will be shown later 6. Grey matter areas in the brainstem (cranial nerves) and the spinal cord (anterior or ventral horn) where LMNs are found and mediate the production of any movement will also be shown later. Next 6 slides: Upper motor neurons to the limbs and trunk and the course of their axons. Upper motor neurons when activated are the central signal to produce (initiate) muscle contraction and movement. With damage to UMNs, weakness (reduced muscle power) occurs. As indicated in these slides, the cell bodies of UMNs to the upper and lower limbs and trunk are found in the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe (in the precentral gyrus anterior to the middle cerebral fissure). The axons travel through the internal capsule and down through the brainstem and then spinal cord in the pyramidal (in the brainstem) and corticospinal (in the spinal cord) tracts before they synapse with LMNs. Thus, damage to any of these areas can produce weakness. UMNs are derived from both sides of the cerebral hemispheres (left and right primary motor cortices) and the axons cross (decussate) in the medulla oblongata (in the medullary pyramids). Hence, the term used to describe the tracts in the brainstem is pyramidal tract. UMNs travel down the spinal cord and terminate on and control LMNs on the opposite (contralateral) side to the soma of the UMN. In the spinal cord they mainly travel in the lateral corticospinal tract. Hence, UMNs from one side of the brain control movement on the opposite side of the body. Damage to the UMNs and tracts up until the medullary decussation cause weakness on the contralateral side and damage to the tracts in the spinal cord cause weakness on the ipsilateral side. TUTORIAL QUESTIONS Consider the following 5 patients (A-E) with a reduced muscle power (weakness) and to assess your understanding of the importance of the above description of UMNs, answer the questions below: A B C D E Power in left Reduced Reduced Reduced Normal Normal arm and leg Power in right Normal Normal Normal Reduced Reduced arm and leg More than one of the following choices may be correct 1. Patient’s A, B and C may have damage to the a. right primary motor cortex. b. left internal capsule. c. right midbrain. d. left pons. e. left spinal cord Answers: Correct are a,c,e. Damage to the UNNs in the right primary motor cortex will cause weakness of the left arm and leg as the pyramidal (corticospinal) tracts decussate in the medulla to supply the opposite side of the body. The same argument applies to the right midbrain which contains the pyramidal tracts conveying the axons from right sided UMNs. Damage to the left spinal cord in the cervical region will destroy the corticosp9nal tracts on this side which control movement on the ipsilateral side of the body. Damage to the left internal capsule or left pons will cause destruction on axons derived from UMNs in the left cortex, which supply the right side of the body. 2. Patient’s D and E may have damage to the a. right primary motor cortex. b. left internal capsule. c. right midbrain. d. left pons. e. left spinal cord Answers: Correct are b,d. As indicated above, damage to the left internal capsule or left pons will cause destruction on axons derived from UMNs in the left cortex, which supply the right side of the body. In contrast, as indicated in the above, damage to the right primary motor cortex, right midbrain, or left spinal cord will cause weakness on the left side. Headings for next 4 slides: Lower motor neurons to the limbs and trunk Lower motor neurons (LMNs) to the limbs and trunk are found in the anterior (ventral) horn of the spinal cord gray matter. LMN axons exit the spinal cord via the ventral root (motor root) where they meet with the dorsal root of the spinal cord containing sensory neurons and form the common nerve before exiting the vertebrae. LMNs target skeletal muscle and the presynaptic terminal of LMNs is part of the neuromuscular junction. LMNs are activated by UMNs to produce movement, but, as shall be discussed, are also controlled by sensory neurons. Only 2 neurons (UMN and LMN) are required to produce contraction of muscle. As with damage to UMNs, damage to LMNs in either the ventral (anterior) horn of the spinal cord, the ventral root or the common nerve will also cause weakness (loss of power). It is important that you recognize that while still within the vertebral column, LMNs exit the spinal cord to form the ventral root and then join with the dorsal root (sensory nerves) to form a common nerve. The common nerve then passes through foramina to exit the vertebral column. Thus, vertebral disc lesions (eg, slipped discs) damage common nerves more often than damaging specifically dorsal (sensory) or ventral (motor) roots. Slide heading: Lower motor neurons and muscle tone. First identify the difference between muscle “power” and muscle “tone”. This is important as in disease of the nervous system, as will be discussed later, while power may be reduced, tone may be increased. To understand the difference, use practical video clips and on-line videos to assist. As an example, compare the assessment of power and tone in the biceps muscle in the arm. Power of the biceps is tested by flexing the arm against resistance (the person examining will try and extend the arm while the patient flexes against resistance). To assess tone, the patient will be asked to relax the arm and the examiner will passively flex and extend the arm while feeling the biceps muscle tone. All of us have a degree of muscle tone and your strength does not determine the tone (someone who is well muscled is not well-toned). Muscle tone comes from a level of muscle contraction at rest and a key stimulus for the contraction at rest is from the muscle spindles (proprioceptors) constantly firing even at rest. Muscle spindles fire at all times in order to provide position sensation (proprioception) (even with your eyes closed and in a seated position, you know where your feet are). As illustrated in the figure the axons from muscle spindles not only send information up the dorsal columns to ultimately determine your ability to detect the position of limbs, but also, through the pathways discussed below for simple muscle reflexes, activate LMNs to produce muscle contraction. TUTORIAL QUESTION (more than one answer may be correct) In the assessment of muscle power of the triceps muscle, a) the patient will flex the elbow as the examiner resists this movement. b) the patient will extend the arm at the elbow as the examiner resists this movement. c) the examiner will passively extend the arm at the elbow and feel the triceps muscle. d) activation of lower motor neurons by position receptors produces muscle contraction. e) activation of lower motor neurons by upper motor neurons produces contraction. Answers: b and e. The triceps muscle extends the arm at the elbow and this is produced by UMN activation of LMNs. To assess power, the examiner must resist the patient’s movement. Passive extension around the elbow is an assessment of the degree of resting muscle spindle (position receptor) activation of LMNs at rest. Slide headings for next 5 slides: LMNs and simple muscle reflexes or monosynaptic stretch reflexes. Slides are provided without pathways and then details of the pathways are provided in the following slides (use the animation to follow them), To assist in remembering the logic, draw the pathways on the slides without the animation. Primitive movement can be achieved without the use of the brain. Indeed, patients with brain damage and no UMNs can achieve some movement through reflex pathways, a fact well known to physiotherapists who use these simple muscle reflexes to assist patients to perform daily activities. Although in humans this is a very ineffective system for producing movement, contributing very little if anything to daily activity, it has clinical relevance. Of importance and to be discussed later, as with muscle tone, simple muscle reflexes may increase when power is lost and this is a critical guide to clinicians when identifying the cause of motor dysfunction. Simple muscle reflexes are produced by activating muscle spindles found in intrafusal fibres of skeletal muscle. Muscle spindles are activated by increases in tension and hence length produced in intrafusal muscle. This can be achieved by stretching muscle (hence the term ‘stretch’ reflex) or simply transferring tension into the muscle by tapping the muscle tendon with a patellar hammer as done clinically (see figures). When activated, muscle spindles send information via sensory afferents to the dorsal root ganglion where sensory neuronal soma are found. This sensory information will then continue along the sensory neurons efferent axon and then stimulate LMNs which then cause extrafusal muscle fibres in that muscle group to contract, shorten and movement will occur. This is the basis of the assessment of muscle reflexes in a neurological examination which are listed and shown and the patellar reflex is illustrated in detail. You should use on-line practical videos to better understand how these reflexes are assessed and what it is that the examining person detects as a response (it is often just the sensation of muscle contraction). What should be noted is that resting muscle tone and muscle reflexes both depend on muscle spindle activation and require no UMN effects to produce muscle contraction. As the reflex only involves a single synapse between the proprioceptor neuron and the LMN, it is often called a monosynaptic reflex. TUTORIAL QUESTION (more than one answer may be correct) A simple muscle reflex, a) requires the presence of intact upper motor neurons. b) is produced by activation of sensory receptors in muscle tendons. c) causes intrafusal muscle to contract. d) is produced by activation of sensory receptors in muscle. e) produced by tapping the patellar tendon produces flexion of the leg. Answers: d. As with all reflexes in the body, such as the pupillary light reflex in the eyes or the corneal reflex in the face, simple muscle reflexes do not require activation of UMNs supplying LMNs. They require the presence of LMNs, which for the limbs would involve anterior horn cells and their axons and these would be activated by the efferent arm, of a sensory neuron found in dorsal toot ganglia. The sensory receptor for this sensory neuron would be found in muscle spindles which are activated by stretch of muscle or the transfer of tension from a tendon to a muscle spindle. Thus, the sensory receptors are in intrafusal muscle and the muscle that contracts in response to this is extrafusal muscle. When tapping a patellar tendon, tension is transferred to the quadriceps muscle group which shortens and extends the lower limb. Slide heading: Problem with muscle spindle design Muscle spindles lie within intrafusal fibres and these are not used to produce movement when they contract. Extrafusal fibres contract and shorten to produce movement. Hence, as illustrated in the figure when an extrafusal muscle contracts and shortens, the tension within the intrafusal fibre decreases and the muscle spindle is unloaded. As the tension in the muscle spindle is now low, it will decrease its firing rate, which in turn will reduce the firing rate of the LMN and hence muscle contraction will stop. Thus, with this design, movement will stop soon after it starts. Slide headings for next 2 slides: Solution to the problem with muscle spindle design. A slide is provided without pathways and then details of the pathways are provided in the following slide (use the animation to follow it), To assist in remembering the logic, draw the pathways on the slide without the animation. A simple solution to the problem of muscle spindle design is to ensure that when extrafusal fibres are stimulated to shorten that intrafusal fibres are stimulated to shorten in parallel with extrafusals. This will prevent unloading of the muscle spindle. This effect is produced by activation of gamma motor neurons by UMNs. Thus, when UMNs stimulate alpha motor neurons which shortens extrafusal muscle, UMNs also activate gamma motor neurons which shorten intrafusal muscle. This effect maintains muscle spindle firing even when extrafusals shorten. The loss of UMN control of gamma motor neurons such as occurs in lesions of UMNs, often results in a very short (brief or brisk) reflex through an inability to unload muscle spindles. TUTORIAL QUESTION (more than one answer may be correct) Gamma motor neuron activation, a) causes intrafusal muscle contraction. b) prevents unloading of muscle spindles. c) is mediated by sensory stimuli derived from muscle spindles. d) is required to initiate muscle shortening. e) is mediated by corticospinal tracts. Answers: a, b, and e. Gamma motor neuron activation is produced by impulses derived from UMNs that target by alpha and gamma LMNs. Unlike alpha motor neurons which cause extrafusal muscle to contract, gamma motor neurons cause intrafusal muscles to contract thus maintaining the firing of muscle spindles, Thus, their role is not to initiate muscle shortening, but to maintain constant muscle shortening, by preventing unloading of muscle spindles. Slide headings for next 3 slides: Second problem with muscle spindle design and solution. The second slide is provided without pathways and then details of the pathways are provided in the following slide (use the animation to follow it), To assist in remembering the logic, draw the pathways on the slide without the animation. The point is best illustrated with an example of quadriceps muscle contraction and extension of the lower limb. By extending the leg, the biceps femoris (the antagonist) is stretched, which in turn increases tension in the muscle spindles of this muscle group. The effect would be to produce a reflex in the biceps and flexion would now be produced. Obviously if flexion occurs at the same time as extension, the desired movement cannot occur. The solution to the problem is simply to provide a pathway that inhibits the reflex in the biceps femoris. This is produced through the pathways illustrated and the reflex is called disynaptic (two synapses), reciprocal (the reciprocal muscle group is inhibited) inhibition. Sometimes in patients with markedly increased reflexes (such as with lesions of UMNs) the ability of disynaptic reciprocal inhibition to inhibit the antagonist muscle will be ineffective. The result is that an opposing reflex is produced each time the leg flexes or extends and repeated pendular actions are noted (pendular reflexes or clonus). There are many video-clips given on-line of these patients. Students should resource these examples to obtain a better understanding of the problems noted. TUTORIAL QUESTION (more than one answer may be correct) Clonus (repeated flexion and extension movements around a joint when a muscle reflex is initiated) is a) prevented by inhibiting reflexes in antagonist muscle groups. b) caused by contraction of reciprocal muscle groups. c) caused by damage to lower motor neurons. d) caused by damage to the primary motor cortex. e) opposed by a monosynaptic reflex. Answers: a, b, and d. When producing a muscle reflex, while agonists shorten, antagonists lengthen which elicits a simple muscle reflex in reciprocal or antagonist muscle groups. This produces a limb movement in the opposite direction. To oppose this effect, activation of muscle spindles sends sensory information that also stimulates a GABA inteneuron which inhibits LMNs to antagonist muscle groups (disynaptic reciprocal inhibition). This therefore requires two (disynaptic) synapses to prevent clonus, and damage to LMNs would inhibit all reflexes including those that cause clonus. UMN damage however, as will be discussed, can increase monosynaptic reflexes to such an extent that disynaptic reciprocal inhibition is no longer effective and clonus occurs. Slide headings for next 2 slides: Golgi tendon organ reflexes The first slide is provided without pathways and then details of the pathways are provided in the following slide (use the animation to follow it), To assist in remembering the logic, draw the pathways on the slide without the animation. The force that can be generated by human muscle contraction, even in someone with little muscle mass, may be so extensive that damage to muscle may occur unless forceful movements are kept in check. This effect is mediated by Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs) found in the muscle tendon and which primarily act as position receptors (proprioceptors). When activated by forceful movement, the GTO however, not only sends signals via the dorsal columns (as with muscle spindles) to the brain, but also sends sensory signals to inteneurons which produce 2 effects. The signal inhibits LMNs to the agonist muscle to stop the movement (GTO reflex), which in the example is again the quadriceps muscle, but also stimulates LMNs to the antagonist muscle to stimulate contraction of opposing muscle forces and also stop the movement (inverse myotatic reflex). Importantly, when damage to tendons occurs (tendon rupture), after repair, GTOs will not be replaced and through significant GTO loss, patients will often experience repeated muscle injuries (muscle tears) as they are unable to limit the force produced by movement in that muscle. TUTORIAL QUESTION (more than one answer may be correct) The inverse myotatic reflex is a) mediated by activation of sensory receptors in muscle. b) mediated by activation of sensory receptors in tendons. c) causes contraction of antagonist muscle groups. d) mediated by nociceptor stimulation. e) inhibited with damage to the dorsal (posterior) columns. Answers: b and c. The reflex is mediated by position receptors (GTOs) and although activation of position receptors mediates this reflex, as with any reflex, the presence does not depend on the ability to detect sensation or on motor pathways from the brain. Unlike the simple muscle reflex, which is mediated by activation of position receptors in muscle (muscle spindles)(even though striking a tendon is used to stimulate these receptors), the GTO and inverse myotatic reflex require stimulation of GTOs in tendons to mediate these effects. These reflexes are nevertheless only mediated by strong forces (ballistic movement) applied to the tendon and cannot be activated by striking the tendon with a patellar hammer. Unlike to GTO reflex which relaxes agonists, the inverse myotatic reflex contracts antagonist when activated. Slide heading: Flexor and crossed extensor reflexes. An important primitive reflex that we have is the withdrawal reflex, which is designed to allow us to move our limbs away from a threatening (noxious) stimulus in response to mechanoreceptor activation. A good example of this reflex is your response to touching a hot stove where often you only feel the pain after you have pulled you hand away. The movement of your hand (flexion) is purely reflexive, and reaching out to balance with the other hand (extension) so that you don’t fall, is also purely reflexive. Thus, the names “flexor and crossed extensor” reflexes. You have the same reflexes in the feet which respond to just light mechanical stimulation of the lateral plantar surface of the feet and the response is plantarflexion of the toes and feet. This allows for a clinical assessment of great importance. When UMNs are lost, the reflex remains but becomes dominantly dorsiflexor in nature. This is called a positive Babinski sign. You should study the on-line practical video clips to illustrate the assessment of this reflex. There are many video-clips given on-line of patients with a positive Babinski sign. Students should resource these examples to obtain a better understanding of the problems noted. TUTORIAL QUESTION (more than one answer may be correct) A flexor plantar response is a) elicited when stimulating position receptors in the foot. b) increased with damage to the primary motor cortex. c) normally toward the dorsal rather than the plantar surface of the foot. d) is toward the dorsal surface of the foot when corticospinal tracts are damaged. e) decreased with damage to anterior horn cells. Answers: d and e. The plantar reflex is produced by activation of mechanoreceptors on the plantar surface of the foot and the response is normally flexion toward the planta surface. When UMN damage occurs, the response is not increased, but rather changes its character and results in dorsiflexion of the foot. As this is a reflex that requires intact LMNs, the reflex will decrease with damage to the anterior or ventral horn of the spinal cord where anterior or ventral horn cells are found (alpha motor neurons). Slide headings for next 5 slides: Clinical changes with LMN damage In the first of these slides please use the animation to follow the arguments. There are many video-clips given on-line of these patients and the abnormalities noted. Students should resource these examples to obtain a better understanding of the problems noted. In the lower half of the first slide, we show axons from LMNs, the neurotransmitter (acetylcholine, ACh) and the nicotinic receptors on skeletal muscle. In other words, we show the neuromuscular (NM) junction. With damage to LMNs, axons are destroyed, the amount of ACh released into synapses decreases and the receptors attempt to compensate by upregulating (more receptors and more sensitive), a process called denervation hypersensitivity. As there are less axons and ACh available at the NM junction, muscle power, tone and reflexes are all reduced. As muscle is less active it undergoes disuse and develops atrophy (wasting) showing a markedly reduced muscle bulk. As denervation hypersensitivity at the NM junction has occurred, if some axons still remain, even subliminal amounts of ACh that do not normally achieve threshold potential at the NM junction, will now act on sensitized receptors and cause small muscle contractions called fasciculations (please go on-line to identify what these look like). Although this information will not be assessed in second year by our department, as emphasized in later slides it is very useful for clinicians to remember the spinal levels of the different reflexes and movements in order to identify the area affected by a neurological problem. This allows clinicians to image appropriate areas when seeking a cause of the LMN problem. TUTORIAL QUESTION (more than one answer may be correct) In damage to the anterior horn of the spinal cord a) muscle atrophy occurs because of a reduced muscle contraction. b) fasciculations are the result of upregulation of receptors on lower motor neurons. c) muscle tone decreases due to reduced muscle spindle activity. d) muscle reflexes are decreased due to denervation hypersensitivity at the lower motor neuron. e) muscle power is reduced because of reduced reflex activity. Answers: a. Damage to LMNs (anterior horn cells) causes disuse muscle atrophy as muscle is contracted less at both rest (reduced muscle tone) and during activity (reduced muscle power). Fasciculations results from denervation hypersensitivity at the NM junction at not at the LMN. Muscle tone is reduced not because of less proprioceptor information reaching the spinal cord (through a decreased stimulation of muscle spindles), but because the LMN cannot be activated (it is destroyed). Denervation hypersensitivity at the LMN will increase and not decrease muscle reflexes. Slide headings for next 2 slides: Effects of UMN damage Please use the animation in these slides to follow the arguments. The first slide summarises the major normal influences on the LMN showing afferent information stimulating the LMN from both UMNs and from muscle spindle afferents. Importantly, when the UMN is no longer present, muscle spindle afferents still remain, Thus, although muscle power decreases, muscle tone and reflexes are not lost. There are many video-clips given on-line of these patients and the abnormalities noted. Students should resource these examples to obtain a better understanding of the problems noted. As there is less neurotransmitter (glutamate) at the synapse between afferents and the LMN, again denervation hypersensitivity occurs at the LMN (not the NM junction). Consequently, normal muscle spindle afferent activity (that mediates resting muscle tone and reflexes) will result in an enhanced LMN response and muscle tone and reflexes will increase. As indicated in the second slide, a sustained increase in muscle tone may occur in flexor muscles and this causes spasticity of muscles and contractures (muscle becomes fixed in a specific flexor position). A primary role of physiotherapists and occupational therapists is to prevent these problems often using splints. As muscle contraction is even higher than normal at rest, although muscle is not being used for movement, disuse and atrophy does not occur. As indicated in previous sections, a positive Babinski sign also occurs in UMN problems, although the exact mechanism is uncertain. Importantly, in UMN damage, there is no activation of gamma motor neurons and hence the reflex is not only increased in amplitude, but through an inability to overcome muscle spindle unloading through gamma motor neuron reflexes, the reflex is short duration. Thus, in UMN damage, the reflex is best described as brisk (increased amplitude but short duration). Furthermore, sometimes the reflex is so pronounced that disynaptic reciprocal inhibition is insufficient to prevent reflexes in antagonist muscles occurring. The consequence is that the reflex, once initiated, induces a reflex in the antagonist and then the agonist, and then the antagonist, and so on. This causes pendular reflexes (they look like a pendulum of a clock) or repeated reflexes called clonus. TUTORIAL QUESTIONS In damage to the corticospinal tracts a) muscle atrophy occurs because of a reduced muscle contraction. b) increased muscle reflexes occur because of upregulation of receptors on lower motor neurons. c) muscle tone increases due to increased muscle spindle activity. d) a dorsiflexor plantar response is observed. e) muscle reflexes are of brief duration because of a loss of gamma motor neuron activation. Answers: b, d and e. Muscle atrophy does not occur in UMN (such as corticospinal tract, primary motor cortex or internal capsule) lesions as muscle contraction at rest (muscle tone) us increased. Both muscle tone and reflexes are increased in UMN lesions as the loss of UMN release of neurotransmitter onto LMNs, results in denervation hypersensitivity (including upregulation of receptors) at the LMN cell body (in the anterior horn). In UMN lesions, the plantar reflex is dorsiflexor in nature. A loss of UMNs results in less gamma motor neuron activity and hence an inability to maintain muscle spindle firing when extrafusal muscles contract. Thus, the reflex, although of increased amplitude, is of short duration. Consider the 5 patients (A-E) described in the first few questions above and two additional patients (F and G) with a reduced muscle power (weakness). To assess your understanding of the importance of the above dscription of LMNs and UMNs, answer the questions below: A-E F G Power Reduced in an Reduced in Reduced in arm and leg both legs left leg Muscle tone/ Increased in same Reduced in Reduced in simple reflexes arm and leg both legs left leg Additional signs Babinski sign Fasciculations Atrophy in left leg Atrophy in both legs _________________________________________________________________________ More than one of the following choices may be correct 1. Patient F is most likely to have damage to the a. lateral corticospinal tracts. b. ventral (anterior) horn of the spinal cord. c. common nerve at cervical level 6 (C6). d. dorsal (posterior) root of the spinal cord. e. common nerve at a lower thoracic/upper lumbar level. Answers: b and e. Damage to corticospinal tracts will result in UMN signs and hence will not cause fasciculations or muscle atrophy. Damage to ventral horn cells on both sides will cause LMN signs (fasciculations and atrophy) in both legs. Common nerve problems (LMN) at the cervical level will cause problems in only the arm and not the leg. Damage to the dorsal root of the spinal cord will produce sensory and not motor problems. Damage to common nerves at the lumbar-sacral level will cause LMN signs in both legs as long as it is bilateral. 2. Patient G is most likely to have damage to the a. lateral corticospinal tracts. b. ventral (anterior) horn of the spinal cord. c. common nerve at cervical level 6 (C6). d. dorsal (posterior) root of the spinal cord. e. common nerve at a lower thoracic/upper lumbar level. Answers: b and e. Damage to corticospinal tracts will result in UMN signs and hence will not cause muscle atrophy. Damage to ventral horn cells on one side will cause LMN signs (atrophy) in one leg. Common nerve problems (LMN) at the cervical level will cause problems in only the arm and not the leg. Damage to the dorsal root of the spinal cord will produce sensory and not motor problems. Damage to a common nerve on one side at the lumbar-sacral level will cause LMN signs in one leg. 3. The increased reflexes in patient’s A-E are most likely caused by a. denervation hypersensitivity at the neuromuscular junction. b. denervation hypersensitivity of neurons in the spinal cord. c. damage to upper motor neurons. d. damage to lower motor neurons. e. increased muscle spindle activation. Answers: b and c. Increased reflexes occur un UMN lesions (primary motor cortex, internal capsule or corticospinal tracts) because of denervation hypersensitivity of LMNs in the spinal cord. 4. The reduced muscle tone in patient’s F and G is most likely caused by a. atrophy of muscle. b. a reduced withdrawal reflex. c. a decreased muscle spindle activity. d. damage to lower motor neurons. e. denervation hypersensitivity at the neuromuscular junction. Answers: d. Decreased muscle tone occurs in LMN lesions (ventral horn cell, ventral root or common nerve) because of an inability of normal muscle spindle sensory information to activate LMNs. Although atrophy does occur in LMN lesions this is not the cause of a reduced muscle tone, but rather the consequence of LMN damage. 5. The fasciculations in patient F are most likely caused by a. damage to lower motor neurons. b. damage to upper motor neurons. c. an increased muscle spindle activity. d. denervation hypersensitivity of receptors on the lower motor neuron. e. denervation hypersensitivity of receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Answers: a and e. Fasciculations re the result of damage to LMNs which result in upregulation of nicotinic receptors at the NM junction. 6. The additional sign noted in patient’s A to E is a. caused by damage to lower motor neurons. b. caused by damage to upper motor neurons. c. a reduced patellar tendon reflex. d. a dorsiflexor plantar reflex. e. caused by upregulation of nicotinic receptors. Answers: b and d. With UMN damage, the plantar reflex changes from plantarflexor to dorsiflexor in nature and this is called a positive Babinski sign. 7. Patient’s A to E are also likely to show a. contractures caused by an increased muscle tone. b. brief reflexes caused by reduced alpha motor neuron effects. c. clonus caused by antagonist muscle stretch. d. atrophy of weak limbs. e. an inability to reflexively withdraw from noxious stimuli. Answers: a and c. UMN damage may cause such marked increases in muscle tone that limbs become fixed in specific positions (mainly in a flexed position). These are called contractures. Although brief reflexes are produced by UMN damage, this is because of an inability to activate gamma motor neurons which results in an inability to maintain normal muscle spindle firing as the muscle shortens and the muscle spindle is unloaded. Clonus is caused by such marked increases in the amplitude of simple muscle reflexes, that disynaptic reciprocal inhibition prevents reflexes occurring in antagonist muscle groups. UMN lesions do not cause muscle atrophy as muscle tone is increased at rest (through enhanced sensitivity of LMNs to muscle spindle afferent information). Reflexes, such as the withdrawal reflex (as in the plantar reflex), are not decreased in UMN lesions, but they may change in their characteristics. Slide headings for next 2 slides: Motor homunculus The UMNs are distributed in the motor cortex in a somatotopic order (UMNs for regions of the body are found together) illustrated in these 2 slides. This is called a motor homunculus and more detailed diagrams may be found in any textbook of physiology. The detailed distribution is of little relevance except to note two facts. First, as illustrated in the first slide, the UMNs for the leg and feet are found medially and the rest laterally. As the anterior cerebral artery supplies the medial part of the frontal lobe, strokes involving this artery may cause weakness of just the foot and leg on one side. In contrast, because the middle cerebral artery supplies the remaining part of the motor cortex as well as the internal capsule (where all UMN axons are found), strokes in this vascular territory result in a complete hemiparesis. Second, as illustrated in the second slide, it is important to note that the distribution of the UMNs for the hands, face, mouth and tongue are as extensive as that for the legs, feet and trunk. This is a reflection of human dependence for survival on verbal communication, facial expression and manual dexterity. Other creatures do not have the same representation of UMNs as they depend far less on these functions for survival. A third important point is illustrated in the first slide. The intrinsic neural plans for movement are found in areas of the frontal lobe anterior to medial and lateral components of the primary motor cortex. In this regard, the supplementary motor cortex lies medially largely in front of the UMNs for the leg and feet and the premotor cortex laterally in front of UMNs for the rest of the body. Generally, because these areas are so closely linked to the primary motor cortex, damage to these areas simply causes weakness. TUTORIAL QUESTION (more than one answer may be correct) Weakness in the leg and foot on the right side only, could occur in response to a) occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. b) damage to the medial portion of the left motor cortex. c) damage to the lateral portion of the right motor cortex. d) occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery. e) damage to the right side of the lumbar spinal cord. Answers: b, d and e. UMNs that initiate movement in the right foot and leg are found on the medial part of the left motor homunculus (primary motor cortex). Hence damage ton this area, such as may occur when blood flow is reduced by an obstruction in the anterior cerebral artery, mat cause weakness of the right foot and leg. In addition, corticospinal tracts in the lumbar-sacral region on the right control movement of the right foot and leg. Damage to the left middle cerebral artery would cause weakness on the whole right side as it supplies blood to the internal capsule. Slide headings for the next 3 slides: Motor control of the head and neck (general information) As with motor control of the limbs and trunk, motor control of the head and neck is also initiated by UMNs and mediated by LMNs. What is often poorly appreciated, is that UMNs that control head and neck movement are also found in the primary motor cortex (as described above), but that they target LMNs in the brainstem as opposed to the spinal cord. These LMNs for the head and neck are found in cranial nerve nucleii in the midbrain, pons and medulla. What is also generally poorly appreciated is that unlike LMNs controlling limb and trunk movement, with a few exceptions (which are important to know), LMNs controlling head and neck movement generally have UMNs influencing their function derived from both left and right motor cortices. That is, LMNs for the head and neck are best described as having bilateral UMN supply. In contrast, LMNs for the limb and trunk are best described as having contralateral UMN supply (see previous descriptions). The second slide highlights the importance of the difference in UMN control of limbs and trunk versus head and neck. In this slide, one motor cortex is destroyed. Because cranial nerve LMNs still receive UMN information from the contralateral cortex, motor function to the head and neck is not lost. However, because LMNs to the limbs and trunk receive information only from one cortex, motor function for the limbs and trunk is lost on the contralateral side. Thus, with the exceptions discussed below, in general, abnormalities of cranial nerve function (head and neck movement), can only occur if damage to the brainstem (bulbar palsies) or the cranial nerves themselves has occurred. Obviously if both motor cortices or motor pathways going through the internal capsules or pyramidal tracts are destroyed then abnormalities of head and neck function on both sides will be noted (a pseudobulbar palsy), but patients seldom survive such advanced degrees of damage. The third slide highlights the fact that there are 2 cranial nerve nucleii which are exceptions to the rule regarding bilateral UMN supply. Indeed, LMNs of the facial (VIIth cranial nerve [CN] nucleus) supplying the lower half of the face, and LMNs to the hypoglossal (XIIth CN nucleus) controlling tongue movement, also only receive contralateral UMN supply (as with the limbs and trunk). The clinical importance of this information will be highlighted in subsequent slides. Slide headings for the next 15 slides: Motor control of the head and neck (specific cranial nerve effects). The next 15 slides describe the motor function of specific CN nuclei (LMNs) and associated UMN effects and the motor abnormalities noted with neural damage. These slides should be used together with the practical demonstrations provided on-line on the assessment of cranial nerve function. There are many video-clips given on-line of patients with cranial nerve abnormalities. Students should resource these examples to obtain a better understanding of the problems noted. These slides are fairly self-explanatory and require only some additional discussion. Please note that for the slide for II, IV and VIth CN abnormalities given in cartoon form, you need to use the animation to show you the abnormalities. To remember the effect on the eyes of these CN nuclei, just simply remember the direction of the squint produced when one or the other CN is damaged. The slides entitled VIIth (facial) cranial nerve and UMN control, you need to understand several major points that are very useful clinically. First follow the UMN supply of LMNs to the upper and lower halves of the face. Remind yourself which movements are produced in the upper and lower half of the face first and then that LMNs to the upper half of the face receive bilateral UMN supply, while LMNs to the lower half of the face receive contralateral UMN supply. Then follow the animation on the slides entitled UMN 7th CN palsy and LMN 7th CN palsy. What you should understand about these slides is that when damage to UMNs to the facial nerve occurs (such damage to the motor cortex or internal capsule) that only the lower half of the face will be weak, but when damage to LMNs occurs (nucleus or nerve) there will be weakness of both the upper and lower half of the face. The above information on cranial nerve VII (facial) is critical, as weakness of muscles of facial expression are often the first abnormality noted by a clinician (the patient will not be able to smile on one side). If the patient is also weak in one arm and leg, but the movement of the upper half of the face (including an ability to close the eye) is intact, the damage to the brain is likely to be in the motor cortex or internal capsule. The same logic applies to the XIIth CN (hypoglossal) and weakness that may be produced by damage to UMNs to this nerve. As with the UMN supply to the LMNs supplying the lower half of the face, which is from only one motor cortex (contralateral), the UMN supply to the LMNs supplying the tongue muscles, is from only one motor cortex only (contralateral). Consequently, with damage to the motor cortex or the internal capsule on one side, an inability to show facial expression in the lower half of the face, an inability to move the leg and arm, and deviation of the tongue to the side of the weakness on protrusion may occur, while all other CN functions will remain intact. TUTORIAL QUESTIONS Consider the following (previously described) 5 patients (A-E) with a reduced muscle power (weakness) and to assess your understanding of the importance of the above description of the motor control of the head and neck, answer the questions below: A B C D E Power in left Reduced Reduced Reduced Normal Normal arm and leg Power in right Normal Normal Normal Reduced Reduced arm and leg Facial Reduced Normal Reduced Reduced Normal Expression upper and lower half lower half lower half on left on right on right Masseter Weak on Normal Normal Normal Normal Right Eye deviation Medial Lateral Normal Normal Normal on right on right Pupillary reflex Normal Reduced direct Normal Normal Normal on right Ptosis None Right None None None Gag reflex Normal Normal Normal Normal Normal Tongue on Normal Normal Deviated Deviated Normal protruson 1. The patient most likely to have damage to the right pons is a. A. b. B. c. C. d. D. e. E. Answer: a (patient A). Damage to the right pons would affect the pyramidal (corticospinal) tracts controlling the left side of the body, and hence weakness would be on the left. Damage in the pons would also affect the Vth (trigeminal), VIth (abducent) and VIIth (facial) cranial nerves on that side. This would result in a weakness of the muscles of mastication on the same side (Vth), medial deviation of the right eye (VIth) and a LMN VIIth cranial nerve palsy with weakness of both the upper and lower facial muscles of expression on the right side. 2. The patient most likely to have damage to the right internal capsule is a. A. b. B. c. C. d. D. e. E. Answer: c (patient C). Damage to the right internal capsule would affect the motor tracts controlling the left side of the body, and hence weakness would be on the left. Although this lesion would affect the UMNs controlling the LMNs in all cranial nerve nuclei, most motor function of the head and neck would be retained. This is because UMNs going through the opposite internal capsule supply cranial nerve nuclei on both sides of the brainstem, Thus, cranial nerve function would largely be intact. However, there are two exceptions where there is no bilateral UMN control of LMNs to the head and neck. This applies to the LMNs supplying muscles of facial expression of the lower half of the face, and to the LMNs supplying the tongue. Thus, facial expression for the lower half of the left face and the ability to use tongue muscles on the left are reduced. 3. The patient most likely to have damage to the left motor cortex is a. A. b. B. c. C. d. D. e. E. Answer: d (patient D). Damage to the left motor cortex would affect the motor tracts controlling the right side of the body, and hence weakness would be on the right. Although this lesion would affect the UMNs controlling the LMNs in all cranial nerve nuclei (if involving the whole left motor cortex), most motor function of the head and neck would be retained. This is because UMNs from the opposite motor cortex supply cranial nerve nuclei on both sides of the brainstem, Thus, cranial nerve function would largely be intact. However, there are two exceptions where there is no bilateral UMN control of LMNs to the head and neck. This applies to the LMNs supplying muscles of facial expression of the lower half of the face, and to the LMNs supplying the tongue. Thus, facial expression for the lower half of the right face and the ability to use tongue muscles on the right are reduced. 4. The patient most likely to have damage to the right midbrain is a. A. b. B. c. C. d. D. e. E. Answer: b (patient B). Damage to the right midbrain would affect the pyramidal (corticospinal) tracts controlling the left side of the body, and hence weakness would be on the left. Damage in the midbrain would also affect the IIIrd (oculomotor) cranial nerve on that side. This would result in a weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, resulting in a ptosis on the right, lateral deviation of the right eye dues to an inability to use all extraocular muscles on that side except the superior oblique and the lateral rectus, and a reduced direct pupillary light reflex in that eye due to a loss of parasympathetic effects on pupillary constriction. 5. The reduced facial expression in patient’s C and D is caused by damage to the a. VIIth cranial nerve (facial nerve) nucleus. b. VIIth cranial nerve axons. c. VIIth cranial nerve upper motor neurons. d. middle ear. e. facial muscles. Answer: c. Weakness of the lower half of the face (when assessing muscles of facial expression) indicates that the patient has an upper motor neuron VIIth cranial nerve palsy. When damage to UMNs to the head and neck occur on one side of the brain, little obvious weakness is the consequence as most cranial nerve LMNs receive UMNs from both (left and right) motor cortices (bilateral supply). Thus, damage to UMNs on side is compensated for by the remaining supply from the opposite side. The exception to this rule is for LMNs in the VIIth cranial nerve controlling the lower half of the face (facial; expression) and the XIIth cranial nerve. Thus, weakness of muscles of facial expression of the lower half of the face only implies that damage to UMNs controlling the facial nerve has occurred. 6. Patient’s C and D are likely to show a reduced a. ability to elevate the eye. b. corneal reflex. c. ability to smile. d. ability to chew on food. e. muscle mass (wasting or atrophy) of the cheek. Answer: c. Weakness of facial muscles involved in facial expression of the lower half of the face reduce the ability to smile. The ability to elevate the eye is a function of the IIIrd cranial nerve (levator palpabrae superioris) and the ability to chew is a function of the Vth cranial nerve, neither which would be affected in UMN lesions. Although the corneal reflex efferent (motor) component involves muscles of facial expression (closing the eye), and hence ethe VIIth cranial nerve, the function of the upper half of the face is not affected in UMN lesions (see above). Although muscles of facial expression in the lower half of the face provide muscle bulk for the cheek, the lesion is an UMN lesion where resting muscle tone is increased and hence wasting does not occur. 7. Patient B is likely to show a reduced a. consensual pupillary reflex on the left. b. movement of right eye on looking left. c. corneal reflex on right. d. function of the VIth cranial nerve. e. muscle mass of the forehead. Answer: b. The lesion has affected the function of the IIIrd (oculomotor) cranial nerve on the right, which would lead to lateral deviation of the right eye. Looking left will therefore make the strabismus (squint) worse. As the IInd (optic) cranial nerve is intact on both sides, and there is no abnormality in the IIIrd cranila nerve on the left, shining a light in the right eye will produce a normal pupillary constrictor response on the left (consensual reflex). Medial (not lateral) deviation of the eye occurs in VIth cranial nerve problems and the muscle bulk of the forehead and the motor component of the corneal reflex would be controlled by the VIIth cranial nerve, which is unaffected. 8. Patient D is likely to show a. deviation of the tongue on protrusion to the left. b. wasting (atrophy) of tongue muscles. c. an inability to turn the head. d. weakness of tongue muscles on the right. e. fasciculations of tongue muscles. Answer: d. The lesion is damage to the UMNs derived from the primary motor cortex on the left. Most head and neck motor functions would be retained (including the ability to turn the head) because of bilateral UMN supply to LMNs controlling the head and neck. The result is that damage on one side of the brain is compensated for by control from the other side. However, the VIIth (lower half of the face only) and XIIth cranial nerve LMNs are the exception to this rule, and hence VIIth and XIIth cranial nerve signs are observed when UMN damage occurs. As damage is to UMNs on the left, then the function of right sided tongue muscles are affected, and on protrusion this would result in deviation of the tongue to the right. As this is an UMN lesion, muscle tone in the tongue will increase and wasting will not occur. Moreover, being an UMN lesion, upregulation of receptors at the NM junction will not occur and hence fasciculations will not be observed. Slide heading: Coordination of movement (the cerebellum and associated systems) As previously indicated, the cerebellum and associated systems are central to producing coordinated movement. Importantly, weakness caused by UMN or LMN problems will produce uncoordinated movement, but in these instances, weakness of muscle is the cause. When damage to the cerebellum or associated systems occurs, muscle strength is entirely intact, but ataxic movements (uncoordinated movement) will be noted. Slide heading: Pyramidal versus extrapyramidal system. As will be discussed the cerebellum coordinates movement by modifying the activity of several motor systems. In this regard, essential systems through which the cerebellum controls movement include not only the motor cortex and the pyramidal system (described above), but also through a motor system called the extrapyramidal system. The extrapyramidal system consists of several nuclei in the brainstem where UMNs are found (red nucleus, reticular nucleus and vestibular nuclei), and the tracts in the spinal cord conveying the axons of the UMNs in these nuclei (rubrospinal, reticulospinal and vestibulospinal tracts). These UMNs target the same LMNs as the corticospinal tracts, but do not produce purposeful muscle contraction. Rather, their essential role is to induce contraction of any muscle group when it is required for posture (to maintain position against gravitational and other forces). As an example, when you walk, leg and arm muscles may shorten to produce purposeful movement, but if your back and neck muscles did not contract you would not stand erect and face up as you walked (postural muscle contraction). It should be obvious that without appropriate posture, coordinated movements would not be possible. Slide headings for the next 3 slides: Cerebellar afferents and efferents and coordinated movement. The cerebellum produces coordinated movements by comparing motor plans with actual movements and fine tuning the motor outputs. Thus, the cerebellum must receive information about both the plan for movement and the actual movement itself. The best way to signal the movement that has occurred is through position receptors (proprioceptors). Indeed, if one evaluates the afferent (inputs) to the cerebellum (first slide), information about the motor plan comes from the primary, pre- and supplementary motor cortices via the various pathways shown. Information about the positional change produced by the body from somatic proprioceptors (muscle spindles, GTOs and joint receptors) (via the dorsal columns) for limbs and trunk and the semicircular canals (via the vestibular nucleus) for the head and neck, similarly also arrives via the pathways shown. To fine tune the motor outputs, the cerebellum must influence systems that both initiate movement and control posture. Indeed, if one evaluates the efferent (outputs) from the cerebellum (second slide), both pyramidal and extrapyramidal systems are modified. To follow the sequence of information received and transmitted by the cerebellum, follow the animated arrows on the final slide entitled “coordinated movement”. From this slide it should be obvious that for coordinated movement to occur three functions determine the efficacy of movement (somatic proprioception, vestibular function and the cerebellum) and that if any one of these functions is disturbed ataxia is the result. Slide heading: Distinguishing different causes of ataxia. As highlighted in the above discussion, 3 factors determine the ability to produce coordinated movement in the absence of a reduced muscle power. Identifying the cause of ataxia is essential to the management of such patients. A useful approach is to ask patients first to stand with their legs together with their eyes closed. An ataxic patient will be unstable and tend to overbalance. Importantly, if the patient then opens their eyes and by looking at their feet to detect position, this improves their balance, then the cause of the problem is likely to be a somatic proprioceptor problem. This is called a positive Romberg’s sign. Neither cerebellar nor vestibular problems can be compensated for by looking at the position of the feet. In the case of vestibular problems, the ataxia is caused by an inability to detect position, but in this case it is the position of the head that is detected and one cannot see the position of the head. To distinguish between cerebellar and vestibular causes, additional tests should be performed. Vestibular problems are caused either by damage to the vestibular apparatus, the vestibulocochlear nerve (VIIIth CN) or the nucleus of the nerve, and these alterations are normally associated with vertigo and abnormal tests of hearing (Rinne’s, Weber’s or more advanced tests). Ataxia in cerebellar disease is associated with several additional cerebellar signs including vertigo and these abnormalities will be described. Slide heading: How does the cerebellum integrate information? To understand some of the cerebellar signs that will be described, a few further facts regarding cerebellar function are necessary. First, it is important to note that, as indicated in this slide, that afferent information to the cerebellum activates two areas, the first being cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and the second being cortical cells. The ability of the cerebellum to fine-tune movement is determined by too much activation of the DCN being compensated for by inhibitory GABA effects produced by cortical cells. As DCN cells are the outputs from the cerebellum, predominantly damage to the DCN will reduce motor outputs and predominantly damage to the cortical cells will increase motor outputs from the cerebellum. This will influence muscle tone as described in subsequent slides. Slide heading: Vestibulo-occular reflex (VOR) and the cerebellar control thereof An additional fact regarding cerebellar function that is important to your understanding of cerebellar signs, is the role of the cerebellum in influencing eye movements. The VOR is an essential reflex for our survival. It maintains our ability to look forward (eg when running away from danger such as when a motor vehicle approaches behind you) while turning the head to listen for the sound of danger behind you (eg listening for the sound of the motor vehicle approaching behind you). The VOR is mediated by activation of the semicircular canal when turning the head which through the vestibular nucleus controls III, IV and VI CN nuclei. There are nevertheless times when moving the eyes to the side with the head turn is important. The cerebellum essentially provides a quick (reflexive) pathway for doing this by inhibiting the vestibular nucleus and hence the VOR. When this effect is lost through cerebellar disease, one can still move the eyes with a head turn, but this requires a slower cerebral cortical pathway to achieve this effect and the effect is not sustained. Thus, with cerebellar disease, the head turns, the eyes remain forward and then only after a brief moment do they move to the side. They then drift back to face forward before the cerebral cortical pathway forces them back to the side again. They then drift back again and the whole process is repeated over and over. The eyes therefore move from side to side repeatedly and this is called nystagmus. There are many causes of nystagmus, the common one of which is activation of the semicircular canals by ear infections or damage to the VIIIth CN. Slide headings for next 2 slides: Abnormal cerebellar function. Based on your understanding of the above information on cerebellar function and the function of associated systems, these 2 slides should be self-explanatory. There are many video-clips given on-line of these patients and the abnormalities noted. Students should resource these examples to obtain a better understanding of the problems noted. TUTORIAL QUESTIONS Consider the following 3 patients (H-J) who complained of “clumsiness” when walking and were noted to have an ataxic gait. To assess your understanding of the importance of the above description of motor coordination, answer the questions below: H I J Muscle power Normal Normal Normal Muscle tone Normal Increased Normal Muscle reflexes Normal Normal Normal Romberg’s sign Positive Negative Negative Rinne’s test Normal Normal Reduced bone and air conduction Nystagmus No Yes Yes Dysmetria No Yes No 1. The patient (s) most likely to have damage to the cerebellum are a. H. b. I. c. J. d. I and J. Answer: b (I). This patient has an inability to balance with either the eyes open or closed (negative Romberg’s sign). Thus, this patient has either a cerebellar or a vestibular problem causing the ataxic gait. It cannot be a problem with the detection of position sensation (such as may occur with damage to the posterior columns or medial lemniscus). If it was, a positive Romberg’s sign (improved ability to balance with the eyes open) would have been noted. Importantly, muscle power (strength) in this patient is normal and hence weakness (caused by UMN, LMN or muscle disorders) is not the cause of the problem. This patient has a normal hearing and hence middle ear or VIIIth cranial nerve function is intact. This patient has several cerebellar signs including an increased muscle tone and the presence of dysmetria, the latter which are sensitive assessments of the ability to perform fine, coordinated movements. 2. The patient (s) most likely to have abnormal sensory inputs to the VIIIth cranial nerve are a. H. b. I. c. J. d. I and J. Answer: c (patient J). A reduced bone conduction (cannot hear when tuning fork is placed over the mastoid process) occurs when there is damage to the inner ear (cochlea) or the VIIIth cranial nerve or its nucleus. If there was a reduced air, but a normal bone conduction (cannot hear tuning fork vibrating when placed next to the ear, but can hear it vibrating when placed over the mastoid process), then this would indicate damage to the middle or outer ears. 3. The patient (s) most likely to have damage to the dorsal columns are a. H. b. I. c. J. d. I and J. Answer: a (patient H). A positive Romberg’s sign in a patient with ataxia and a normal muscle power indicates a loss of position sensation. These patient’s can balance when they are looking at the position of their limbs, but are unable to balance when the eyes are closed. 4. The patient (s) most likely to complain of vertigo are a. H. b. I. c. J. d. I and J. Answer: d (patients I and J). Vertigo may occur in either cerebellar disease or in vestibular disease. In cerebellar disease, the cerebellum is no longer able to inhibit the vestibular nucleus, a normal action necessary to suppress the vestibulo-occular reflex and hence allow for the eyes to turn as the head turns. An inability to suppress vestibular activity results in increased amount for vestibular information reaching the vestibular cortex, the result being an unusual sense of the surroundings revolving around the patient. In vestibular disease, an increased amount of vestibular information reaches the vestibular cortex, producing the same effect. 5. The patient (s) most likely to have a muscle tremor when writing are a. H. b. I. c. J. d. I and J. Answer: b (patient I). An intention tremor occurs in cerebellar disease and is a manifestation of unco-ordinated fine movement or ataxia with fine movements. Thus, the cause is an inability to adequately integrate the information of motor plans received by the cerebrum when movement is initiated, with the information received on the actual movement produced (via position receptors and vestibular inputs) and consequently to modify movements through cerebellar outputs. 6. Patient H is most likely to be able to stand with his legs together a. without falling with his eyes closed. b. and still fall with his eyes open. c. without falling with his eyes open. d. and balance either with his eyes open or closed. Answer: c. A positive Romberg’s sign is when a patient over-balances when standing with their legs together with the eyes closed, which is then rectified by opening their eyes and looking at the position of their feet. 7. Patient J is most likely to be able to stand with his legs together a. without falling with his eyes closed. b. and still fall with his eyes open. c. without falling with his eyes open. d. and balance either with his eyes open or closed. Answer: b. A negative Romberg’s sign is when a patient over-balances when standing with their legs together with the eyes closed, which is then unable to be corrected by opening their eyes and looking at the position of their feet. This occurs in vestibular disease because although opening the eyes allows one to improve the sense of position of the feet relative to space, the vestibular apparatus is employed to detect the position of the head in space, which cannot be corrected by visual cues as one cannot see the head. 8. The increased muscle tone in patient I is most likely caused by a. upper motor neuron damage. b. increased deep cerebellar nuclear cell activity. c. increased cerebellar cortical cell activity. d. an increased muscle mass (hypertrophy). Answer: b. In cerebellar disease, if cortical damage predominates, there is insufficient GABA inhibitory effects from cortical cells on deep cerebellar nuclear cells. The consequence is deep cerebellar nuclear cells will have a high activity and hence stimulate an increased activity of extrapyramidal systems controlling posture including the reticulo-, rubro- and vestibulo-spinal systems. 9. The dysmetria in patient I is most likely caused by a. a reduced premotor cortical activity. b. weakness of the hands and fingers. c. an inability to compensate for a loss of position sensation because of nystagmus. d. a decreased ability to compare movement with motor plans. Answer: b. In cerebellar disease, dysmetria is one manifestation of unco-ordinated fine movement or ataxia with fine movements. The cause is an inability to adequately integrate the information of motor plans received by the cerebrum when movement is initiated, with the information received on the actual movement produced (via position receptors and vestibular inputs) and consequently to modify movements through cerebellar outputs. Slide headings for next 5 slides: The production of automatic movement: The basal ganglia and abnormalities thereof. Effective movement has to be spontaneous and performed without thought (automatic). Imagine how ineffective walking would be if you had to think about each muscle contracting before the muscle is activated and movement occurs. Hence, every movement we make we first learn and then store as motor memories (the motor plan). The motor plan is thought to be largely found in the premotor and supplementary motor association cortices. To activate these memories we use the thalamus (all information going to the cerebral cortices has to come from the thalamus). The signal to activate these memories comes from the motor cortex, but to retrieve the plan for movement, motor memories first activate a circuit to increase thalamic cell firing This circuit is the basal ganglia circuit involved in motor control. The first slide shows the anatomical location of the various basal ganglia involved in producing automatic movement. Please note that the basal ganglia are also involved in limbic control (emotions, etc), but use different components to do this. The second slide shows some of the details of these circuits. Importantly, to access motor memories the inhibitory effects of the basal ganglia on the thalamus (via GABA) need to be removed. These inhibitory effects are in place to stop the recall of motor memories at inappropriate times. To prevent basal ganglia inhibition of thalamic cells, dopamine in the striatum has two effects mediated through direct and indirect pathways. You should follow these pathways to note that the effects of dopamine via either pathway are to decrease GABA effects on thalamic cells and hence to recall motor memories. The third and fourth slides show what happens when dopamine effects are lost in the basal ganglia (as occurs in Parkinson’s disease) and what one can do clinically to oppose the loss of dopamine. You should follow the pathways carefully to understand these effects. Importantly, the major effect of a loss of dopamine is an inability to retrieve motor memories automatically and hence in order to move patients with these problems have to think about the movement before they can move. The consequence is a general decrease in movement called bradykinesia. This is expressed in a decreased facial expression, an inability to start walking or to stop moving forward when the need to stop occurs. When walking, patients also don’t swing their arms. When sitting these patients will hardly move and over time any movement becomes more and more difficult until they reach a point of complete catatonia where no movement at all occurs. There are many video-clips given on- line of these patients and the abnormalities noted. Students should resource these examples to obtain a better understanding of the problems noted. Although these patients develop a particular form of tremor and increased muscle tone, called a pill-rolling tremor (it looks like the patient is rolling a pill between thumb and forefinger) and cog-wheel rigidity (muscle tone which comes and goes as the arm is flexed or extended), the mechanisms of these changes are far more complex and best dealt with in later years. The fifth slide shows what occurs when certain components of the basal ganglia are lost which prevent the inhibitory effects of GABA on the thalamus. This causes the retrieval of motor memories at inappropriate times which result in bizarre movements called choreiform movements or ballismus. There are many video-clips given on-line of these patients and the abnormalities noted. Students should resource these examples to obtain a better understanding of the problems noted. These problems occur in children with a particular form of cerebral palsy caused by damage to the striatum (when childhood jaundice occurs [kernicterus] and bilirubin destroys the striatum [or globus pallidus] or with particularly difficult deliveries [eg breech deliveries] when the striatum is destroyed by damage to the head during delivery). These problems also occur occasionally in rheumatic fever when the striatum is destroyed by auto-antibodies against group B streptococcal infections, or in genetic disorders of the central nervous system (Sydenham’s or Huntington’s chorea). TUTORIAL QUESTIONS (more than one answer may be correct) 1. Dopamine release from cells derived from the substantia nigra results in a) increased activity of subthalamic nuclear cells. b) activation of striatal inhibitory dopamine 1 receptors. c) an enhanced recall of motor plans. d) stimulation of caudate nucleus neurons. e) an increased activity of thalamic neuronal firing. Answers: c, d and e. Release of dopamine from the substantia nigra (SN) activates both inhibitory D2 receptors and excitatory D1 receptors in the caudate nucleus and putamen (striatum). The effect is ultimately to increase thalamic cell firing and hence enhance the recall of motor plans and produce automatic movement (movement without thought). The striatal effects are in part mediated by effects on the globus pallidus which result in decreased firing of the subthalamic nucleus and thus a reduced amount of ACh release from neurons found within the subthalamic nucleus. 2. Bradykinesia (reduced automatic movement) a) is prevented by blocking muscarinic receptors. b) is produced by blocking dopamine receptors. c) in Parkison’s disease occurs with a loss of muscle power. d) is prevented by damaging the substantia nigra. e) is prevented by pacing the subthalamic nucleus. Answers: a, b and e. Activation of dopamine (DA) receptors in the striatum is the essential mediator of the ability to perform movement without thought. A loss of this ability, by either blocking DA receptors in the striatum (a side effect of antipsychotic agents), or through damage to the substantia nigra (SN) (which then decreases the releases of DA onto the SN), is what causes bradykinesia in Parkinson’s disease. The inability to perform automatic movement is not through a reduced muscle power as, when muscle contraction does occur (such as when the patient actively thinks about the movement), power is normal. The treatment involves the administration of L-DOPA, the dopamine precursor together with agents that prevent the breakdown of dopamine (the combined effect is to increase dopamine in neuronal cells in the SN), muscarinic receptor blockers, which decrease the inhibitory effects of GABA producing neurons in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra on thalamic cells, and pacing of the subthalamic nucleus which also decreases the inhibitory effects of GABA producing neurons in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra on thalamic cells. 3. Choreoathetosis a) occurs in response to increased GABA effects on thalamic cells. b) occurs with damage to the globus pallidus. c) is an increased recall of motor memories at inappropriate times. d) is prevented with the use of L-DOPA. e) is prevented by pacing the subthalamic nucleus. Answers: b and c. Choreoathetosis is continuous involuntary writhing movements that occur in response to the recall of motor plans or memories at inappropriate times. They occur as a consequence of either damage to the component of the striatum responsible for the indirect pathways in the basal ganglia or damage to GABA producing cells in the globus pallidus that normally inhibit thalamic neurons controlling movement. The treatment is to block dopamine receptors in the striatum to inhibit the direct pathway and thus decrease the recall of motor memories. The use of L-DOPA or subthalamic nuclear pacing will therefore make the problem worse. HIGHER FUNCTIONS This section of physiology will be considerably expanded on in later years especially when you are doing psychiatry. Indeed, there are complex higher functions performed by the brain that manifest in psychiatric disorders, such as the control of emotions, anxiety, personality, sleep, appetite, etc. (often said to be controlled by the limbic system), that are best dealt with in later years. At this point in your careers however, this information represents more advanced physiology. The following is therefore meant to introduce you to the topic of higher function physiology at an appropriate level. Slide heading: Higher functions Up until this point you have largely studied the primary neural functions of movement, somatic sensation, vision, hearing and to some degree smell (or taste). You will note from this slide, that in the human brain, only a small component of the cerebral cortex is necessary for these functions. The human brain is quite distinct in that most of the cerebral cortex is used for higher functions, but importantly these functions are linked to primary functions. The relationship with primary functions has led to cortical areas which serve a higher purpose as being called “association cortices”. In this regard, information from the primary cortices are further processed in association cortices to serve more advanced functions. Association cortices are viewed as processing a single primary function (unimodal association cortices) or several primary functions simultaneously (heteromodal, polymodal or multimodal association cortices) and the areas involved are shown in the figure. The exact mechanisms employed at a cellular level to mediate these higher functions has eluded science and this is largely responsible for our inability to create artificial intelligence (a thinking device mimicking complex human neuronal circuitry). However, much is known about the general function of specific areas and hence what occurs when there is damage to particular parts of the brain. What is the role of the association cortices? Slide headings for next 2 slides: Unimodal association cortices The first slide shows the unimodal association cortices related to the primary motor and somatosensory cortices. The unimodal association cortices for motor function (movement) have already been discussed and are the supplementary and premotor cortices, which carry a motor plan. Usually when these areas are damaged weakness is the result largely because the function of neurons in these areas is so intertwined with the function of the primary motor cortex. The somatosensory association cortex does nevertheless produce more complex problems when damaged. This area integrates several somatosensory sensations to detect size and shape of objects using touch. Thus, when damaged, although the ability to detect individual sensations may be intact, the identity of shapes drawn on the hand (such as a circle or square), or objects placed in the hand may not be detected with the eyes shut. These are somatosensory agnosias and are called agraphasthaesia and astereognosis. Because of an inability to identify objects using touch sensations, skilled tasks cannot be completed with the hands (motor and constructional apraxias). The second slide shows the unimodal association cortex related to the primary visual cortex (visual association cortex). The visual association cortex processes two distinct streams of neural information derived from the primary visual cortex, one being a dorsal stream and the other a ventral stream. The dorsal stream takes primary visual information and processes it to allow for the detection of distance (depth), size and motion. Patients with disturbances of this area may see perfectly well, but cannot judge differences in the size of objects (simultanagnosia) or distances between objects (spatial agnosia or optic ataxia). The ventral stream takes primary visual information and processes it to allow for the detection of shape and color. Patients with disturbances of this area may see perfectly well, but cannot identify the shapes or color (achromotopsia). The latter is true color blindness (for all colors) as opposed to the frequently occurring color blindness detected using “Ishihari charts” which is specific for certain colors. Importantly, a unimodal auditory association cortex (designed to detect pitch, cadence, tone, etc) also exists next to the small area of the cortex assigned to the primary function of hearing. However, this area is so small that specific auditory problems associated with damage to this area almost never occur. TUTORIAL QUESTIONS (more than one answer may be correct) 1. Damage to the posterior parietal lobe results in a reduced ability to detect a) the distance of objects from the observer. b) differences in the size of objects using vision. c) the shape of objects placed on the hand. d) light touch sensation. e) the texture of an object. Answers: c. Although primary somatosensory sensory function, including the ability to detect texture of objects using Meissner’s corpuscle, is intact, further integration of primary functions occurs in this region to detect the shape of objects with the hand, without looking at them. The posterior parietal lobe is not involved in mediating higher visual functions and hence does not play a role in detecting depth or size visually. 2. Damage to areas that influence the ventral stream of visual sensory information in the left cerebral hemisphere results in a reduced ability to detect a) the distance of objects from the observer. b) differences in the size of objects using vision. c) the differences between colors. d) the difference between red-green colors only. e) all visual in the right visual field. Answers: c. The dorsal stream allows for the detection of visual depth and size, while the ventral stream allows for the detection of color and shape. Damage to the ventral stream still allows for the perception of normal vision, but prevents the identification of shapes and the detection of all color. Red-green color blindness is a genetic disorder of the retinal surface that commonly affects males and affects the ability to detect differences between specific colours. Slide headings for next 5 slides: Heteromodal association cortices The first slide shows the heteromodal association cortex that lies between the visual and somatosensory or visual and auditory unimodal association cortices. Further integration of somatosensory and visual information provides a sense of spatial awareness and damage to this area results in patient’s ignoring certain areas of their body (neglect syndrome). For example, they may shave, comb their hair, or even dress on only one side of the body without being aware of doing this and without any primary sensory disturbances. Further integration of visual and auditory information provides an understanding of language and damage to this area results in patient’s being unable to understand language even though they will think they do and will speak fluently but without making much sense. They cannot follow instructions. This is called a sensory or receptive aphasia or a Wernicke’s aphasia (the area involved is named after Wernicke). Although not strictly heteromodal, as it involves only processing of visual information, visual information is further processed more anteriorly in the temporal lobe. This more complex processing allows for recognition of a particular item, for example a face. Hence, with damage to this area, a patient may maintain intact vision and an ability to recognize a face as a human face, but the damage will not allow the patient to recognize the face as from a particular person. Although this may occur with any object (for example the patient may not recognize their car as their own although they can tell you that the car is a Ferrari for example), it is particularly disturbing when facial recognition is lost and this is called prosopagnosia. The second slide shows further processing of language in a heteromodal association cortex in the frontal lobe called Broca’s area. This area is necessary to translate language into the motor component of speech. Damage to this area causes a motor or expressive aphasia or a Broca’s aphasia. Although the understanding of language is fairly sound, the ability to express language is difficult and speech is non-fluent. However, the patient understands instructions. The next slide summarizes the function of different brain regions involved in producing language. Although this conceptual arrangement has been modified over time, the pathways illustrated have essentially provided a central understanding of the abnormalities of language (aphasias) that may occur with clinical problems of different brain regions. Importantly, in most persons these regions are found in the left hemisphere only, but in some left-handed persons these regions may be represented in the right side of the brain only. Thus, it is important to note that in most persons damage to the left hemisphere is responsible for aphasias. The next slide entitled heteromodal association cortices outlines the regions of the brain involved in logical thought. In this regard, the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (the Brodman’s areas involved are labelled, but it is not necessary to remember these numbers) are the areas of the brain responsible for executive and cognitive function. To achieve these functions, these areas are where short-term memory (difficult information gained and the memory is for up to a minute) is held before being processed for long-term memory. Note that information is transferred to these areas for further processing from other heteromodal association cortices. Thus, the information processing required by the human brain to produce complex and logical thought has been far too complex to reproduce in computer models designed for the purposes of artificial intelligence. The final slide in the series entitled heteromodal association vortices outlines the regions of the brain involved in generating emotions. In this regard, the (the Brodman’s areas involved are labelled, but it is not necessary to remember these numbers) are the areas of the brain responsible for generating a sense of pleasure or reward, emotional well-being, happiness, and a sense of worthiness. Abnormalities of these areas are responsible for many of the emotional disturbances that occur in depressive illnesses and schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions and when these areas are not sufficiently activated result in drug seeking behaviour (including habitual alcohol ingestion). TUTORIAL QUESTIONS (more than one answer may be correct) 1. Damage to the temporal lobe results in a) an inability to understand instructions. b) fluent speech. c) somatosensory agnosias. d) an inability to recognize faces. e) an expressive aphasia. Answers: a, b and d. The temporal lobe contains Wernicke’s area which is heteromodal association cortex that integrates visual and auditory information and allows for the understanding of speech. Although the patient has little understanding of language and cannot understand instructions, the patient believes they know what is being said and uses fluent language with no meaning. The result is a receptive and not an expressive aphasia. The temporal lobe also contains areas which allow for further integration of visual information to allow for recognition of subtle differences in for example faces. Thus, patients will be unable to recognize a person even though they see the person and that the features are of a person. Somatosensory agnosias occur with damage to the posterior parietal lobe where somatosensory information is integrated at a higher level. 2. Damage to the frontal lobe results in a) an inability to understand instructions. b) fluent speech. c) decreased logical thought. d) a reduced spatial awareness. e) an expressive aphasia. Answers: c and e. The frontal lobe contains Broca’s area which is a heteromodal association cortex that contains a motor map for speech. It receives information from Wernicke’s area and turns it into fluent expression. Although the patient has a sound understanding of language and can understand instructions, the patient cannot express themselves using speech. The result is an expressive aphasia. The frontal lobe also contains the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, which are responsible for retaining complex information for a short term and hence allows for logical and deductive reasoning. The area responsible for spatial awareness is the heteromodal association cortex in the posterior parietal lobe that integrates visual and somatosensory information in a complex fashion. Slide heading: Long-term memory Although memory formation is a complex process important in gaining complete insight into psychiatric disorders, at this point in your careers a few simple facts are essential. In this regard, the final slide shows the important anatomical areas involved in producing long-term memories and the problems that may occur with damage to these areas. To acquire long- term memories, information derived from primary sensory and association cortices must first be processed by the hippocampal formation in the medial part of the temporal lobe before it is transferred to association cortices all over the brain for long-term storage. Thus, with damage to the temporal lobe, although one may still remember everything that occurred prior to the damage, no new memories may be developed. This is called anterograde amnesia. With damage to frontal, parietal or temporal lobe association cortices such as may occur in disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, old memories are lost, but new memories may still be gained, although they are lost as further association cortical damage occurs. This is called retrograde amnesia. TUTORIAL QUESTION (more than one answer may be correct) 1. Damage to the medial part of the temporal lobe results in a loss of a) memory prior to the event. b) the ability to develop new memories. c) short-term memory. d) long-term memory. e) memory of emotionally disturbing events. Answers: b and d. All of us lose the ability to remember emotionally disturbing events through processes that you will understand from information provided in later years and which involve the amygdala body. Short-term memory is by definition the ability to retain facts up until a minute and hence by definition, do not play a role in amnestic syndromes unless the frontal lobe is affected as well (which can occur in Alzheimer’s disease). The medial temporal lobe allows for processing of information prior to storage as long-term memory and hence a loss of the medial temporal lobe produces a loss of the ability to acquire new memories, while old memories are still retained.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
