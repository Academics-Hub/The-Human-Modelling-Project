Smooth muscle region called muscularis mucosae lies below the lamina propria. **The mucosa forms selectively permeable barrier to the contents of digestive tract. In the stomach and small intestine, Function = in the digestion of food and In the small intestine, Function = the transport of nutrients (absorption) into the body. Mucosa Glands may be present in lamina propria. The lamina propria is often rich in macrophages. Aggregations of “free” lymphoid cells and lymph nodules (immune system components – GALT) ** This area can be said to act as a barrier to bacterial invasion. ** These cells in lamina propria (and also the submucosa) act to help prevent spread of infectious organisms into the body via the digestive tract. http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Histo/HistoImages/hl8-04.jpg http://www.finchcms.edu/anatomy/histology/organology/lymphoid/o_l_8.html Histology of the Submucosa Organ Specialized structures Esophagus Submucosal mucous glands Stomach None Duodenum Brunner’s glands Ileum Peyer’s Patches Large Intestine None General pattern of the Submucosa a. Another layer of loose C.T. with many blood and lymph vessels that lies just below the muscularis mucosae (i.e. mucosa). b. This layer also contains nerve plexuses each called a Meissner's plexus (parasympathetic). c. Glands and Lymph nodules may also be present in this layer.

(2000), p253 Fig 14.4a As with any region of the GI tract, lymph nodules (diffused) (Ly) may be present –usually in the lamina propria and occasionally extending into the submucosa Esophagus Lymphatic nodules in lamina propria and/or submucosa (part of GALT, gut-associated lymphoid tissue) Esophageal glands (submucosal) secrete acidic mucous - lubricates the luminal wall; ducts carry secreted mucous to the lumen.

Specializations of esophageal tissues 1.Tubuloacinar mucus secreting glands (esophageal glands proper), present in the submucosa. Their ducts extend to the esophageal lumen. 2.Small branched mucus secreting glands (in the lamina propria near the stomach). These are called esophageal cardiac glands. 3. The muscular layer of the esophagus changes from striated muscle near mouth, to smooth muscle near stomach. Why would this be the case? 4. Outermost layer - simple squamous epith is the adventitia - outer layer of loose C.T. - blends with surrounding tissues. • A serosal layer (simple squamous epith) as outermost layer is only found in the peritoneal cavity, below the diaphragm and near the stomach.Gastroesophageal junctionAbrupt epithelial transition: Stratified squamous non-keratinized (esophagus) simple columnar (stomach) “Cardiac glands” of the esophagus (mucosal, i.e. IN LAMINA PROPRIA); secrete neutral mucous, protect esophagus from stomach acid Cardiac glands of the stomach; also mucosal (in the lamina propria) and also mucus-secreting Ross and Pawlina, Histology: A Text and Atlas, 5th ed.

The cardia - cardiac stomach 2. The body (corpus) and fundus 3. The pylorus - pyloric stomach Stomach esophagus cardia corpus (body) Rugae - longitudinal folds (allow distention) duodenum pylorus Four anatomical regions: a. Cardia - Cardiac glands b. Fundus* - Gastric glands c. Corpus* - Gastric glands d. Pylorus - Pyloric glands fundus Because they are HISTOLOGICALLY similar, histologists lump fundus and corpus together (and you may sometimes hear gastric glands referred as “fundic glands” –the terms are synonymous) Ross and Pawlina, Histology: A Text and Atlas, 5th ed. (2006). Fig. 17.5, p.524 pits Rugae: folds of mucosa w/ submucosal core –somewhat analogous to intestinal plicae*- allow stomach to distend Pits (foveolae): invaginations of mucosal epithelium (similar to intestinal crypts*); continuous with the lumen of underlying glands rugae Stomach University of Michigan Virtual Microscopy slide collection, slide #156 Rugae D B C A Stomach (Cardiac Region) • Mucosa: simple columnar with oval nuclei, mucous secreting cardiac glands in lamina propria. • Submucosa: connective tissue. • Muscle layer: inner circular, outer longitudinal. • Serosa: simple squamous epithelium. Stomach (Fundic Region) Mucosa: simple columnar with oval nuclei, presence of gastric glands in lamina propria.
