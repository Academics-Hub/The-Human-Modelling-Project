The liver’s ins and outs Bile The Liver’s Ins • All venous blood from the GIT enters the liver via the hepatic portal vein. Contains nutrients, toxins, drugs, bile salts, NH4+ and foreign substances. • Arterial blood from the heart enters via the hepatic artery. Contains hormones, metabolites, drugs and bilirubin. The Liver’s Outs • All blood moves out of the liver via the hepatic vein Contains glucose, proteins, urea and liver metabolites. • Bile leaves the liver via bile canaliculi and bile ducts and enters GIT. Contains bile salts, bile pigments, phospholipids and enzymes. • Lymph Microscopic structure • Hexagonal shaped functional units called hepatic lobules. • Hepatocytes radiating from the central canal (central vein) to the periphery of the lobule. • Between hepatocytes are small blood vessels called sinusoids and small bile ducts called canaliculi. • Specialised macrophages: Kupffer cells • Bile drained from the hepatocytes by the many small bile ducts (canaliculi) that unite to form the main bile duct of the liver, the hepatic duct. Part 2 – The functions of the liver A) Synthesis and storage functions Functions of the liver The liver’s main functions are: • Synthesis and storage • Detoxification and inactivation • Filtration \u0000 Glucose Glycogen A) The synthesis and storage functions of the liver Mostly related to carbohydrate, protein, lipid and micronutrient metabolism 1. Carbohydrate metabolism • The liver maintains blood glucose concentration. • Regulated by insulin and glucagon (and to a lesser extent cortisol and adrenaline) The liver synthesises new glucose by gluconeogenesis. The liver stores glucose as glycogen. Glycogen content in the fed state = ~10% of liver mass Glycogen content in the fasting state = ~0.3% of liver mass 2. Lipid metabolism in the liver The liver synthesizes…. a) Fatty acids from excess carbohydrates. . b) Triacylglycerols (triglycerides) from fatty acids The liver synthesizes……. (cont’d) c) Cholesterol d) Lipoproteins (for transport of lipids). e.g. VLDLs transport triglycerides from the liver to adipose tissue e) Bile acids (salts) The liver synthesizes……. (cont’d) f) Ketones i) Synthesis of proteins by the liver • Blood clotting factors (fibrinogen etc.) * Remember this also requires vitamin K • Transport proteins (transferrin, apoproteins, globulins, sex-hormone binding protein etc.) • Albumin * Remember that albumin is important for the determination of plasma oncotic pressure • Complement • Angiotensinogen (forms angiotensin I) Note that the other major component of plasma protein, the -globulins, are not synthesized by the liver, but by leukocytes. 3. ‘Nitrogen’ metabolism in the liver Includes the metabolism of proteins, amino acids, urea and ammonia ii) Amino acid metabolism in the liver Amino acids Amine (NH2) group Glucose Carbon backbone Urea NH3/NH4+ Acetyl-CoA Transaminases Most important amino acids in liver are alanine and aspartate Most abundant transaminases in liver are alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) iv) Storage of vitamins and minerals by the liver iii) Peptide hormone synthesis by the liver • Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1): Promotes growth in bone and soft tissue. Mediates some of the effects of growth hormone • Thrombopoietin (TPO) Stimulates platelet formation by bone marrow. • Hepcidin Inhibits iron (Fe3+) absorption by the small intestine The liver stores: • Vitamins A, D, E, K * Note that these are all fat-soluble vitamins and so require bile for efficient absorption from the GIT • Vitamin B12 (water soluble) The liver also stores iron and copper 4. Bile Acid/Bile Salt synthesis • Bile salts are required for fat digestion and absorption in the GIT • Bile salt synthesis is an excretory route for cholesterol *Note: No need to learn details Part 3 – The functions of the liver B) Protective functions of the liver Hydrolysis and oxidation B) Protective functions of the liver – Detoxification, inactivation and filtration The liver protects the body from organic substances by: • Processing by-products of digestion and cellular metabolism. • Transforming harmful substances and toxins into less harmful compounds. • Metabolising, i.e. inactivating, most hormones. • Processing ingested drugs to form either less, or sometimes more, active substances. In general, the above processes result in the production of an end-product that can be excreted by the kidneys or in the faeces. Methods used: 1) Hydrolysis 2) Oxidation 3) Conjugation 1. Hydrolysis of substances by the liver Hydrolysis is the breaking of bonds in macromolecules by the addition of ‘H2O’. Hydrolysis applies especially to the breakdown of proteins by breaking peptide bonds. Hydrolysis functions to: • Recycle proteins to amino acids. • Inactivate protein/peptide hormones, especially insulin! 2. Oxidation Generally, oxidation reactions result in the breakdown of organic chemicals. a) Cytochrome P450 A large and diverse group of enzymes which oxidise organic molecules. Cytochrome p450 Drugs SteroidsFatty acids Eicosanoids (Prostaglandins etc.) Cholesterol Induction of cytochrome p450 activity: • Some drugs can INDUCE (increase activity) of the complex. • Induction of cytochrome p450 may increase the clearance of other drugs or substances from the body so that they become less effective. Some examples: Example 1: Phenobarbital (a sedative) and warfarin (an anticoagulant) • cytochrome p450 inactivates warfarin. • phenobarbital induces cytochrome p450. Consequence: phenobarbital increases the inactivation of warfarin If a patient is given both phenobarbital and warfarin, then the dose of warfarin must be increased to maintain its anticoagulant effect Example 2: Rifampicin (an antibiotic) and oral contraceptives • Cytochrome p450 inactivates ‘oestrogen’ in oral contraceptives • Rifampicin INDUCES cytochrome p450 Consequence: Rifampicin reduces the effectiveness of oral contraceptives If a person is prescribed rifampicin and they are taking an oral contraceptive then they should be advised that contraception may not be effective. b) Ethanol detoxification by oxidation Ethanol CH3CH2-OH Acetaldehyde CH3CH=OAlcohol dehydrogenase Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase NAD+ NADH2 NAD+ NADH2 • Ethanol detoxification reduces hepatocyte NAD+ availability. This compromises other cellular processes requiring NAD+ e.g. glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation. • The acetate formed favours fatty acid synthesis: acetate → acetyl-CoA → fatty acids The consequences of excessive alcohol intake include the development of a fatty liver. Acetate CH3COO- Part 4 – The functions of the liver B) Protective functions of the liver Conjugation and bilirubin metabolism 3. Conjugation by the liver • Generally, conjugation is the addition of a chemical group (usually sulphate or glucuronide) to an insoluble waste substance to make it water soluble so that it can be excreted. • Conjugated substances are then excreted in the urine or faeces. i) Conjugation of steroid hormones (aldosterone, testosterone) ii) Bilirubin metabolism and conjugation Haem Haem reductase Biliverdin reductase • Bilirubin is the main pigment in bile and is yellow in colour. • It is formed from the breakdown of haem that has been released from lysed erythrocytes (red blood cells). • Haem is converted to biliverdin, and then to unconjugated bilirubin. Processing of unconjugated bilirubin Important aspects of bilirubin metabolism • Unconjugated bilirubin is not very water soluble – can’t be excreted by the kidneys. • Conjugated bilirubin is water soluble, although it is excreted mostly via the GIT (except for some urobilinogen which is excreted via the kidneys). • Excessive red blood cell haemolysis will increase unconjugated bilirubin concentrations. • Blockage of the biliary system e.g. at the common bile duct, will cause a backup of bile contents into the blood, and so plasma conjugated bilirubin concentration will increase. • Liver dysfunction will probably affect both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin concentrations. • An increase in plasma unconjugated and/or conjugated bilirubin concentration causes jaundice. (See later for more details) 4. Ammonia detoxification • Bacterial action on proteins in the GIT produces lots of ammonia (NH3) which becomes ammonium (NH4+) in solution. • The blood in hepatic portal vein i.e. from the GIT, contains a high ammonia concentration. • Ammonia is alkali (affects pH and acid-base balance) and toxic (affects CNS function). • The liver detoxifies ammonium/ammonia from the hepatic portal blood before the blood enters the systemic circulation. This is done via the urea cycle. Urea NH4+ from GIT 5. Removal of lactate Lactate is produced constantly by red blood cells, skin and skeletal muscle Lactate produced in the body is converted to glucose in the liver – The Cori Cycle 6. Filtration functions of the liver Blood from the GIT contains bacteria, viruses, and foreign antigens (protein fragments etc.). The liver receives this blood and filters out and removes these foreign particles before they enter the systemic circulation. This is the job Kupffer Cells – modified liver-specific macrophages. Part 5 – Jaundice and liver disease Types of jaundice and pre-hepatic jaundice Liver disease and jaundice Elevated bilirubin causes: • Yellow staining of the skin and sclera of the eyes, particularly unconjugated bilirubin. • Itchiness of skin. Bilirubin is toxic to nervous tissue and can cause poor mental development in neonates. Jaundice is caused by elevated plasma concentrations of conjugated and/or unconjugated bilirubin There are three types of jaundice: • Pre-hepatic jaundice • Intra-hepatic jaundice • Post-hepatic jaundice 1. Pre-hepatic jaundice Increased bilirubin due to excessive haemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells). Causes: • Malaria, sickle cell anaemia, incompatible blood transfusion and genetic conditions resulting in fragile erythrocytes. • Neonatal jaundice Pre-hepatic jaundice is characterised by: • Increased plasma unconjugated bilirubin concentration • Increased plasma lactate dehydrogenase activity. Part 6 – Jaundice and liver disease Post-hepatic jaundice Obstruction to the passage of bile (containing conjugated bilirubin) Causes: • Gall stones (crystallised cholesterol) • Precipitated bile salts • Inflammation or carcinoma of nearby organs (i.e. the pancreas) • Cholestasis (inflammation of bile canaliculi). These result in back up of bile and contents into the liver and the systemic circulation. The cells that line the bile ducts produce these enzymes: – Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) – Gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) 2. Post-hepatic jaundice Part 7 – Jaundice and liver disease Acute intra-hepatic jaundice 3. Intra-hepatic jaundice (liver disease) a) Acute intra-hepatic jaundice Acute infection or damage to hepatocytes Causes: • Viral infections (hepatitis A to E) • Inflammation (alcohol binge drinking) • Hepato-toxins (carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), Pb, Hg, some mushrooms) Signs reflect damage to hepatocytes and loss of function. Part 8 – Jaundice and liver disease Chronic intra-hepatic jaundice b) Chronic intra-hepatic jaundice Long term liver damage resulting in gradual loss of liver cells & liver function – it ends up in liver failure. Causes: • Chronic liver infections • Chronic alcohol abuse (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis is the formation of fibrous tissue (scar tissue) in the liver that replaces functioning liver cells. 3. Intra-hepatic jaundice (liver disease) Other signs and symptoms associated with chronic intrahepatic jaundice: • High blood pressure, ascites and oedema Causes: - Increased blood volume due to excess aldosterone. - Increased resistance to blood flow through the liver. • Ascites formation and oedema aggravated by: – low plasma albumin (decreased capillary oncotic pressure). – increased blood volume (increased capillary hydrostatic pressure). • Hepatomegaly • Poor drug tolerance • Gynaecomastia in males (increased oestrogen) • Development of a fatty liver (accumulation of fats in hepatocytes). • Bleeding into the oesophagus and stomach – aggravated by lack of clotting factors. Porta-caval shunting (portal hypertension) in chronic liver disease • Progressive fibrosis and scaring blocks venous sinuses in liver. • There is resistance to blood flow from the hepatic portal vein (i.e. the GIT) into the liver. • Hydrostatic pressure in the portal vein increases (portal hypertension). • Blood in portal vein diverted to vena cava via gastric and oesophageal veins (i.e. bypasses liver). Consequences of portacaval shunting • NH4+ from GIT not processed by the liver causing ammonia toxicity. • Foreign particles from the GIT not phagocytosed by Kupffer cells in liver. Particles pass into circulation and initiate an immune response • Ascites and oedema • Bleeding into the oesophagus and stomach via venous varices.The End -literally ","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
