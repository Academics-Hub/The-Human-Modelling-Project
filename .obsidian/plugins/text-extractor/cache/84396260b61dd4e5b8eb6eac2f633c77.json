We denote the set of complex numbers by C. Any complex number z = x + iy is said to be in real-imaginary form. In fact, we use the notation Im(z) and Re(z) for the imaginary part and real part of z,respectively. Ifz = x + iy,then Re(z)= x and Im(z)= y. There is another way of writing complex numbers called the modulus-argument form (mod-arg form in short). Under the mod-arg form of a complex number, there are two versions, and these versions are: i. z = r(cos ✓ + i sin ✓) ii z = re i✓ In any version above, r is the modulus, i.e. r = |z| = p x2 + y2 and ✓ is ‘the’argument of z, denoted by arg(z). It is evidently easier to ﬁnd r,but how do we ﬁnd ✓ ? In order to ﬁnd the argument, do the following steps: Steps in ﬁnding ✓ 1. Identify the quadrant in which z = x + iy is, and draw the position vector of z in that quadrant 2. Identify the angle between the position vector and the x-axis in that quadrant. This angle is ALWAYS acute, and call if \u0000.Find \u0000 by using the equation tan \u0000 = \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 y x \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 (1.1) In the above equation, the absolute value must be applied since \u0000 is an acute angle. 3. Find ✓ by using a relevant quadrant formula. For instance, if z is in the ﬁrst quadrant, then ✓ = \u0000; 1 if z is in second quadrant, then ✓ = ⇡ \u0000 \u0000; if z is in the third quadrant, then ✓ = ⇡ + \u0000; if z is in the fourth quadrant, then ✓ =2⇡ \u0000 \u0000. Remark 1.1.1 Any number of the form ✓ +2k⇡ where k 2 Z is an argument of z.If I ﬁnd ✓ = ⇡ 6 , then I can also choose ⇡ 6 +2⇡ = 13⇡ 6 as another possible argument. To ✓, adding any integer multiple of 2⇡ yields another argument of z. Let us look at an example. Example 1.1.2 Write down the complex number z = \u00001+ p 3i in modulus-argument form. Clearly, r = |z| = q ( p 3)2 +(\u00001)2 = p 4 = 2. To ﬁnd the argument, we need to follow the above steps. Step 1: Note that y = p 3 and x = \u00001 so that z is in the second quadrant. Step2: We now ﬁnd the acute angle \u0000, we use (1.1), i.e. tan \u0000 = \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 p 3 \u00001 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 = p 3 so that \u0000 = ⇡ 6 Step 3: Since ✓ is in the second quadrant, we must have ✓ = ⇡ \u0000 \u0000 = ⇡ \u0000 ⇡ 6 = 5⇡ 6 The principal value of the argument By Remark 1.1.1, you should know that there are inﬁnitely many ’arguments’. However there is one that is unique in the sence that it is an argument that lies in the interval (\u0000⇡, ⇡]. Such an argument is called the principal value of the argument, which we shall denote by PV . In other words, ✓ is a principal value if \u0000⇡ < ✓  ⇡. Let me try to explain this in simple terms: There are only two possibilities for an argument to be a PV . EITHER ✓ < 0 (negative) and |✓| < ⇡ OR ✓ > 0 and |✓|  ⇡. Geometrically, this means that ✓ is PV if it does not cross the ⇡-line (the straight line) (assuming 0  ✓  2⇡ or \u00002⇡  ✓ < 0). If ✓ crosses the ⇡-line, then to ﬁnd the PV, use the negative angle (if ✓ > 0) and positive angle (if ✓ < 0). Thus If ✓ > 0 (anti-clockwise) and it crosses the ⇡-line, then PV = \u0000(2⇡ \u0000 ✓) If ✓ < 0 (clockwise) and it crosses the ⇡-line, then PV =2⇡ \u0000 |✓| Example 1.1.3 Find the principal value of the argument in Example 1.1.2. Now in that example, we found ✓ = 5⇡ 6 . If we draw this angle, we notice that we do not cross the ⇡-line (✓ < ⇡). So, ✓ is itself a PV . Example 1.1.4 Find the principal argument of the complex number z = \u00001 \u0000 i Applying steps 1, 2 and 3 for ﬁnding ✓, we note that \u0000 = ⇡ 4 and z is in third quadrant. Hence ✓ = ⇡ 4 + ⇡ = 5⇡ 4 . We now need to ﬁnd the principal value of the argument. Clearly, 5⇡ 4 here is not principal since it is more than ⇡. In this case, PV = \u0000(2⇡ \u0000 5⇡ 4 )= \u00003⇡ 4 . 2 1.1.1 Complex conjugation For a complex number z = x + iy, we denote the complex conjuate of z by z and deﬁne it as z = x \u0000 iy. Let z and w be complex numbers. Then i. z + w = z + w; ii. zw = zw; iii. zz = |z| 2; iv z = z for all real numbers z. iv z + z = 2Re(z) Using these properties, it is not di\u0000cult to see that, if r and ✓ are real numbers, then 1 \u0000 rei✓ = 1 \u0000 rei✓ =1 \u0000 re \u0000i✓ So, this demonstrates that 1 \u0000 rei✓ 6=1 + re \u0000i✓. YOU CANT JUST REVERSE THE SIGN! IN CON- JUGATION, ONLY THE SIGN OF THE IMAGINARY PART IS REVERSED! 1.1.2 Important formulae Let z = re i✓.Then z = re i✓ so that z + z = 2Re(z) ( using property (iv) on complex conjugation). But 2Re(z) = 2Re(r cos ✓ + i sin ✓)=2r cos ✓ which implies that z + z =2r cos ✓,i.e. re i✓ + re \u0000i✓ =2r cos ✓ so that cos ✓ = 1 2 \u0000 e i✓ + e \u0000i✓\u0000 . However, the input can be extended to complex numbers and not just real numbers only. Thus, for any complex number z,wehave cos z = 1 2 \u0000 e iz + e \u0000iz\u0000 . Other formulae for sin z, cosh z,sinh z must be mastered and these are in Ridley!! 1.2 Roots and Polynomials (Second Year) In this section, it is important to know how to ﬁnd n th roots of a complex number. For a complex number z, an n th root of z is a complex number zk such that zn k = z. We often write zk = np z.It must also be stated that there are n such complex numbers zk. To compute ALL n th roots of z,we simply use the following formula: zk = |z| 1 n e i( ✓+2k⇡ n ), where k =0, 1, 2,. .., n \u0000 1. (1.2) 3 In the formula above, ✓ need not be principal. Furthermore, the values of k must always be ANY n consecutive integers. Some use k = ±1, 0, ±2,. .. as long as there are n consecutive values in total), that is OK. I use k =0, 1, 2, 3,. .., n \u0000 1 which does not make any di↵erence. The video lectures provide detailed examples and other facts about nth roots. Please watch the videos. Let us look at polynomials. Some quick facts about polynomials with coe\u0000cients in C include, but are not limited to: i. Every polynomial can be factorised into linear factors with complex coe\u0000cients. ii. A polynomial of degree n has n roots (also called zeros). iii. If ↵ is a root of a polynomial P (z), then z \u0000 ↵ is a factor. To ﬁnd other factors, use long divison. In short, fact (iii) above says: knowing the roots of a polynomial means knowing its factorization. The following is a procedure for factorising a polynomial. Steps in polynomial factorisation Let P (z) be a polynomial of degree n.Then P (z)= anzn + an\u00001zn\u00001 + .. . + a1z + a0 where an 6= 0. If an 6= 1, we can divide each coe\u0000cient by an and after factorising the resulting polynomial, we simply multiply the answer by an. In that case, without loss of generality, we can assume that an = 1. Thus P (z)= zn + an\u00001zn\u00001 + .. . + a1z + a0. Do the following: 1. Solve the equation P (z) = 0. In total, there are n roots of this equation, and call them ↵1, ↵2,. .., ↵n. 2. Set P (z)=(z \u0000 ↵1)(z \u0000 ↵2) .. . (z \u0000 ↵n). Those are the steps in factorising P (z). It is as simple as that! However there are special cases where factorisation becomes easier. The theorem below is one of those cases. Theorem 1.2.1 Suppose P (z) satisﬁes the following condition: ALL coe\u0000cients of P (z) are real, i.e. an\u00001,. .., a1,a0 2 R, P (z) has a nonreal root ↵.This means that P (↵)=0 and Im(↵) 6=0. Then ↵ is also a root of P (z). Proof of this theorem is in Ridley (see page 69). Just a bit of clariﬁcation here. A polynomial P (z) satisfying the conditions of Theorem 1.2.1 has at least two linear factors: z \u0000 ↵ and z \u0000 ↵. Indeed, we have a partial factorisation of P (z) as follows: P (z)=(z \u0000 ↵)(z \u0000 ↵)Q(z) (1.3) 4 where Q(z) is some lower degree polynomial which must also be factorised!! In Equation 1.3, (z\u0000↵)(z\u0000↵) is in fact a quadraftic factor of P (z). Let’s work it out and see what it is exactly? Thus (z \u0000 ↵)(z \u0000 ↵)= z2 + z(\u0000↵ \u0000 ¯↵)z + ↵↵ = z2 \u0000 z(Re(↵)) + |↵| 2 (refer to properties of conjugation). What makes this quadratic factor special is that its coe\u0000cients; 1, \u0000Re(↵) and |↵| 2 are all real. Such a quadractic factor is called a real quadratic factor. A look at an example below Example 1.2.2 Factorise z4 + 16 into real quadratic factors The ﬁrst thing to do is to ﬁnd linear factors. To do that, we solve z4 + 16 = 0, i.e. z4 = \u000016, and clearly, z = 1 4 p \u000016. These are 4th roots of -16. Note that arg(\u000016) = ⇡ and | \u0000 16| = 16. Using our formula for n th roots, we have zk = | \u0000 16| 1 4 e i( ✓+2k⇡ 4 ), where k =0, 1, 2, 3. = 16 1 4 e i( ⇡+2k⇡ 4 ) =2e i( (2k+1)⇡ 4 ) By substituting the values, k =0, 1, 2, 3, we have z0 =2e i ⇡ 4 , z1 =2e i 3⇡ 4 , z2 =2e i 5⇡ 4 , z3 =2e i 7⇡ 4 . At this stage, I advise that its important to write the ﬁnal angles as principal values since this lessens the work of pairing of linear factors (as it will be explaned later). Looking at the exponential version of these roots, we see that the angles in z2 and z3 are not principal. So we rewrite z2 and z3 as: z2 =2e i 5⇡ 4 =2e i(\u0000(2⇡\u0000 5⇡ 4 )) =2e \u0000i 3⇡ 4 and z3 =2e i 7⇡ 4 =2e i(\u0000(2⇡\u0000 7⇡ 4 )) =2e \u0000i ⇡ 4 So the factorization of z4 + 16 into linear factors is: z4 + 16 = (z \u0000 z0)(z \u0000 z1)(z \u0000 z2)(z \u0000 z3) =(z \u0000 2e i ⇡ 4 )(z \u0000 2e i 3⇡ 4 )(z \u0000 2e \u0000i 3⇡ 4 )(z \u0000 2e \u0000i ⇡ 4 ). Now the last thing to do in order to have the real quadratic factors is to pair up conjugate pairs for the nonreal roots. Clearly the conjugate pairs are: 2e i ⇡ 4 vs 2e \u0000i ⇡ 4 and 2e i 3⇡ 4 vs 2e \u0000i 3⇡ 4 .Then multiply the corresponding linear factors in this pairing process. I have put the paired linear factors in square brackets below: z4 + 16 = [(z \u0000 2e i ⇡ 4 )(z \u0000 2e \u0000i ⇡ 4 )][(z \u0000 2e i 3⇡ 4 )(z \u0000 2e \u0000i 3⇡ 4 )] =(z2 \u0000 2z(e i ⇡ 4 + e \u0000i ⇡ 4 )+4e i ⇡ 4 e \u0000i ⇡ 4 )(z2 \u0000 2z(e i 3⇡ 4 + e \u0000i 3⇡ 4 )+4e i 3⇡ 4 e \u0000i 3⇡ 4 ) =(z2 \u0000 2z(2 cos ⇡ 4 ) + 4)(z2 \u0000 2z(2 cos 3⇡ 4 ) + 4) =(z2 \u0000 2 p 2z + 4)(z2 +2 p 2z + 4). 5 In line 3 of the manipulation above, we have used the fact that cos ✓ = 1 2 \u0000 e i✓ + e \u0000i✓\u0000 . Example 1.2.3 Factorise z4 +(2 \u0000 7i)z3 \u0000 (14 + 14i)z2 \u0000 (16 \u0000 8i)z + 16i \u0000 12 into linear factors given that z2 \u0000 6iz \u0000 8 is a quadratic factor. Hint: Long Division! This problem is left as an exercise. 1.2.1 Partial Fractions To decompose Q(z) P (z) into partial fractions, make sure that it is a proper fraction ﬁrst (degree of P (z)strictly greater than the degree of Q(z). Otherwise, do a long division and then work with the corresponding proper fraction. We shall assume that the fraction is proper. You then need to factorise the denominator P(z) into linear factors, and then proceed as you used to do in First Year. At this stage, the only di↵erence with your ﬁrst year work is that at this level, you do not have irreducible factors in the denominator since any polynomial will always factor into linear factors. In the case whereby the linear factors of the denominator are distinct (none of them is repeated) you are strongly advised to use the Heaviside Cover Rule. Explanation of Heaviside Cover Rule: Suppose Q(z) P (z) = Q(z) (z \u0000 ↵1)(z \u0000 ↵2) .. . (z \u0000 ↵n) = A1 z \u0000 ↵1 + A2 z \u0000 ↵2 + .. . + An z \u0000 ↵n . To ﬁnd Ai, solve the equation z \u0000 ↵i = 0. Thus z = ↵i. Substitute this value ↵i in the expression Q(z) (z\u0000↵1)(z\u0000↵2)...(z\u0000↵i\u00001)(z\u0000↵i+1)...(z\u0000↵n) , and that becomes the value of Ai. Observe that the expression in which you are substituting ↵i does not have the factor z \u0000 ↵i in it. In other words, it is covered or deleted! In summary, Ai is found from the formula: Ai = Q(z) (z \u0000 ↵1)(z \u0000 ↵2) .. . (z \u0000 ↵i\u00001)(z \u0000 ↵i+1) .. . (z \u0000 ↵n) \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 z=↵i. Example 1.2.4 Find the complex partial fraction decomposition of z3\u00001 z4+(2\u00007i)z3\u0000(14+14i)z2\u0000(28\u00008i)z+16i . Note that z4 +(2 \u0000 7i)z3 \u0000 (14 + 14i)z2 \u0000 (16 \u0000 8i)z + 16i \u0000 12 = (z \u0000 2i)(z \u0000 4i)(z + 2)(z \u0000 i). Hence, z3 \u0000 1 z4 +(2 \u0000 7i)z3 \u0000 (14 + 14i)z2 \u0000 (28 \u0000 8i)z + 16i = A z \u0000 2i + B z \u0000 4i + C z +2 + D z \u0000 i Since none of the factors is repeated, we can use the Heaviside cover rule. We have A = z3 \u0000 1 (z \u0000 4i)(z + 2)(z \u0000 i) \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 z=2i = (2i) 3 \u0000 1 (2i \u0000 4i)(2i + 2)(2i \u0000 i) = \u00008i \u0000 1 (\u00002i)(2i + 2)(i) = \u00008i \u0000 1 4i +4 = (\u00008i \u0000 1)(4 \u0000 4i) (4 + 4i)(4 \u0000 4i) = ...
