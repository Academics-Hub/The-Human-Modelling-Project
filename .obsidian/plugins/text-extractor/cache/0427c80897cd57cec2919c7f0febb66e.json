Introduction • The nerves of the lower limb are derived from the ventral rami of the lumbar and sacral nerves. • They arise from the posterior abdominal wall forming the lumbar plexus (L1– L4) and the sacral plexus (L4–S4) in the pelvis. • The main nerves of the lower limb are as follows: • Femoral nerve. • Obturator nerve. • Sciatic nerve. • Tibial nerve. • Common peroneal nerve. Applied Anatomy of the Femoral Nerve • Femoral Nerve Block • It involves the injection of anesthetic agents into the femoral region to inhibit sensory and motor function of the nerve. • This procedure is applicable for surgery on the anterior aspect of the thigh and for superficial surgery on the medial aspect of the leg below the knee. • It can also be used alongside a sciatic nerve block to provide complete anesthesia of the lower leg and ankle. • It can also be used to provide prolonged analgesia for patients with fractures on the femoral neck or shaft Applied Anatomy of the Femoral Nerve • Referred pain • The femoral and obturator nerves which supply the hip joint, also supply the knee joint. • Therefore, diseases of the hip may produce referred pain in the knee and also in the cutaneous area innervated by these nerves. • Injury to the femoral nerve • Injury to the femoral nerve by wounds in the groin, though rare, causes paralysis of the quadriceps femoris leading to inability to extend the knee. • This leads to a sensory deficit on the anterior and medial sides of the thigh and medial side of leg. Applied Anatomy of the Femoral Nerve • Femoral nerve neuropathy • The main trunk of the femoral nerve is not subject to an entrapment neuropathy, but it may be compressed by retroperitoneal tumors. Clinical features include: • Wasting and weakness of quadriceps leading to considerable difficulty in walking. • Pain and paraesthesia on the anterior and medial aspects of the thigh extending down along the medial aspect of the leg and foot along the distribution of the saphenous nerve Applied Anatomy of the Obturator Nerve • Obturator nerve block • It is used to treat hip joint pain and is also used in the relief of adductor muscle spasm associated with hemiplegia or paraplegia. • In this procedure, the anaesthetic is injected inferior to the pubic tubercle and lateral to the tendon of the adductor longus muscle. • It can also be carried out under ultrasound guidance. • Injury to Obturator nerve • Injury to the nerve is rare as it lies deep within the pelvis and medial thigh. It can be damaged through direct injury to the nerve or to surrounding muscle tissue. • Symptoms include difficulty in adducting the thigh and decreased sensations over the upper medial part of the thigh. Applied Anatomy of the Obturator Nerve • Obturator nerve neuropathy • It is an entrapment neuropathy that occurs when the obturator nerve is compressed by surrounding structures. • It causes medial thigh pain and can be associated with athletes having large adductor muscles. • Irritation of the obturator nerve • The inflammation of the ovary causes localized peritonitis in the region of ovarian fossa which may cause irritation of the obturator nerve. • In such a case, the pain may be referred to the hip, knee, and medial side of the thigh. • Referred pain • In diseases of the hip joint, the pain may be referred to the medial side of the thigh. Applied Anatomy of the Sciatic Nerve • Sciatic nerve injury • This nerve is most injured by badly placed intramuscular injections in the gluteal region and sometimes by penetrating wounds and pelvic or hip fractures. • Most lesions are incomplete and in 90% of cases, the common peroneal part is affected. Sciatic nerve damage results in the following features. • Muscles of the leg innervated by the common peroneal and tibial nerves are paralyzed • All hamstring muscles are paralyzed, and sensation is lost below the knee except for the saphenous area i.e. medial side of the leg and medial border of the foot Applied Anatomy of the Sciatic Nerve • Sciatic nerve block • The is done by injecting an anaesthetic agent a few cm below the midpoint of the line joining the PSIS and the upper border of the greater trochanter. • It is useful for procedures at or below the knee. • Piriformis syndrome • Occurs due to compression of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis. • common in sports that require excessive use of gluteal muscles (e.g., ice skaters, cyclists, etc.) • Symptoms include • pain, numbness, muscle weakness and buttock tenderness • Treatment could • Non-operative: use of analgesics or physiotherapy • Operative: Piriformis muscle release Applied Anatomy of the Sciatic Nerve • Sciatica: • It is a term applied to a clinical condition characterized by shooting pain felt along the course of distribution of the sciatic nerve e.g., • buttock, posterior, aspect of thigh, lateral aspect of leg, and dorsum of the foot • It occurs due to compression and irritation of L4–S3 spinal nerve roots by herniated intervertebral disc of the lumbar vertebrae. https://www.spineuniverse.com/conditions/sciatica/sciatica-causes Applied Anatomy of the Tibial Nerve • Injury of the tibial nerve • The nerve may be injured by a lacerated wound in the popliteal fossa or posterior dislocation of the knee joint. Clinical features include: • Motor loss: • Foot is held dorsiflexed and everted, due to paralysis of the muscles of posterior compartment of the leg. • Loss of prominence of calf and tendocalcaneus, due to paralysis of the triceps surae muscle (gastrocnemius and soleus). • Loss of plantar flexion of foot, due to paralysis of the flexors of ankle. • Inability to stand on the toes, due to loss of plantarflexion of foot. • Sensory loss: • The loss of sensation in the sole and plantar aspects of the toes including the dorsal aspects of their distal phalanges, due to involvement of the cutaneous branches. Applied Anatomy of the Tibial Nerve • Tarsal tunnel syndrome • It occurs due to compression of the tibial nerve in the osseofibrous tunnel under the flexor retinaculum of the ankle. • It clinically presents as pain and paresthesia in the sole of the foot, which often becomes worse at night. • Morton’s metatarsalgia (also called plantar digital neuroma) • It occurs due to the formation of a neuroma following pressure on one of the plantar digital nerves just prior to its bifurcation at one of the toe clefts. • It most commonly affects the plantar digital nerve running between the third and fourth metatarsal heads to the third web-space. • Clinically, it presents as intermittent pain on the plantar aspect of the forefoot usually between the third and fourth metatarsals. Applied Anatomy of Common Peroneal Nerve • Injury to the common peroneal nerve • This nerve is commonly injured in fractures of the neck of the fibula and by pressure from ill-fitted casts or splints resulting in the following features; • Motor loss • Foot drop, due to the paralysis of muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg • Loss of extension of toes, due to the paralysis of extensor digitorum longus and extensor hallucis longus. • Loss of eversion of foot, due to the paralysis of peroneus longus and peroneus brevis (evertors of the foot). • Sensory loss • The sensory loss due to involvement of the cutaneous branches, on the anterolateral aspect of the leg, and whole of dorsum foot except the areas supplied by the saphenous and sural nerves.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
