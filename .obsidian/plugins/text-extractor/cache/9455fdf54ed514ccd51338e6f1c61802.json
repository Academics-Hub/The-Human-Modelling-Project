Primase is attached to form the RNA primer in the replication bubble Extends the primer in the 5’ to 3’ direction 2. DNA polymera se synthesizes the strands in the 5’ to 3’ direction and forms phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides it adds to the strand Continuously – leading strand And discontinuously – lagging strand RNA primer is attached discontinuously and forms the O kazaki segments 3. RNA primer is removed by the DNA ligase that forms a continuous lagging strand Forms the phosphodiester bond and joins the Okazaki fragments Needs an external source of energy ATP Proofreading DNA synthesis: DNA polymerase 5’ - 3’ polymerase activity 3’ - 5’ exonuclease activity Nuclease cleaves nucleic acids from the outside **endo – cleaves from the inside Proofreading function Removes incorrectly matched bases so polymerase can try it again The DNA polymerization stalls if an incorrect nucleotide is added Cannot add the chain properly – don’t form a proper bond and the structure of the chain is distorted The 3’ - 5’ e xonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase comes along Works in the opposite direction Removes the incorrect base Polymerization occurs again S imran Patel Proofreading is slower than the polymerase activity Allows exonuclease to work","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
