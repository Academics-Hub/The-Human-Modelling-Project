Mechanically, measuring the exact actual pressure is quite difficult, but measuring the difference between two pressures is quite straightforward. Hence, some pressure measurements are given as relative pressure, which is the difference between the pressure at the measured point and the pressure at another point used as a baseline. Gauge pressure is the difference between the pressure at the measured point and atmospheric pressure. Bernoulli’s equation The basic behaviour of a connected body of fluid is governed by a straightforward set of relations summed up by Bernoulli’s equation, which takes the following form for an incompressible liquid without thermal effects: 𝜌𝑣2 2 +𝜌.𝑔.ℎ +𝑃=constant Where 𝜌 is the density of the fluid 𝑣 is the velocity of the liquid at the point being considered 𝑔 is the acceleration due to gravity ℎ is the height of the liquid at the point being considered above a common reference point and 𝑃 is the pressure at the point being considered 𝜌.𝑔.ℎ is the potential energy term per unit volume 𝜌𝑣2 2 is the kinetic energy term per unit volume 𝑃 is an enthalpy per unit volume term (recall that enthalpy is internal (thermal) energy +P.V This equation represents a summation of all of the hydrostatic pressure effects on a body of liquid and remains constant at all points throughout a connected body of liquid. It does not include friction effects on moving fluids; those represent an additional term that we will look at later. Let us consider a simple example of a cylindrical tank of water open to the air, standing on the ground, at sea level, with a depth of 10m, as shown below. 10m Point 1 Point 2 P g h V f m s 2 m d pump spatially greatest in the middle friction N M J newtons J EÉKÉmÉ5 P V N m work joules all pressure gradients Metre I p V m2 s 2 kg l N m Iworkitoties How do we 414 E in system what does it mean for a system to be hydraulically impart force linked Pressure Irina Pins lost due to friction Pa kg m 1 s 2 N m 2 depending what É I pgn 99h Ppi Pp'atm a friar FHoattigt How rate a dispatementbend Mnometer By Bernoulli’s equation, ( 𝜌𝑣2 2 +𝜌.𝑔.ℎ +𝑃)1=( 𝜌𝑣2 2 +𝜌.𝑔.ℎ +𝑃)2. There is no movement of liquid, so the velocity terms fall away. The pressure at the top of the tank is atmospheric pressure, 101kPa. Thus, if the reference point for height is the bottom of the tank, then 𝑃2=𝑃1+𝜌.𝑔.ℎ1 = 1000kg/m 3.9.8N.10m+101kPa=98 000N/m 2 +101kPa= 199kPa. Note that this pressure difference for 10m of water yields a rule of thumb that 10 meters of water depth corresponds to roughly one atmosphere of pressure, which you can always use to intuitively check your answers. Once again, pay close attention to the units when doing these calculations and remember that 1m/s 2=1N, and 1N/m 2=1Pa. Note as well that you would arrive at the same answer regardless of where you placed the reference point for the height of the liquid. Now let us modify the earlier scenario so that there is some fluid motion as well, by including a circular outlet aperture with diameter 3cm at the bottom of the tank, through which water will be discharged. Once again, we apply Bernoulli’s equation at Point 1 and Point 2. For Point 1, there is a velocity term but it is very small. This is because the level in the tank will be dropping as liquid leaves, but the diameter of the tank is much larger than that of the aperture and so the velocity will be low and so we can treat it as negligible. Therefore, for point 1, ( 𝜌𝑣2 2 +𝜌.𝑔.ℎ +𝑃)1= 𝜌.𝑔.ℎ1+𝑃1, as before. Point 2 is also unchanged. Let us now look at Point 3, where water is being discharged into the open air. Because this point is exposed to the open atmosphere, its pressure must be atmospheric (101kPa at sea level). Let us apply Bernoulli’s equation to Point 3 and Point 1. ( 𝜌𝑣2 2 +𝜌.𝑔.ℎ +𝑃)3= ( 𝜌𝑣2 2 +𝜌.𝑔.ℎ +𝑃)1 Point 3 𝑃1=𝑃3 (101 𝑘𝑃𝑎), and 𝜌𝑣1 2 2 =0, therefore 𝜌𝑣2 2 2 =𝜌.𝑔.ℎ1 therefore 𝑣2 2=2.𝑔.ℎ1 𝑣2=√2.𝑔.ℎ1=√2.√10𝑚.9.8𝑚/𝑠2=14𝑚/𝑠 Once again, pay careful attention to the units to ensure that the calculation is being done correctly! We now know the velocity of the water leaving the aperture. We can use this, along with the size of the aperture, to determine the flow-rate of water leaving the tank. The velocity of a fluid flow, multiplied by the cross-sectional surface area perpendicular to the direction of flow, gives the volumetric flow-rate. Hence flow-rate = 14𝑚 𝑠 .𝜋𝑟2= 14𝑚 𝑠 𝜋(0.015𝑚)2=0.00315𝑚3 𝑠 =3.15𝑙/𝑠.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
