Along metazoan evolution, an exquisite control developed because although oxygen is required as the final acceptor ofelectron respiratory chain, an excessive level could be potentially harmful. Understanding the role of the main factors affectingoxygen availability, such as the gradient of pressure of oxygen during normal conditions, and during hypoxia is an important point.Several factors such as anaesthesia, hypoxia, and stress affect the regulation of the atmospheric, alveolar, arterial, capillary andtissue partial pressure of oxygen (PO2). Our objective is to offer to the reader a summarized and practical appraisal of themechanisms related to the oxygen's supply within the human body, including a facilitated description of the gradient of pressure fromthe atmosphere to the cells. This review also included the most relevant measuring methods of PO2 as well as a practical overviewof its reference values in several tissues.PO2 monitoring plays a vital role in diagnosing, managing, and researching various medical conditions and situations.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
