Hutchinson 2B09 School of Anatomical Sciences OBJECTIVES • Describe the features of the eyelids and major landmarks of the eyes of a living subject • Describe the major features of the bony walls of the orbit • Describe the arrangement, innervation and actions of the extra-ocular muscles • Describe the distribution of the optic nerve, ophthalmic nerve and ophthalmic artery in the orbit • Understand the anatomical arrangement of structures in the eye through a horizontal section of the eyeball Surface Anatomy of the Eye Orbital Axes BONES OF THE ORBIT Accessory Visual Structures • The orbits and orbital region anterior to the eyeballs contain and protect the eyeballs and accessory visual structures which include: • Eyelids - bound the orbits anteriorly, controlling exposure of the anterior eyeball • Extraocular muscles – position the eyeballs and raise the superior eyelids • Nerves & Vessels – in transit to the eyeballs and muscles • Mucous membrane (conjunctiva) – lining the eyelids and anterior aspect of the eyeballs and most of the lacrimal apparatus, which lubricates it • Orbital fat – forms a matrix in which the structures of the orbit are embedded EYE: EYELIDS EYE: EYELIDS EYE: LACRIMAL GLAND AND APPARATUS Lacrimal gland & apparatus • Excretory ducts of the lacrimal gland • Convey lacrimal fluid from the gland to the conjunctival sac • Lacrimal canaliculi • Commence at the lacrimal punctum (opening) on the lacrimal papilla near the medial angle of the eye and drain lacrimal fluid from the lacrimal lake to the lacrimal sac • Lacrimal lake • A triangular space at the medial angle of the eye where tears collect • Lacrimal sac • The dilated superior part of the nasolacrimal duct • Nasolacrimal duct • Conveys lacrimal fluid to the inferior nasal concha Tears • Production of lacrimal fluid is stimulated by parasympathetic impulses from CNVII • Lacrimal fluid is secreted through 8-12 excretory ducts , which open into the lateral part of the superior conjunctival fornix of the conjunctival sac • The fluid flows inferiorly within the sac under the influence of gravity. When the eye becomes dry, the eye blinks • The eyelids come together in a lateral to medial sequence pushing a film of fluid medially over the cornea • Once in the lacrimal sac tears pass to the inferior nasal meatus through the nasolacrimal duct, draining posteriorly across the floor of the nasal cavity into the nasopharynx Innervation of the lacrimal glandEYE: EYEBALL EyeballEYE: EYEBALL Superior rectusLateral rectus vs. medial rectus Inferior rectus Superior oblique vs. Inferior oblique Optic nerve (CNII) Oculomotor nerve (CNIII)Trochlear nerve (CNIV)Ophthalmic nerve (CNV1)Abducent nerve (CNVI)Arteries and Veins of the Orbit Possible common abnormalities of the eye • Degeneration of the optic vesicle/s may result in unilateral or bilateral anopthalmos • Infection of the mother with rubella may result in congenital cataract in the infant • Cyclopia (median eye) which results from the total or partial fusion of the eyes. This is often associated with holoprosencephaly (non-separation of the forebrain). This abnormality is thought to result from an associated neural crest cell deficiency. The proboscis (tubular nose) usually lies above the eye. 1. Identify the highlighted structure 2. What is the function of this structure 3.
