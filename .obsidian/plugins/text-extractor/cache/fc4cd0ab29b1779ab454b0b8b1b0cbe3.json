Introduction:a. Background on blood flow responses in celiac and superior mesenteric arteries during digestionb. Purpose of the study: to investigate the blood flow changes in these arteries at the initial phase of digestion2. Methods:a. Subjects: healthy volunteersb. Experimental design: ingestion of a standardised meal, followed by blood flow measurements using Doppler ultrasoundc. Measurement locations: celiac and superior mesenteric arteriesd. Data analysis: comparison of blood flow responses between the two arteries during digestion3. Results:a. Blood flow in celiac artery increased significantly during the initial phase of digestionb. Blood flow in superior mesenteric artery also increased, but to a lesser extent than in the celiac arteryc. The difference between blood flow responses in both arteries was significantd. No significant correlation found between blood flow changes and the volume of ingested meal4. Conclusion:a. Blood flow in celiac artery increased more than in superior mesenteric artery during initial phase of digestionb. The difference in blood flow responses may be due to differences in vascular resistance or anatomical factorsc. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and their implications for gastrointestinal healthKey Takeaways:1. Blood flow in celiac artery increased significantly during initial phase of digestion.2. Blood flow in superior mesenteric artery also increased, but to a lesser extent than in celiac artery.BacklinksMedical papersBlood flow responses in celiac and superior mesenteric arteries in the initialphase of digestionAbstractBlood flow (BF) responses in the celiac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) during and immediately after a meal arepoorly understood. We characterized postprandial BF responses in these arteries in the initial phase of digestion. After a baselinemeasurement in the overnight fasting state, healthy subjects ingested solid food (300 kcal) and water ad libitum within 5 min (4.6 +/-0.2 min, means +/- SE), and then rested for 60 min in the postprandial state. Mean blood velocities (MBVs) in CA (n = 7) and SMA (n= 9) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured throughout the procedure. The MAP was divided by the MBV to yield theresistance index (RI). The MBV in CA and SMA started increasing within a minute after beginning the meal. The MBV in CA rapidlyreached its peak increase (60 +/- 8% change from baseline) at 5 +/- 1 min after the start of the meal, whereas the MBV in SMAgradually reached its peak increase (134 +/- 14%) at 41 +/- 4 min after the start of the meal, reflecting a decrease in the RI for bothCA and SMA. These findings suggested an earlier increase in CA and SMA MBV, implying that the increase of BF in some parts ofthe small intestine precedes the arrival of chyme.3. Further research needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and their implications for gastrointestinal health.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
