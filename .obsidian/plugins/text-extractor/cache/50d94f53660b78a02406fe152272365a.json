Tshabalala Room 2P22 Second floor, Medical School Objectives  PRONEPHROS  MESONEPHROS  METANEPHROS  The development of the collecting system  The development of the excretory system  The ascent of the kidneys  The development of the urinary bladder  Abnormalities Urinary system Kidney developmentKidney development Pronephros  Appear early in the fourth week  Tubular structures in the cervical region  Pronephric ducts run caudally and open into the cloaca  Pronephros will degenerate  Duct system persists, used by the mesonephros Mesonephros  Appears late in the fourth week  Caudal to the degenerating pronephros  Function as interim kidneys  Consists of glomeruli and mesonephric tubules  The duct opens into the cloaca  Degenerate at the end of the first trimester Metanephros • Forms the permanent kidney • Develops early in the 5th week • Begins to function early in the 9th week • Ureteric bud • Metanephric mesoderm • Metanephrogenic blastema Kidney development Ureteric bud/diverticulum forms the collecting system of the kidneys (ureters, renal pelvis, major and minor calices, collecting tubules and ducts Metanephric blastema forms the excretory system (renal corpuscles, proximal convoluted tubules, loops of Henle, distal convoluted tubules) Kidney development (Reciprocal induction)Collecting SystemCollecting SystemCollecting SystemCollecting System Excretory system Excretory systemExcretory system Kidney development  Nephrons are formed until birth  Urine production begins during the 10th week after the differentiation of glomerular capillaries Ascent of the kidneyAscent of the kidneyAscent of the kidneysAscent of the kidneysAscent of the kidneysAscent of the kidneysAscent of the kidneys Abnormalities  Accessory renal arteries  Renal agenesis  Ectopic kidneys  Malrotated kidney  Horseshoe kidney  Duplication of the ureters Accessory renal arteries and Hydronephrosis Accessory renal arteries and Hydronephrosis Unilateral renal agenesis  Approximately 1:1000 newborn infants.  Males are affected more often than females  Left kidney is usually the one that is absent  Unilateral renal agenesis often causes no symptoms  Compensatory hypertrophy and performs the function of the missing kidney.
