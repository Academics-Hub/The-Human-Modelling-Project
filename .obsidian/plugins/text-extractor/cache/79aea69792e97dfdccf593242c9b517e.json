If the efficiency of a coal-fired power station is 30% and average losses in combined transmission and distribution system is 10%; a) How much coal is burnt at the power station to provide 200Wh of electrical energy at home for boiling 2 litres of water in the kettle? b) In 2017 Eskom reported emitting 211,1Mt of CO2 from burning 113, 7Mt of coal in the power stations. i. How much CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere at the power station in providing the electrical energy to boil the 2 litres of water in the electric kettle? ii. What are the other waste by-products of coal combustion? iii. What are the possible pollution mitigations in coal-fired thermal power stations? 11 Online Resource •Practical Engineering, “How Does the Power Grid Work?” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1BMWczn7JM Thank you and bye!","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
