JOVANOVIĆ Ovary Graafian follicle Graafian follicle • Slides 9 and 9.2 Ovary (Baboon) Cortex Hilum (or hilus) Cortex Hilum (or hilus) NOTE: A cross section through the ovary shows two distinct regions: The peripherally situated cortex and central medulla. Cortex is richly cellular connective tissue that surrounds the ovarian follicles at the different stages of development, while medulla (not visible in either section) contains loose connective tissue with numerous blood vessels, nerves and lymphatic vessels. An OVARIAN FOLLICLE is a roughly spheroid cellular aggregation that contains a single oocyte (immature ovum or egg cell). As they develop, ovarian follicles secrete hormones and thus influence different stages of the menstrual cycle. At the same time, under the influence of pituitary hormones, follicles grow and develop, culminating in ovulation of usually a single oocyte. Study the development of the ovarian follicles in the following slides. Cortex (consists of connective tissue stroma and follicles at the different stages of development) Germinal epithelium Tunica albuginea Nucleus Single layer of squamous follicular cells Single layer of cuboidal follicular cells Oocyte PRIMORDIAL FOLLICLE PRIMARY UNILAMINAR FOLLICLE PRIMARY MULTILAMINAR FOLLICLE SECONDARY ANTRAL FOLLICLE Oocyte Zona pellucida Multiple layers of follicular (granulosa) cells Basement membrane Antrum filled with follicular fluid that forms between the granulosa cells Theca interna Theca externa MATURE GRAAFIAN FOLLICLE Antrum Corona radiata Cumulus oophorus Oocyte Zona pellucida Follicular (granulosa) cell layer Theca interna Theca externa NOTE: During the period of follicular maturation, the theca interna cells become steroid producing cells. Under the influence of pituitary LH hormone, these cells secrete the precursors of oestrogens (androgens) which are transported to the granulosa cells. In response to pituitary FSH hormone, androgens are converted to oestrogens, which in turn stimulate the granulosa cells to proliferate and enlarge thus increasing the size of the follicle. Slide 56: Ovary - Corpus luteum CL NOTE: Ovulation results in the release of the secondary oocyte from the mature - graafian follicle. Subsequently, the remains of the collapsed graafian follicle undertakes reorganisation into the corpus luteum and contains the centrally located granulosa lutein cells (derived from granulosa cells), peripherally located theca lutein cells (derived from theca interna cells) and the cells of theca externa that now forms the septa of this transient endocrine organ. This slide shows a cross section of the entire ovary with a very large corpus luteum (encircled) containing a central clot (CL). Study the granulosa lutein cells and the theca lutein cells using the two photomicrogarphs on the following slide. Theca lutein cells Granulosa lutein cells Central clot Theca externa forming the connective tissue septa Granulosa lutein cells filled with lipid droplets Theca lutein cells NOTE: The granulosa lutein cells contain large spherical nucleus and a large amount of cytoplasm, whereas the theca lutein cells are smaller with spherical nucleus and thus generally appear to be closer to each other in comparison to granulosa lutein cells. These two types of steroid producing cells secrete progesterone and oestrogen into the rich vascular network and in that way stimulate the growth and differentiation of the uterine endometrium in preparation for the possible implantation of the fertilized ovum. Blood vessel Uterus Lumen Endometrium Myometrium Perimetrium NOTE: The uterine wall is composed of three layers (from the lumen outward): Endometrium (consists of luminal epithelium, glands, connective tissue – stroma and spiral arteries), myometrium the thick smooth muscle layer (with numerous large blood vessels and lymphatic vessels) and perimetrium the outer serous layer. We will concentrate mostly on the endometrial layer, since this layer undergoes cyclical changes each month throughout the reproductive lifespan of a female. Study the cyclical changes (phases) happening within the endometrium in the following slides. Remember to correlate the three phases of the menstrual cycle taking place within the endometrium with the events happening simultaneously within the ovary! Uterus Slide 10 - 2 Slide 10 Uterus – Proliferative phase Lumen Endometrium Myometrium NOTE: During the proliferative phase (Day 4 to day 14 of the 28 day menstrual cycle) the endometrium is recovering after it has been slough off. Epithelial cells (from the basal parts of the glands situated in the stratum basale), reconstitute the glands and migrate to cover endometrial surface. Fibroblast looking stromal cells proliferate, spiral arteries lengthen, while simple tubular glands appear relatively straight, with narrow lumina. Observe each of these changes in the following slide. Lumen Lumen Endometrium Myometrium Stratum functionale Stratum basale Luminal (simple cuboidal to columnar) epithelium Uterine (simple tubular) glands Spiral arteries Connective tissue - stroma, with fibroblast looking stromal cells Slide 58 Uterus – Secretory phase NOTE: During the secretory phase (Day 14 to Day 28 of the menstrual cycle) endometrium becomes edematous, glands enlarge and become corkscrew, their lumina filled with secretory products (glycogen), spiral arteries lengthen and coil, while stromal cells decidualise (become large and rounded), providing a favorable environment for possible embryo implantation. Observe each of these changes in the following slide. Lumen Uterine glands Spiral arteries Decidualised stromal cells Lumen Endometrium Myometrium Luminal epithelium Slide 60 Placenta Chorionic Villi Amnion Amioniotic Sac Chorionic villi Intervillous space Maternal side of the placenta - Decidua basalis Chorionic plate Syncytiotrophoblast Cytotrophoblast Maternal side - Decidua basalis Intervillous space Mesenchymal tissue Foetal blood vessels NOTE: The inlet from the first photomicrograph and the bottom photomicrograph show the anchoring villous attaching to the maternal part of placenta called decidua basalis. NOTE: Tertiary villus surrounded with the maternal blood lake within the intervillous space. Its core is made of the mesenchymal tissue which cushions numerous foetal blood vessels. The outside layer of the villous is made of the syncytiotrophoblast cells, while the cytotrophoblast cells are relatively sparse, found immediately under the former. Intervillous space Foetal blood vessels Syncytiotrophoblast Cytotrophoblast Mesenchymal tissue NOTE: This photomicrograph shows the point of attachment of the anchoring villus (outlined in red) onto the maternal part of placenta (decidua basalis). Large decidualised stromal cells are easily identified (arrows) and maternal spiral arteries frequently seen. Spiral artery Syncytiotrophoblast Cytotrophoblast Hofbauer cells (uterine macrophages) Foetal blood vessel NOTE: This photomicrograph represents a section of the tertiary villous with noticeable Hofbauer cells (uterine macrophages). Slide 122 Non lactating mammary gland NOTE: The inactive non lactating mammary gland is composed of 15-25 secretory lobes, embedded in adipose tissue. This gland is a modified sweat gland where each lobe represents a compound tubular alveolar gland. The alveoli empties into ducts lined by cuboidal or low columnar epithelial cells and surrounded by myoepithelial cells. The ducts from each lobule empty into a lactiferous duct that empties onto the surface of the nipple. These ducts are surrounded by smooth muscle in the region of the nipple which assists with the erection of the nipple. Abundant adipose tissue is present within the dense irregular connective tissue of the interlobular spaces. Dense irregular connective tissue Adipose tissue Ducts Slide 55 Lactating mammary gland NOTE: The mammary glands undergo dramatic proliferation and development during pregnancy. The changes in the glandular tissue of the lobes are characterised by a decrease in the connective as well as adipose tissue. The ducts branch and alveoli develop. In the later stages of pregnancy , there is a hypertrophy of the secretory cells and accumulation of the secretory product in the alveoli. The secretory cells produce two distinct products that are released by merocrine (protein component ) and apocrine (fatty or lipid component of the milk) mode of secretion.
