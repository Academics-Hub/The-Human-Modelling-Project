Regulation of glycolysis • Glucokinase (in liver) (glucose + ATP → glucose-6P + ADP) • activity increases with high blood [glucose] • is increased by insulin • activity decreased by glucagon and adrenaline. • Hexokinase (most other tissues) (glucose + ATP → glucose-6P + ADP) • inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate, its product. • ↑glucose in the cell → ↓glucose gradient →↓glucose entry NOTES : Glucose uptake into cells from blood • Glucose uptake into most tissues is controlled by insulin. • Glucose transporter in peripheral tissues, GLUT-4 (glucose transporter 4) - increased by insulin. • Glucose uptake into liver, brain, red blood cells and pancreas is not regulated by insulin. It depends on blood glucose concentration. – Results in glycosylation of the cells – primarily seen in red blood cells (HB1aC) • Insulin-independent cells have different insulin- independent glucose transporters (GLUT-2). – SGLT receptors – SGLT2 antagonist drugs prevent glucose reabsorbtion in the nephrons of the kidney • Glucose phosphorylation reaction is irreversible and glucose-6-phosphate cannot cross cell membranes. • Glucokinase activity is increased by cellular glucose & induced by insulin.

Tissue dependence on glycolysis for energy production. Red blood cells – Totally dependent on anaerobic glycolysis (no mitochondria). Muscle – Very dependent on glycolysis both aerobically and anaerobically. Brain – Prefers aerobic glycolysis. Adipose tissue – Glycolysis needed for lipid synthesis and cellular energy. 2. Regulation of glycolysis cont….. Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) (fructose-1P + ATP → fructose-1,6-bisP + ADP) Enzyme activity stimulated by: • increased AMP concentration • increased concentration of glycolytic substrates • insulin (indirectly) Enzyme activity inhibited by: • increased ATP concentration • increased citrate concentration • Also glucagon, adrenaline (indirectly) 3. Regulation of glycolysis cont….. Pyruvate kinase (phosphoenolpyruvate + ADP → pyruvate + ATP) Activity stimulated by: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate Insulin Activity inhibited by: ATP glucagon Lactate dehydrogenase (pyruvate + NADH → lactate + NAD+) Activity stimulated by: increased pyruvate increased NADH decreased NAD+ • Dihydroxyacetone phosphate is used for lipogenesis in adipocytes. • In other cells dihydroxyacetone phosphate is isomerised to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate for the rest of glycolysis. • Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is converted to 1,3-biphosphoglycerate with the addition of inorganic phosphate (PO4) and transfer of 2 electrons (H- + H+) to NAD+, yielding NADH + H+. • The high-energy position 1 phosphate of 1,3-biphosphoglycerate is used to make ATP, leaving 3-phosphoglycerate, which is isomerised and dehydrated to form high-energy phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). • Pyruvate kinase catalyses irreversible conversion of PEP to pyruvate, with production of another molecule of ATP. • Pyruvate kinase is activated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and insulin, and inhibited by ATP and glucagon. • Unlike other catabolic pathways, insulin stimulates glycolysis and glucagon inhibits it. 1, Summary of Glycolysis • Glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate in aerobic conditions in cells that have mitochondria. • In anaerobic conditions (hypoxia or fast twitch muscle fibres) and in cells that lack mitochondria (erythrocytes) pyruvate is reduced to lactate, which allows oxidation of NADH to NAD+, providing the NAD+ co-enzyme needed for glycolysis to continue. • In the “investment” stages of glycolysis 2 ATP molecules are used to form fructose-1,6-bisphosphate from glucose. • Reactions forming glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-1,6- bisphosphate are irreversible and the enzymes, hexokinase, glucokinase and phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) are regulated. • Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is split into 2 phosphorylated trioses, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which are inter-convertible. 2. Summary of Glycolysis Possible fates of glucose-6-phosphate Glucose-6-phosphate Energy generation Pentose sugars & NADPH Glycogen glycogen synthesis glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway Important metabolic intersection! Pentose phosphate pathway (hexose monophosphate shunt) Glucose Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate Glucose-6-phosphate ATP ADP Fructose-6-phosphate ATP ADP Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 6C 6C 5C 5C 3C H2O + NADP+ NADPH 6-phosphogluconateNADP+ NADPH + CO2 Ribulose-5-phosphate Ribose-5-phosphate Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)* OR Pentose phosphate pathway involves oxidation of glucose. But its primary role is anabolic rather than catabolic. The pathway is important in preventing oxidative damage to red blood cells (erythrocytes). nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate Pentose phosphate pathway (hexose monophosphate shunt) • The pentose phosphate pathway produces the 5-carbon sugar, ribulose-5- phosphate, from glucose-6-phosphate, • The cofactor NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) together with its reduced form NADPH is involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids and nucleic acids. • The rate-limiting enzyme is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which is activated by NADP+. • Ribulose-5-phosphate is isomerised to ribose-5-phosphate, which is used to make nucleotides, RNA and DNA. • In cells that are not actively synthesising nucleotides (e.g. red blood cells), 3 molecules of ribulose-5-phosphate (3 x 5C) are converted to 2 molecules of fructose-6-phosphate (2 x 6C) and 1 molecule of glyceraldehyde-3-phospahte (1 x 3C). Both are returned to the glycolysis pathway. • NADPH is important for protecting red blood cells from oxidation-induced haemolysis. It is used to reduce glutathione, which in turn neutralises reactive oxygen species (produced by toxins or drugs, including anti-malarials) that oxidise the cell membrane. Synthesis of glycogen (glycogenesis) from glucose-6-phosphate UTP 2Pi Pi = inorganic phosphate Irreversible ** = Need to know Branching enzyme • Synthesis of glycogen requires some pre-existing glycogen. • Glucose-6-P is isomerised to glucose-1-P. UMP from UTP is added to the phosphate group of glucose-1-P. The phosphate bonds provide energy for joining glucose to existing glycogen. • Glycogen synthesis consumes energy 2 bonds from UTP for each molecule of glucose added to glycogen. • Glycogen synthase only makes α1-4 bonds (chains). • Glycogen branching enzyme transfers some of the α1-4-linked sugars to an α1→6 branch. • Glycogen in liver is used to maintain blood glucose concentration. • Liver glycogen content fluctuates during the day. • Glycogen in heart and skeletal muscle cells is only used as a fuel reserve for the cell.

Decreased blood glucose concentration • liver glycogen stores are utilised • the synthesis of glucose occurs • catabolism fat instead of glucose when little/no carbohydrate is eaten • Maintaining blood glucose concentration at 4.1 – 5.9 mmol/l Excess blood glucose • glucose is removed from the blood when it is in excess • stored as glycogen (in liver and muscle) • stored as fat Regulation of glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) • Glycogen synthase is the rate-limiting enzyme. • It is activated by insulin (dephosphorylation) • It is inhibited by glucagon and adrenaline (phosphorylation). • After a meal containing carbohydrate increased blood glucose stimulates secretion of insulin. • Insulin stimulates uptake of glucose into peripheral tissue, including muscle and adipose tissue, decreasing the blood glucose concentration. • Glucose increases activity of glucokinase and insulin increases the amount of glucokinase protein so that more glucose-6-phosphate is trapped in the liver. • Insulin activates glycogen synthase in liver and muscle → increased glycogen stores. • When blood glucose concentration decreases, insulin decreases and glucagon is secreted. • Glucagon inhibits glycogen synthesis and stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
