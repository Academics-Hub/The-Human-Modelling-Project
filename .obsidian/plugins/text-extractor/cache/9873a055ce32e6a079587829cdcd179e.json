Site: In the ampullary part of the uterine tube, for 2 reasons:  It is close to the ovary.  It is the widest part of the uterine tube. Definition & Site of fertilization http://mmatthewsbiology.weebly.com/uploads/5/8/5/1/58510837/s tudent_handbook_2015-2016.pdf The Sperm & Egg/ovum *Sperm -length = about 50µ, and highly motile. Parts→ head, neck and a motile tail. Head contains the nucleus that is covered by the acrosome (an organelle containing enzymes). Two types of sperms according to the chromosomal contents i.e. the Y- bearing sperm (having 22 autosomes + Y) the X bearing sperm (having 22 autosomes +X). Secondary Oocyte (ovum) • Has large size & immotile, • Covered by zona pellucida and corona radiate • The cytoplasm is abundant (containing yolk granules for nutrition of the embryo during the 1wk of deve.) • The nucleus contains 22 chromosomes + one X chromosome Movement of sperm & oocyte Sperm 1. By own propulsion →tail. 1. By the movement of uterine cilia. Egg 1. By the movement fimbria of the uterine tube. 2. By peristaltic movement of the uterine tubes Before the sperm fertilizes the oocyte it must undergo 2 processes: Capacitation: • the glycoprotein coat is removed from the surface of the sperm's acrosome (about 7 hours). *Only the capacitated sperms can penetrate the corona radiata. Acrosome reaction: - *Occur after capacitation where proteolytic enzymes (acrosin, esterases, hyaluronidase, and neuraminidase ) *Released by sperm cells →digest & penetrate the zona pellucida. Phases of Fertilization 1. several sperm reach the site of fertilization • Only one sperm will fertilize the oocyte • The others aid the fertilizing sperm to penetrate the barriers • Only the capacitated sperm pass freely through the corona radiata 2. Sperm bind to the zona pellucida & triggers release of acrosomal contents → zona digestion Penetration of the zona pellucida 3. Once sperm contacts the plasma membrane of the egg 4. Immediate change in the zona pellucida (release of cortical granules- lysosomal enzymes (depolarizes- zona reaction) – blocks polyspermy Fusion of the oocyte and sperm cell membranes 5. Cell membrane adhere and fuse 6. Both head and tail enter the cytoplasm of the oocyte 7. The sperm plasma membrane → left on oocyte surf. 8. fusion of the sperm’s pronucleus with the pronucleus of the egg = zygote Fertilization • Once the sperm cell enters the cytoplasm of the oocyte, – the oocyte will complete its second meiotic division The chromosomes of oocyte nucleus arrange themselves into a female pronucleus • The sperm cell will move closer to the female pronucleus • The sperm nucleus becomes swollen and the tail →degenerate as a male pronucleus is formed One daughter cell is called the second polar body -degenerate The other daughter cell is the definitive oocyte Two daughter cells • Both pronuclei will come in close contact, – lose nuclear envelopes and fuse • The fusion of the two pronuclei → zygote (completes fertilization) STAGES: Meiosis II complete Formation of male and female pronuclei Decondensation of male chromosomes Fusion of pronuclei Zygote Summary Phases of fertilization: During Fertilization • Penetration of the corona radiata • Penetration of the zona pellucida • Fusion of the oocyte and sperm cell membranes Results of fertilization 1. Restoration of the diploid number of chromosomes (46 chromosomes) 2. Determination of the embryo's chromosomal sex (the female is 46,XX and the male is 46,XY) 3. Stimulation of cleavage (mitotic cell divisions of the zygote) 4. A new individual – formed, consists of both maternal and paternal chromosomes … Week 1: days 1-6 • Fertilization, day 1 • Cleavage, day 2-3 • Compaction, day 3 • Formation of blastocyst, day 4 • Ends with beginning of implantation, day 6 Cleavage Definition: the repeated mitotic divisions of the zygote, resulting into a rapid increase in the number of cells that are called blastomeres. Site: The uterine tube medial to the ampula. • The zygote 1st divide →two-celled zygote. • Further cleavage divisions →the two-celled zygote forms 4 cells • The 4 cells will form 8 cells, 8 will form 16…..until we reach a 32 cell stage known as a morula. • The resulting cells are called blastomeres – the cell → smaller with each cleavage division due to limiting zona pellucida Morula: A 16 -32 cells. -has mulberry appearance. -surrounded by Zona pellucida. -enters the uterus nearly 3 days after fertilization. Embryo undergoes compaction after 8-cell stage •The centrally placed cells of the morula → the inner cell mass. The cells on the periphery of the morula →outer cell mass or trophoblast → form extra- embryonic membranes and placenta •The inner cell mass →the embryo proper, Blastocyst formation As the morula enters the uterus, -fluid from the uterine cavity penetrate the zonz pellucida -accumulates in the inner-cullular spaces of the inner cell mass →creates pressure among the blastomeres/inner cell mass -inner cell mass →pushed to one pole →called embryonic pole -The opposite pole is the abembryonic pole - A single cavity is formed →the blastocele or blastocytic cavity - The morula after the formation of blastocele →called blastocyst - The blastocyst consists of: - the inner cell mass (called embryoblasts) - the outer cell mass (future trophoblast → extra- embryonic membranes – contribute to placenta) *The zona pellucida disappears allowing for implantation The break of the zona pellucida occurs under the influence of two forces: 1. mechanical pressure of the growing blastocyst on the zone 2. chemical dissolution of the zone material with secreted lytic enzymes secreted by cells of the trophectoderm Early blastocyst Day 3 Later blastocyst Day 5 blastocoele inner cell mass •The blastocyst will then implant at the end of the first week in order to receive haemotrophic nutrition (histotrophic nutrition is no longer adequate at this stage). Clinical application: Embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass. These cells are pluripotent →can give any type of tissue. Totipotency is the ability of a single cell to divide and produce all of the differentiated cells in an organism. Pluripotent cells can give rise to all of the cell types that make up the body • Hemotrophic nutrition - exchange of blood-borne materials between maternal and fetal circulations. – facilitated by the extensive and intimate apposition of the maternal and fetal tissues - the placenta. • Histotrophy - nutrition in which the developing embryo receives nutrition from its mother in the form of uterine secretions, known as histotroph (or \"uterine milk\"). • Sum total of nutritive material derived from maternal tissue other than the blood, utilized by the early embryo. Monozygotic twinning typically occurs during cleavage/blastocyst stages Cleavage and the formation of the morula and blastocyst Summary “Hatching” of the blastocyst: preparation for implantation Hatching of the embryo from the zona pellucida occurs just prior to implantation. Occasionally, the inability to hatch results in infertility, and premature hatching can result in abnormal implantation in the uterine tube. Ectopic Implantation Implantation somewhere other than upper portion of uterus “Rupture” can lead to life- threatening hemorrhage Week 2: days 7-14 implantation • Implanted embryo becomes more deeply embedded in endometrium • Further development of trophoblast into placenta • Development of a bi-laminar embryo, amniotic cavity, and yolk sac. – Ectoderm: outside, surrounds other layers later in development, generates skin and nervous tissue – Mesoderm: middle layer, generates most of the muscle, blood and connective tissues of the body and placenta – Endoderm: eventually most interior of embryo, generates the epithelial lining and associated glands of the gut, lung, and urogenital tracts Implantation Definition: Penetration of the blastocyst into the superficial (compact) layer of the endometrium. Time: Implantation occurs at the 6th day after fertilization and is completed – about 11th day Site: The normal site ►endometrium of the posterior wall of the uterus The endometrium after implantation is called decidua. Implantation Contd ■About 6 days after fertilization *attaches to endometrium ■ Orients inner cell mass toward endometrium ■ 7 days after fertilization: attaches more firmly and burrows in.. ■ Endometrium becomes more vascularized and glands enlarge ■ Decidua – modified portion of endometrium after implantation ■ Regions named relative to site of implantation Summary of events associated with the first week of development • THANK YOU & HAVE A NICE DAY","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
