The gastrointestinal (GI) circulation accounts for over 25% of cardiac output under resting conditions. Blood ¯ow to the GI tract is dynamic, however, with tissue- speci®c increases caused by the ingestion of a meal and profound reductions in ¯ow elicited by stresses that threaten to deprive the vital organs (e.g., brain, heart) of their normal blood supply. Although the different organs perfused by the GI circulation share common stimuli and mechanisms of blood ¯ow regulation, sig- ni®cant differences related to tissue function have been described. As seen in most other vascular beds, im- paired blood perfusion of GI organs can lead to profound organ dysfunction and tissue injury. The stomach, liver, intestine, and pancreas provide excellent examples of the unique and diverse anatomical features and regulatory mechanisms that distinguish the GI circulation from other regional vascular beds. GASTRIC CIRCULATION Introduction Gastric blood ¯ow plays an important role in sustaining the normal physiologic functions of the stomach and it helps to protect the gastric mucosa against ulcer formation. Intrinsic regulatory mecha- nisms ensure that blood ¯ow is adjusted to meet the energy-demanding processes of gastric secretion and motility. Gastric blood ¯ow also helps to maintain a barrier against back-diffusion of lumenal acid, thereby preventing mucosal damage and ulceration. Impairment of gastric blood ¯ow renders the mucosa vulnerable to the damaging actions of gastric juice as well as ingested agents, such as ethanol, aspirin, and bacteria (e.g., Helicobacter pylori). Anatomy Oxygenated blood is provided to the stomach via the celiac artery, with deoxygenated blood drained by the portal vein. Small branches of the celiac artery give rise to arterioles in the external muscle layers and the sub- mucosa. Some of the submucosal arterioles pierce the muscularis mucosae to produce the capillary network that supplies the mucosa. Hence, the tone of the sub- mucosal arterioles determines the magnitude of muco- sal blood ¯ow. The mucosal capillaries drain into a central vein that begins just beneath the surface epithel- ial cells. These venules coalesce to form a dense venous plexus in the submucosa. The submucosal venous drainage penetrates the external muscle layers where additional venous blood is provided by the muscle microvasculature. Hemodynamics The parallel-coupled capillary networks of the gas- tric muscular layer and the mucosa are under separate control, responding independently to tissue metabo- lism, other local factors, and extrinsic neural input. Between meals, blood ¯ow in the mucosal layer is approximately six times higher than that of the muscle layer, and approximately 75% of total gastric blood ¯ow is distributed to the mucosa, with 25% directed to the muscle layer. This intramural distribution of blood ¯ow is altered when either of the two layers becomes functionally active; i.e., when the mucosa is stimulated to produce acid, mucosal blood ¯ow (and its percent- age of total ¯ow) preferentially increases. Blood Flow Regulation Gastric blood ¯ow is controlled by neural, humoral, and metabolic factors. Sympathetic activation elicits re- ductions in total gastric blood ¯ow and mucosal ¯ow through arteriolar constriction.

Oxygen consumption by the stomach increases in pro- portion to acid production. Changes in both blood ¯ow and oxygen extraction assist in meeting the demand for additional oxygen in the acid-secreting stomach. When gastric blood ¯ow is reduced, however, acid secretion and blood ¯ow may fall in parallel, owing to the fact that the rate of oxygen delivery to the parietal cells is limited by blood ¯ow. Pathophysiology The gastric microcirculation contributes to gastric ulcer formation in several ways. Capillary transport of parietal cell-derived bicarbonate normally plays an im- portant role in protecting the surface epithelium against acid-induced injury and ulceration. The mucosal cap- illaries originating near the gastric pits transport bicar- bonate toward the mucosal surface, where it can diffuse into the interstitial compartment beneath the surface epithelial cells. The latter cells transport bicarbonate into the gastric lumen where it can buffer lumenal acid. As a consequence, there is an inverse relationship between gastric mucosal injury and the rate of vascular bicarbonate delivery to the mucosal surface. Arteriolar constriction and capillary plugging with thrombi or activated leukocytes often accompany the ulceration process and are thought to promote mucosal injury by rendering the tissue ischemic and vulnerable to necrosis. Repair of gastric mucosal ulceration relies on the restoration of blood ¯ow and on the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), which usually sprout from venules. HEPATIC CIRCULATION Introduction The hepatic circulation has many unique features compared to other vascular beds in the splanchnic cir- culation. There is the unusual presence of both an ar- terial input and a venous input that combine to deliver a large fraction of cardiac output to the liver. The acinar arrangement of the microvasculature creates a series of microenvironments within the organ that imparts a sig- ni®cant spatial resolution for speci®c biosynthetic, bio- transformation, and detoxi®cation functions of the liver. These and other unique features of the hepatic circulation serve to ensure that the varied and complex functions of the liver are maintained at levels that are optimal for the whole animal. Anatomy The liver receives blood from two sources: fully oxygenated blood is derived from the high-pressure, high-resistance hepatic artery and partially oxygenated blood comes from the low-pressure, low-resistance por- tal vein. Within the liver, these vessels give rise to numerous smaller vessels, called hepatic arterioles and terminal portal venules, which supply a small mass of parenchyma called the liver acinus. The mixture of arterial and venous blood from these terminal vessels drains into the sinusoids, which constitutes the capillary network of the liver. The sinusoidal capillaries are highly permeable to water and plasma proteins. The sinusoids radiate toward the periphery of the acinus, where they connect with the terminal hepatic venules and ultimately into progressively larger branches of hepatic veins and the inferior vena cava. Hemodynamics Total hepatic blood ¯ow accounts for approximately 25% of resting cardiac output (1250ÿ1500 ml/min) in the resting adult human. The portal vein supplies the liver with 70ÿ75% of its blood and the hepatic artery provides the remaining 25ÿ30%. Because of the higher oxygen content of arterial blood, the hepatic artery and portal vein contribute roughly equal amounts of oxygen to the liver in the fasting state. The mean blood pressure in the hepatic artery is approximately 90 mm Hg and that in the portal vein is approximately 10 mm Hg, re- sulting in a sinusoidal capillary pressure of 2ÿ3 mm Hg. The low pressure within these highly permeable capil- laries serves to minimize excessive loss of ¯uid and protein into the liver interstitium and the subsequent leakage of this plasma ®ltrate into the peritoneal cavity (ascites ¯uid). Blood Flow Regulation Increased blood ¯ow in the portal vein leads to an increased hepatic arterial resistance and a reduction in portal vein ¯ow produces hepatic arterial dilation. Al- though this reciprocal relationship between hepatic arterial and portal vein blood ¯ows tends to maintain a constant total blood ¯ow through the liver, ¯ow in one system usually cannot fully compensate for the reduc- tion in blood ¯ow in the other system. However, the liver is more effective at maintaining a constant oxygen consumption because the extraction of oxygen from hepatic blood is very ef®cient. The small diffusion distances for oxygen transport between blood and he- patocytes accounts for this highly ef®cient oxygen extraction. Hepatic blood ¯ow increases following 352 CIRCULATION, OVERVIEW ingestion of a meal, largely due to an increased ¯ow in the portal vein. Capacitance Function The liver represents the most important blood res- ervoir in human. It contains approximately 15% of the total blood volume of the body. Hepatic blood volume can nearly double when right atrial pressure is elevated. The capacitance function of the liver plays an important role during hemorrhage. After moderate blood loss, ac- tivated sympathetic nerves constrict the hepatic venules and expel enough blood to compensate for as much as 25% of the hemorrhage. INTESTINAL CIRCULATION Introduction The blood circulation plays an important role in the support of intestinal functions, such as propulsion of chyme and assimilation of ingested nutrients. Intrinsic regulatory mechanisms allow the intestine to adjust the distribution of blood ¯ow between the muscular and mucosal layers in accordance with local metabolic needs. An extensive network of collateral channels within and external to the gut wall helps to ensure ad- equate intestinal blood ¯ow. Anatomy The small intestine receives blood primarily from the numerous vascular arcades arising from the superior mesenteric artery. The arterial arcades are connected by extensive collateral channels both within the mesentery (extramural) and within the bowel wall proper (intra- mural). The major arterial vessels supplying the mu- cosa, submucosa, and muscularis emerge from an arterial plexus within the submucosa. The submucosa proper has a very sparse vascular supply. The arterioles entering the muscle layer branch into capillaries run- ning parallel to the muscle ®bers. The mucosal villi are supplied by a single arteriole running centrally to the tip where the vessel branches into a fountain-like pattern of capillaries that drain into the centrally located vein. The venous drainage of the mucosa and muscularis empties into large veins within the submucosa. These veins enter the mesentery in parallel to the arterial arcades of the superior mesenteric artery and eventually drain into the portal vein. Hemodynamics Intestinal blood ¯ow accounts for 10ÿ15% of the resting cardiac output (500ÿ750 ml/min) in the adult human. There appears to be an oral-to-anal gradient in blood ¯ow (milliliters per gram of tissue) along the small intestine. In the resting state, approximately 65% of the total intestinal blood ¯ow is directed to the mucosa, 25% to the muscularis, and the remainder to the submucosa. This distribution of ¯ow within the bowel wall is usually attributed to the greater metabolic demand of the mucosa. Stimulation of mucosal epithel- ial transport processes favors improved mucosal perfu- sion, whereas enhanced motor activity redistributes blood ¯ow to the muscle layers. Blood Flow Regulation Extrinsic control of intestinal blood ¯ow is exerted by neural and humoral factors. Activation of para- sympathetic nerves usually results in vasodilation (in- creased blood ¯ow) mediated by acetylcholine. Sympathetic nerve stimulation elicits vasoconstriction (decreased blood ¯ow) that is mediated by nor- epinephrine. This a-adrenergic vasoconstriction is short-lived because intestinal arterioles escape from the constrictor in¯uence of norepinephrine, resulting in partial restoration of normal blood ¯ow (auto- regulatory escape). Local release of adenosine appears to mediate this autoregulatory escape. Hormones such as vasoactive intestinal peptide, cholecystokinin, and secretin can induce vasodilation and increase blood ¯ow, whereas angiotensin II and vasopressin are potent constrictors of intestinal arterioles. Indeed, a large pro- portion of basal vascular tone in the intestine can be attributed to circulating angiotensin II and vasopressin. Intrinsic control of intestinal blood ¯ow is mediated by both metabolic and nonmetabolic factors. Ingestion of a meal results in an increase in both intestinal oxygen consumption and blood ¯ow. The postprandial hyper- emia is directly coupled to the increase in intestinal oxygen consumption. For any given increase in oxygen consumption, the greater the initial oxygen extraction, the greater the postprandial hyperemia. If the initial oxygen extraction is low, then the postprandial hyper- emia is minimal and the increased oxygen demand is met primarily by an increase in oxygen extraction. The opposite holds if the initial oxygen extraction is high. The postprandial hyperemia is con®ned to that seg- ment of intestine directly exposed to chyme; segments distal to the bolus of chyme have normal resting blood ¯ow. Of the hydrolytic products of food digestion, lu- menal glucose and oleic acid are capable of eliciting an intestinal hyperemia. Intralumenal glucose presumably elicits a hyperemia due to stimulation of absorptive pro- cesses, since 2-deoxyglucose (which is not absorbed) does not elicit a hyperemia. The glucose-induced CIRCULATION, OVERVIEW 353 hyperemia is mediated by metabolic factors, such as low tissue pO2, and adenosine release. The same metabolic factors contribute to the oleic acid-induced functional hyperemia; however, a portion of the hyperemia can be attributed to oleic acid-induced irritation of the mucosa, which is linked to local release of vasoactive intestinal peptide. The importance of active transport of nutrients to the postprandial hyperemia is best exempli®ed by the differential responses of the jejunum and ileum to lu- menal bile or bile salts. In the jejunum, bile does not elicit a hyperemia, whereas in the ileum (where bile salts are actively transported), lumenal bile produces a pro- found hyperemic response. Pathophysiology Occlusion of a major intestinal artery does not result in the expected reduction in intestinal blood ¯ow. In adult animals, occlusion of a branch of the superior mesenteric artery results in only a 30ÿ50% reduction in intestinal blood ¯ow, which is attributed to the ex- tensive network of intramural and extramural collateral channels. In neonatal animals, which have less devel- oped collateral channels, a similar arterial occlusion reduces intestinal blood ¯ow by 70%. This may explain why the neonatal intestine is more vulnerable to ische- mic necrosis than adult intestine. Reperfusion of the ischemic intestine exacerbates the microvascular dysfunction and tissue injury in- curred during ischemia. The reperfusion-induced intes- tinal pathology is comparable to that observed during an intense in¯ammatory response. The reintroduction of oxygen upon reperfusion results in the local formation of oxygen radicals, which in turn initiate a series of events that promote the recruitment and activation of neutrophils. Extravasated neutrophils release a variety of proteases and reactive oxygen metabolites that me- diate the mucosal dysfunction and epithelial necrosis induced by ischemia and reperfusion. PANCREATIC CIRCULATION Introduction The pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine func- tions. The endocrine functions of the pancreas are lo- calized to the islet cells and the secretory functions are localized to the ducts and acini. The human pancreas can secrete approximately 1 liter of juice every 24 h. The water and electrolytes delivered to pancreatic juice are ultimately derived from the blood. Thus, the pancreas controls its blood ¯ow to cope with the demands of basal secretion and makes adjustments (arteriolar dilation) to ensure an adequate supply of blood ¯ow to maintain maximal secretion. The hormones secreted by the islet cells modulate exocrine function. Anatomy The pancreas is supplied by arterial blood from two sources: the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac artery. The arteries entering the gland proper are the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery (from the superior mesenteric artery) and the superior pancreaticoduo- denal artery and branches of the splenic artery (from the celiac artery). Within the pancreas, arterioles supply the three functional components of the gland: the acini, ducts, and islets. The blood draining all three plexi drains into either the splenic vein or the superior mesenteric vein, which ultimately empty into the portal vein. Portal Circulation There is also an extensive portal system within the pancreas. Blood vessels draining the capillary plexus within the islets of Langerhans empty into the acinar and ductal plexi. Blood vessels draining the acinar cap- illary plexus perfuse the ductular plexus. The functional signi®cance of this intrapancreatic portal circulation is that the hormones secreted by the islets reach the exocrine portion of the gland (the acini and ducts) at very high concentrations. Virtually all of the peptides and hormones secreted by the islets exert an in¯uence on pancreatic secretion. This can be attributed to the low molecular weight of these hor- mones and peptides, which allows them to readily ®lter across the fenestrated capillaries surrounding the acini and ducts. Blood Flow Regulation Pancreatic blood ¯ow doubles after a meal. The kallikreinÿkinin system, cholinergic and purinergic neurotransmitters, and gastrointestinal hormones (cholecystokinin and secretin) have all been implicated in postprandial hyperemia. The hyperemia-associated increase in pancreatic oxygen delivery appears to be linked to the increased metabolic demand imposed on the pancreas by the stimulated secretory processes. The postprandial hyperemia also provides the addi- tional ¯uid that accompanies the enhanced electrolyte transport in pancreatic acini and ducts. The arteriolar dilation elevates pancreatic capillary hydrostatic pressure, which drives ¯uid across the capillaries into the interstitial spaces surrounding the ductal epithe- lium. The importance of these vascular adjustments 354 CIRCULATION, OVERVIEW postprandially is underscored by the fact that during periods of maximal stimulation, the pancreas can secrete its weight in juice in less than 30 min.
