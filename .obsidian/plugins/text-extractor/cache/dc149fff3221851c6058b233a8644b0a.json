Hypothalamic hormones control the release of a) follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) b) calcitonin. c) oxytocin. d) adrenaline. e) adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 2. Excess secretion of thyroid hormones a) results from a dietary deficiency of iodine. b) is caused by autoantibodies against the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor. c) causes higher than normal plasma TSH concentration. d) causes exophthalmos (protruding eyes). e) increases metabolic rate. 3. Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease) is associated with a) a low blood glucose concentration. b) a high plasma ACTH concentration. c) a decreased blood volume. d) a metabolic alkalosis. e) an increased plasma sodium concentration. 4. Aldosterone receptor antagonists a) increase Na+ reabsorption by the kidney. b) increase blood volume. c) decrease blood pressure. d) cause a metabolic alkalosis. e) increase plasma K+ concentration. APQ 1 The table below shows the laboratory results obtained from plasma analyses of four patients (1, 2, 3 and 4) with imbalances in thyroid hormone homeostasis Patient Plasma concentration 1 2 3 4 Normal Values Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (pg/mℓ) 25 20 18 72 34-57 Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (mU/ℓ) 0.23 8.92 0.19 10.65 0.35-5.50 Triiodothyronine (T3) (pmol/ℓ) 10.6 8.84 1.75 2.36 3.5-6.5 Answer questions 25 - 32 based on the data in the table. 1. The patient most likely to be producing thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) is a) patient 1. b) patient 2. c) patient 3. d) patient 4. 2. Patient 3 is most likely to have damage to the a) thyroid gland. b) anterior pituitary. c) hypothalamus. d) posterior pituitary. 3. The patient most likely to have an iodine deficiency is a) patient 1. b) patient 2. c) patient 3. d) patient 4. 4. The patient most likely to have a secretory tumour of the anterior pituitary gland that is secreting excess hormone is a) patient 1. b) patient 2. c) patient 3. d) patient 4. 5. Patient 1 has hyperplasia of the thyroid gland (goitre), which is most likely due to a) thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI). b) thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). c) tri-iodothyronine (T3). d) thyroid binding globulin (TBG). 6. The metabolic changes in patients 3 and 4 are most likely to include a) decreased oxygen consumption and decreased expression of uncoupling proteins. b) decreased oxygen consumption and increased expression of uncoupling proteins. c) increased oxygen consumption and decreased expression of uncoupling proteins. d) increased oxygen consumption and increased expression of uncoupling proteins. 7. The patients most likely to have increased urea production are patients a) 1 and 2. b) 1 and 3. c) 2 and 3. d) 3 and 4. 8. The cardiovascular change in patient2 is most likely to be an increased a) heart rate. b) total peripheral resistance. c) blood volume. d) α-adrenergic receptor stimulation. APQ 2 The table below indicates plasma hormone concentrations in five patients (A, B, C D and E) with endocrine disorders. C A B D E Corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ ↓ Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) ↓ ↑ ↓ ↓ ↑ Cortisol ↓ ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ (↑ = increased; ↓ = decreased) Giving a physiological mechanism that explains all of the changes noted in each case, decide which data set (A, B, C, D or E) best fits a person with: 1. decreased hypothalamic function. 2. a hormone-secreting tumor of the anterior pituitary gland. 3. decreased anterior pituitary function. 4. decreased function of the adrenal cortex (Addison’s disease). 5. increased hormone secretion from the adrenal cortex (Cushing’s syndrome).","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
