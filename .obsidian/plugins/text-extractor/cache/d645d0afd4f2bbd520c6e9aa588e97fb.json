If Jp(x) and J−p(x) are independent, then this will be the complete general solution, but unfortunately this is not always true. Theorem. The solutions Jp(x) and J−p(x) of Bessel’s equation with parameter p are independent if and only if p is not an integer. Proof. To prove independence of two functions y1 and y2 we need to show that their Wronskian W (y1, y2) = y′ 1y2 − y1y′ 2 is non-zero. (See MATH2011/2/4 Algebra Chapter 3.) Note that the derivative of the Wronskian simpliﬁes to W ′ = y′′ 1 y2 − y1y′′ 2 , since the terms y′ 1y′ 2 − y′ 1y′ 2 cancel out. If y1 and y2 are both solutions of Bessel’s equation, then x2y′′ 1 + xy′ 1 + (x2 − p 2)y1 = 0 (1) x2y′′ 2 + xy′ 2 + (x2 − p 2)y2 = 0.

Nevertheless, it is possible to ﬁnd a guaranteed independent solution Yp of Bessel’s equation by deﬁning Yp so that xW (Yp, Jp) = 1 (or any non-zero constant). Question 27 below shows that Yp(x) is a solution, and the non-zero Wronskian ensures independence. We require W (Yp, Jp) = 1 TSF Chapter 2 31 *Proof.
