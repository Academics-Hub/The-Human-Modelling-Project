Using Windkessel Model to Measure Brachial Blood Flow Shing-Hong Liu Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan, E-mail: shliu@cyut.edu.tw Jia-Jung Wang Department of Biomedical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaoshiung , Taiwan E-mail: wangjj@isu.edu.tw Abstract--In this study, we propose a new method for assessing the blood flow of a compressed brachial artery using the loaded brachial arterial compliance and based on a two-element Windkessel (WK) model. The loaded compliance of the brachial artery has been estimated from the pattern of the oscillometric waveform in our previous study. The accuracy of WK-based mean blood flow (FWK) is validated by comparing it with the mean blood flow (Fecho) estimated by an echo-based method in the brachial arteries of 32 subjects. The results showed that the values of FWK and Fecho were significantly correlated (r = 0.671). Keywords: Windkessel, Oscillometry, Blood Flow I. Introduction In recent years, the endothelial vasodilator function has been widely studied which evaluation is to measure the blood flow and pressure [1]. In these studies, they all used the echo-method to detect the blood velocity and the diameter in an artery of interest, and then the arterial blood flow is obtained by multiplying the measured velocity by the cross-sectional area [2, 3]. When blood propagates from the heart to the peripheral vascular system, pressure and flow waveforms are affected by the properties of the cardiovascular system. Peripheral resistance and peripheral arterial compliance form the major part of the arterial load on the heart [4, 5]. Frank first introduced the two-element Windkessel (WK) model who considered the whole arterial tree as an elastic chamber with a constant compliance and a resistance representing the total resistance of arterial tree [6]. Stergiopulos evaluated the many different WK models used to estimate the peripheral arterial compliance, and found that method based on the two-element WK model was more accurate than those based on the three-element WK models [7]. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the mean brachial blood flow from the loaded brachial arterial compliance with the two-element WK model. In the studying process, the first step is to find a transfer function between the loaded brachial arterial compliance and the peripheral arterial compliance. Then, according this transfer function, the estimating peripheral compliance was determined with the loaded brachial arterial compliance. The second step is to use the estimating peripheral compliance and a full cycled pressure waveform which was extracted from the oscillometric waveform when the cuff pressure deflated to the diastolic blood pressure to estimate the peripheral resistance. Finally, the WK-based blood flow waveform was determined by the governing equation of the two-element WK model. II. ESTIMATING ELEMENTS OF WK MODEL A. Two-element Windkessel Model In the two-element WK model, the whole arterial tree is modeled as an elastic chamber with a peripheral arterial compliance, PAC, and a peripheral resistance, PR. The governing equation of the two-element WK is )( )()( tF PR tP dttdP PAC =+ (1) where F denotes the blood flow and P is the blood pressure. During diastole, there is no blood inflow from the heart (F=0), and hence the right-hand side of Eq. (1) vanishes and a direct integration yields PACPR/)tt(e)t(P)tP ⋅−−= 1 1( (2) where P(t1) is the initial blood pressure in the diastolic phase. Equation (2) expresses a monoexponential decay and can be fitted to any portion of the diastolic waveform to yield the time constant, τ: PACPR ⋅=τ (3) B. Clinical measurement 32 subjects (14 men and 18 women) aged 68 ± 15 years (mean ± SD; range: 19 to 93 years) who had been explained the study protocol before the measurement were measured the brachial blood pressure of the left arm with an electric sphygmomanometer (DINAMAP PROCARE 100, GE Medical Systems, USA). The brachial arterial internal diameter and velocity of blood flow of each subject was 978-1-4244-5089-3/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE measured by the duplex ultrasound scan (7.5M Hz, M2410B, AGILENT, Hewlett Packard). The hemodynamic characteristics of 32 subjects were shown in Table I. We had estimated the loaded brachial arterial compliance from the 32 subjects [8]. The compliance was determined under three different loaded situations in TABLE I. TABLE I. Baseline hemodynamic characteristics of 32 subjects Internal diameter of brachial artery 0.344 ± 0.079 Mean Brachial blood flow velocity 47.7 ± 13.8 MAP (mm Hg) 92.3 ± 11.9 SBP (mm Hg) 135.4 ± 23.6 DBP (mm Hg) 67.5 ± 8.8 Cosci(PMAP) 10–3 ml/mmHg 1.363 ± 0.559 Cosci(PSys) 10 –3 ml/mmHg 1.253 ± 0.652 Cosci(PDia) 10 –3 ml/mmHg 1.072 ± 0.600 C. Estimation of Peripheral Arterial Compliance The resistance of periphery was calculated by dividing the mean blood pressure by the mean blood flow. The blood flow was obtained by multiplying the measured velocity by the cross-sectional area. Thus, the mean echo-based flow (Fecho) was defined using the following equation: T dt)t(v DF T echo 4 02 ∫ ⋅⋅= π (4) where D is the arterial internal diameter, and T is the cardiac cycle, and v the blood flow velocity. The range of Fecho is from 0.189 to 2.693 ml/second (0.954 ± 0.547 ml/second). According the definition of PR [9], the range of PR is from 29.7 to 539.7 second/mlHg mm ⋅ (136.3 ± 99.6 second/mlHg mm ⋅ ). A full cycled waveform was extracted from an oscillometric waveform for each subject when the cuff pressure deflated to the DBP. The waveform was calibrated to a pressure waveform by the SBP value and DBP value of the subject. Equation (2) was applied to the diastolic phase of pressure waveform to determine time constant (τ) whose range is from 0.37 to 1.81 second (0.912 ± 0.348 second). The range of the regression coefficient (R) is from 0.973 to 0.999 (0.993 ± 0.006). Figure 1(a) shows the blood pressure waveform extracted from the oscillometric waveform when the mean cuff pressure was deflated to DBP, and calibrated by the blood pressure, for one subject (sex: female; age: 44 years; SBP: 112 mmHg; DBP: 62 mmHg; MAP: 83 mmHg). Figure 2(b) shows the diastolic phase of the blood pressure waveform which was fitted with Eq. (10) to produce a regression coefficient of 0.992 and the following parameter values: time constant (τ), 1.033 second; and peripheral resistance (PR), 149.3 second/mlHg mm ⋅ .

(2) (solid line) :, where P(t1)=112, RC=0.968, R=0.992. The PAC was calculated by Eq. (3) whose range is from 0.0007 to 0.0338 ml/mm Hg (0.0105 ± 0.0091 ml/mm Hg). The linear relation between the PAC and three different loaded brachial, Cosci(MAP), Cosci(SBP) and Cosci(DBP), is shown in TABLE II. We could find that total arterial compliance and Cosci(DBP) has a best correlation coefficient, r = 0.783. The linear transfer function is below: 4243214 .)DBP(C.PAC osci −= (13) TABLE II.

We called this estimated compliance as the estimated peripheral compliance (EPC) whose range was from 0.0012 to 0.128 ml/mm Hg (0.0143 ± 0.0211 ml/mm Hg). D. Estimation of Peripheral Resistance In previous section, the EPC has been got from the loaded brachial arterial compliance by the linear transfer function. According Eq. (3), we used the time constant and EPC to calculate the estimated peripheral resistance (EPR) whose range was from 36.7 to 433.4 second/mlHg mm ⋅ (123.7 ± 90.8 second/mlHg mm ⋅ ). III. ESTIMATING BLOOD FLOW In section 2, we have presented how to determine EPR and EPC from the loaded brachial arterial compliance. The blood pressure waveform extracted from the oscillometric waveform when the mean cuff pressure was deflated to DBP was calibrated using the SBP and DBP. Then, according Eq. (1), the blood flow waveform could be determined from EPR, EPC, and the blood pressure waveform. The WK-based mean blood flow, FWK, was calculated with a full cycled flow waveform. Figure 2 shows an evaluated blood flow waveform for the same subject as in Fig. 1 whose FWK is 0.834 ml/second. To validate the proposed method, the WK-based mean blood flow (FWK) was compared with the echo-based mean blood flow (Fecho). The correlation coefficient (r) between Fecho and FWK values is 0.671. In order to provide an agreement figure, the Bland–Altman plot for each Fecho and FWK of 32 subjects was used in Fig. 3. These results indicated that with the loaded compliance, the mean blood flow obtained using the WK model was in moderate agreement with the echo-based blood flow.

DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS Long-term changes in arterial blood flow induce parallel changes in arterial size, with increased flow stimulating outward remodeling and decreased flow reducing the arterial size [9]. Some studies have shown that the brachial blood flow is elevated in patients with risk factors and cardiovascular disease [10, 11]. In these clinical studies, the baseline brachial blood flow was calculated using the flow velocities as measured ultrasonically and based on the vessel cross-sectional area. It typically takes 5–10 minutes to measure these parameters, which makes it difficult to apply in home-based care. However, in our studies, we have used an airflow meter and pressure transducer to construct the loaded compliance-vs-pressure curve based on oscillometry [8]. The two-element WK model could be used to estimate the FWK. Because our proposed is based on oscillometry, the measurement can be made in only 30–40 sec. The WK model has been accepted as appropriate for describing the arterial tree, and suitable for obtaining the PAC [12, 13]. The most well-known method is the diastolic decay method, in which a monoexponential curve is fitted to the decay time of the pressure waveform. In this model, the PR is commonly derived from the ratio between the MAP and flow. The PAC always includes the major arterial compliances, brachial, radial, and ulnar arterial compliances, and minor compliances, arteriolar and capillary compliances. However, in our previous study, the loaded brachial arterial compliance just only considers the brachial artery, and is a relative measurement. But, in Table 3, we could find that Cosci(DBP) has a best correlation with the PAC, r = 0.783. This result represents that the Cosci can be used to evaluate the PAC. Using PAC and Cosci(DBP) data, a linear transform function was constructed for transferring Cosci(DBP) to the EPC. In section 2.4, the EPR was estimated from the EPC with Eq. (3). However, we could find that EPR and EPC is a nonlinear relation in Eq. (3). That is why the correlation coefficient between PR and EPR is very close to 0 when the correlation coefficient between PAC and EPC just is only 0.783. We validated the proposed FWK by comparing it with Fecho. The values of Fecho in this study were calculated from the vessel cross-sectional area and the mean flow velocity (in cm/second). However, there are several potential sources of errors in the echo-based method. The first possible error source is the limited resolution of the echo system in measuring the internal radius of the artery, as expressed in Eq. (4). Second, the cross section of the brachial artery is here assumed to be constant, and ignoring vessel contraction or dilatation in this way will unquestionably introduce errors into the blood flow computation. Third, the distribution of blood flow velocity in the direction perpendicular to the arterial axis is nonuniform, which introduces inaccuracy into echo-based velocity measurements. Finally, the echo-based blood flow is an absolute measurement. However, because the Cosci is only a relative measurement, the FWK estimated from this compliance is also a relative one. The above factors increase the errors in the comparison between the two methods used to measure regional blood flows. Moreover, the potential error of Fecho also affects the accuracy of PR. The second term on the left-hand side of Eq. (1) is the reciprocal of arterial resistance multiplying the blood pressure. Because the mean peripheral resistance was 123.7 secondּmm Hg/ml and the mean blood pressure was 92.3 mm Hg, this term will be very small. Therefore, the first term will be the dominant factor for estimating the WK-based flow waveform. That is, a more-accurate value for the compliance will increase the accuracy of the FWK. Although blood only flows during the systolic phase of the heart, Cosci(DBP) is more accurate than Cosci(SBP) in Table 3. Thus, we used Cosci(DBP) to evaluate FWK. In the present study, although r between Fecho and FWK is only 0.671, we first used a known arterial compliance to estimate the arterial blood flow based on the WK model. The arterial compliance could also be measured using many different non-echo methods, such as the pulse wave velocity [14]. Therefore, these methods could be further applied to estimate the blood flow in combination with the new technique presented here. As our discussion, the more accurate at compliance, the more accurate at blood flow. These results indicate that our proposed method based on the two-element WK model can be readily used to obtain a mean brachial arterial flow without requiring echo-based measurements. Since the method for computing the WK-based mean blood flow using the loaded brachial arterial compliance can be suitably implemented in an oscillometric blood pressure monitor, it has great potential in home-care applications.
