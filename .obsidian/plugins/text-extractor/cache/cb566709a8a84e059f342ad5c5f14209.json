Hutchinson 2B09 School of Anatomical Sciences Objectives • Describe the layers of the scalp and its blood supply, innervation and lymphatic drainage • Identify the muscles of facial expression, their actions and innervation • Describe the innervation to the skin of the face • Describe the trigeminal nerve, its origin and distribution in the face SCALP • Scalp proper: skin, connective tissue and epicranial aponeurosis • Skin • Thin, except in the occipital region • Contains many sweat and sebaceous glands and hair follicles • Abundant blood supply and lymphatic drainage • Connective tissue • Thick, dense, richly vascularized subcutaneous layer • Well supplied with cutaneous nerves • Aponeurosis (epicranial aponeurosis) • Broad, strong, tendinous sheet covering the calvaria • Serves as an attachment for the muscle bellies converging from the forehead (frontal belly-occipitofrontalis), occiput (occipital belly-occipitofrontalis) and from the temporal bones on each side (temporoparietalis and superior auricular muscles) • Collectively these structures constitute the musculoaponeurotic epicranius which is innervated by the facial nerve (CVII) • Loose areolar tissue • A spongy-like layer • Includes potential spaces that may distend with fluid as a result of injury or infection • Pericranium • Dense layer of connective tissue that forms the external periosteum of the neurocranium • Firmly attached but can be stripped from the crania of living persons, except where the pericranium is continuous with the fibrous tissue in the cranial sutures SKIN CONNECTIVE TISSUE APONEUROSIS LOOSE AREOLAR TISSUE PERICRANIUM NASALISPROCERUS CORRUGATOR SUPERCILII ORBICULARIS OCULI OCCIPITAL BELLY FRONTAL BELLYMuscles of facial expression All facial muscles are innervated by the facial nerve (CNVII) via its posterior auricular branch or via the temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular or cervical branches of the parotid plexus MUSCLE ORIGIN INSERTION MAIN ACTION Occipitofrontalis: frontal belly Epicranial aponeurosis Skin & subcutaneous tissue of eyebrows and forehead Elevates eyebrows and wrinkles skin of forehead; protracts scalp (indicating surprise or curiosity) Occipitofrontalis: Occipital belly Lateral 2/3 of superior nuchal line Epicranial aponeurosis Retracts scalp; increasing effectiveness of frontal belly Orbicularis oculi (orbital sphincter) Medial orbital margin, medial palpebral ligament; lacrimal bone Skin around margin of orbit; superior and inferior tarsal plates Closed eyelids; palpebral part does so gently; orbital part tightly (winking) Corrugator supercili Medial end of superciliary arch Skin superior to middle of supraorbital margin and superciliary arch Draws eyebrows medially and inferiorly, creating vertical wrinkles above nose (demonstrating concern or worry) Procerus + transverse part of nasalis Fascia aponeurosis covering nasal bone and lateral nasal cartilage Skin inferior to forehead, between eyebrows Depresses medial end of eyebrow; wrinkles skin over dorsum of nose (conveying disdain or dislike) Alar part of nasalis + levator labii superioris aleque nasi Frontal process of maxilla (infero-medial margin of orbit) Major alar cartilage Depresses ala laterally; dilating anterior nasal aperture (flaring of nostrils)Muscles of facial expression RISORIUSZYGOMATICUS MAJORBUCCINATOR ZYGOMATICUS MINOR LEVATOR LABII SUPERIORIS ORBICULARIS ORISMuscles of facial expression All facial muscles are innervated by the facial nerve (CNVII) via its posterior auricular branch or via the temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular or cervical branches of the parotid plexus MUSCLE ORIGIN INSERTION MAIN ACTION Orbicularis oris (oral sphincter) Medial maxilla and mandible; deep surface of perioral skin; angle of mouth Mucous membrane of lips Tonus closes rima oris; phasic contraction compresses and protrudes lips (kissing) or resists distention (when blowing) Levator labii superioris Infraorbital margin (maxilla) Skin of upper lip Part of dilators of mouth; retract (elevate) and/or evert upper lip; deepen nasolabial sulcus (showing sadness)Zygomaticus minor Anterior aspect of zygomatic bone Buccinator (cheek muscle) Mandible; alveolar processes of maxilla and mandible, pterygomandibular raphe Angle of mouth; orbicularis oris Presses cheek against molar teeth, works with tongue to keep food between occlusal surfaces and out of the oral vestibule, resists distention (when blowing) Zygomaticus major Lateral aspect of zygomatic bone Angle of mouth Part of dilators of mouth, elevate labial commissure-bilaterally to smile (happiness), unilaterally to sneer (disdain) Risorius Parotid fascia and buccal skin (highly variable) Part of dilators of the mouth; depresses labial commissure bilaterally to frown (sadness)Muscles of facial expression PLATYSMA MENTALIS DEPRESSOR LABII INFERIORIS DEPRESSOR ANGULI ORISMuscles of facial expression All facial muscles are innervated by the facial nerve (CNVII) via its posterior auricular branch or via the temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular or cervical branches of the parotid plexus MUSCLE ORIGIN INSERTION MAIN ACTION Depressor anguli oris Anterolateral base of mandible Angle of mouth Part of dilators; depresses labial commissure bilaterally to frown (sadness) Depressor labii inferioris Platysma and anterolateral body of mandible Skin of lower lip Part of dilators of the mouth; retracts (depresses) and/or everts lower lip (pouting, sadness) Mentalis Body of mandible (anterior to roots of inferior incisors) Skin of chin (mentolabial sulcus) Elevates and protrudes lower lip; elevates skin of chin (showing doubt) Platysma Subcutaneous tissue of infraclavicular and supraclavicular regions Base of mandible, skin of cheek and lower lip; angle of mouth; orbicularis oris Depresses mandible (against resistance); tenses skin of inferior face and neck (conveying tension and stress)Muscles of facial expressionCutaneous nerves of face and scalp Distribution of the Trigeminal nerve (CNV) Blood supply of the face and scalp Lymph drainage of the face and scalp CLINICAL ANATOMY HERPES ZOSTER INFECTION OF TRIGEMINAL GANGLION • A herpes zoster virus infection may produce a lesion in the cervical ganglia • Involvement of the trigeminal ganglion occurs in approximately 20% of cases (Bernardini, 2005) • The infection is characterized by an eruption of groups of vesicles following the course of the affected nerve (e.g. ophthalmic herpes zoster) • Any division of CNV may be involved, but the ophthalmic division is most commonly affected • Usually, the cornea is involved, often resulting in painful corneal ulceration and subsequent scarring of the cornea FACIAL LACERATIONS AND INCISIONS • As the face has no distinct deep fascia and the subcutaneous tissue between the cutaneous attachments of the facial muscles is loose, facial lacerations tend to gape (part widely) • Thus, the skin must be carefully sutured to prevent scarring • The looseness of the subcutaneous tissue also enables fluid and blood to accumulate in the loose connective tissue following bruising of the face • Facial inflammation causes considerable swelling (e.g. a bee sting on the root of the nose may close both eyes) • As a person ages, the skin loses its resiliency (elasticity). As a result, ridges and wrinkles occur in the skin perpendicular to the direction of the facial muscles fibers • Skin incisions along these cleavage or wrinkle lines heal with minimal scarring 1.
