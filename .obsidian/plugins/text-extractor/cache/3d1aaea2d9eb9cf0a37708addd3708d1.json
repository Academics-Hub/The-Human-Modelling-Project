Autonomous proliferative signalling: Oncogenes activation Oncogenes: What they are and how activated Inhibition of growth inhibitory signals: Tumour suppressor loss or inactivation What are tumour suppressors? Recessive nature and tumour susceptibility Outline of Lecture Evasion of apoptosis Role of AKT Immortalisation Role of p53 and telomerase Cancer energy metabolism Role of RTK signalling in aerobic glycolysis /Warburg effect Oncogene discovery and Peyton Rous •Many oncogenes were first discovered in acutely transforming RNA animal tumour viruses. Peyton Rous made the initial discovery of viral oncogenes •Peyton Rous, was an American pathologist / virologist. • A Long Island NY chicken farmer brought him a prize hen that had developed a large sarcoma in its chest muscle. •He removed the sarcoma, homogenised, centrifuged, and filtered it and then used the cell free filtrate produced to inject another chicken. This chicken then developed the same tumour. So some agent in the filtrate was causing cancer. • The agent was identified as a virus and named Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). Rous sarcoma virus with viral oncogene SRC •This virus was subsequently shown to have an additional gene in its genome when compared to a similar virus (ALV) which didn’t cause rapid cancer. This additional gene was termed a viral oncogene as it caused cancer. •After further experimentation, the additional gene (viral oncogene) was shown to be a “kidnapped“ normal cellular gene from the infected chicken, which encoded for a protein (SRC tyrosine kinase) that regulates proliferation. This normal gene in the chicken was then termed a proto-oncogene •Due to the LTR (long terminal repeat) sequences flanking the virus genome, which act like promoters and enhancers, the “kidnapped” cellular gene was highly expressed resulting in increased expression of SRC, transformation of cells and cancer. •Many other rapidly transforming animal retroviruses were shown to have viral oncogenes and thus many more proto- oncogenes were discovered e.g. RAS Proto-oncogenes and oncogenes •Proto-oncogenes or cellular oncogenes: genes that encode cellular proteins that regulate normal cell proliferation and survival •Oncogenes are mutated forms of proto-oncogenes that encode proteins that stimulate uncontrolled proliferation or promote cell survival by either being constitutively active or over-expressed. •Dominant Normal cell Proto-oncogene: Normal gene which encodes for protein regulating proliferation or survival Normal protein which regulates proliferation or survival Viral oncogene: Normal gene “kidnapped” from genome of organism which it infects. This gene encodes for proteins regulating proliferation or survival. Part 2: Mechanisms of oncogene activation Genetic mechanisms of converting proto-oncogenes into oncogenes •Mutation ( Gain of Function) e.g. RAS If mutation in promoter - overexpression Normal gene: proto-oncogene : Oncogene Genetic mechanisms of converting proto- oncogenes into oncogenes •Gene amplification e.g. HER2, PI3K, MYC Overexpressed protein Normal gene: proto-oncogene Multiple copies: oncogene Genetic mechanisms of converting proto- oncogenes into oncogenes •Translocation a) fusion gene e.g –reciprocal, unequal t(9;22). BCR-ABL Encodes constitutively active kinase Normal gene: proto-oncogene Fusion gene: OncogeneFigure 4.16, Biology of Cancer, Garland Science, 2014 Genetic mechanisms of converting proto- oncogenes into oncogenes •Translocation b) transcriptional activation e.g. t(8:14)MYC, t(14:18)BCL2 Overexpressed protein Normal gene: proto-oncogene Over transcribed gene: oncogene Genetic mechanisms of converting proto- oncogenes into oncogenes •Retroviral activation e.g. MYC, SRC, Overexpressed protein Normal gene: proto-oncogene Over transcribed gene: oncogene Genetic mechanisms of oncogene conversion There are five different genetic ways i.e. the sequence of the DNA changes, in which proto-oncogenes are converted to oncogenes (encoded proteins are overactive or over-expressed) • Gain of function mutation in a proto-oncogene and now an oncogene- encoded protein would have a different sequence which activates the protein usually an enzyme and it is constitutively active e.g. RAS, MAPK •Amplification of the gene- Here multiple copies of the proto- oncogene gene are found converting it to an oncogene. This results in more protein being made when all the genes are transcribed –overexpression e.g. HER 2 or EGFR •Viral insertion. Here a retrovirus inserts upstream (5’) of a proto-oncogene and due to its LTRs results in the gene being over transcribed. Thus converting it to an oncogene which is thus overexpressed and we get overexpressed protein. Genetic mechanisms of oncogene conversion •Translocation –movement of part of a chromosome to a different chromosome. There are two types: –Fusion gene formation: Here the chromosomes each break in the middle of a gene and new fusion genes are formed on translocation. One of the pair is a proto-oncogene and the resultant fusion gene (oncogene) encodes a chimeric protein with overactive function. An example is BCR ABL where the ABL kinase’s (oncoprotein) regulatory domain portion of gene is replaced by the BCR gene and thus the kinase is constitutively active. The mainly BCR fusion gene has no oncogenic function –Transcriptional activation: Here the translocated proto- oncogene is placed downstream (3’) of an actively transcribed promoter or enhancer and as a result the gene is over transcribed thus converting it to an oncogene and more protein is made –overexpressed. Eg BCL2 Oncogene activation by miRNAs •Loss of 3’UTR of mRNA transcribed which is where the miRNA binds. Thus no degradation of mRNA •Loss of miRNA which regulates levels of mRNA or translation of the mRNA Oncogene activation by epigenetic mechanisms In many cancers the genome is hypomethylated resulting in increased expression of genes. Hypomethylated promoters result in increased transcription of genes. Mechanisms of oncogene conversion •Only one allele needs to be mutated –dominant •Oncogenes act to increase cell cycling and hence proliferation or cell survival like a stuck accelerator pedal increases the speed of a car. Normal cell Proto-oncogene Normal protein Viral oncogene Mutated proto-oncogene: Oncogene Mutated protein: Oncoprotein- constitutively active : Overexpressed normal protein: Oncoprotein Multiple copies or overexpressed proto-oncogene: Oncogene Virus Cancer cell Part 3: The functions of proto- oncogenes and their encoded proto- oncoproteins How do proto-oncogenes control cell proliferation and oncogenesis? Proto-oncogenes encode key regulatory proteins: •proliferative signalling pathways •survival signalling pathways •cell cycle •Please note that many people refer to the genes and their encoded proteins as proto-oncogenes Classes/functions of proto- oncoproteins: signalling pathways Any components of proliferative signalling pathways or survival pathway could be proto- oncoproteins and are encoded by proto- oncogenes •Proto-oncogenes encode for proteins in proliferative signalling pathways. If the encoded protein is mutated so that it is overactive or overexpressed that proto-oncogene is now an oncogene and the encoded protein is an oncoprotein. •In the following slides, I will discuss various proteins that have been found to be overactive or over expressed in the RTK signalling pathway and hence they are now oncoproteins encoded by oncogenes y y y y y y GF:PDGF –PDGF HGF - HGF G protein: RAS - RAS Adaptor SH2 GEF RAS Cytoplasmic Kinase: MAPKKK: RAF- RAF Gene activation TF MAPKKK MAPKK MAPK TRK: EGFR: ERBB –ERBB EGFR2: NEU/HER2 - NEU/HER2 SCFR: KIT - KIT GTP Proliferation TF: FOS, FOS MAPK Pathway: Oncogenes/Oncoproteins MYC and G1 cyclin production Oncogenes and encoded oncoproteins found in human cancers •Growth Factors: PDGF, VEGF and HGF inappropriately produced and form an autocrine loop that activate tumour cells - sarcomas •RTK: HER2/NEU and EGFR/ERBB1 –Gene amplified resulting in excess receptors in membrane which then can dimerise when no growth factor present - lung and breast carcinoma EGFR/ERBB1 RTK mutation that results in constitutive kinase activity – lung , breast carcinomas and gastrointestinal stromal tumours •G protein: RAS –mutation that decreases activity of GTPase –therefore GTP bound longer and RAS active for longer and signalling continues. Many different cancers •Kinase: RAF –mutation that causes constitutive RAF kinase activity. –melanomas •Transcription factors: FOS mutated or overexpressed Proteins produced as a result of MAPK pathway: MYC –amplified, transcriptional activation and mutations found –many cancers G1 cyclins -amplified y y y y y y PI3K AKT PH PIP3 Lipid Kinase: PI3KCA -PI3K - Phosphoinositide 3 kinase PI3K Pathway: Oncogenes /Oncoproteins GF: PDGF –PDGF HGF - HGF TRK: EGFR: ERBB - ERBB EGFR2: NEU/HER2 - NEU/HER2 SCFR: –KIT - KIT Cytoplasmic Kinase: AKT - AKT PI3K pathway –Oncogenes and encoded oncoproteins •Growth factors and receptors as before •PIK3CA gene: •is frequently mutated resulting in a hyperactive PI3K enzyme. •is amplified resulting in overexpressed PI3K enzyme. Eg ovarian carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast carcinoma •AKT gene: •is mutated resulting in changed PH domain that constitutively binds to phospholipids and continuous activation of AKT •is amplified resulting in overexpressed AKT protein Naming of Oncogenes  Many of the oncogenes names may seem to be rather strange.  Derived from the species and/or the kind of tumour in which they were found. •RAS : rat sarcoma, •SIS: simian sarcoma •RAF: rat fibroma •NEU : neuroblastoma. •ERBB: erythroblastic leukemia, •KIT: feline sarcoma •MYC: myelocytoma  Others are named according to their function, for example EGFR, HER2: human epidermal growth factor receptor and PI3K . Part 4: Introduction to Tumour Suppressor Genes Tumour suppressor genes encode proteins that normally suppress cell proliferation and promote cell death; they slow down cell division, activate apoptosis and repair DNA That is they are like brakes to stops cells progressing down a road which could lead to cancer Inactivation/loss is associated with cancer development Tumour suppressor gene loss is termed recessive as both alleles need to be lost (and mutations are loss of function mutations) for the potential for cancer development to occur. This is not the same as the genetics definition of recessive inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance is a trait which manifests in the homozygous state i.e. in a person possessing both copies of an abnormal or mutant allele. The Recessive Nature of Tumour Suppressor Genes Humans carrying germline mutations in a tumour suppressor gene should exhibit increased cancer susceptibility. Part 5: Loss of tumour suppressor genes Inherited Mutations and Cancer Susceptibility LOH: Loss of heterozygosity 1 2 Chromosomal nondisjunction Inherited Mutations and Cancer Susceptibility LOH: Loss of heterozygosity 1 2 3 Gene Conversion Inherited Mutations and Cancer Susceptibility LOH: Loss of heterozygosity 1 2 3 4 5 Tumour suppressor silencing and miRNA •If miRNA controlling degradation of tumour suppressor mRNA or translation of mRNA is overexpressed –silencing of tumour suppressor will occur •Promoters of tumour suppressor genes are hyper-methylated resulting in silencing of genes e.g. RB, PTEN Epigenetic inactivation of tumour suppressor genes Comparison of proto-oncogenes/oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes Proto-oncogene Tumour suppressor gene The protein encoded by the gene functions directly in promoting cell growth and survival Oncogene May exist in a viral form Dominant, single allele mutation in cancer cells Tumour suppressor gene Transformation results in inactivation/ loss of the protein in cancer cells Inherited as a germ line mutation Acquired as a somatic mutation The protein encoded by the gene functions directly in inhibiting cell growth and promoting cell death Transformation results in over-activity/ overexpression of the protein in cancer No viral counterparts Not inherited as a germ line mutation Acquired as a somatic mutation Recessive, two alleles mutated in cancer cells Part 6: Evasion of apoptosis: Role of AKT (intrinsic) AKT role in apoptosis Evasion of Apoptosis Akt phosphorylates •BAD, relocates it the cytoplasm •Procaspase 9 and inhibits it •Transcription factor for FASL and prevents it from entering nucleus thus FASL not made Net result inhibition of apoptosis Enabling replicative immortality Overcoming Senescence and Immortalisation Role of p53 and telomerase Part 7: What is senenscence? Hayflick Limit and Cultured Cells •Cells in cell culture exhibit a limited number of replicative cycles i.e. no of cellular doublings before they stop proliferating. •Named for the scientist who observed it: Hayflick limit. •Cells can go through about 50-60 doublings. •Then enter a state of non - proliferation called senescence Senescence Definition: •Cells that don’t go through the cell cycle even though growth factors and conditions are favourable i.e permanent cell cycle arrest •A non-proliferating state of cells in which they exhibit a distinctive cell phenotype and remain viable for extended periods of time but are unable to proliferate again Why do cell culture cells become senescent? Some sort of internal clock? •Later shown to be due to telomere shortening What are telomeres? •The structure at the end of chromosomes made up of a repeating 6 nucleotide sequence. Protect the end of chromosomes in the same way as aglets protect the ends of shoelaces Telomere replication: end-stage replication problem Telomere replication: end-stage replication problem l replication: end-stage replication problem Telomere replication: end-stage replication problem How is the terminal gap repaired? How is the terminal gap repaired? Telomere shortening leads to replicative senescence Other causes of senescence •Physiological stresses: •Oxidative stress- increased ROS •UV light •Ionising Radiation •Cytotoxic drugs The above all cause DNA damage •Oncogene activation DNA damage and oncogene activation activate p53 and increase its levels in the cell When do cells become senescent? Increased proliferation Increased proliferation Increased p53 Mechanisms of senescence Oncogene activation CDKI Senescence 50 Senescence Part 8 Overcoming senescence and becoming immortal •Senescence has probably developed as a tumour suppressing mechanism. •For cancer to develop, cells need to overcome senescence so that they can proliferate •How do they do this? Loss of p53 or Rb overcomes senescence 100 Overcoming senescence leads to crisisWhat is crisis? •Crisis (cell biology): State arising where cells with eroded telomeres undergo end to end fusion of chromosomes, karyotypic chaos and widespread cell death by apoptosis. •It is the point at which the telomeres are so shortened/eroded that sister chromatids or non homologous chromosomes can fuse and result in breakage - fusion - bridge cycles Breakage - fusion - bridge cycles: Crisis This would result in aneuploidy (scrambled chromosomes) found in karyotypes from many different solid tumours. Genetic instability in cancerOvercoming crisis leads to immortalisation •Most of the cells undergoing crisis will die – because of the extreme DNA damage. •The occasional cell will have a decrease in the methylation of the telomerase promoter or a translocation to behind another promoter and will start producing telomerase again What is telomerase? •The enzyme that adds telomeric repeats to the end of chromosomes. •They extend the telomeres so that cells can continue to proliferate –replicative immortality. •Chromosomes are now stable with their many abnormalities 60 Senescence Overcoming crisis leads to immortalisation Breakage-fusion- bridge cycles Immortalisation •Immortalisation: Cells that have the potential to go through the cell cycle indefinitely. •Why? •Because they have active telomerase which replaces the telomeres lost each time the cell goes through the cell cycle Please note: They can still be killed •So activation of telomerase is like an agent that ensures that your runaway car has an endless, self- replenishing supply of petrol Cellular senescence and immortalisation Cell proliferation (short telomeres) DNA damage Oncogene activation Potential Cancer Causing Events Normal cells 'mortal' Precancerous cells Cell senescenceApoptosis Tumour suppressor mechanisms Cancer cells ‘Immortal' Loss of p53 or RB Activation of telomerase ROS, cytotoxic drugs, UV light Upregulation of p53 •Note cells in cell culture will undergo senescence when they have been through cell cycle 50-60 times. Other cells can become senescent due to DNA damage or oncogene activation. •To overcome senescence, p53 or RB is lost. Those cells with DNA damage or oncogene activation continue to proliferate and telomeres are eroded and “crisis” occurs •Crisis is overcome by activating telomerase and extending the telomeres again resulting in replicative immortality. •In some cancers, telomerase can be activated without senescence or crisis occurring and those cells will then have replicative immortality Cancer energy metabolism Role of RTK signalling in aerobic glycolysis Part 9: What is the Warburg effect? Normal Cell Metabolism Glycolysis TCA/Krebs Cycle What is the Warburg Effect? •It is the shift from ATP generation through oxidative phosphorylation (Kreb Cycle) •to ATP generation through glycolysis even under normal oxygen concentrations Warburg effect: Aerobic glycolysis + O2 Why do cancer cells switch to a less efficient form of ATP production? •Lower ATP production is only a problem if glucose levels are scarce. •Cancer cells transport greatly increased amounts of glucose into their cytoplasm and thus can still make enough ATP •Proliferating cells have metabolic requirements that extend beyond ATP –They need to replicate all of their cellular contents •Nucleotides, amino acids, lipids Advantages of aerobic glycolysis •Glycolysis allows for shunting of carbon to other biosynthetic pathways •There is decreased ROS production because •oxidative phosphorylation is inhibited •there is increased production of NADPH which is involved in anti oxidant systems –less apoptosis initiated. Part 10: Aerobic Glycolysis Why is aerobic glycolysis biosynthetic? •Various glycolytic intermediates can be used for NADPH, nucleotide, amino acid and glycolipid synthesis •Proliferating cells express the M2 form of the enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK M2) Catalyses the production of pyruvate –This form has low activity due to phosphorylation of tyrosine amino acids within it by RTK resulting in a build –up of glycolytic intermediates which can then be used for biosynthesis. Glucose GLUT4 Transporter Glucose Glucose - 6 - P Hexokinase Fructose - 6-P Glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate 2X 3-Phosphoglycerate 2X Phosphoenolpyruvate 2X Pyruvate Pyruvate kinase M2 Nucleotide synthesis Amino acids Pyrimidines Glycolipids Glycoproteins R T K PI3K/AKT Lactate HIF1α Kreb Cycle PDK PDKPyruvate dehydrogenase Lactate Dehydrogenase Glycolysis in proliferating cell Pentose phosphate pathway NADPH mTOR P Acetyl CoA P P P HIF1β P •Thus the nett result is increased glycolysis, (as well as amino acid, lipid, nucleotide and NADPH production) with production of lactate and inhibition of Krebs cycle. Interestingly, p53 has recently been shown to limit glycolysis and divert pyruvate towards the TCA cycle Part 11: PET scans How is this change in metabolism used for diagnostic purposes? •It is used in PET scans •PET (positron emission tomography) makes use of a radionuclide F linked to glucose forming ( F)fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to detect tumours. •The FDG is injected into the patient and its accumulation in tumour cells is detected. The deoxyglucose isn’t further metabolised so it accumulates where it has been taken up. •Remember cancer cells have increased glucose uptake compared to normal cells 18 18 PET/CT ScannerHow does it work? •The radionuclide (FDG) emits a positron, an antiparticle of the electron with opposite charge. Annihilation Gamma ray FDG How does it work? •Photons (Gamma Rays) are detected by the scanning device. •The position of the radionuclide (FDG) can then be plotted. •A CT scan is done simultaneously to clearly detect the organs and skeleton of the patient. PET ScannerUses of PET scans •To detect cancers •To detect if metastases have occurred •To determine the efficacy of treatment PET scan for cancer detection","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
