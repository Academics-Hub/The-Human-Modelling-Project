LECTURE OBJECTIVES IMMUNE SYSTEM OVERVIEW ❖The lymphatic system consists of groups of cells, tissues, vessels and organs that monitor body surfaces and internal fluid compartments and react to the presence of potentially harmful substances. ❖The immune system is a collection of lymphatic tissues and organs that interact and communicate with each other in extraordinarily complex ways. ❖Immunosurveillance monitoring the body for harmful substances. Lymphatic vessels ❖Lymphatic vessels (LV’s) are channels through which cells and large molecules are transported from the tissue back into the blood. ❖LV’s begin as blind-ended capillaries in connective tissue and interstitial spaces. ❖They have thin permeable walls lined by endothelium and contain one way valves to prevent back flow of lymph. ❖Lymphatic vessels join to form larger vessels and run next to the blood vessels. LV’s finally empties lymph into the blood circulation at the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian veins. ❖Before lymph is reintroduced to the blood it passes through the lymph nodes for immune surveillance. Collection of lymph ❖With increased hydrostatic and osmotic pressure in arterioles, fluid leaks out of the capillaries into the surrounding connective tissue. ❖Decreased hydrostatic pressure in the venous system allows the collection of some fluid from the surrounding connective tissue but there may be an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space. ❖The lymphatic system vessels drains these interstitial fluids (lymph) and return them to the bloodstream. How does collection of lymph relate to oedema? IMMUNE RESPONSE Non-specific (Innate); a wide variety of effector mechanisms, which is evolutionarily older and Include; ❖Physical barriers (e.g., the skin and mucous membranes) ❖Chemical defences (e.g., low pH ) that destroy ❖Secretory substances (e.g., thiocyanate in saliva, lysozymes, interferons, fibronectin, and complement in serum) ❖Phagocytic cells (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes) and natural killer (NK) cells. Specific (Adaptive) immunity; aims at specific microbial invaders, mediated by lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and produces memory cells that permit a similar, very rapid response if that specific microbe appears again. Include ; ❖Humoral – production of antibodies by B lymphocytes and plasma cells. ❖Cell-mediated – attack and destroy virus-infected host cells foreign cells mediated by specific T lymphocytes. CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM Lymphocyte and supporting cells These cells can be divided based on function: ❖ Lymphocytes and Antigen- presenting cells (APCs) which specifically coordinate the activities of adaptive immunity ❖ Supporting cells: Other granulocytes and agranulocytes The lymphocytes and APCs for adaptive immunity are distributed throughout the body in the blood, lymph, and epithelial and connective tissues. Lymphocytes are formed initially in primary lymphoid organs (the thymus and bone arrow), but most lymphocyte activation and proliferation occur in secondary lymphoid organs (the lymph nodes, the spleen). LYMPHOCYTES- Effector cells of the immune system and conduct immunosurveillance Types of lymphocytes ❖ T Cells ❖ Develop in the thymus ❖ Adaptive immunity: cell-mediated ❖ Different functions: cytotoxic T cells kill transformed and infected cells; helper T cells mediate cytotoxic T cell and B cell responses ❖ B cells ❖ Develop in the bone marrow and GALT ❖ Adaptive immunity: Humoral ❖ Once activated develops into a plasma cell which produces antibodies (immunoglobulins) ❖ Natural Killer cells ❖ Innate immunity ❖ Kill transformed and infected cells that they are genetically programmed to identify SUPPORT CELLS are organized in loose meshwork Reticular cells; they and the reticular fibres they produce form mesh works in lymph nodules, lymph nodes, and the spleen . Macrophages, dendritic and follicular dendritic cells reside in the loose mesh work of lymphatic organs and loose connective tissue of the body. Langerhans cells are found in the epidermis. The blood cells and immune cells arise in the bone marrow via various differentiation pathways from hematopoietic stem cells which are present throughout adulthood and allow for the continuous differentiation of blood cells to replace those lost to age or function. Revise notes on blood. Relate morphology and function of granulocytes and agranulocytes to their immune response function. ANTIGENS AND ANTIBODIES ❖Antigens may consist of soluble molecules or molecules that are still components of intact cells (bacteria, protozoa, or tumor cells). ❖The immune response to antigens can be cellular (in which lymphocytes are primarily in charge of eliminating the antigen), or humoral (in which antibodies are primarily responsible for the response), or both. ❖Antibody is a glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin family that interacts specifically with an antigen. They either accumulate in the blood plasma and interstitial fluid of tissues or are transported across epithelia into the secretion of glands such as mucous, salivary, and mammary glands. ❖The interaction between most antigens and antibodies is insufficient to stimulate immune responses. ❖To present an antigen to a helper T cell, the APC first processes the antigen intra-cellularly and then displays antigen peptides on its surface. Antigen can also be processed as a part of the B-cell activation pathway ❖Therefore, antigens must be broken into small peptides and presented in conjunction with MHC II molecules by specialized APCs to the appropriate helper CD4 T lymphocytes. ❖APCs include ❖Macrophages ❖Perisinusoidal macrophages (Kupffer cells) of the liver. ❖Langerhans’ cells in the epidermis, ❖Dendritic cells of spleen and lymph nodes. ❖Type II and III of Epithelioreticular cells of the thymus ANTIGENS PRESENTING CELLS (APC’S)LYMPHOCYTES ❖Lymphocytes are the primary cells of adaptive immune responses. Three major types of lymphocytes are present in the body: T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and NK cells. ❖The functional classification of lymphocytes is independent of their morphologic (size) characteristics. ❖Natural killer cells; genetically programmed to recognize transformed cells. After which they release substances which induces cells to self-destruct (apoptosis). T CELLS mature in the thymus, have a long lifespan and are involved in cell-mediated immunity such as; ❖HELPER T CELLS; recognizes antigen presented by antigen presenting cells. They are activated to release cytokines such as interleukins. Interleukins stimulate other T and B lymphocytes to differentiate and proliferate. ❖CYTOTOXIC T CELLS; can only recognize antigen on other body cells such as virus-infected cells, cancer- transformed cells, cells infected with intracellular microorganisms, parasites, and transplanted cells. ❖REGULATORY (SUPPRESSOR) T CELLS; can functionally suppress an immune response to foreign and self- antigen by influencing the activity of other cells in the immune system. How does the human immunodeficiency virus HIV bypass the cell mediated response of T lymphocytes and compromise the immune response of an infected individual?B cells mature in red bone marrow and are involved in the production and secretion of the various circulating antibodies (immunoglobulins Ig). They express membrane bound Ig (immunoglobins) called B-cell receptors (BCRs) which serve as the antigen-specific binding site. Once a B cell is activated by binding to antigen, and to helper T cells, it differentiates into ❖Plasma cells that secrete a soluble form of their surface antibodies. ❖Memory B cells that responds quickly to re-encounter with the same antigen. ❖The specific antibody produced by the plasma cell binds to the stimulating antigen, forming an antigen–antibody complex. These complexes are eliminated in a variety of ways, including destruction by NK cells and phagocytosis by macrophages and eosinophils DIFFUSE LYMPHATIC TISSUE ❖Diffuse lymphatic tissue and lymphatic nodules guard the body against pathogenic substances and are the site of initial immune response – lamina propria (CT underlying epithelia). ❖They are not enclosed by a capsule, when associated with mucous membranes are called mucosa- associated lymphatic tissue (MALT) ❖Regionally MALT include: ❖Gut-Associated Lymphatic Tissue (GALT) ❖Bronchus -Associated Lymphatic Tissue (BALT) ❖Lymphocytes and other free cells of this tissue are found in the lamina propria (subepithelial tissue) of these tracts. ❖After initial antigen exposure, cells of diffuse lymphatic tissue, travel to lymph nodes for proliferation and differentiation. ❖Increased plasma cells in the lamina propria indicate antibody secretion. ❖Increases eosinophils in the lamina propria indicates chronic inflammation and hypersensitivity reaction. Revision lymphatic tissue Cells Antigen presenting cells B lymphocytes T lymphocytes Natural killer cells Histology Agranulocytes with large spherical indented nuclei Function (be specific- this means do not give general functions like immune response but speak in detail to a particular function) Processes the antigen intra- cellularly and then displays antigen peptides on its surface Location Blood, lamina propria, lymphatic nodule , lymph node, spleen Connective tissue/ blood LYMPHOCYTE DEVELOPMENT ❖Lymphocytes undergo antigen- independent proliferation and differentiation (in the absence of any antigen/pathogen) in the primary lymphatic organs (thymus, bone marrow) and become immunocompetent. ❖Lymphocytes undergo antigen- dependent activation(there must be some exposure to antigen/pathogen before activation occurs) and become effector lymphocytes and memory cells in the secondary lymphatic organs (Lymphatic nodules, lymph nodes, tonsils, spleen). Bone marrow Lymphatic nodule LYMPHATIC ORGANS Primary lymphoid organs • Bone marrow • Thymus • Development, proliferation, maturing of lymphocytes Secondary lymphoid organs • Lymphoid nodules • Lymph nodes • Spleen • Germinal centers • Internal structure of reticular fibres ❖Lymphatic nodules are discrete concentrations of lymphocytes contained in a meshwork of reticular cells. ❖No afferent lymphatic vessels but lymph drains from lymphatic tissue through efferent lymphatic vessels. ❖Un-encapsulated (not enclosed by a capsule) but sharply delineated ❖These concentration are sharply defined, consisting of mostly small lymphocytes in a primary nodule. ❖A secondary nodule has a germinal centre. LYMPHATIC NODULES Germinal center Secondary lymphatic nodule Classification of lymphatic nodules Primary lymphatic nodule Mainly small lymphocytes Antigen exposure Secondary lymphatic nodule (with germinal Centre) Germinal center: large lymphocytes, mainly B cells/ macrophages/ APC’s/ plasma cells. Mantle zone: small lymphocytes chiefly T cells Primary nodule Secondary nodule ❖ When small sized dense heterochromatin staining lymphocytes that has recognized an antigen returns to a primary nodule, they undergo antigen dependent activation ,proliferation, differentiation and antibody production. ❖ A germinal center appears when lymphocytes are mitotic (proliferation of new lymphocytes), have lighter euchromatin and are dispersed and larger (immature lymphocytes). ❖Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are inter-dispersed between populations of B lymphocytes. ❖The presence of a germinal centre represents a cascade of events that includes activation and proliferation of lymphocytes, differentiation of plasma cells, and antibody production. Germinal centre Germinal center Secondary lymphatic nodule Germinal center Secondary lymphatic nodule Distribution of lymphatic nodules in the alimentary canal Tonsil Peyer’s patches (ileum) Vermiform appendix TONSILS ❖Ring of lymphatic tissue ❖Pharyngeal tonsils – roof of pharynx (adenoids) ❖Palatine tonsils – either side of pharynx ❖Lingual tonsils- Base of tongue ❖The palatine tonsils consist of dense accumulations of lymphatic tissue located in the mucous membrane. Palatine tonsils Squamous epithelium Crypt Lymphatic nodule The squamous epithelium that forms the surface of the tonsil dips into the underlying connective tissue in numerous places, forming tonsillar crypts. There fore it is classified as partially encapsulated Vermiform appendix ❖Arises from the cecum, the appendix is a significant part of the MALT with its lamina propria and submucosa filled with lymphocytes and lymphoid follicles. ❖The lamina propria is heavily infiltrated with lymphocytes and contains ❖numerous lymphatic nodules. ❖ The small lumen contains a sample of the microbial flora of the intestine, along with undigested material. Peyers patches ❖Located in the ileum (distal portion of the small intestine). ❖Aggregations of lymphatic nodules containing T and B lymphocytes ❖In addition to numerous isolated single (solitary) lymph nodules along intestines. LYMPH NODE ❖ Bacteria infected interstitial fluid is taken up by lymphatic capillaries and transported to a regional lymph node. ❖ Dendritic cells and macrophages within this organ internalize and kill many of the pathogens that pass through. ❖ The lymph node is also the site of adaptive immune responses mediated by T cells, B cells, and accessory cells of the adaptive immune system. Lymph Node Structure ❖ Capsulated (surrounded by dense connective tissue capsule) ❖ Divided into compartments by trabeculae ❖ Supported by reticular meshwork ❖ Reticular cells ❖ Dendritic cells ❖ Macrophages ❖ Follicular dendritic cells ❖ The parenchyma is divided into ❖Cortex Superficial: nodular; Deep: diffuse cells ❖Medulla Medullary cords Medullary sinuses Junqueira and Carneiro, 2002 Secondary lymphatic nodule Trabeculae Medulla Cortex Capsule Lymph node cortex ❖ Consists of a dense mass of lymphatic tissue and lymphatic sinuses (lymph channels). ❖ Superficial (nodular) cortex ❖ Primary nodules if they consist of mainly small lymphocytes and secondary nodules if they possess a germinal centre. ❖ Deep (diffuse) cortex ❖ The portion of the cortex between the medulla and superficial cortex is free of nodules. Contains mostly T cells. ❖ Also contains post capillary venules (high endothelial venules; HEV’s) which serve to transport fluid and electrolytes from lymph into the blood stream; also antigen-primed lymphocytes from the blood stream into the lymph node. HEV’S in deep cortex black arrow heads Lymph node medulla ❖ The inner part of the lymph node, consists of medullary cords [lymphatic tissue (lymphocytes ;T cells, B cells and many plasma cells), macrophages, and dendritic] separated by lymphatic sinuses called medullary sinuses. ❖ Also contains a network of reticular cells and fibres that traverse the medullary cords and medullary sinuses and serves as the framework of the parenchyma. ❖ The medullary sinuses (macrophages and sometimes neutrophils) converge near the hilum, where they drain into efferent lymphatic vessels. Cortex Medulla Medulla sinus Filtration of lymph Afferent L. vessels  Subcapsular sinus  Paratrabecular sinus  Medullary sinuses  Efferent L. vessels Subcapsular sinus ❖ Lymph enters the lymph node beneath the capsule of the lymph node through a sinus interposed between the capsule and the cortical lymphocytes ❖ It is occupied by dendritic cells, macrophages, and reticular fibres. ❖ Within the cortex of the lymph node are lymphoid nodules, which consist of germinal centres of rapidly dividing B cells surrounded by a layer of T cells and other accessory cells. Medullary sinus ❖ As the lymph continues to flow through the node, it enters the medulla, which consists of medullary cords of B cells and plasma cells, and the medullary sinuses where the lymph collects before leaving via the efferent lymphatic vessels. ❖ Dilated spaces lined by discontinuous endothelium that separate the medullary cords. ❖ The lumens of medullary sinuses include a meshwork of processes from reticular cells, which represent a final lymph filter. ❖ These sinuses contain many macrophages and sometimes neutrophils and converge at the hilum as the efferent lymphatic vessel Cortex Medulla REVISION SLIDE a.

Describe the changes that occur in the white pulp before a splenic nodule is formed. b. Considering that the spleen only has efferent lymphatic vessels and no afferent lymphatic vessels, explain how lymph drainage through the spleen occurs? Splenic nodule Trabeculae vein White pulp REVISION SLIDE Filtration of blood in the spleen ❖ The splenic artery from the hilum branches into trabecular artery and within the white pulp forms the central artery. ❖ The central artery sends branches to the marginal sinuses then to the red pulp as penicillar arterioles. ❖ These vessels empty directly into the reticular meshwork of the splenic cords and percolates through the cords exposing it to macrophages and squeezing through the walls of the splenic sinuses before returning to the circulation by the splenic vein. BONE MARROW ❖Medullary cavity of long bones ❖Consists of: ❖Sinusoids ❖Cords of haematopoietic stem cells & reticular cells ❖The hematopoietic niche in marrow includes the stroma, osteoblasts, and megakeryocytes. ❖Between the hematopoietic cords run the sinusoids, which have discontinuous endothelium, through which newly differentiated blood cells and platelets enter the circulation. Junqueira and Carneiro, 2002 Types of bone marrow Red bone marrow • Developing cell clusters, • RBCs • Megakaryocytes Yellow bone marrow • Mostly adipose • Can be re-stimulated by extension of haematopoietic tissue or circulating stem cells THYMUS ❖Bi-lobed organ found in the space between the sternum and the aorta of the heart . ❖Large organ at birth, regresses from puberty with adipose infiltration. ❖Can be restimulated ❖Outer region of cortex and inner medulla. ❖ Thin vascularized connective tissue capsule and trabeculae contain blood vessels, efferent (but not afferent) lymphatic vessels, and nerves. ❖Densely packed developing T cells (thymocytes) in an extensive meshwork formed by epithelioreticular cells ❖Contains macrophages, and dendritic cells. ❖Macrophages in thymic cortex identify T cells that do not fulfill thymic education and therefore are programmed for apoptosis. Thymic cortex Thymic medulla ❖ Many epithelioreticular cells and loosely packed T cells . Stains less intensely due to pale staining and mostly large lymphocytes that have more cytoplasm than small lymphocytes. ❖ Thymic corpuscles are isolated masses of closely packed, concentrically arranged type VI epithelioreticular cells; these cells exhibit flattened nuclei. ❖ The more central mass of the Hassall’s corpuscle contains fully keratinized cells.

Describe the histology and arrangement of cells found in this region. REVISION SLIDE ❖ Many lymphatic organs have the appearance of a pale (germinal) center. So how do you spot one from the other? ❖ Look out for the surrounding structures. ❖ In image B, a capsule and trabeculae can be clearly seen. Lymph node, spleen and thymus all have these features. But in the lower part of the image we can see medullary sinuses and cords as well therefore image B is? ❖ Image D has a pale internal region with a possible vessel structure in the middle. It could not be the white pulp because the PALS surrounding the central artery is very basophilic and not pale. Rather the pale and basophilic structure in image D is compartmentalized into an inner and outer, therefore image D is? ❖ Image C has a typical germinal center and outer mantle zone, but it also has a structure embedded in its mantle zone. Therefore image C is? ❖ Do not be in a hurry to identify every structure that has a pale center as a secondary nodule or lymph node.
