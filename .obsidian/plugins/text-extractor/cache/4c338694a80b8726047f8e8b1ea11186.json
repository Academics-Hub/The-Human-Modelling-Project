Best wishes, Lois ______________________________________________________ PHSL 2004 Immunology 3 Lecture 1 • Please watch videos 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d and 1e. 1. Introduction 1.1 What is Immunology ? The study of how the body defends itself against foreign organisms such as viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi, as well as against foreign non-invasive cells, tissues, molecules. Virus • Small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. • Examples include: o influenza, common cold, coronavirus SARSov2 (COVID-19). o norovirus and rotavirus, common causes of viral gastroenteritis. o human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Bacteria • Humans and most other animals carry millions of bacteria. Most are in the gut, and there are many on the skin. Most of the bacteria in and on the body are harmless or rendered so by the protective effects of the immune system, and many are beneficial, particularly the ones in the gut. • However, several species are pathogenic and can cause disease. • The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections, for example tuberculosis and streptococcus pneumonia. • Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections. PHSL 2004 Immunology 4 Parasites • A parasite is an organism that lives on or in a host organism and gets its food from or at the expense of its host. • 3 main classes of parasites that can cause disease in humans: protozoa, helminths, and ectoparasites. • Of all parasitic diseases, malaria causes the most deaths globally. • Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by any one of five malaria parasite species. Fungi • There are millions of different fungal species on Earth, but only about 300 of those are known to make people sick. • Fungal diseases are often caused by fungi that are common in the environment. Fungi live outdoors in soil and on plants and trees as well as on many indoor surfaces and on human skin. • Ringworm = A common fungal skin infection that often looks like a circular rash. • Candidiasis = candida is a type of yeast that normally lives in small amounts in places like your mouth, GIT and skin without causing any problems. But when the environment is right, the yeast can multiply and grow out of control. PHSL 2004 Immunology 5 1.2 Pathogen • is any foreign organism (not a part of the body) that invades or is present inside the body. • can cause harm to the body and affects normal functioning. • can cause disease. • Examples would be bacteria, virus, fungi or parasites. 1.3 Antigen • antigen = antibody generator • is not an organism, but rather, a molecule attached to a foreign organism that activates an antibody response. • usually located in the cell walls of bacteria, or in the outer coating of other foreign organisms. • can also be an unusual peptide produced by a tumor cell. • may originate from within the body (\"self-antigen\") or from the external environment (\"non-self\"). • The immune system is usually non-reactive against \"self\" antigens under normal homeostatic conditions due to negative selection of immune cells in the thymus and is supposed to identify and attack only \"non-self\" invaders from the outside world or modified/harmful substances present in the body under distressed conditions. • Negative selection deletes potentially self-reactive immune cells, thereby generating a repertoire of immune cells that is largely self-tolerant. PHSL 2004 Immunology 6 2. Physical barriers PHSL 2004 Immunology 7 • Infection occurs when viruses, bacteria, or other microbes enter your body and begin to multiply. • In response to infection, your immune system springs into action. • Many of the symptoms that make a person suffer during an infection—fever, malaise, headache, pain — result from the activities of the immune system trying to eliminate the infection from the body. Jobs of the immune system • Communicate • Kill enemies • Cause inflammation • Activate other cells • Produce antibodies • Kill infected cells • Remember enemies • Mark/disable enemies I • Mark/disable enemies II PHSL 2004 Immunology 8 3. Cells of the immune system 3.1 Functions • Monocytes live for 1-3 days in blood • Macrophages live for a long time (months) in tissue • Phagocytes • Antigen presenting cells • Orchestrate immune responses: induce inflammation, secrete signalling proteins (cytokines) to activate lymphocytes and other phagocytes. Monocytes and macrophages Cell PHSL 2004 Immunology 9 • Monocytes live for 1-3 days in blood • Macrophages live for a long time (months) in tissue • Phagocytes • Antigen presenting cells • Orchestrate immune responses: induce inflammation, secrete signaling proteins (cytokines) to activate lymphocytes and other phagocytes. • Live for days to weeks. • Phagocytes • Long finger like processes: ingest particles and extracellular fluid by macropinocytosis. • If they encounter a microorganism, they mature into cells capable of activating T lymphocytes = Antigen presenting cells • Short-lived cells ~ 5 days • Phagocytes • Antigen presenting cells to memory T helper cells. • Destroy microorganisms with granules (contain lysozyme & other degradative enzymes). • Release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). • Very effective at killing bacteria. Dendritic cell Neutrophil Monocytes and macrophages Cell Janeway Immune Biology, page 5 PHSL 2004 Immunology 10 • Involved mostly in defense against parasitic infections. • Secrete highly toxic proteins and free radicals that are highly effective in killing bacteria and parasites. • Phagocytes • Along with mast cells causes Inflammation and is involved in allergic responses. • Function is similar and complementary to that of eosinophils and mast cells. • Release histamine and heparin which are involved in inflammation. • Heparin initiates the production of a hormone – bradykinin • Bradykinin causes dilation of blood vessels • Histamine increases vascular permeability • Phagocytes • Are involved in allergic responses. • Reside in tissue mainly near small blood vessels. • Function is similar and complementary to that of eosinophils and basophils. • Release histamine and heparin which are involved in inflammation. • Phagocytes • Are involved in allergic responses. Eosinophil Basophil Mast cell Janeway Immune Biology, page 5 PHSL 2004 Immunology 11 T-lymphocyte cells • Each T-lymphocyte carries a different antigen receptor (T cell receptor) on its surface. • Selection of T cells with the correct T cell receptor happens in the thymus. • The T cell receptor from an immature T cell is tested against major histocompatibility complex (MHC) from the self. • MHC is a group of genes that code for proteins found on the surfaces of cells that help the immune system recognize foreign substances. • There are two major types of MHC protein molecules—class I and class II. Class I MHC molecules span the membrane of almost every cell in an organism, while class II molecules are restricted to cells of the immune system called antigen presenting cells. • Immature T cells that recognize self MHC and bind weakly to them receive signals for survival and will progress to become a single positive T cell. • If the immature T cell doesn’t bind or if it binds too much with the self MHC then it is removed by apoptosis (a form of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms). • If the T cell receptor binds to an MHC class I-presented antigen then it is a Killer/Cytotoxic T Cell (TC). • If the T cell receptor binds to an MHC class II-presented antigen then it is a Helper T Cells (TH) • You will learn more about MHC molecules in lecture 3. • Once a positive T cell receptor encounters its antigen the T cell is activated. • Killer/Cytotoxic T Cell (TC) Destruction of host cells infected with viruses or other intracellular pathogens • Helper T Cells (TH) Directs immune system by secreting cytokine • Memory T Cells (TM) Provide long–lasting immunity • Suppressor/Regulator T Cells (TS/R) Suppress activity of other lymphocytes to control immune responses PHSL 2004 Immunology 12 B lymphocyte cells • Each B cell carries a different antigen receptor (B cell receptor) on its surface. • B cell receptor (BCR) is a surface antibody (or immunoglobulin) • When BCR binds to its antigen it activates the B lymphocyte • Activated B cells multiply and differentiate into plasma cells or memory cells. • Plasma cells produce antibodies Natural killer (NK) cell • Involved in the early phase of host defense to pathogen. • Have the capacity to recognize the surface changes that occur on a variety of tumor and virally infected cells. • Unlike killer T cells, they do not have antigen-specific receptors. • “Killing” method same as that of Killer T cells. • Release granules that kill some virus-infected cells by causing lysis of the infected cell. Lysis refers to the disintegration of a cell by disruption of its plasma membrane. • Secretes cytokines Janeway Immune Biology, page 5 PHSL 2004 Immunology 13 Test 1 2022 Neutrophils a) are white blood cells. b) secrete immunoglobulin G (IgG). c) are antigen-presenting cells. d) form natural killer cells. e) are phagocytic. Exam 2021 Natural killer cells a) produce immunoglobulins. b) have antigen-specific receptors. c) release lytic granules. d) develop into cytotoxic/killer T cells. e) protect the host against viral infections.

Organs of the immune system Lymphoid tissue = produce, store and process lymphocytes • Primary/Central lymphoid tissue sites are where lymphocytes mature into naïve cells in the absence of foreign antigen. • T Lymphocytes mature in the thymus. • Bone marrow = T + B Lymphocytes develop and B Lymphocytes mature. • Secondary/Peripheral lymphoid tissue sites are where lymphocytes are exposed to foreign antigen, multiply and are activated. right subclavian vein Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) Janeway Immune Biology, page 7 PHSL 2004 Immunology 15 PHSL 2004 Immunology 16 1. 2. 3. 4. http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/immuneSystem/Pages/structureImages.aspx PHSL 2004 Immunology 17 Lymphoid tissue Function Bone marrow 1. Origin of all blood cells. 2. Site of maturational processing of B lymphocytes. Lymph nodes, tonsil, adenoids, appendix, GALT 1. Exchange lymphocytes with the lymph (remove, store, produce and add them). 2. Resident lymphocytes produce antibodies and activated cells, which are released into the lymph. 3. Resident macrophages remove microbes and other particulate debris from the lymph. Spleen 1. Exchanges lymphocytes with the blood (removes, stores, produces and adds them). 2. Resident lymphocytes produce antibodies and activated cells, which are released into the blood. 3. Resident macrophages remove microbes and other particulate debris, most notably worn-out red blood cells, from the blood. Thymus 1. Site of maturational processing for T lymphocytes. 2. Secretes the hormone thymosin (stimulates the development of T cells). PHSL 2004 Immunology 18 5. Innate immunity Innate immunity: general protection against the ‘non-self’: • Immediate defence against pathogens • Does not confer long-term immunity • Innate consists of cells and proteins that are always present and ready to mobilize and fight microbes at the site of infection. Adaptive immunity (against specific pathogens, specific proteins that are recognized): • Develops during the lifetime of an individual • Takes a few days-weeks to develop • Can create long-term immunity against a pathogen • Adaptive immune system is called into action against pathogens that are able to evade or overcome innate immune defences. Rapid response www.ucsf.edu/immunology Slow response PHSL 2004 Immunology 19 Activation of the innate immune system • Two pathways: – Monocyte-macrophage pathway – Complement system pathway – These two pathways can coexist simultaneously Macrophages (tissue)/monocytes (blood) can exist in 3 stages of readiness: • Resting • Phagocytic cells also play an important part in scavenging dead and damaged cells and cell debris for example worn-out red blood cells and white cells. PHSL 2004 Immunology 20 • Primed or activated 1. 2. 3. Please relook at video 1d before going further. PHSL 2004 Immunology 21 Activated or primed macrophage A bacterium is engulfed by phagocytosis into an activated or primed macrophage and is encased in a phagosome.

PHSL 2004 Immunology 29 Lecture 3 • Please watch videos 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f and 3g. Complement system What is the complement system? The complement system refers to a series of more than 30 soluble, preformed proteins circulating in the blood and bathing the fluids surrounding tissues. The proteins circulate in an inactive form, but in response to the recognition of molecular components of a microorganism, they become sequentially activated, working in a cascade where in the binding of one protein promotes the binding of the next protein in the cascade. There are 3 complement pathways that make up the complement system: • the classical complement pathway, • the lectin pathway, • the alternative complement pathway. PHSL 2004 Immunology 30 The alternative complement pathway PHSL 2004 Immunology 31 The alternative complement pathway C3b C3a and C5a C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9 Opsonisation of pathogens and antigens Binding to complement receptors on phagocytes Membrane-attack complex Lysis of pathogens and cells Triggers inflammation by causing mast cell degranulation Chemotactically attracts phagocytes to the infection site Activates WBC • C3b binds to either amino or hydroxyl groups. • Many of the proteins and carbohydrates that make up the surfaces of microorganisms have amino and hydroxyl groups. PHSL 2004 Immunology 32 Opsonization = Is the process by which a pathogen is marked for phagocytosis. Opsonization involves the binding of an opsonin, e.g., antibody or complement protein to proteins and polysaccharides (antigens) on pathogen surfaces; another portion attaches to receptors on phagocytes for enhanced phagocytosis PHSL 2004 Immunology 33 Membrane attack complex (MAC) • The membrane attack complex (MAC) is a structure typically formed on the surface of pathogen cell membranes as a result of the activation of the host's complement system. • The membrane-attack complex (MAC) forms transmembrane channels. These channels disrupt the cell membrane of target cells, leading to cell lysis and death. Pathogen Lipid bilayer PHSL 2004 Immunology 34 The lectin pathway C3b C3a and C5a C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9 Opsonization of pathogens and antigens Binding to complement receptors on phagocytes Membrane-attack complex Lysis of pathogens and cells Triggers inflammation by causing mast cell degranulation Chemotactically attracts phagocytes to the infection site Activates WBC carbohydrate-binding protein called mannose-binding lectin found in plasma and tissue and produced by the liver in response to infection microorganism surface contains pieces of carbohydrates e.g. mannose PHSL 2004 Immunology 35 How do we know there is inflammation or an inflection in the body? • Pus forms: mix of live and dead neutrophils. • Swelling, oedema, redness and heat at inflammation site. Pain induced by local swelling. • ↑ neutrophils (above 10 000/mm3; 10 x 109 cells/L) • ↑ C-reactive protein (CRP) (NORMAL < 10 mg/l) • CRP is synthesized primarily in liver hepatocytes. • Pro-inflammatory cytokines released from immune cells such as macrophages stimulate the release of CRP. • ↑ Erythrocyte sedimentation rate • ESR is the rate at which red blood cells precipitate in a period of 1 hour (in mm/hour) • ↑ number of proteins circulating: plasma is more viscous, erythrocytes agglutinate together and form ‘rouleaux’. They ‘fall’ quicker in the tube and therefore accumulate at the bottom quicker. PHSL 2004 Immunology 36 Test 1 2021 A bacterial infection will cause a) decreased blood C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. b) complement activation. c) an increased neutrophil count. d) a decreased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. e) mast cell histamine release. PHSL 2004 Immunology 37 6. Adaptive (acquired) immunity www.ucsf.edu/immunology PHSL 2004 Immunology 38 Antigen presentation - Major Histocompatibility molecules • MHC I are present on all NUCLEATED cells in our body. • Typically, white blood cells have lots of MHC I, hepatocytes less, and red blood cells almost none (probably why malaria finds refuge in them). MHC II are found ONLY on specialized antigen presenting cells = B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages. MHC Class I MHC Class II PHSL 2004 Immunology 39 1. 2. 3. 4. PHSL 2004 Immunology 40 MHC class I • Will trigger activation of cytotoxic T cell (CD8+ T cell) 1. 2. 3. 4. If host cell is not infected will just display MHC I with self-proteins.

B cell receptor B cell 2. Helper T cell 3. PHSL 2004 Immunology 43 • Antibodies have TWO functions done by 2 separate parts of the antibody molecule: 1. Recognition of antigen (antigen binding site) by the variable region 2. Effector function is done by the constant region • B-cell receptor does not have these effector functions because the C region is buried in the membrane  its role is to activate B cells. • The different suffixes of the antibody isotypes denote the different types of heavy chains the antibody contains, with each heavy chain class named alphabetically: α (alpha), γ (gamma), δ (delta), ε (epsilon), and μ (mu). This gives rise to IgA, IgG, IgD, IgE, and IgM. • Mature Naïve B-cells (those that have not encountered their antigen) express IgM and IgD on their surface. • When they encounter their antigen and are activated class switching occurs. Class switching is the process whereby an activated B cell changes its antibody production from IgM to either IgA, IgG, or IgE depending on the functional requirements. • In the end, most of our Ig are represented by IgGs.. Human Physiology, Sherwood 5th ed, page 426 Fc = constant fragment of antibody “tail” which can bind to receptors (Fc receptors) on the surface of cells like macrophages. Fab Light chain Heavy chain Antigens Specific antigen- binding sites Antigen-binding fragment PHSL 2004 Immunology 44 The classical complement pathway C3b C3a and C5a C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9 Opsonization of pathogens and antigens Binding to complement receptors on phagocytes Membrane-attack complex Lysis of pathogens and cells Triggers inflammation by causing mast cell degranulation Chemotactically attracts phagocytes to the infection site Activates WBC PHSL 2004 Immunology 45 Control of complement pathway • C1-inhibitor is an acute-phase protein that circulates in blood. • The levels rise ~2-fold during inflammation. • It stops the classical pathway. • It also limits spontaneous activation of C1 in the plasma. • Deficiency of this protein is associated with hereditary angioedema (\"hereditary angioneurotic oedema\"), or swelling due to leakage of fluid from blood vessels into connective tissue. • Deficiency of C1-inhibitor permits localised vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. In its most common form, it presents as marked swelling of the face, mouth and/or airway that occurs spontaneously or to minimal triggers (such as mild trauma), but such swelling can occur in any part of the body. In 85% of the cases, the levels of C1-inhibitor are low, while in 15% the protein circulates in normal amounts but it is dysfunctional. A 67 year-old man presents with lower lip swelling for the past two hours, and was recently diagnosed with hereditary angioedema. PHSL 2004 Immunology 46 Primary and secondary response to antigen exposure https://courses.lumenlearning.com/microbiology/chapter/b-lymphocytes-and-humoral-immunity/ Primary immune response Secondary immune response 1. Occurs as a result of primary contact with an antigen. Occurs as a result of second and subsequent exposure of the same antigen. 2. Responding cell is mature naïve B- cell and T-cell. Responding cell is memory cell. 3. Lag phase is often longer (4-7 days), sometimes as long as weeks or months. Lag phase is shorter (1-4 days) due to the presence of memory cell. 4. Level of antibody reaches peak in 7 to 10 days. Level of antibody reaches peak in 3 to 5 days. 5. First antibody produced is mainly IgM. Although small amount of IgG are also produced. Mainly IgG antibody is produced. Although sometimes small amount of IgM are produced. Other immunoglobulins such as IgA and in the case of allergy IgE are produced. 6. Antibody level declines rapidly. Antibody level remain high for longer period. 7. Affinity of antibody is lower for its antigen. Antibodies have greater affinity for antigen. PHSL 2004 Immunology 47 PHSL 2004 Immunology 48 Neutralization • Both viruses and bacterial toxins must bind to the plasma membranes of body cells before they can enter or injure those cells. • Binding occurs at superficial sites on the bacteria or toxins. • Antibodies may bind to those sites, making the virus or toxin incapable of attaching itself to a cell. Precipitation and agglutination • If antigens are close together, an antibody can bind to antigenic determinant sites on two different antigens. • In this way, antibodies can tie large numbers of antigens together, creating an immune complex. • When the target antigen is on the surface of a cell or a virus, the formation of immune complexes is called agglutination. • Agglutination enhances phagocytosis and reduces the number of infectious units to be dealt with. Prevention of pathogen adhesion • Antibodies dissolved in saliva, mucus, tears and sweat coat epithelia, providing an additional layers of defense. • A covering of antibodies makes it difficult for bacteria or viruses to adhere to and penetrate body surfaces. Activation of complement • Upon binding to an antigen, portions of the antibody molecule change shape, exposing areas that bind complement proteins. • The bound complement molecules then activate the complement system, which destroys the antigen. Opsonization • Phagocytes can bind more easily to antibodies and complement proteins on the surface of a pathogen than they can to an antibody-free and complement-free surface. • As a result, a coating of antibodies and complement proteins on a pathogen increases the effectiveness of phagocytosis. • Some bacteria have slick plasma membranes or capsules, and phagocytes must be able to hang onto their prey before they can engulf it. Attraction of phagocytes • Antigens covered with antibodies attract eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages – cells that phagocytize pathogens and destroy foreign or abnormal plasma membranes. Stimulation of inflammation • Antibodies may promote inflammation by stimulating the release of chemicals from basophils and mast cells. PHSL 2004 Immunology 49 Characteristic IgG IgM IgA IgD IgE Concentration in plasma (g/L) 13 1.5 3.5 0.03 0.00005 What an increased concentration may mean Long-term (chronic) infection Are the type that form when an infection occurs for the first time: - new infection - vaccination Autoimmune disease Unclear Parasitic infection Allergic reaction Location Blood, lymph, intestine Blood, lymph, B cell surface Secretions (tears, saliva, mucus, intestine, colostrum, milk), blood, lymph B cell surface, blood, lymph Bound to mast and basophil cells throughout body, blood Activates classical complement pathway Yes Yes No No No Placental transfer Yes No No No No Neutralization Yes Yes Yes No No Opsonisation Yes No Yes No No Fix to mast cells/basophils/eosinophils No No No No Yes Binds to macrophages and phagocytic Fc receptors Yes No Yes No Yes PHSL 2004 Immunology 50 Test 1 2021 Identify the correct and the incorrect statement(s). a) The complement system forms part of the innate immune system. b) The classical complement pathway is activated by binding of C3. c) Complement pathways, when activated, form the membrane attack complex. d) Complement pathways, when activated, inhibit opsonization of the pathogen. e) A deficit of the C1 inhibitor will cause angioedema.

Immunopathology - Allergy Hypersensitivity reaction mediated by immunological mechanisms An allergy is an immune reaction to something that does not affect most other people. Substances that often cause reactions are: - Pollen - Dust mites - Mold spores - Pet dander - Food - Insect stings - Medicines PHSL 2004 Immunology 52 Airways • Decrease in airway diameter and an increase in mucus secretion. • Congestion and blockage of the airways (wheezing, coughing, phlegm) • Swelling and mucus secretion in nasal passages PHSL 2004 Immunology 53 Anaphylaxis • exaggerated allergic response to a substance to which an individual is hypersensitive. • it typically results in a number of symptoms including an itchy rash, throat swelling, and low blood pressure. • common causes include insect bites, foods, and medications. • rapidly fatal, therefore requires an immediate injection of adrenaline to relax smooth muscle and inhibit the cardiovascular effects of anaphylaxis. PHSL 2004 Immunology 54 Disease due to immunodeficiency - AIDS After transmission of HIV to a new host: Immunopaedia.org. AIDS = acquired immune deficiency syndrome Seroconversion is the period of time during which HIV antibodies develop and become detectable PHSL 2004 Immunology 55 After transmission of HIV to a new host: 1. there is dissemination of the virus to lymphoid tissues 2. a rapid increase in viraemia in the acute phase. The fall in peak viraemia is thought to be due to the initial immune control. 3. and viral load declines to a set point. • A decline in CD4+ T cells coincides with the increase in viral load. • HIV-specific CD8+ Cytotoxic T cell responses are thought to reduce systemic viral load and an increase in CD4+ T cells is often observed. • HIV-specific binding antibodies appear after the reduction of viraemia. • During chronic infection, CD4+ T cells decline slowly and viral load remains relatively stable. • Neutralising antibodies begin to appear only after about 3-6 months and continued HIV replication • Immune evasion exhausts the immune system leading to opportunistic infection and AIDS. • Access to better antiviral treatments has dramatically decreased deaths from AIDS worldwide. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years. Deficit in CD4 T helper cells (mainly) and CD8 T cytotoxic cells due to: • Direct viral killing of infected cells • Increased susceptibility to the induction of apoptosis in infected cells • Killing of infected CD4 T helper cells by CD8 T cytotoxic cells • High destruction and low renewal: additional destruction of CD4 T helper cells in the Thymus by the virus CD4 T helper cells stimulate CD8 T cytotoxic cells  as CD4 decrease, CD8 also decrease  decreased cellular immunity CD4 T helper cells necessary for the activation of naïve B lymphocytes  decreased extracellular immunity PHSL 2004 Immunology 56 Complications HIV infection weakens your immune system, making you much more likely to develop many infections and certain types of cancers. Infections common to HIV/AIDS • Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). This fungal infection can cause severe illness. Although it's declined significantly with current treatments for HIV/AIDS, PCP is still the most common cause of pneumonia in people infected with HIV. • Candidiasis (thrush). Candidiasis is a common HIV-related infection. It causes inflammation and a thick, white coating on your mouth, tongue, esophagus or vagina. • Tuberculosis (TB). TB is a common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. Worldwide, TB is a leading cause of death among people with AIDS. • Cytomegalovirus. This common herpes virus is transmitted in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. A healthy immune system inactivates the virus, and it remains dormant in your body. If your immune system weakens, the virus resurfaces — causing damage to your eyes, digestive tract, lungs or other organs. • Cryptococcal meningitis. Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord (meninges). Cryptococcal meningitis is a common central nervous system infection associated with HIV, caused by a fungus found in soil. • Toxoplasmosis. This potentially deadly infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, which may then spread to other animals and humans. Toxoplasmosis can cause heart disease, and seizures occur when it spreads to the brain. Cancers common to HIV/AIDS • Lymphoma. This cancer starts in the white blood cells. The most common early sign is painless swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck, armpit or groin. • Kaposi's sarcoma. A tumor of the blood vessel walls, Kaposi's sarcoma usually appears as pink, red or purple lesions on the skin and mouth. • HPV-related cancers. These are cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. They include anal, oral and cervical cancer. PHSL 2004 Immunology 57 Autoimmune diseases Autoimmune diseases arise from an inappropriate immune response of the body against substances and tissues normally present in the body. The immune system mistakes some part of the body as a pathogen and attacks its own cells. • Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus o Pancreatic beta-cell destruction, marked by the production of antibodies to the pancreatic beta-cells, occurs over many years and ultimately results in metabolic abnormalities first manifested as impaired glucose tolerance and then progressing to symptomatic hyperglycemia. • Multiple sclerosis o Disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with characteristic inflammatory lesions and demyelination that causes damage to the protective covering (myelin sheath) that surrounds nerve fibers in your brain, the nerves leading to the eyes (optic nerves) and spinal cord. When the myelin sheath is damaged, nerve impulses slow or even stop, causing neurological problems. o Antibodies that recognize components of the CNS may be involved. • Rheumatoid arthritis o characterized by joint inflammation. o Antibodies that recognize components found in joints and surrounding tissue. • Systemic Lupus erythematosus o widespread inflammation and tissue damage in the affected organs. It can affect the joints, skin, brain, lungs, kidneys, and blood vessels. o antibodies that bind to nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), proteins and complexes of DNA or RNA with proteins. https://drjockers.com/heal-autoimmune-disease/ PHSL 2004 Immunology 58 Test 1 2022 Anaphylaxis is mediated by a) immunoglobulin M (IgM). b) eosinophils. c) cytotoxic T cells. d) histamine. e) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation.
