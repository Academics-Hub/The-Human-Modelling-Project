Alterations in these basic functions con- tribute to a variety of clinical scenarios. These pri- mary functions intrinsically require splanchnic blood ¯ow at both the macrovascular and microvascular lev- els of perfusion. Therefore, a greater understanding of the mechanisms that regulate intestinal vascular per- fusion in the normal state and during pathophysiolog- ical conditions would be bene®cial. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current understand- ing regarding the regulatory mechanisms of intestinal blood ¯ow in fasted and fed conditions and during pathological stress. © 2000 Academic Press Key Words: regional blood ¯ow; postprandial hyper- emia; septic shock; hemorrhagic shock; cardiogenic shock; circulation; nitric oxide; adenosine; adrenergic. VASCULAR ANATOMY AND DISTRIBUTION OF INTESTINAL BLOOD FLOW The gastrointestinal system of mammals is supplied by three direct branches of the aorta: the celiac artery, the cranial or superior mesenteric artery, and the cau- dal or inferior mesenteric artery [1]. The celiac artery supplies blood ¯ow to the stomach, liver, and spleen, while the superior mesenteric artery, the largest single branch of the abdominal aorta, supplies the entire small intestine, proximal portions of the colon, and the pancreas. The inferior mesenteric artery delivers blood ¯ow to the distal colon. Total blood ¯ow through these arteries is typically 20 ±25% of cardiac output in the unfed state [2]. There is extensive overlap or collateral circulation in the distal vascular distributions of these arteries. During nutrient absorption, blood ¯ow in each of these arteries is increased sequentially as the diges- tive chyme passes over the mucosal surface supplied by the particular arteries [3]. Following nutrient absorp- tion, the blood ¯ow to each segment returns to baseline levels as the chyme moves past that region of the digestive tract [4, 5]. This postprandial increase in blood ¯ow is independent of organ distention and is solely dependent on the composition of the chyme [6, 7]. The intraorgan distribution of blood ¯ow within the tissue layers of the intestine is not uniform [3] and appears to correspond to the functional importance of the tissue layer. In unfed animals at rest, blood ¯ow to the mucosal layer is about 70 ± 80% of total ¯ow, while the muscular and serosal layers collectively receive 15±25% of organ ¯ow and the submucosal layer is perfused by less than 5% [3]. Of the mucosal blood ¯ow, approximately 60% perfuses the vessels that terminate as end loops and that supply the epithelial cells in the intestinal villi. The remaining 40% supply ¯ow to the crypts and goblet cells [3]. The arterial microvascular branching pattern of the intestinal microvasculature, described by Bohlen and Gore [8, 9], is diagrammed in Fig. 1. Following the ingestion of a meal, blood ¯ow increases by as much as 200% above baseline levels and persists for 2 to 3 h. This increase in ¯ow is shifted to the mucosal layer by a process of capillary recruit- ment where existing but closed vessels open. The con- trol mechanism of this recruitment process is unknown for the intestinal microcirculation. In the resting or unfed state only 20 ±30% of capillaries are normally perfused [1, 3]. The intestinal mucosa is the site of nutrient absorption; the submucosa, which consists of 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed at Veterans Af- fairs Medical Center, 800 Zorn Avenue, Research Bldg. 19, Louis- ville, KY 40206.

In gen- eral, blood ¯ow to these three layers is autoregulated by metabolic factors such as decreased PO2, pH, or osmolarity and increased PCO2 or adenosine. These mechanisms serve to maintain or increase blood ¯ow to meet the tissue's need for oxygen and nutrient delivery and waste removal [10]. In addition to vascular perfusion, the organs of the gastrointestinal system contain numerous lymph ves- sels [11±14]. The gastrointestinal lymphatic circula- tion is anatomically divided into two separate parti- tions, which remain separate until they exit from the intestine near the mesenteric arcade vessels [12±14]. These two lymphatic circulations are termed the mucosal±submucosal lymph system and the muscular lymph system [12]. The mucosal±submucosal lymph circulation functions to drain the absorbed nutrients and metabolic by-products from the villi during diges- tion. These villus lymph vessels, termed lacteals, do not have smooth muscle cells. However, it is thought that the muscularis mucosa, which lines the villi be- neath the epithelial cells, can contract in synchrony with the relaxation of the muscular layers of the intes- tine, thereby propelling lymph from the villi into the submucosal arcade of lymph capillaries [15]. The en- teric nervous system coordinates the contractions of villi in this process to optimize lymph drainage from the intestine and to facilitate nutrient entry into the circulation [12, 13]. The contraction of the muscularis mucosa occurs along the length of the villus and propels lymph toward the submucosal arcade vessels, which are located prox- imal to the site where the mucosal±submucosal and muscular lymph systems unite [13, 14]. As lymph col- lects in the submucosal arcade, the contraction of the longitudinal and circular muscular layers during the digestion of chyme propels the lymph out from the intestinal layers and into the out¯ow lymph vessels [13, 14]. These out¯ow lymph vessels exhibit typical characteristics of lymph vessels including rhythmic contractions and unidirectional valves, which function to propel the lymph and to prevent retrograde ¯ow back toward the intestinal layers. These larger lymph vessels are lined with endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells that produce mediators of smooth muscle tone in response to different nutrients or metabolic products present in the lymph [12, 13]. The role of lymph-derived mediators in regulation of resting vas- cular tone or postprandial hyperemia is not known, but involvement has been implicated in some studies [16]. FACTORS THAT REGULATE RESTING VASCULAR TONE In the unfed resting state, numerous mechanisms exist that control vascular tone in the microvessels of the gastrointestinal circulation. Table 1 provides a summary of mechanisms and mediators that might contribute to resting tone, and Fig. 2 provides a theo- retical scale to indicate the relative contribution of the different vasoactive mediators as a function of position in the arterial tree. Constriction of large arteries and arterioles (.50 mm) is primarily under the in¯uence of neural regulation from the vasomotor center of the FIG. 2. Theoretical contribution to vascular tone of the media- tors from the classi®cation system outlined in Table 1 as a function of their position in the vascular tree. Neural and humoral agents might contribute more to the tone of large conduit blood vessels, while paracrine and metabolic mediators contribute proportionally more to the smaller microvessels due to limited diffusion into sys- temic blood.

This neurogenic input to the large blood vessels and in¯ow arterioles is primarily sympathetic, with a-adrenergic (vasoconstriction) control more prevalent than b-adrenergic (vasodilation) in¯uence [17, 18]. These pathways are well described and will not be elaborated on in this review. Previous studies [10] sug- gest that metabolic autoregulation plays a signi®cant role in the regulation of resting vascular tone in the enteric circulation. Autoregulation by decreased PO2, pH, or osmolarity and increased PCO2 or adenosine exerts signi®cant local environmental control of micro- scopic blood vessel tone. Other studies [16, 19] indicate a near-constant oxygen delivery to the mucosal sur- face, while the mean in¯ow pressure varied from 30 to 120 mm Hg. The extent to which other mediators and mechanisms listed in Table 1 contribute to resting vascular tone in the intestine varies and has not been completely de®ned. CONTROLLING FACTORS IN THE REGULATION OF POSTPRANDIAL HYPEREMIA Postprandial intestinal hyperemia is de®ned as an increase in blood ¯ow to the gastrointestinal system during the digestion and absorption of nutrients. This hyperemia is a complex response mediated by neural, humoral, and paracrine elements [20 ±22]. As early as 1910, Brodie and colleagues [23, 24] demonstrated in- creased blood ¯ow in isolated canine intestinal seg- ments after the placement of a peptone solution into the lumen of the intestine, while placement of differing molar strengths of saline solutions did not produce a similar response. Studies in the 1930s with newly de- veloped electromagnetic ¯ow probes [25, 26] demon- strated an intestinal postprandial hyperemia in con- scious instrumented dogs following the intraluminal placement of a predigested meal. Since these initial observations, additional experiments have focused on the mechanisms of absorptive hyperemia, and yet the basic control mechanisms have not been completely elucidated [20]. Traditional thought proposes that postprandial hyperemia is a functional response that exists to maintain adequate blood ¯ow for preservation of intestinal function and integrity during digestion and absorption [20]. In the 1970s and 1980s, Chou and others [20] per- formed a seminal series of experiments to clarify the role of the intestinal luminal contents in postprandial hyperemia, which has been extensively reviewed pre- TABLE 1 Potential Vasoactive Mediators of the Enteric Circulation Constrictors Dilators Neural Mediators 1 Sympathetic tone (Adrenergic) 2 Sympathetic tone 2 Parasympathetic tone (Cholinergic) 1 Parasympathetic tone Neuropeptide Y Substance P Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRPa) Circulating Humoral Mediators Catecholamines (except in liver and muscle) Catecholamines (only in liver and muscle) Angiotensin II Histamine Vasopressin Bradykinin Serotonin Activated complement (C3a, C5a) Activated complement (C5a) Adrenomedullin Circulating Paracrine and Autocrine Mediators Endothelin-1 (vascular smooth muscle cells) Endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF, NO) Platelet-activating factor Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) Constrictor prostaglandins (F2a) Dilator prostaglandins (I2 or prostacyclin) Endothelin-1 (endothelial cells) ªMetabolicº Vasodilators 1 PO2 2 PO2 2 PCO2 1 PCO2 1 pH 2 pH 2 Metabolites (K1, lactate, adenosine, etc.) 1 Metabolites 184 JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH: VOL. 93, NO. 1, SEPTEMBER 2000 viously. This review highlights key elements and de- scribes the known hierarchy of nutrient inducers of hyperemia. Lipids and fats in combination with bile salts are the most potent nutrient inducers of in- creased ¯ow, followed by glucose and other carbohy- drates, proteins, peptides, and amino acids as the least potent nutrient inducers. A combination of these vari- ous compounds [6, 27, 28] produces the greatest in- crease in intestinal blood ¯ow, and bile salts further increase ¯ow during nutrient digestion and absorption [29, 30]. During the digestion of a meal, there are four activ- ities that occur during two well-described cardiovascu- lar stages: anticipation and ingestion, and digestion and absorption [20, 22]. Anticipation and ingestion occur simultaneously for a brief period and are fol- lowed by simultaneous digestion and absorption over a much longer duration [20]. The anticipation and inges- tion phases, mediated by the sympathetic nervous sys- tem [4], increase cardiac output, blood pressure, heart rate and splanchnic and renal vascular resistance, and decrease carotid artery resistance, with a variable re- sponse in skeletal muscle and skin vascular resistance depending on the initial status of the individual [4, 5, 31]. The cardiovascular components of the digestion and absorption stages begin as the stomach ®lls with chyme and typically coincide with the end of anticipa- tion and ingestion [7, 20]. Digestion and absorption of nutrients from the intestine produce segment-speci®c increases in blood ¯ow that persist as long as chyme remains in that intestinal segment [7, 32]. In this way, blood ¯ow increases ®rst to the stomach, then to the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum in order, as the chyme passes through the gastrointestinal tract over time (Fig. 3). The increase in ¯ow to the digestive organs is compensated by both a decrease in ¯ow to other organs (skeletal muscle and perhaps skin) and an increase in cardiac output [4, 33]. The occurrence of both events is suggested, since renal blood ¯ow also increases follow- ing absorption of a protein-rich meal [5]. FIG. 3. Descriptive summary of the results from numerous studies depicting the cardiovascular responses during postprandial hyper- emia. Blood ¯ow increases in speci®c organs as digestive chyme reaches that organ. Indications along the time axis mark the point at which the chyme reaches the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum to initiate the metabolically mediated digestion and absorption stages of postprandial hyperemia. 185MATHESON, WILSON, AND GARRISON: REGULATION OF INTESTINAL BLOOD FLOW Chou and Coatney [20] systematically analyzed the potency of various nutrients to stimulate postprandial hyperemia. These experiments ®rst demonstrated that the liquid phase of the luminal contents of predigested, mixed-composition meals were responsible for the in- creased ¯ow, even in the absence of a solid phase [6, 7, 34]. In contrast to this ®nding, the placement of a liquid saline solution or the solid phase of a predigested meal alone did not produce hyperemia [7, 34]. These ®ndings suggested that the compound(s) responsible for postprandial hyperemia exists in the hydrolytic products of food digestion. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying these phenomena, investiga- tors analyzed the ability of individual nutrients in the liquid phase to produce increased intestinal blood ¯ow, as measured by the radiolabeled microsphere tech- nique in isolated and/or intact canine intestine. Based on those studies, the single most potent nutrient-mediator of intestinal hyperemia when ad- ministered alone is glucose [29, 35±39], and glucose- induced ileal hyperemia is attenuated by the presence of bile salts [6, 29, 30]. However, glucose-induced jeju- nal hyperemia is not affected by the addition of bile to the intestinal injectate [6, 29]. Next in degree of po- tency are various long-chain fatty acids such as oleic acid and caproic acid. When administered to isolated intestinal segments alone, oleic acid produces a mild hyperemia, but a mixture of oleic acid and bile pro- duces the greatest increase in ¯ow, surpassing that of mixed glucose and bile in the ileum [6, 28 ±30]. Bile interacts with lipids in the intestinal lumen to form lipid micelles, the absorption of which is thought to provide the potency of lipid/bile mixtures to produce increased ¯ow [6, 29, 39]. Proteins and products of protein digestion are the least potent in producing increased intestinal ¯ow states, especially when ad- ministered in the physiological amounts that are present during the digestion of a high-protein meal [6, 39]. However, certain amino acids are known to cause vasodilation in the intestinal circulation. The amino acids glutamine, aspartate, and glycine produce hyper- emia when administered to the lumen of isolated in- testinal segments at pharmacological doses [6, 29, 39]. Other studies show that luminal distention, mechani- cal mucosal stimulation alone, and extrinsic innerva- tion by either sympathetic or parasympathetic neurons are not required for hyperemia to occur [6, 40]. POTENTIAL MECHANISMS FOR POSTPRANDIAL HYPEREMIA Several factors have been proposed as potential me- diators of postprandial hyperemia. The classi®cation system of Chou and Coatney [20] subdivides potential mediators into ®ve broad categories: direct effects of absorbed nutrients, enteric nervous system effects and re¯exes, gastrointestinal hormones and peptides, local nonmetabolic vasoactive mediators, and local meta- bolic vasoactive mediators. Involvement of components from each of the ®ve categories has support in the literature as contributing to the complex mechanisms of postprandial hyperemia. It is interesting to note that all of the proposed mech- anisms of nutrient absorption and transport require increased oxygen delivery. Bohlen [41, 42] demon- strated that intestinal villus PO2 decreased from 15±20 mm Hg in unfed rats to less than 5 mm Hg during nutrient-induced hyperemia. Other studies show that lipid micelles, carbohydrates, and amino acids use ox- ygen for absorptive metabolism. Lipid micelle trans- port requires the largest increase in oxygen delivery [42± 46] followed by sodium-linked absorption of carbo- hydrates and di- and tripeptides and amino acids [41, 42]. In contrast to these oxygen-dependent phenom- ena, villus lymph and interstitial ¯uid osmolarities increase from resting, unfed levels of 400 mOsm to 600 mOsm or more during the absorption of nutrients [16, 47]. Studies [12, 35] show increased diameters of in¯ow A1 and A2 arterioles and increased arteriolar ¯ow in response to the injection of hyperosmolar solutions into submucosal arcade lymph vessels, which might involve nitric oxide [48]. Conversely, intraluminal injections of isosmotic solutions have no effect on blood ¯ow [12, 35]. The ®ndings of these studies have led to the hypothesis that both oxygen-dependent and osmolarity-dependent metabolic mechanisms contribute to the initiation, de- velopment, and maintenance of postprandial hyper- emia. DIRECT EFFECTS OF ABSORBED NUTRIENTS Some nutrients in the chyme are themselves vasodi- lators in the intestinal microcirculation, such that suf- ®cient quantities of these compounds can produce va- sodilation after they enter the circulation. Intraarterial injection of carbohydrates including glucose and most amino acids does not alter microvascular ¯ow in the intestine [27]. However, micellar solutions, which con- tain bile and oleic acid, caproic acid, or taurocholate, increase ¯ow in the jejunal circulation when adminis- tered intraarterially [28], as can bile salts alone [30]. In addition to lipid micelles and some amino acids, lumi- nal carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions can diffuse across the intestinal epithelial barrier directly to initi- ate metabolic autoregulation of blood ¯ow in the intes- tinal microvessels [33, 49]. ENTERIC NERVOUS SYSTEM EFFECTS AND REFLEXES The potential role of the enteric nervous system in postprandial hyperemia is not clear, since it has been well demonstrated that extrinsic sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation is not required for post- prandial hyperemia [40, 45, 50]. However, the role of 186 JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH: VOL. 93, NO. 1, SEPTEMBER 2000 nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurons cannot be ex- cluded because some studies have shown that stimula- tion of mucosal mechanoreceptors enhances a glucose- induced increase in intestinal blood ¯ow [27, 40, 51]. Also, the topical anesthetic dibucaine can block glucose-induced and oleic acid-induced hyperemia, pre- sumably because dibucaine prevents epithelial cell up- take of glucose and oleic acid micelles by altering mem- brane ¯uidity [40]. Capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons (C-®bers) that release neurotransmitters such as cholecystokinin (CCK), substance P, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) might also be involved, since capsaicin and lidocaine can prevent the jejunal hyperemia that is associated with micelle absorption [52]. This latter mechanism is credible since VIP re- lease has been demonstrated in response to placement of oleic acid± bile micelles into the jejunum [53]. GASTROINTESTINAL HORMONES AND PEPTIDES A number of gastrointestinal hormones have vasoac- tive properties, but their involvement in postprandial hyperemia is not clear because the levels that have been measured experimentally are lower than the min- imum doses required to produce vasodilation [20]. Gas- trin, VIP, CCK, substance P, secretin, gastric inhibi- tory polypeptide (GIP), neurotensin, calcitonin-gene related peptide a (CGRP-a), glucagon, enkephalins, somatostatin, and peptide YY do not appear to have a role in postprandial hyperemia at physiological doses [53±56]. On the other hand, it is possible that local sites in the intestine might experience suf®cient levels of these compounds to produce a controlled local effect, but such phenomena have not been demonstrated to date. Thus, on a whole-organ scale, these compounds probably are not involved in nutrient-induced absorp- tive hyperemia. LOCAL NONMETABOLIC VASOACTIVE MEDIATORS The small intestine is capable of releasing serotonin [57], histamine [58], bradykinin [59], and prostaglan- dins [51, 60 ± 62] in response to a wide range of physi- ological and pathophysiological stimuli. These media- tors might enhance, diminish, or have no effect on nutrient-induced absorptive hyperemia, depending on the initial state of the animal and the presence of arachidonic acid in the intestinal chyme. For example, blockade of cyclooxygenase to prevent intermediate formation of prostanoid vasoconstrictors (thromboxane A2 or prostaglandin F2a) enhances nutrient-induced hy- peremia in normal canine jejunum [63± 65], while ara- chidonate loading inhibits the hyperemia [63± 65]. Pro- stanoid synthesis occurs in the jejunum [66], and following placement of predigested food into the intes- tinal lumen, prostaglandin (PG) synthesis increases (PGE2 . PGI2 . thromboxane A2 . PGF2a) [51]. How- ever, the exact role of these autocoid mediators proba- bly depends on other factors [51] such as the relative balance of prostanoid vasoconstrictors and vasodila- tors at rest and stimuli for the gut to produce hista- mine, bradykinin, or serotonin. Histamine, bradykinin, and serotonin (at low concentrations) are potent vaso- dilators in the intestinal microcirculation, and hista- mine blockade of H1 but not H2 receptors diminishes the hyperemic response to the placement of predi- gested food in the jejunum [67]. LOCAL METABOLIC VASOACTIVE MEDIATORS As previously noted, intestinal blood ¯ow is precisely regulated via metabolic mechanisms to provide the right amount of blood ¯ow for the metabolic needs of the tissue [10, 37, 68]. In fact, most if not all of the mechanisms of intestinal blood ¯ow regulation alter the oxygen use by tissues involved in nutrient absorp- tion. In general, any mechanism that increases the amount of hyperemia also increases the oxygen debt of the villi, while those mechanisms that diminish hyper- emia result in less oxygen uptake and utilization. Thus, it is dif®cult to disentangle such a complex rela- tionship, but the current paradigm suggests that oxy- gen uptake and tissue PO2 are the initial mediators of postprandial hyperemia. In addition to PO2 and tissue osmolarity, other met- abolic products increase in the intestine during post- prandial hyperemia, in particular hydrogen ions [69 ± 71] and adenosine [72±75]. Adenosine is a ubiquitous vasodilator that occupies a unique position in most metabolic processes as a component in energy storage in the form of adenosine trisphosphate (ATP) and also in the key second messenger system of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). During the process of energy- dependent sodium-linked absorption of carbohydrates or amino acids by the epithelium, adenosine is released into the villus interstitial space and portal circulation. It is known that adenosine is transiently increased in the portal circulation during the ®rst 3 to 11 min im- mediately preceding the increased blood ¯ow and oxy- gen uptake by the mucosal tissue [75]. Other studies [76 ±79] also support the ®nding that adenosine is an important mediator of nutrient-induced hyperemia. Recently, the role of nitric oxide (NO) as a key reg- ulator of intestinal motility, ¯uid balance, and electro- lyte absorption has been demonstrated [80 ± 82]. These ®ndings have prompted the investigation of a potential role for nitric oxide in postprandial hyperemia. NO is a potent endothelium-derived vasodilator that directly enters vascular smooth muscle cells to induce relax- ation. Our studies [83] have demonstrated that glucose-induced premucosal arteriolar vasodilation in the rat ileum is competitively blocked by L-v- nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME), which inhibits both constitutive (NOS-3) and inducible (NOS-2) nitric 187MATHESON, WILSON, AND GARRISON: REGULATION OF INTESTINAL BLOOD FLOW oxide synthase enzyme isoforms. Thus, in a rodent model NO appears to be essential for premucosal arte- riolar dilation during topical glucose exposure. These observations, along with studies that document aden- osine involvement in nutrient-induced intestinal hy- peremia, suggest a possible relationship between the two compounds. We have recently studied the role of adenosine in the generation of elevated nitric oxide metabolite (NOX) levels in response to intestinal epithelial nutrient ex- posure [84]. Adenosine A2a and A2b are G-protein- associated transmembrane receptors, which produce vasodilation via increased intracellular cAMP levels by activation of adenylate cyclase [85]. Thus, adenosine receptors might also be capable of increasing intracel- lular Ca21 via phospholipase C activation with subse- quent in¯ux of extracellular Ca21. Numerous studies [86 ±92] suggest a synergistic relationship between adenosine and nitric oxide. Recent experiments dem- onstrate that intragastric glucose placement increases portal NO metabolite levels and that adenosine A2 receptors are required for this glucose-induced NO re- sponse [84]. Adenosine A2b receptor activation is es- sential for portal vein NO elevation, while adenosine A2a receptor activation appears to augment or second- arily regulate portal NOX production [unpublished data]. Gastric gavage with L-glutamine also resulted in increased portal nitric oxide metabolite levels depen- dent on adenosine A2b receptors, while oleic acid ga- vage and racemic glycine gavage had no effect on portal NO metabolite levels [84]. These studies implicate the existence of an adenosine±nitric oxide signaling mech- anism in the glucose- or glutamine-induced generation of postprandial hyperemia (Fig. 4). This signaling mechanism might involve Na1-linked, secondary ac- tive transport mechanisms, since both D-glucose and L-glutamine are absorbed in this way. PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL ALTERATIONS IN THE CONTROL OF INTESTINAL BLOOD FLOW A number of pathophysiological conditions exist that alter intestinal macro- and microcirculatory regulatory mechanisms such that these alterations in intestinal blood ¯ow could contribute to the genesis or mainte- nance of the disease processes. The mechanisms that produce these conditions are dif®cult to elucidate be- cause of the involvement of many physiological sys- tems and mediators with multiple effects in different organ systems. The remainder of this review summa- rizes the pathological alterations associated with reg- ulation of microvascular tone in the conditions of septic FIG. 4. Schematic overview of the proposed mechanism of adenosine-mediated nitric oxide release during postprandial hyperemia. Brie¯y, this diagram summarizes the Na1-linked absorption of glucose, which is thought to increase ATP utilization and stimulate the production of the potent metabolic and paracrine vasodilators adenosine and nitric oxide. 188 JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH: VOL. 93, NO. 1, SEPTEMBER 2000 shock, hemorrhagic shock, cardiogenic shock, and por- tal hypertension. The effect of mechanical bowel ob- struction on the intestinal microvasculature has not been studied by intravital microcirculatory methods and is therefore not included in this review. SEPTIC SHOCK Infectious shock in humans is often characterized by an early hyperdynamic, high-cardiac-output phase fol- lowed by a delayed hypodynamic, low-cardiac-output period, and can sometimes lead to multiple-organ dys- function syndrome (MODS) and death [93]. In labora- tory models of systemic septicemia or bacteremia, the gut has been implicated as the motor or generator of MODS [93, 94]. The gut might contribute to the pro- gression of MODS by a combination of gut-associated immune alterations [95] and impairment of intestinal blood ¯ow during systemic in¯ammation. If mucosal blood ¯ow decreases below a critical level for cellular viability, free radical generation, cytokine production, and perhaps the loss of tissue integrity and mucosal barrier function can occur [96]. In hyperdynamic shock states, mucosal vascular perfusion appears to be com- promised, despite decreased total peripheral resistance and increased cardiac performance [97]. Hinshaw [98] reviewed the myriad microcirculatory changes that oc- cur following sepsis, including impaired coagulation status, diminished red blood cell deformability, in- creased microvascular permeability and subsequent tissue edema, altered distribution of blood ¯ow, altered microvascular responses to adrenergic mediators (smooth muscle function), and impaired endothelial cell function. The endothelial cell occupies a central position in the cascade of events that lead to impaired vascular function during bacteremia or septicemia, and a number of vasoactive compounds with altered regulation during sepsis have been identi®ed. This re- view focuses on arachidonic acid metabolites, cyto- kines, oxygen-derived free radicals (ODFRs), endothe- lin 1, platelet-activating factor, adrenomedullin, and nitric oxide. Using intravital videomicroscopy techniques, Gosche et al. [99] examined the involvement of arachidonic acid metabolites in the microvascular alterations of infection. The authors found that Escherichia coli bac- teremia increases cardiac output and decreases intes- tinal blood ¯ow secondary to arteriolar and venular constriction. Cyclooxygenase blockade with mefen- emate does not improve arteriolar diameters or blood ¯ow, but profoundly dilates venules, suggesting that microvascular control mechanisms in response to a septic challenge vary considerably, not only by organ system, but also by distal-to-proximal position in the arteriolar and venular vascular trees. Clearly, experi- mental sepsis models produce intestinal microvascular vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion [100 ±102]. This phenomenon might lead to the generation of ODFRs and altered cytokine production. Using intravital videomicroscopy techniques, Krysztopik et al. [103] have recently demonstrated protection against intra- venous E. coli-induced intestinal arteriolar vasocon- striction and hypoperfusion [103] and impaired renal blood ¯ow [104] by intravenous lazaroid antioxidant that protectively scavenges ODFRs and prevents lipid radical chain reactions. The vasoconstriction in both in¯ow and premucosal arterioles was prevented with- out altering the hyperdynamic cardiac response, sug- gesting that local intestinal ODFR production might play a role in the intestinal microvascular sequelae following a bacteremic challenge. Endothelins are potent vasoconstrictor polypeptides with a range of other effects, including control of renal function; neuroendocrine stimulation of atrial natri- uretic peptide, renin, aldosterone, and catecholamines; and control of gastrointestinal blood ¯ow. Endothelin 1 gene expression is upregulated in a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture [105], and in a rat model of E. coli bacteremia using intravital videomicroscopy, endothelin 1 is implicated in the shift toward a more tonically constricted state [106]. The upregulation and expression of adhesion molecules (or cytokines) [107] with altered neutrophil traf®cking and subsequent capillary and/or postcapillary venule plugging consti- tute another endothelial-dependent mechanism that might contribute to impaired intestinal blood ¯ow. These changes could further contribute to hypoxic con- ditions that could stimulate free radical formation and proin¯ammatory cytokine production. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is another potential mediator of blood ¯ow that has been shown to be up- regulated during infection [108, 109]. Bar-Natan et al. [110] compared the microvascular events of early E. coli bacteremia in the absence and presence of the PAF receptor antagonist WEB2086 with direct topical ap- plication of PAF on the intestinal surface in intravital videomicroscopy experiments. A decrease in arteriolar in¯ow and venular out¯ow was noted in both sepsis and PAF-treated groups with spatially discrete areas of venular constriction in the group treated with topi- cal PAF. Application of the PAF receptor antagonist prevents the sepsis-induced vasoconstriction and re- duction in blood ¯ow in both the PAF-treated group and the infected group. Recent studies [111±114] suggest that adrenomedul- lin, a potent vasodilatory peptide derived from endo- thelial cells, might play an early role in the develop- ment of both increased cardiac output and decreased total peripheral resistance during the early hyperdy- namic phase of septic shock. These studies [113] dem- onstrate increased levels of adrenomedullin in the se- rum of rats 2 h after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) associated with elevated levels of adrenomedullin 189MATHESON, WILSON, AND GARRISON: REGULATION OF INTESTINAL BLOOD FLOW mRNA in the small intestine, the left ventricle, and the thoracic aorta [111, 113]. The time course observed in this expression pattern correlates well with the previ- ously described cardiovascular phases of septic shock [114]. Additionally, adrenomedullin blockade with spe- ci®c anti-rat adrenomedullin antibodies prevents the development of the hyperdynamic phase of sepsis and normalized microvascular blood ¯ow 5 h after the onset of CLP [112]. Direct intravital videomicroscopy studies to examine the contribution of adrenomedullin to mi- crovascular tone in the intestinal microcirculation have not been reported. Animal studies demonstrate that nitric oxide is chronically elevated during infection and that NO syn- thase blockade might improve survival rate [115]. However, early videomicroscopy studies [116, 117] sug- gest that NO blockade during acute E. coli bacteremia worsens microvascular constriction and hypoperfusion. The effect of continued overexpression of NO on endo- thelial and vascular smooth muscle cells is not clear [118]. Vascular ring studies have shown decreased re- activity of large conduit blood vessels after prolonged infectious exposure [119 ±121]. Spain et al. [122] ad- dressed this issue by studying in vivo intestinal micro- vascular responses shortly after intravenous E. coli infusion and observed impaired magnitude and fre- quency of vasomotion, a normally occurring rhythmic process of dilation and contraction, in both in¯ow and premucosal arterioles. Topical application of acetylcho- line partially restores the vasomotor activity of the premucosal arterioles and fully restores the vasomo- tion of the in¯ow arterioles. There is no change in sensitivity or reactivity of endothelium-dependent re- laxation to acetylcholine or endothelium-independent relaxation to nitroprusside during bacteremia. How- ever, constriction with norepinephrine is impaired in bacteremia in both in¯ow and premucosal arterioles, suggesting that acute bacteremia causes both endothe- lial alterations (vasomotion) and vascular smooth mus- cle cell changes (a-adrenergic constriction). HEMORRHAGIC SHOCK Resuscitated hemorrhagic shock in the absence of any infectious challenge or other complication can re- sult in death, despite the restoration of cardiac perfor- mance and central hemodynamic variables. In the in- testinal circulation resuscitated hemorrhagic shock produces vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion in a fash- ion similar to that previously described for septic shock [123]. The endothelial cell appears to play a pivotal role in the development of this low-¯ow condition. The in- terpretation of laboratory studies of vascular function following resuscitated hemorrhagic shock has been complicated by the use of a wide range of experimental hemorrhagic shock models and protocols. Different methods of hemorrhage signi®cantly alter the develop- ment, severity, and outcome of the hemorrhage. Studies by Chaudry and co-workers [124] and others [123, 125, 126] reveal that microvascular blood ¯ow in the liver, small intestine, kidneys, spleen, and skeletal muscle are signi®cantly impaired, despite the restora- tion of central venous pressure and central hemody- namic parameters of cardiac function and arterial pressure. Numerous studies [123±126] establish that intestinal microvascular blood ¯ow is signi®cantly im- paired following hemorrhage and resuscitation, despite the con®rmation of adequate ¯uid resuscitation by the measurement of cardiac performance and blood pres- sure. Intravital videomicroscopy studies indicate that diameters of in¯ow and premucosal arterioles return to normal values immediately following resuscitation, but arteriolar constriction progressively worsens thereafter with an accompanying decrease in blood ¯ow. Spain et al. [127] demonstrate impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine in these vessels, as well as histologic injury and neutro- phil in¯ux and impaired nitric oxide synthase function, but no apparent oxidant injury. Furthermore, these changes are prevented or diminished by the blockade of the complement cascade with soluble complement re- ceptor treatment prior to resuscitation. The mecha- nism of this microvascular protection is not known, but it might involve protection of endothelial cell function and/or decreased neutrophil activation and in¯ux. Several studies [128, 129] show that pentoxifylline administration during and after resuscitation im- proves microvascular tissue perfusion. Pentoxifylline has a wide range of therapeutic bene®ts after hemor- rhage and resuscitation, which include improved car- diac performance and intestinal and renal microvascu- lar blood ¯ow. Pentoxifylline is thought to improve these conditions by one of its myriad effects, including increased red blood cell deformability, endothelial cell membrane ¯uidity, and altered neutrophil activity and cytokine production. It is not known which of these functions produces the improvement in microvascular blood ¯ow, or if all of the effects are necessary for microvascular perfusion to be restored to prehemor- rhage levels. In addition to pentoxifylline and soluble complement receptor, heparan sulfate [125] and chemically modi- ®ed heparin [130], which are heparin analogues with little or no anticoagulant activity, also appear to re- store microvascular blood ¯ow after centrally resusci- tated hemorrhagic shock. These agents appear to sim- ilarly protect the endothelial cell membrane after hemorrhagic shock, suggesting that the endothelium plays a central role in the pathogenesis of altered vas- cular responsiveness to resuscitated hemorrhagic shock. 190 JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH: VOL. 93, NO. 1, SEPTEMBER 2000 CARDIOGENIC SHOCK Alterations in microvascular control mechanisms during low-cardiac-output cardiogenic shock have not been extensively studied by microcirculation research methods. However, Bulkley et al. [131, 132] have clearly demonstrated that a porcine model of cardio- genic shock (pericardial tamponade induced by 10% dextran injection into the pericardial cavity) signi®- cantly increases celiac artery resistance, compared with either baseline or total peripheral resistance, by an angiotensin II-mediated mechanism. In these stud- ies, the addition of captopril, an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor, selectively prevents the increase in celiac artery resistance, while the addition of angiotensin II in normal pigs mimics many of the changes seen with pericardial tamponade. Two addi- tional studies have examined microvascular blood ¯ow using laser Doppler ¯owmetry in similar porcine mod- els of cardiogenic shock induced by pericardial tampon- ade. In the ®rst [133], investigators found diminished microvascular blood ¯ow in the mesentery that per- sisted throughout the experimental protocol. Treat- ment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor after the onset of cardiogenic shock restored mesen- teric microvascular blood ¯ow to near-normal levels. A second study [134] examined the effectiveness of pul- satile blood ¯ow during low-cardiac-output shock at maintaining microvascular perfusion as assessed by laser Doppler ¯owmetry. Pulsatile blood ¯ow main- tained microcirculatory perfusion better than the non- pulsatile perfusion. These latter ®ndings suggest a po- tential role of endothelial cell derangement with impaired perfusion and decreased tissue oxygenation during cardiogenic shock secondary to systemic alter- ations in the renin±angiotensin system. PORTAL HYPERTENSION A number of elegant studies have examined the mi- crocirculatory effects of portal hypertension on the in- testinal and gastric circulations. Benoit and Granger [135] have described a model of portal venous hyper- tension using chronic graded stenosis of the portal vein that produces portal hypertension and slightly de- creased systemic pressures resulting in increased cen- terline red blood cell velocity in in¯ow A1 arterioles with no change in A1 diameter. While this model pro- duced no difference in A1 or A2 diameters or ¯ow, the A3 arterioles displayed signi®cantly elevated pressure that was carried through to the out¯ow V1 veins. The increased intestinal microvascular pressure associated with portal hypertension is caused by both reduced arteriolar resistance to ¯ow and venous congestion from impaired portal vein drainage. Tarnawski et al. [136] also demonstrated altered gastric mucosal archi- tecture (compressed cytosolic area of endothelial cells, increased pinocytotic vesicle area, and increased thick- ness of the capillary basement membrane) by trans- mission electron microscopy after staged ligation of the portal vein. Further studies [137] to examine the gas- tric microvascular alterations to portal hypertension demonstrate a biphasic response in gastric vessel di- ameter, ¯ow, and wall thickness. By Day 15 after por- tal vein constriction, the vessels were severely dilated with decreased wall thickness and impaired ¯ow. Later studies by Joh et al. [138] revealed signi®- cantly increased vascular reactivity to norepinephrine after staged prehepatic portal vein stenosis in the in- ¯ow arterioles of rat intestine, while the transitional A2 and premucosal A3 arterioles showed decreased reactivity to norepinephrine. However, these alter- ations in a-adrenergic reactivity did not alter the di- ameters of the in¯ow arterioles. The contribution of norepinephrine, vasopressin, and angiotensin II to resting tone in the intestine is altered after chronic portal hypertension. Norepinephrine primarily con- tributes to resting vascular tone in the A3 arterioles in portal hypertension, while vasopressin contributes pri- marily to A1 tone and angiotensin II contributes only to A3 tone. Circulating levels of vasopressin and angio- tensin II are increased, suggesting that the increased contribution of these mediators to resting tone might be related to increased production rather than in- creased receptor sensitivity. To examine the pathogen- esis of the impaired reactivity to norepinephrine fol- lowing portal hypertension, Wu and Benoit [139] compared norepinephrine reactivity after acute or chronic portal hypertension, sham operation, or porto- caval shunting. Norepinephrine receptor reactivity is altered in a biphasic pattern in acute (decreased NE reactivity) versus chronic portal hypertensive (in- creased NE reactivity) animals. Additionally, the por- tocaval shunt animals exhibit increased reactivity to a-adrenergic stimulation, suggesting that the alter- ations in adrenergic reactivity might be due to redis- tribution of microvascular blood ¯ow rather than to the elevated microvascular pressures previously observed in the A3 arterioles through the V1 venules. Recent studies [140] examined the deleterious micro- vascular effects of propranolol, which is often used in the treatment of cirrhotic hypertension, on the intesti- nal microcirculation and demonstrated that the cardio- vascular actions of propranolol were caused primarily by b2-adrenergic blockade. In a rat model of progres- sive prehepatic portal venous shunting, propranolol treatment resulted in microvascular vasoconstriction and reduced blood ¯ow, which was manifested in both normals and portal hypertensive animals. These changes were reversed with phentolamine treatment, indicating b2-adrenergic receptor involvement in the propranolol-induced vasoconstriction. Wu and Benoit [141] also studied the involvement of the cAMP and 191MATHESON, WILSON, AND GARRISON: REGULATION OF INTESTINAL BLOOD FLOW cGMP second-messenger pathways in the altered reac- tivity to norepinephrine from portal hypertension. These studies involved the blockade of cAMP- dependent protein kinase A by the addition of Rp- cAMPS, a cAMP analogue, or the blockade of cGMP via LY-83583. Rp-cAMPS had no effect on microvascular parameters in normal animals, but during portal hy- pertension PKA blockade signi®cantly decreased A1 blood ¯ow and restored norepinephrine reactivity. On the other hand, guanylate cyclase blockade had no effect on any measured variable in normal or portal hypertensive animals. Therefore, portal hypertension appears to impair norepinephrine reactivity via cAMP- dependent alterations in the intestinal microvascula- ture. NUTRIENT ABSORPTION AND SHOCK Several studies [142±145] suggest that nutrient ex- posure and/or absorption in the gastrointestinal sys- tem improves outcome in some pathophysiological con- ditions. Numerous investigators have proposed that certain nutrients such as L-glutamine, L-arginine, v-3 fatty acids, and RNA fragments, when administered enterally, provide more therapeutic bene®t than the same nutrients applied intravenously. These ®ndings have led to the use of terms such as immunonutrition and immune-enhancing enteral diet, since these nutri- ents are thought to directly feed immune cells, partic- ularly those found in gut-associated lymphoid tissue. An alternative hypothesis to explain some of the ben- e®ts of early enteral feeding is that these nutrients might provide a greater stimulus to enhance mucosal blood ¯ow during nutrient absorption than isocaloric, isonitrogenous control diets that do not contain these nutrients. The maintenance of mucosal perfusion might then serve to protect intestinal epithelial cell function as well as mucosal microvascular endothelial cell oxygenation. Traditionally, intravital microscopy studies have used glucose-free bath or suffusate solu- tions to avoid the effects of nutrient exposure on intes- tinal microvascular control. Only two studies have ex- amined the role of nutrient absorption on intestinal microvascular blood ¯ow in shock states [126, 146] using intravital microscopy methods. The ®rst study found that glucose exposure and/or absorption main- tained intestinal blood ¯ow during E. coli bacteremia and the second found that glucose protected intestinal blood ¯ow following resuscitated hemorrhage. As sug- gested previously [84], this protection might involve the generation of adenosine and/or nitric oxide during the nutrient absorption process, both of which are pow- erful vasodilators that could increase mucosal blood ¯ow. SUMMARY Intestinal blood ¯ow is regulated to provide adequate blood ¯ow to maintain the supply of oxygen and essen- tial nutrients to the tissue and to remove waste prod- ucts. The predominate mechanisms at rest involve metabolic control by oxygen, H1, and carbon dioxide as well as other metabolic regulators such as lactate and adenosine. The placement of nutrients into the intes- tinal lumen initiates nutrient-dependent hyperemic mechanisms, which appear to be initiated by the gen- eration of mucosal oxygen debt due to increased met- abolic activity during nutrient absorption. Glucose, the most potent single mediator of postprandial hyper- emia, appears to initiate a mechanism that involves adenosine-mediated NO production. Various patho- physiological conditions appear to produce endothelial cell dysfunction via different mechanisms that result in impaired mucosal microvascular blood ¯ow. Many of these alterations seem to involve the endothelial cell membrane, and treatments that protect this mem- brane might provide protection against impaired mi- crovascular blood ¯ow and tissue hypoxia. In certain conditions, nutrient absorption early after traumatic injury might play a protective part in the maintenance of intestinal blood ¯ow, endothelial cell stability and mucosal barrier function.
