The gold standard technique for estimating Ra is the use of a multitracer oral glucose protocol. However, this technique is complex and is usually not convenient for large studies. Alternatively, a simpler approach based on the glucose-insulin minimal model is available. The main drawback of this last approach is that it also requires a gastrointestinal model, something that may lead to identifiability problems. Methods: In this article, we present an alternative, easy-to-use method based on the glucose-insulin minimal model for estimation of Ra. This new technique avoids complex experimental protocols by only requiring data from a standard meal tolerance test. Unlike other model-based approaches, this new approach does not require a gastrointestinal model, which leads to a much simpler solution. Furthermore, this novel technique requires the identification of only one parameter of the minimal model because the rest of the model parameters are considered to have small variability. In order to account for such variability as well as to account for errors associated to measurements, interval analysis has been employed. Results: The current technique has been validated using data from a United States Food and Drug Administration- accepted type 1 diabetes simulator [root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.77] and successfully tested with two clinical data sets from the literature (RMSE = 0.69). Conclusions: The presented technique for the estimation of Ra showed excellent results when tested with simulated and actual clinical data. The simplicity of this new technique makes it suitable for large clinical research studies for the evaluation of the role of Ra in patients with impairments in glucose metabolism. In addition, this technique is being used to build a model library of mixed meals that could be incorporated into diabetic subject simulators in order to account for more realistic and varied meals. J Diabetes Sci Technol 2012;6(1):153-162 ORIGINAL ARTICLE 154 A Simple Robust Method for Estimating the Glucose Rate of Appearance from Mixed Meals Herrero www.journalofdst.orgJ Diabetes Sci Technol Vol 6, Issue 1, January 2012 Introduction Estimating the rate of glucose appearance (Ra) into the systemic circulation after ingestion of a mixed meal may be highly valuable in diabetes management as well as in other pathophysiological states (e.g., abnormalities of glucose absorption). For instance, in the context of an artificial pancreas, 1 it is of great importance to estimate the contribution of the ingestion of a mixed meal into the overall glucose kinetics because an accurate prediction of plasma glucose is crucial to the performance of most glucose controllers.2 The gold standard technique for estimating prior Ra is the use of a multitracer oral glucose protocol.3 However, this technique is complex and usually not convenient for large studies (e.g., screening studies). Alternatively, a simpler approach 4 based on the glucose-insulin minimal model 5 is available. This approach only requires plasma glucose and plasma insulin data acquired from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or meal tolerance test (MTT). The main drawback of this approach is that it requires a gastrointestinal absorption model coupled to the minimal model of glucose disappearance, which leads to a large number of model parameters that need to be identified. This problem is usually overcome by using sophisticated parameter identification techniques (e.g., Bayesian estimation), which usually require a number of assumptions over the parameters (e.g., probability distribution). In this article, a novel minimal model approach for estimating Ra is proposed. The main advantage of this new approach is that it does not require a gastrointestinal model. This difference leads to a much simpler solution because complex parameter identification techniques are not required. This technique provides an estimate of Ra, which can then be used to fit the model parameters for any existing gastrointestinal models. 6–9 The proposed approach for estimating Ra requires only the identification of insulin sensitivity (SI) from the minimal model because it is based on the hypothesis that the rest of the model parameters can be considered to vary in relatively small ranges. This hypothesis is based on the experimental evidence that the intersubject variability of these parameters is not very big.3 In order to validate this hypothesis, interval analysis 10 was employed to obtain a robust estimation of Ra accounting for the intersubject variability on the model parameters. Furthermore, interval analysis also allows accounting for the errors associated with the measurements. For estimating SI, the existing formula proposed by Caumo and colleagues 11 could be used. However, the procedure to obtain this formula requires an assumption on the shape of the Ra, which may not be suitable for our approach because estimating Ra is the objective. For this reason, we present a new formula for estimating SI that does not require any assumption on the Ra profile. To validate the technique, a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-accepted University of Virginia (UVa) simulator of subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) 12 has been employed to generate the required data. Furthermore, the new methodology has been tested using clinical data obtained from the literature. 4,13 Methods Minimal Model of Glucose Disappearance The minimal model of glucose disappearance from a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test is widely used to assess SI and glucose effectiveness (SG) in physiological, pathophysiological, and epidemiological studies. 14 The minimal model is represented by the equations Ġ(t) = –[SG + X(t)]G(t) + SGGb + Ra(t) V (1) Ẋ(t) = –p2X(t) + p2SI[I(t) – Ib] (2) where G(mg/dl) is plasma glucose concentration with G(0) = Gb; I (μU/ml) is plasma insulin concentration with I(0) = Ib, where suffix b denotes basal values; X is insulin action on glucose production and disposal with X(0) = 0; V (dl/kg) is the distribution volume; and SG (min -1), SI (min -1 per μU/ml), and p2 (min -1) are model parameters. Specifically, SG (min -1) is the fractional (i.e., per unit distribution volume) glucose effectiveness, which measures glucose ability per se to promote glucose disposal and inhibit glucose production; SI is insulin sensitivity; p2 is the rate constant describing the dynamics of insulin action; and Ra (mg/min) is the rate of glucose appearance. 155 A Simple Robust Method for Estimating the Glucose Rate of Appearance from Mixed Meals Herrero www.journalofdst.orgJ Diabetes Sci Technol Vol 6, Issue 1, January 2012 Glucose Rate of Appearance Estimation From Equation (1), Ra can be isolated as follows: Ra(t) = [Ġ(t) + [SG + X(t)]G(t) – SGGb]V (3) In order to evaluate Equation (3), a number of assumptions need to be made. As discussed in detail by Dalla Man and collegues,3 one can assume mean population values for parameters V, p2, and SG because their interpatient variability is not very large. On the other hand, the variability of SI is much larger, and this parameter needs to be individualized for each subject. The following assumption can be made if the duration of the OGTT/MTT experiment is long enough to consider that the ingested carbohydrate has been fully absorbed: ∫ T 0Ra(t)dt = fD (4) where f (unitless) is carbohydrate bioavailability (i.e., fraction of carbohydrate absorbed), D (mg) is the amount of ingested carbohydrates, and T (min) is the duration of the experiment. By replacing Equation (3) into Equation (4), ∫ T 0 ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ Ġ(t) + [SG + X(t)]G(t) – SGGb⎛⎜⎝Vdt = fD (5) Defining I’(t) as [I(t) – Ib], Equation (2) becomes Ẋ(t) = –p2X(t) + p2SII’(t) (6) which, by applying the Laplace transform, can be expressed as X(s) I’(s) = SI p2 s + p2 (7) The impulse response of Equation (7) is z –1 ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ X(s) I’(s)⎧⎨⎩ = SI p2e–p2t (8) and solution of Equation (6), for X(0) = 0, is expressed by the convolution integral X(t) = SI ∫ t 0 p2e–p2t I’(t - t)dt (9) By replacing Equation (9) into Equation (5), ∫ T 0Ġ(t)dt + ∫ T 0 SGG(t)dt + S1 ∫ T 0 ⎡ ⎜ ⎣ ∫ t 0 p2e–p2t I’(t - t)dt⎡⎜⎣G(t)dt – ∫ T 0 SGGbdt = fD V (10) By isolating SI from Equation (10), SI = fD V – ∫ T 0Ġ(t)dt – ∫ T 0SGG(t)dt + ∫ T 0SGGbdt ∫ T 0 ⎡ ⎜ ⎣ ∫ t 0p2e–p2t I’(t - t)dt⎡⎜⎣G(t)dt (11) which is equivalent to SI = fD V – [G(T) – G(0)] – ∫ T 0SGG(t)dt + SGGbT ∫ T 0 ⎡ ⎜ ⎣ ∫ t 0p2e–p2t I’(t - t)dt⎡⎜⎣G(t)dt (12) Now, SI can be easily evaluated with Equation (12) and standard data obtained from an OGTT/MTT test, considering a basal initial condition. Finally, Ra can be calculated by substituting Equation (9) into Equation (3) as follows: Ra(t) = V ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ Ġ(t) – SGGb + ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ SG + SI ∫ t 0p2e–p2t I’(t - t)dt⎡⎢⎣⎛⎜⎝ (13) In order to evaluate Equation (12) and Equation (13), the Euler approximation method, with a step size of 1 minute, was employed. Cubic splines were used to interpolate both G and I signals. The derivative of G was approximated by the slope of linear regression of 10 consecutive interpolated G values. In order to reduce the effect of the noise on the derivative of G, the derivative filter differentiator from the MATLAB ® Signal Processing Toolbox was used (2010b, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). The full algorithm was implemented using MATLAB. Robustness Analysis via Interval Analysis As stated earlier, mean population values can be assumed for parameters V, p2, and SG because their interpatient variability is not very large. 4 Nevertheless, in order to evaluate the effect of this variability on estimation of Ra 156 A Simple Robust Method for Estimating the Glucose Rate of Appearance from Mixed Meals Herrero www.journalofdst.orgJ Diabetes Sci Technol Vol 6, Issue 1, January 2012 as well as the measurements error, we propose the use of interval analysis. 13 Interval analysis is a mathematical tool that has been applied extensively in the field of robust control as a way to deal with uncertainty. 15 Interval analysis allows representing uncertainties by means of intervals represented by a lower and upper limit; thus, in using intervals, no assumptions are made about the probability distribution of the uncertainties or about the independence or correlation of parameters. Simulation of a model involving interval values produces a band (or envelope) that represents the evolution of each state variable over time and, unlike Monte Carlo techniques, numerically guarantees that all the behaviors are considered. In particular, we have used modal interval analysis (MIA) because it allows for more efficient computations than the classical interval approach 10 (for a complete introduction to MIA, see Gardenyes and colleagues 16). Model interval analysis has already been successfully applied for the prediction of postprandial glucose excursions under uncertainty in T1DM 17 and for optimization of insulin dosage based on these predictions. 18 In-Silico Validation The proposed technique has been validated using simulated data from the FDA-accepted UVa T1DM simulator, 12 hereafter T1DM simulator. Note that the T1DM model implemented in the simulator 19 is different from the minimal model because the former incorporates endo- genous glucose production, renal excretion, and insulin- independent and -dependent glucose utilization. This makes the T1DM simulator a suitable platform for validating the proposed approach for estimating Ra. The T1DM simulator was used to generate the required data (i.e., plasma insulin, plasma glucose, and Ra) from a MTT. For this purpose, the 10 adult diabetic subjects of the commercial version of the T1DM simulator were used. The metabolic test functionality provided by the simulator was employed for this purpose. The protocol applied consisted of adjusting the basal insulin rate in order to get a basal glucose level (Gb) close to 100 mg/dl. The amount of carbohydrates ingested was fixed to 50 g, and the corresponding insulin bolus was adjusted in order to minimize the postprandial peak and to avoid a big inverse peak response (i.e., undershoot below 80 mg/dl). The total time for the experimental period was adjusted in order to return to the basal states after the ingestion of the meal (i.e., 6 h). Note that despite ingesting the same amount of carbohydrates, the glucose absorption rate for each individual of the simulator may be significantly different. Once the basal conditions were achieved by applying the protocol described earlier, basal plasma glucose and plasma insulin levels (Gb and Ib) were obtained from the simulator. Because plasma glucose and plasma insulin data provided by the simulator are error-free, ±2 and ±4% uniformly distributed errors were added to the plasma glucose and plasma insulin measurements, respectively, as reported in YSI Life Sciences 20 and Even and colleagues.21 SI Estimation The proposed technique for estimating SI (Equation 12) was compared against the clinically validated method proposed by Caumo and colleagues. 11 For this purpose, the minimal model parameters values reported by Krudys and colleagues 22 for a T1DM subject (i.e., SG = 0.014 min -1, V = 1.7 dl/kg, and p2 = 0.03 min -1) were used. The carbo- hydrate bioavailability (f) was assumed to be 0.9 because this is a standard value for mixed meals. 4 The coefficient of determination between the two techniques was R2 = 0.99. Despite the two methods seeming to be equivalent, we still consider that our approach is methodologically more robust because it does not require any a priori assumption on Ra. Interval Ra Estimation Intervals associated to model parameters V, p2, and SG were defined based on the intersubject variability reported by Dalla Man and colleagues 4 [i.e., (V) coefficient of variation (CV) = 4%; (p2) CV = 11%; and (SG) CV = 12%], being the associated interval defined as Interval = [mean – SD, mean + SD] (17) where mean is the reported mean value for the model parameter 22 and SD is the corresponding standard deviation. One standard deviation was selected to generate such intervals since this was considered enough to encompass most of the possible behaviors. Intervals corresponding to plasma glucose and plasma insulin measurements were defined based on the errors [(G) ±2% and (I) ±4%] reported in YSI Life Sciences 20 157 A Simple Robust Method for Estimating the Glucose Rate of Appearance from Mixed Meals Herrero www.journalofdst.orgJ Diabetes Sci Technol Vol 6, Issue 1, January 2012 and Even and colleagues,21 with the associated interval defined as Interval = [mean – %mean, mean + %mean] (18) In order to account for the variability of SI due to error in the measurements, a simulation study was carried out comparing estimated SI with error and without error in the measurements. The resulting CV was 16%. The corresponding interval was calculated using Equation (17). Finally, a ±5% variability was considered for the carbohydrate bioavailability, f, and a ±10% error for the estimation of the glucose derivative, based on empirical observations. Figure 1 shows the intervals associated with plasma glucose, plasma insulin measurements, and estimation of the glucose derivative. Experimental Tests The technique presented has also been tested with clinical data. For this purpose, the scientific literature was reviewed for published clinical trials, including Ra data obtained with a multitracer oral protocol, plasma glucose and plasma insulin concentration data, meal composition, and body weight. Despite an intensive bibliographic search, only two studies 4,13 were found that satisfied these criteria. The first selected study 4 (study 1) involved 88 normal glucose tolerance subjects (46 males and 42 females; age = 58 ± 2 years; body weight = 77 ± 2 kg) who received Figure 1. Intervals (dashed red lines) associated with plasma glucose (A), plasma insulin (B) measurements, and estimation of the glucose derivative (C). 158 A Simple Robust Method for Estimating the Glucose Rate of Appearance from Mixed Meals Herrero www.journalofdst.orgJ Diabetes Sci Technol Vol 6, Issue 1, January 2012 a triple-tracer mixed meal (10 kcal/kg, 45% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 40% fat) containing 1 ± 0.02 g/kg glucose (77 ± 1.54 g). The second study 12 (study 2) involved 21 nondiabetic subjects (13 males and 8 females; age = 41 ± 1 years; body mass index = 27 ± 1 kg/m 2) with varying degrees of glucose tolerance (10 normal glucose tolerance and 11 impaired glucose tolerance) who underwent an OGTT labeled with two glucose tracers. SG, p2, and V minimal model parameters were fixed to the mean population values for a normal glucose- tolerant subject reported by Dalla Man and colleagues (i.e., SG = 0.029 min -1, V = 1.4 dl/kg, and p2 = 0.0123 min -1). 4 Note that for study 2, neither the body weight nor the carbohydrate amounts are provided in the article. Because the study consisted of a standard meal tolerance test, the amount of carbohydrate was considered to be 75 g. The corresponding intervals were defined in the same manner as with the in-silico validation tests (see Interval Ra Estimation). The employed glucose and insulin data correspond to average population data. Results In-Silico Results Table 1 shows the relative root mean square error (RMSE) between the center of the Ra interval estimations and the reference Ra corresponding to the 10 adult subjects of the simulator. In the same table, the area under the curve (AUC) of the estimated Ra is also reported as well as the percentage of time that the reference Ra remains inside of the interval estimate. Note that the reference value of absorbed amount of carbohydrates is 45 g and not 50 g because of the carbohydrate bioavailability (f = 0.9). Figures 2 and Figure 3 show the interval Ra estimations for adults number 1 and number 2 of the simulator, the center of the interval estimate, the reference Ra profiles, and corresponding plasma glucose and plasma insulin data. First of all, note that the reference behavior is, practically all the time, fully included inside the interval estimate. Furthermore, note that despite the relatively big size of the obtained interval estimate, the center of the interval fits well with the reference behavior. Experimental Results The relative RMSE between the center of the interval Ra estimation and the reference Ra for studies 1 and 2 were RMSE = 0.61 and RMSE = 0.77, respectively. The respective AUC for each study were AUC1 = 71.5 g and AUC2 = 68.8 g, while the reference amount of absorbed carbohydrates were 78.5 g and 66.9 g. In both studies, the percentage in time corresponding to the reference Ra inside the interval estimate was 95%. Note that the reference Ra deviates out of the interval estimate when it initially increases rapidly. This effect is probably due to the filtering of the derivative of G, which advances the signal, as can be observed in Figure 1. Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the interval Ra estimations for both studies together with the corresponding reference Ra estimated with tracers. Discussion The methodology presented has been proven to be a simple and effective way to estimate the rate of glucose appearance from mixed meals. The simplicity of this technique makes it suitable for large clinical research studies for the evaluation of the role of Ra in patients with impairments in glucose metabolism. Note that the proposed methodology is limited to in-clinic studies as it requires plasma glucose and plasma insulin data. To obtain satisfactory results, it is important to capture the complete glucose and insulin dynamics during the experiments. For this purpose, the sampling time and duration of the experiment have to be carefully selected. Finally, when dealing with glucose-intolerant subjects, it is important to guarantee that basal conditions are satisfied at the start and end of the experiment. Table 1.

One of the key points of the proposed technique is the fact that it only requires the identification of one parameter of the minimal model, while the rest of the parameters can be considered to vary inside relatively small ranges. This characteristic makes the parameter identification process very simple as no identifiability problems are present. To test this hypothesis, interval analysis, a well- established technique for robust analysis, was employed. For this purpose, uncertainty was carefully selected based on earlier studies on the variability of such parameters as well as technical specifications of the different employed measurement techniques. This method has been proven to be sound because the obtained Ra interval estimate includes the reference one. Furthermore, and more importantly, the method is accurate because the center of such an interval estimate correlates well with the reference value. Concerning the new technique for estimating SI, it highly correlates with an existing clinically validated technique. Despite both methods seeming to be equivalent, the proposed technique is methodologically more robust since it does not require any a priori assumption on Ra. In addition to its application to large clinical studies for the evaluation of the role of Ra in patients with impairments in glucose metabolism, the technique presented is being applied to build a model library of mixed meals using data from the literature. This library could be incorporated into existing T1DM simulators in order to account for more realistic and varied meals. Furthermore, it could be used in an artificial pancreas context by any algorithm that requires robust glucose estimates such as robust fault detection algorithms, which detect faults on the glucose sensors and insulin pumps, or a robust model-based glucose controller. Conclusions Existing techniques for estimating the rate of glucose appearance (Ra) from a mixed meal are either experimentally complex (i.e., multitracer protocols) or numerically complex (e.g., Bayesian estimation). In this article, a simple method, based on the glucose-insulin minimal model has been proven to be an alternative effective way to estimate Ra. In summary, a new technique for estimation of the rate of glucose appearance is described, only requiring the identification of insulin sensitivity (SI) from the minimal model, with the remaining parameters fixed to mean population value. By using interval analysis, a robust estimate of Ra represented by a band including all possible behaviors is obtained, and in in-silico trials, it has been proven that the robust estimate obtained contains the reference behavior. Furthermore, the center of the interval estimate is highly correlated with the reference. A new technique for estimating SI, which unlike earlier methods, does not require any assumption on Ra, has been presented and validated. Finally, this new technique showed excellent results when tested with actual clinical data.
