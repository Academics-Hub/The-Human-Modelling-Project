Development of the ovariesDevelopment of the ovariesDevelopment of the ovariesDescent of the testisDescent of the testisDescent of the testisDescent of the testis Cryptorchidism May be unilateral or bilateral If both testis remain in the abdominal cavity they fail to mature This will result in sterility Cryptochid testes may be in the abdominal cavity or anywhere within the inguinal canal Descent of the ovaries Descent of the ovariesGenital systemGenital system (paramesonephric ducts cross ventral to the mesonephric ducts) Genital systemGenital systemFemale genital ductsFemale genital ductsFemale genital ducts  In female embryos, the mesonephric ducts regress because of the absence of testosterone and only a few non-functional remnants persist .  The paramesonephric ducts develop because of the absence of MIH. External genitalia External genitaliaExternal genitalia Male genitaliaMale genitaliaMale genitaliaMale genitalia Female genitalia Hypospadias Hypospadias is the most common anomaly of the penis. There are four main types of hypospadias:  Glanular hypospadias-the most common type  Penile hypospadias  Penoscrotal hypospadias  Perineal hypospadias • Glanular hypospadias- The external urethral orifice is on the dorsal surface of the glans of the penis • Penile hypospadias • The external urethral orifice is on the dorsal surface of the body of the penis • Glanular hypospadias and penile hypospadias constitute approximately 80% of cases In penoscrotal hypospadias, the urethral orifice is at the junction of the penis and scrotum. In perineal hypospadias, the labioscrotal folds fail to fuse and the external urethral orifice is located between the unfused halves of the scrotum. Agenesis of external genitalia Congenital absence of the penis or clitoris is an extremely rare condition . Failure of the genital tubercle to develop . The urethra usually opens into the perineum near the anus. Absence of vagina and uterus 1:5000 female births, absence of the vagina occurs. Results from failure of the sinovaginal bulbs to develop and form the vaginal plate . When the vagina is absent, the uterus is usually absent . Vaginal atresia Failure of canalization of the vaginal plate results in atresia (blockage) of the vagina. References Allan, J., Kramer, B. (2010). The fundamentals of human embryology.
