•Attenuation of an ultrasound beam •Generation and detection •Resolution •Scanning modes •Noise and SNR •Time Gain Compensation •Contrast •Uses of diagnostic ultrasound –Blood velocity measurement •Advantages and disadvantages The decibel •A „bel‟ is defined as the base-ten log of the ratio of the increase or decrease of power in a system –If P1 > P2 (amplification) => positive –If P1 < P2 (attenuation) => negative –If P1 = P2 => zero 2 110 logP P The decibel •A „decibel‟ is simply one tenth of a „bel‟ •Examples: •30 dB = 3 B = amplification (gain) of 1000 •-30 dB = attenuation of 1000 •0 dB = no gain •Note: –Intensity (I) can be substituted for power (P) in dB calculations without any problems – the normalising areas (in m2 ) simply cancel out –This will also avoid the risk of confusion with pressure 2 110 log10 P PdB The decibel •Uses of the dB scale: –Logarithmic scale for representing a wide range of values (e.g. sound detection by the human ear (0 – 120 dB), A-mode scans without TGC) –In any train of power transmission (e.g. ultrasound beam or optical communication along a fibre optic cable), simply add the dB levels (with appropriate signs) and get the answer for the final-to-initial power ratio in dB (due to a log property, easier than working out exponential decays and multiplying) The decibel •Very important: –dB‟s relate to power (or intensity in the case of ultrasound) –If using voltage (in electrical circuits) or pressure (in ultrasound), remember it is the square of these units that are proportional to power 2 1102 2 2 1 log20log10 V V V VdB The decibel •The dB is the log of a ratio and not an absolute unit –E.g. -3dB simply means an arbitrary power level was reduced by a factor of 2 –It does not imply an absolute power level as an initial power level was NOT specified •However, a reference power may be specified –E.g. in the field of audiology, the power level that the patient can hear is generally expressed relative to a specific power level which is just audible to an “average” individual for a 1 kHz sound signal –In this case, the dB can be considered an absolute unit Attenuation of an ultrasound beam •A number of mechanisms result in energy loss of the ultrasound beam as it propagates through tissue –Including so called „tissue relaxation‟ and scattering •The beam attenuates exponentially as it passes through tissue –i.e. described by a standard first-order decay equation with the attenuation coefficient (eg. in mm-1 ) being dependant on the properties of the tissue and on the frequency of ultrasound Distance (mm) relative intensity 1 Attenuation of an ultrasound beam •The loss is more commonly expressed in dB per cm of tissue (dB/cm) •As the relationship between attenuation/cm and frequency is roughly linear, it may be expressed in dBcm-1 MHz-1 –Typical example for some tissues: 1 dBcm-1 MHz-1 , thus at 5 MHz, the loss would be about 5dBcm-1 Distance (cm) relative intensity 1 Distance (cm) relative intensity (dB) 0 Attenuation of an ultrasound beam •The higher the frequency, the greater the attenuation •Able to image over short distances using very high frequencies –E.g. 30 MHz in opthalmology gives excellent axial resolution •Imaging greater distances requires the use of much lower frequencies to get a useful signal –E.g. 2 - 4 MHz in cardiac imaging, resulting in lower axial resolution Axial resolution high low Generation and detection •Piezoelectric transducer –When a voltage is applied, the crystalline material undergoes mechanical deformation •i.e. by applying a short oscillating voltage pulse, the material rings at its resonant frequency, thus producing a sound wave at that frequency –When the crystalline material experiences a mechanical deformation, it produces a voltage •i.e. by subjecting the device to the sound, it undergoes strain, thus producing a voltage in proportion to its deformation, allowing detection of the sound Generation and detection •Piezoelectric transducer –Made of a material abbreviated PZT –Each crystal‟s properties and dimensions determine its resonant frequency –The crystal has a backing material to damp out oscillations when the voltage signal ceases –The characteristic impedance of the piezoelectric transducer is about 15 times higher than skin Generation and detection •Piezoelectric transducer –Remember from circuits, the most power is transferred when the impedances are matched –An impedance matching layer is placed in front of the transducer in contact with the skin –The best impedance for the matching layer is determined as the square root of the product of the skin‟s impedance and the piezoelectric element‟s (pze) impedance skinpze ZZ Note: geometric mean Generation and detection •Piezoelectric transducer –The matching layer has a thickness of ¼ the wavelength of the ultrasound –A gel is placed between the transducer and skin •serves to further match impedances for maximum energy transfer •lubricates the movement of the transducer over skin Generation and detection •Piezoelectric transducer –The size and shape of the transducer determines the geometry of the beam •A phased array of transducers can be used which is excited in sequence to direct the beam and thus sweep it through an angle to sweep out a sector Remember Huygen‟s Principle Generation and detection •Piezoelectric transducer –1-D and 2-D phased arrays can be used to steer the beam and to focus it by shaping the beam –The shape determines how thin the waist (thinnest part) of the beam is and its distance along the beam‟s axis (focal distance) –An annular array of crystals can be used to focus the beam, but this cannot be steered Generation and detection •The shape of an ultrasound beam –Power distribution in a cross-section of the beam –Parallel lines suggest sharp edges –But generally represent the 1-SD power (intensity) level in the Gaussian beam profile propagation direction Generation and detection •The shape of an ultrasound beam –Can be rather complex –Diffraction effects can cause unwanted side- lobes –The lines represent the 1-SD power level Phased-array transducer beam waist focal distance Generation and detection •The shape of an ultrasound beam –By changing the number and timing of the excitation of elements in the piezoelectric transducer array, the waist can be made narrower or wider, and its axial position (focal distance) can be moved closer to or further from the transducer –The width of the beam determines the so called lateral resolution Phased-array transducer beam waist focal distance Generation and detection •The shape of an ultrasound beam –The operator has some control over the lateral resolution and can also decide how deep they want the maximum lateral resolution to be •e.g. the operator can move the position of the waist to overlie the mitral valve leaflet, thus optimising the lateral resolution of this structure –In modern ultrasound equipment, the operator interface is usually simple and the focal distance is usually set by placing a cursor over the position for which they want to optimise lateral resolution Lateral resolution high low Generation and detection •The detection of echoes –The transducer is excited briefly, emits a pulse of ultrasound and then waits for the returning echoes (from tissue interfaces) –The duration of the pulse (δ) can be made shorter •if the frequency of ultrasound is made higher •if the crystal is well damped so that it does not go on ringing for too long (short ring-down time) after the excitation voltage has ceased hfE Generation and detection •The detection of echoes –δ is the major determinant of axial resolution –The crystal is damped using an energy- absorbing material at the back of the crystal •Note: high damping (short ring-down times) increases the bandwidth of the ultrasound beam Resolution •Lateral resolution –The resolution in a direction perpendicular to the beam –Determined by the beam width and is therefore best at the depth of the waist (focal distance) –For a Gaussian profile the resolution of the beam is related to the width (the width can be measured by the standard deviation, σ) –The lateral resolution is numerically equal to the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) which can be calculated as: –The best FWHM and its axial position can be controlled by the operator Lateral resolution high low 36.22ln22 FWHM Resolution •Axial resolution –determined by the pulse duration (δ) and speed of sound in tissue (c) –δ, and therefore axial resolution, is frequency dependant •i.e. high frequency implies high axial resolution. c 2 1 axial resolution Axial resolution high low Scanning modes •There are three basic types of ultrasound scan –A-Mode –M-Mode –B-Mode Scanning modes •A-Mode scans –First type of scan produced •remains useful to image the fine layered structures of the eye –Starts with the emission of a pulse of ultrasound –The transducer then “listens” for the echoes produced at the interfaces of different Z values –The time for each echo to return depends on how deep the structure is –The return echo is amplified to compensate for tissue losses in a process known as Time Gain Compensation (TGC) –Even after TGC is applied, the echo often has less than 0.1% of the power of the outgoing beam Scanning modes •A-Mode scans –A plot of amplitude of echoes as a function of time is produced time (ms) distance (cm) amplitude Z1 Z2 Z3 Z2 transducer Ultrasound beam passing through various materials The time axis can be converted into a distance axis by assuming a speed of sound The A-Mode echoes are shown with TGC applied Remember there-and- back trip of the beam Scanning modes •M-Mode scans –Simply a sequence of A-Modes –It essentially shows the positions of echo- producing interfaces along a single scan line as a function of time –It can give vital information about movement •e.g. a mitral valve leaflet Scanning modes •M-Mode scans –Start by looking at another way to show the A- Mode image time (ms) distance (cm) amplitude Imagine the amplitudes coming out of the page The amplitudes are now represented by a brightness level in grey-scale Scanning modes •M-Mode scans Scanning modes •M-Mode scans Now rotate the A-Mode image by 90° Scanning modes •M-Mode scans Scanning modes •M-Mode scans After enough time has elapsed to read all the echoes, do another A-Mode and place it next to the first. Scanning modes •M-Mode scans After enough time has elapsed to read all the echoes, do another A-Mode and place it next to the first. Scanning modes •M-Mode scans and again… Scanning modes •M-Mode scans and again, and again… Scanning modes •M-Mode scans and again, and again, and again… Scanning modes •M-Mode scans until… Scanning modes •M-Mode scans time distance An M-Mode scan is simply a sequence of A- Modes along a single scan direction Scanning modes •M-Mode scans Depth (mm) Time (s) Now imagine that one of the echo- producing interfaces is moving towards and away from the transducer – it produces a scan that looks like this Scanning modes •B-Mode scans –Comprise a series of A-Mode scans along different scan directions –The beam is steered to sweep out a sector through an angle and at each incremental angular step, an A-Mode scan is acquired –The full sector is imaged and displayed as a series of A-Mode images (i.e. with intensity deemed to be coming out of the screen and shown as a grey-scale level) B-Mode sweep Scanning modes •B-Mode scans –The entire sector is scanned rapidly so that for all practical purposes it forms a frame comprising a static 2-D image –Then the sector scan is repeated –Modern ultrasound machines can produce 30 or more frames per second giving an ultrasonic 2-D image of a sector in the plane of the scan –The operator can rotate the probe (e.g. by 90º) to scan in another plane –Each frame would show a different point in time with the effect being a moving ultrasound image in a plane Scanning modes This 2-D, B-Mode ultrasound image shows the sagittal section of the normal fetal spine in longitudinal section.

Electronic noise in the circuitry – SNR is increased if the echo is intense enough 2. Speckle due to coherent wave interference in the tissue which causes a granular appearance 3. Clutter applies to all other causes of noise (e.g. signal from side lobes and grating lobes, multi-path reverberations, tissue movement etc) Noise and SNR •Achieving a high SNR High SNR achieved by: Disadvantage: high intensity pulse – results in high intensity echoes low frequency of ultrasound reduces attenuation poor axial resolution very focused beam gives high energy per unit area and therefore a high SNR poor SNR anywhere other than at depth of focus reduced transducer damping reduced axial resolution due to low bandwidth Noise and SNR •Achieving a high SNR –Compound Imaging (sonoCT) is a technique in which multiple co-planar B-Mode scans are acquired using clever phasing of the transducer array •i.e. the same structures are viewed from a few different angles in the same plane –This substantially enhances SNR because speckle and clutter are reduced –The reduction is due to the backscattered echoes (the reflected signal) adding coherently while speckle and clutter only add partially coherently Time Gain Compensation •A Time Gain Compensator –An amplifier designed to apply a gain to a signal in proportion to the time taken to receive the signal –The longer a signal takes to return, the further it has travelled and therefore the more attenuation it experiences –A deep object will produce a very weak signal compared to a superficial (close to transducer) object –TGC corrects this, so that all objects of equal reflectivity have the same brightness irrespective of how deep they are Time Gain Compensation •A Time Gain Compensator –The characteristic of a TGC can be described in dB/cm or dB/μs (the conversion is just the speed of sound) cm or μs dB 0 a typical gradient could be something like 5dB/cm (or the equivalent in dB/μs) but the exact value would depend on expected tissue attenuation Time Gain Compensation •A Time Gain Compensator –The graph of a TGC characteristic should be roughly the inverse of the attenuation for the tissue being imaged –Sliders •differentially control the gain for different depths, boosting weak signals if imaging tissues which have different attenuation coefficients •can change the TGC characteristic to non-linear Time Gain Compensation A time-gain- compensated echo signal: • CH1 is the echo signal prior to time-gain compensation • CH2 is the gain- control voltage • CH3 is the echo signal after time- gain compensation Dinev P D, Glenn W E. Digitally controlled time-gain compensation for ultrasound scanners. Meas. Sci. Technol. 8 (1997) 938–940. Contrast •Agents can be introduced into the blood that produce increased contrast between the region of fluid being examined and the surroundings •This is usually done by injecting a specialised pharmaceutical that produces tiny bubbles < 10μm •The flow of these bubbles can be followed on the image –E.g. as they pass through a septal defect in the heart Contrast •At least 3 mechanisms for increasing contrast may be exploited: 1. The bubbles change the acoustic properties of the material (i.e. a new reflective interface) 2. The bubbles have their own resonance frequency which can be exploited if the ultrasound beam has a wide bandwidth 3. The bubbles compress and expand in a non-linear way in response to the pressure from the ultrasound beam – this introduces harmonics due to distortion of the signal – a specialised technique, second-harmonic imaging, is used whereby the initial ultrasound beam has one frequency, but the measurement of the reflection is made at the second harmonic of this frequency, which is introduced by the bubbles Uses of diagnostic ultrasound •Obstetric ultrasound •Soft-tissue imaging: cardiac, renal, liver, gallbladder •Musculo-skeletal imaging of muscles, tendons and ligaments •Ophthalmic ultrasound scans of the eye •Superficial scans of the testes, thyroid, salivary glands and lymph nodes •Guide interventional procedures (e.g. fine needle aspirations and biopsies) Uses of Diagnostic Ultrasound •Blood velocity measurement –Doppler Ultrasound for visualising blood flow in arteries and veins •when ultrasound scatters off Red Blood Cells (RBC size << wavelength), it undergoes a Doppler shift due to movement •there are actually two shifts –the shift from the perspective of the RBC –the shift from the perspective of the receiver (i.e. the RBC acts as a second transmitter by reflecting the sound) Uses of Diagnostic Ultrasound •Blood velocity measurement –The Doppler shift (the difference in the initial transmitted frequency and the received frequency) is linearly proportional to blood velocity •fi is the outgoing frequency •c is the speed of sound •v is the velocity of blood •θ is the angle between the probe and the flow vector, which should ideally be small c vff i cos2 Uses of Diagnostic Ultrasound •Blood velocity measurement –Continuous Wave Doppler •A transducer sends out a continuous ultrasound beam and a receiver, usually in the same housing, detects the signal •Using appropriate techniques, the Doppler shift frequency is determined and thus the average blood flow velocity •This is often complicated by the uncertainty in the angle Uses of Diagnostic Ultrasound •Blood velocity measurement –Pulsed Wave Doppler •a single transmitter and receiver are operated in pulsed mode •the advantage is the ability to determine velocity at a particular depth •the volume of the region of interest can be chosen by –shaping the beam for the lateral extent –the appropriate timing for receiving the signal after transmission (minimum depth) –the duration of acquisition (maximum depth) •if the velocity is too high –aliasing occurs because the repetition rate (sampling) is too low –in a spectral plot you will see a low frequency alias Uses of Diagnostic Ultrasound •Blood velocity measurement –B-Mode Duplex imaging •pulsed mode Doppler measurements are interlaced with B-Mode scan to register the velocity in a region •remember that there are different velocity vectors in a region (e.g. in a vessel, the velocity is higher centrally than peripherally) •some techniques only measure the average velocity Uses of Diagnostic Ultrasound • Blood velocity measurement – B-Mode Duplex imaging 1. Colour flow: • a region of interest is defined using the scan parameters • in this region, the flow velocities are shown using a colour map, including directionality of flow (e.g. blue v.s. red) • this is superimposed on the real-time B-Mode picture so the operator can see where the region of interest is in relation to the other anatomy (e.g. flow across a heart valve with the moving valve leaflets shown in real time) • so, both a real-time B-Mode image and the flow rate (colour coded for velocity and direction) in a region of interest are shown simultaneously Uses of Diagnostic Ultrasound • Blood velocity measurement – B-Mode Duplex imaging 1.

Spectral Doppler mode: • the signal is shown as frequency (velocity) against time where the amplitude represents frequency (velocity) • the amplitude of any velocity (frequency) component is shown as brightness • the vertical extent of the plot at any time represents the range of frequencies (velocities) and the brightness represents the amplitude of a given velocity component • aliasing may occur due to the pulsed sampling rate Uses of Diagnostic Ultrasound • Blood velocity measurement – B-Mode Duplex imaging 2. Spectral Doppler mode: • Note: • the Doppler frequency is always small because it is the difference between the transmitted and received frequencies • it happens to be in the audio range (e.g. 1 – 3 kHz) so we can actually play this through a speaker • turbulence sounds harsh compared to smooth flow • hearing the signal helps visual interpretation • it is not the blood flow you are hearing! Uses of Diagnostic Ultrasound • Blood velocity measurement – B-Mode Duplex imaging • many measurements and estimates can be made: – e.g. the ejection fraction can be estimated by making a few measurements and then performing calculations based on pre-determined correlations, which clearly involve assumptions about the geometry of the ventricle – other measurements will be demonstrated on the site visit Advantages and Disadvantages •Advantages –Inexpensive –Portable –Able to use in routine and emergency prenatal care –As currently applied in the medical field, poses no known risks to the patient •Disadvantages –Two known physiological effects: •Enhances inflammatory response •Can heat soft tissue through molecular friction –Biological effects of contrast agents –Benefits to patients outweigh the risks References •Prof. D.
