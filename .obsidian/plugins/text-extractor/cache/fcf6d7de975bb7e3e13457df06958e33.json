In the correct order, Name the parts of the conducting system through which an impulse travels when passing to the myocardium of the right ventricle Blood supply to the heart • Blood supply is from the R&L coronary arteries • Surround the heart like an inverted crown • Origin: right ( anterior ) aortic sinus. • Course: ✓ between pulmonary trunk & right auricle descends to right in atrioventricular sulcus (coronary sulcus ) ✓ turns posteriorly at junction of right & inferior border ✓ continues along posterior part of coronary sulcus to anastomose with branch of left coronary artery. Branches ✓ Artery to SA node (65% of cases) ✓ Right marginal artery ✓ Posterior interventricular branch ✓ Conus artery ✓ Atrial & ventricular branches Areas supplied ✓ Most of right atrium. ✓ Right ventricle except area adjoining anterior interventricular groove. ✓ Left ventricle adjacent to posterior interventricular sulcus. ✓ Posterior 1/3rd of interventricular septum ✓ SA node in 65% of the cases. ✓ AV node and bundle of His, except left branch of bundle of His. Origin: left ( left posterior ) aortic sinus. • Course: behind, then to left of pulmonary trunk to reach left part of atrio-ventricular sulcus divides into anterior inter-ventricular and circumflex branches – • Branches o Anterior interventricular artery o Circumflex artery o Diagonal artery o Unnamed branches to left atrium and ventricle • Areas supplied o Left atrium o Left ventricle except the area adjoining posterior interventricular groove. o Right ventricle adjacent to the anterior interventricular sulcus. o Anterior 2/3rd of the interventricular septum o SA node in 35% of the cases. o Part of the left branch of bundle of His. Coronary artery dominance: w ✓ posterior interventricular artery( posterior descending artery (PDA) determines the coronary dominance.Summary of Arterial Supply Venous drainage of heart i. Coronary sinus ii. Anterior cardiac veins iii. Venae cordis minimae Coronary sinus: ✓ Drains most of the venous blood from heart. ✓ lies in posterior part of coronary sulcus. ▪ Great cardiac vein ▪ Middle cardiac vein ▪ Small cardiac vein ▪ Right marginal vein ▪ Oblique vein of the left atrium ▪ Posterior ventricular vein Tributaries Anterior cardiac veins • Several small veins , that drain blood from the anterior aspect of right ventricle. • They open into the right atrium. Venae cordis minimae • Drain venous blood from the endocardium and deep part of myocardium. • Open directly into the every chamber of the heart. Nerve supply of heart autonomic nervous system. ✓ Sympathetic fibers: superior, middle and inferior cervical ganglia Spinal segments (T1-T4) . ✓ Parasympathetic fibers: Vagus nerve ✓ The sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers reach heart via superficial and deep cardiac plexuses. • Superficial Cardiac Plexus is located below arch of aorta. • Deep cardiac plexus is located behind arch of aorta & front of tracheal bifurcation. ✓ Angina Pectoris ✓ Myocardial infarction Cardiac pain due to angina pectoris or myocardial infarction is usually referred to the medial aspect of left arm and forearm. WHY? Visceral afferent fibers travel within the sympathetic cardiac nerves to the sympathetic trunk on their way to the spinal cord, which they enter through posterior roots at levels T1-T5. These visceral afferents are thus in the same roots as the somatic afferents returning from the medial border of the left upper limb and left side of the chest wall. Cardiac pain is often referred to areas of the body surface which send sensory impulses to the same levels of the spinal cord that receive cardiac sensation. REVIEW QUESTIONS • List the structures and location involved in the conducting system of the heart. • Give, the origin, course and branches of the right and left coronary arteries • Describe the innervation of the heart • Write notes on the coronary sinus.
