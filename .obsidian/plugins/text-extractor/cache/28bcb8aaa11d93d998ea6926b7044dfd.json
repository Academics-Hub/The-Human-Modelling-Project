Ankle Joint Ankle Joint • The ankle joint is a strong weight-bearing joint which is a synovial joint of hinge variety. • Articular surfaces • The proximal articular surface is by a socket formed by the facets on the lower ends of the tibia and fibula • Articular facet of the medial malleolus. • Articular facet of the lateral malleolus. • Inferior transverse tibiofibular ligament. • The distal articular surface is formed by the articular facets on the upper, medial, and lateral aspects of the body of the talus. Stability of the Ankle Joint • Close interlocking of its articular surfaces. • Strong, medial, and lateral collateral ligaments. • Deepening of tibiofibular socket posteriorly by the inferior transverse tibiofibular ligament. • Tendons (four in front and five behind) crossing the ankle joint. • Other ligaments of this joint. Joint Capsule • The capsule encloses the joint and attaches to the articular margins of the joint all around with two exceptions: • Posterosuperiorly- It attaches to the inferior transverse tibiofibular ligament. • Anteroinferiorly- It attaches to the dorsum of the neck of talus at some distance from the trochlear surface. • The joint capsule is thin in front and behind to allow hinge movements and thick on either side where it blends with the collateral ligaments. • The synovial membrane lines the capsule. Ligaments • The medial, or deltoid ligament • It is strong ligament and has a superficial and a deep part. • Both parts attach by their apex to the tip of the medial malleolus above. • Below, the attachment of superficial and deep parts differs • Superficial fibres • Anterior fibres (tibionavicular)- to the tuberosity of navicular bone • Middle fibres (tibiocalcanean)- to the whole length of sustentaculum tali. • Posterior fibres (posterior tibiotalar)- to the medial tubercle and adjoining part of the medial surface of talus. • Deep part (anterior tibiotalar) is attached to the anterior part of the medial surface of talus. Ligaments • The lateral ligament • It is weaker than the medial ligament and consists of three bands. • The anterior talofibular ligament runs from the lateral malleolus to the lateral surface of the talus. • The calcaneofibular ligament runs from the tip of the lateral malleolus downward and backward to the lateral surface of the calcaneum. • The posterior talofibular ligament runs from the lateral malleolus to the posterior tubercle of the talus. Relations of the Ankle Joint • Anterior: medial to lateral side • Tibialis anterior. • Extensor Hallucis longus. • Anterior tibial Artery. • Deep peroneal Nerve. • Extensor Digitorum longus. • Peroneus tertius • Posteriorly: medial to lateral side • Tibialis posterior. • Flexion Digitorum longus. • Posterior tibial Artery. • Posterior tibial Nerve. • Flexor Hallucis longus. Neurovascular Supply • Arterial supply • The malleolar branches of anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries. • Nerve supply • The branches of deep peroneal and tibial nerves. Movement • Dorsiflexion • It reduces the angle between front of the leg and dorsum of the foot. • Dorsiflexion is performed by the • tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and peroneus tertius. • It is limited by the tension of • the tendocalcaneus, the posterior fibers of the medial ligament, and the calcaneofibular ligament. • The ankle joint is most stable in dorsiflexion. https://touchoflifeptnyc.com/foot-ankle- toe-treatment-principle/ Movement • Plantar Flexion • It depresses the foot and the angle between the leg and foot is increased. • It is performed by the • gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus. • It is limited by the tension of the opposing muscles, • the anterior fibers of the medial ligament, and the anterior talofibular ligament. • The joint is unstable in plantar flexion and allows for a small amount of movement like • rotation, abduction, and adduction. https://touchoflifeptnyc.com/foot-ankle- toe-treatment-principle/ Clinical Significance • Ankle sprains • They are usually caused by the falls from height or twists of ankle. • They occur following excessive stretching and/or tearing of ligaments of the ankle joint. • Ligaments at risk include • The anterior and posterior talofibular • Calcaneofibular ligaments are stretched • The anterior talofibular ligament is most commonly torn. • The inversion sprains are more common than eversion sprains. Clinical Significance • Dislocation of the ankle • The dislocations of ankle joint are rare because it is a very stable joint due to tibiofibular mortise. • However, whenever dislocation occurs it is always accompanied by the fracture of one of the malleoli Clinical Significance • Pott’s fracture • It involves a fracture of the medial and lateral malleoli and sometimes the distal tibia. • It arises following forced eversion of the foot and occurs in a series of stages: • Oblique fracture of the lateral malleolus due to internal rotation of the tibia. • Transverse fracture of the medial malleolus due to pull by strong deltoid ligament. • Fracture of the posterior margin of the lower end of tibia (third malleolus) because it is carried forward. • These stages are also termed first, second, and third degree of Pott’s fracture, respectively. • The third degree of Potts fracture is also called trimalleolar fracture Joints of the Foot Joints of the Foot • There are numerous joints in the foot formed between tarsal, metatarsal, and phalangeal bones. • The joints of the foot include • Intertarsal • Tarsometatarsal • Intermetatarsal • Metatarsophalangeal • Interphalangeal • Those joints which are of more functional value are discussed. Joints of the FootTarsal Joints- Subtalar Joint • The subtalar joint is a synovial joint, of the plane variety between the talus and the calcaneum posteriorly. • Articulation • The articular surfaces are covered with hyaline cartilage and is between the inferior surface of the body of the talus and the facet on the middle of the upper surface of the calcaneum. • Capsule • The capsule encloses the joint and is attached to the margins of the articular areas of the two bones and it's lined by a synovial membrane. • Ligaments • Medial and lateral (talocalcaneal) ligaments strengthen the capsule. • Movements • Gliding and rotatory movements are possible. https://mobilephysiotherapyclinic.in/wp- content/uploads/2020/08/Subtalar-joint-arthritis.png Talocalcaneonavicular Joint • The talocalcaneonavicular joint js a synovial joint between the talus, the calcaneum and navicular bone anteriorly. • Articulation • The articular surfaces are covered with hyaline cartilage and involves the rounded head of the talus, the upper surface of the sustentaculum tali, and the posterior concave surface of the navicular bone. • Capsule • The capsule is lined by a synovial membrane, and it incompletely encloses the joint. • Ligaments • The plantar calcaneonavicular ligament is strong and runs from the anterior margin of the sustentaculum tali to the inferior surface and tuberosity of the navicular bone. • Movements • Gliding and rotatory movements are possible. Calcaneocuboid Joint • The calcaneocuboid joint is synovial, of the plane variety. • Articulation • The articular surfaces are covered with hyaline cartilage and is between the anterior end of the calcaneum and the posterior surface of the cuboid. • Capsule • The capsule is lined by synovial membrane and encloses the joint. • Ligaments • The bifurcated Y-shaped, ligament is a strong ligament on the upper surface of the joint. • It attaches to the upper surface of the anterior part of the calcaneum, the upper surface of cuboid and upper surface of the navicular bone. • The long plantar ligament is a strong ligament on the lower surface of the joint. • The short plantar ligament is a wide, strong ligament that is attached to • The anterior tubercle on the undersurface of the calcaneum and to the adjoining part of the cuboid bone Movements in the Subtalar, Talocalcaneonavicular, and Calcaneocuboid Joints • The talocalcaneonavicular and the calcaneocuboid joints are jointly known as the transverse tarsal joints. • Two forms of movements take place at the subtalar and transverse tarsal joints. • Inversion • It is the movement of the foot so that the sole faces medially. • Inversion is more extensive than eversion and is performed by the • tibialis anterior, the extensor hallucis longus, and the medial tendons of extensor digitorum longus; the tibialis posterior also assists. • Eversion • It is the opposite movement of the foot so that the sole faces in the lateral direction. • Eversion is performed by the • peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, and peroneus tertius; the lateral tendons of the extensor digitorum longus also assist. https://touchoflifeptnyc.com/foot-ankle- toe-treatment-principle/ Tarsometatarsal Joints • These are plane type of synovial joints connected by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous tarsometatarsal ligaments. • They are five in number. • The first joint possesses a separate cavity, the second and third together have one cavity. • These joints permit only limited gliding movements. • Movements include dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, adduction, and abduction. Metatarsophalangeal Joints • They are ellipsoidal type of the synovial joints connected by the capsular, collateral, plantar, and deep transverse metatarsal ligaments. • Two collateral ligaments strengthen the sides of each joint. • The deep transverse ligaments (four in number) connect the plantar ligaments of adjacent metatarsophalangeal joints • The joints permit the slight gliding movements. Interphalangeal Joints • They are typical hinge joints connected by the capsular and collateral ligaments. • Movements include dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of distal phalanges.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
