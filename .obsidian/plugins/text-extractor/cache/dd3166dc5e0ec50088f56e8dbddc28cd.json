Students will be required to use Matlab as an assistive tool. The examples in this tutorial involve basic 2-port electric circuits. 2 First order systems Figure 1: Circuit 1 is an RC circuit. x(t) is the input voltage and y(t) is the output voltage. 1. On paper, determine the transfer function for circuit 1, leaving R and C as variables. 2. Then, on paper, determine the response to a unit step input voltage. You will be finding the unit step response. 3. Set R =1 and C =1. 4. In Matlab, plot a figure representing the calculated step response from the previous step. 5. In Matlab, use the tf and stepplot functions to plot a separate step response figure. 6. Compare figures from steps 4 and 5. 7. Calculate the time constant, rise time, and settling time, 8. Use the Matlab bodeplot function to find the -3 dB frequency in radians and in Hz. 9. Explain the dynamic behaviour of the system i.e., how does the system deal with input sinusoidal voltages of different frequencies? You have a system in a black box with two wires at one end for the input and two wires at the other end for the output. You apply a unit step voltage at the input terminals and record and plot the output voltage over time. The plot is shown in Figure 2. 10. Can you assume that the system in the black box is a first order LTI system? Explain.

The transient response is defined as the part of the time response which goes from the initial state to the final state and reduces to zero as time becomes very large. The steady-state response is defined as the behaviour of the system as t approaches infinity after the transients have died out. Thus the system response y(t) may be written as: y(t) = y t (t) + y ss (t) where y t (t) denotes the transient response, and y ss (t) denotes the steady-state response. 2. Response Analysis of First-Order Systems Many systems are approximately first-order. The important feature is that the storage of mass, momentum and energy can be captured by one parameter. Examples of first-order systems are velocity of a car on the road, control of the velocity of a rotating system, electric systems where energy storage is essentially in one capacitor or one inductor, incompressible fluid flow in a pipe, level control of a tank, pressure control in a gas tank, temperature in a body with essentially uniform temperature distribution (e.g. steam filled vessel). Next we will present several examples to show how to obtain the dynamic equations of first-order systems. Example 1: Mechanical system m is the mass, u(t) is the external force, y(t) is the velocity and b is the friction coefficient. By Newton’s law, we have the following differential equation: )t(u)t(by dt )t(dy m =+ Example 2: Electrical system R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, u(t) is the input voltage and y(t) is the output voltage. By Kirchhoff’s law: u(t) = Ri(t) + y(t) and i(t) = Cdy(t)/dt Thus )t(u)t(y dt )t(dy RC =+ A general form of a first-order system can be represented by the block diagram. 1/Ts Y(s) + _ R(s) = 1Ts 1 + Y(s)R(s) m u(t) y(t) by(t) u(t) y(t) R C x(t) ELEN3014 – Modelling Tutorial 1 2023 2 11. If you choose to model the black box system as a first order LTI RC circuit, estimate a suitable transfer function to model the black box system. Then estimate appropriate real-world values for R and C. Figure 2: Step response for an unknown system 3 Second Order Systems Figure 3: Circuit 2 is an RLC circuit. x(t) is the input voltage and y(t) is the output voltage. 1. On paper, determine the transfer function for circuit 2, leaving R, L and C as variables. 2. The transfer function should be in the form: 𝑌(𝑠) 𝑋(𝑆)= 𝑘𝜔𝑛 2 𝑠2 + 2𝜁𝜔𝑛𝑠 + 𝜔𝑛 2 . Find suitable values for R, L and C such that 𝜔𝑛=1; 𝜁= 1; k = 1. 3. Then, on paper, determine the step response. 4. In Matlab, plot a figure representing the calculated step response from the previous step. 5. In Matlab, use the tf and stepplot functions to plot a separate step response figure. 6. Compare figures from steps 4 and 5. 7. Calculate the time constant, rise time, settling time and percentage overshoot. 8. Use the Matlab bodeplot function to find the -3 dB frequency in radians and in Hz. 9.

Second Order Systems x(t) ELEN3014 – Modelling Tutorial 1 2023 3 You have two systems in two black boxes. Each box has two wires at one end for the input and two wires at the other end for the output. For each black box, you apply a unit step voltage at the input terminals and record and plot the output voltage over time. The two output plots are shown in Figure 4. 10. Can you assume that the systems in the black boxes are first order LTI systems? Explain. 11. Can you assume that the systems in the black boxes are second order LTI systems? Explain. 12. If you choose to model the black box systems as second order LTI RLC circuits, estimate a suitable transfer function to model the black box systems. Then estimate appropriate real-world values for R, L and C. It may be helpful to look at the percentage overshoot. Figure 4: Step responses for two black box systems","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
