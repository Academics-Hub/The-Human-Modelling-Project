First, the lungs must continuously oxygenate blood. Second, they should appropriately eliminate the carbon dioxide that accumulates through peripheral metabolic processes. Both effects should occur in keeping with the bodies demands for oxygen and the elimination of carbon dioxide which may change depending on levels of activity. Diseases of the respiratory system may quickly result in an inability to oxygenate blood or to eliminate carbon dioxide either at rest or during exercise, changes which ultimately threaten our survival. A variety of disease processes may contribute toward these changes, but a useful approach to these diseases is to consider them as diseases that produce alterations in pulmonary ventilation or gas exchange defects. Pulmonary ventilation problems usually occur because of a few conditions including those that decrease our capacity to breathe (such as in brain damage or abnormalities of the chest that prevent inspiration and expiration), obstruction of the airways (such as may occur in asthma), or with collapse or destruction of the alveoli (such as in infections or in premature infants). Gas exchange abnormalities are commonly caused by problems which result in a reduced diffusion across the respiratory (alveolar) membrane (such as in infections) or where ventilated alveoli may not receive much blood, whilst perfused alveoli may not receive much air (ventilation/perfusion mismatches). An inability to appropriately ventilate the lungs may cause problems with both a reduced capacity to oxygenate blood or eliminate carbon dioxide. In contrast, because carbon dioxide can diffuse very well, even across damaged alveolar membranes, gas exchange problems usually reduce the capacity to oxygenate blood, whilst the ability to eliminate carbon dioxide from the blood is maintained. Although lung disease can progress to a point where abnormalities of blood oxygenation or carbon dioxide elimination are noted, the appropriately prepared health professional should recognize that the main goal of health care is to prevent these diseases from progressing to this point. To do this, health professionals are required to perform a few lung function tests that detect the early stages of these lung diseases, well before abnormalities in blood oxygenation or carbon dioxide elimination occur. Moreover, these tests, depending on the characteristic changes noted, often assist us in identifying the cause of the pulmonary abnormality and thus contribute to diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. In this regard, lung diseases are often categorized as being either obstructive or restrictive diseases in their characteristics (see explanation below). Furthermore, lung function tests may assist with monitoring the success of therapy in patients. The point of the present practical is therefore in- part to expose you to some clinically important lung function tests, to provide you with an opportunity to appreciate the effect of obstructive or restrictive lung disease on these lung functions, and to provide you with an opportunity to use deductive reasoning to form logical clinical decisions based on abnormalities of these assessments. 2 Patients with early lung disease may not notice a shortness of breath at rest, because normal ventilatory (lung) reserves allow for marked increases in ventilation volumes and rates. By increasing the depth or frequency of respiration at rest, patients may therefore adequately compensate for the presence of lung disease. However, with exercise, when increases in oxygen are required to accommodate exercising skeletal muscle, patients with early lung disease may not be able to further increase ventilation volumes or rate, and hence may note a reduced exercise tolerance or breathlessness with exercise. An additional point of the present practical is therefore to highlight for you the extent of the ventilatory (lung) reserves that we all have and for you to appreciate the impact of lung disease on these ventilatory reserves. Importantly, clinical cases are provided in these practical sessions against which you should compare your findings and answer the questions given. Much of the clinical data of the “paper” patient’s given to you during this practical session can be found in the appendix. You should, however, obtain the missing data from information provided at the practical. Before beginning with the practical it is important that you have a sound grasp of the different pulmonary problems (pathophysiological categories) that may cause abnormalities of lung function. Generally, very different abnormalities in lung functions may be noted in patients with obstructive as compared to those with restrictive lung disease. Hence, a brief description of these lung diseases is required. Figure 1. Lung changes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Breakdown of tissue in- between alveoli contributing to a confluence and enlargement of alveoli Normal lung tissue Lung tissue in COPD Thick-walled bronchioles which increase the resistance to airflow and contribute to air-trapping 3 Obstructive versus restrictive lung disease Obstructive lung disease occurs because the lumen of the airways is narrowed. This commonly occurs in diseases such as asthma, where bronchiolar smooth muscle is contracted and excess mucous fills the airways, or in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a problem that is closely associated with smoking, where the bronchiolar walls are thickened, and the airways are similarly filled with mucus (see Figure 1). In obstructive lung disease the narrowed airway prevents rapid expiration. The consequence is that air “trapping” tends to occur, and lung volumes measured after maximal expiration tend to increase. Although there are large lung volumes, the speed of expiration is still reduced. In contrast, restrictive lung disease occurs because of damage to the lung parenchyma or surrounding tissues, or because of chest wall distortion, changes that limit the ability to inspire or reduce the alveolar area and hence reduce lung volumes. The speed of expiration will also be reduced, but only because there is far less air to breath out than normal. These disease processes therefore result in very different abnormalities of lung function with obstructive lung diseases causing increased total lung volumes because of the air trapping, but a reduced speed of expiration relative to the volume of air that can be breathed out. In contrast, restrictive lung diseases cause reduced lung volumes, but a normal speed of expiration relative to the total volume of air that can be breathed out. In the following practical you will be given an opportunity to measure many of the lung functions which allow you as future health practitioners to distinguish between obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. You will also be given the opportunity, from lung function data given in the cases provided in the appendix, to use deductive reasoning to identify patients with obstructive or restrictive lung disease. Furthermore, during the practical sessions you will simulate obstructive or restrictive lung disease by either partially obstructing air flow whilst breathing, or by physically restricting inspiration. Practical stations STATION A: Lung volumes (using LabStation). STATION B: Peak expiratory flow rate and the effect of lung disease (Using a Peak flow meter). STATION C: Flow-volume loops and the effect of lung disease (Using WINSPIRO PRO). By the end of today's practical you should be able to: • Relate your recorded lung volumes and capacities, to those of a typical person of the same gender, height, and age. • Perform pulmonary function tests, describe the common measurements made from them Peak expiratory flow rate and relate these measurements to those of a typical person of the same gender, height, and age. • Describe the effect of airway restrictions on FVC and FEV1 as influenced by different lung diseases. 4 STATION A Lung volumes Although in clinical practise the measurement of static lung volumes (absolute volume as opposed to the rate of change of volume) has largely been replaced by the recording of dynamic flow- volume loops (dynamic lung volume measurements involve assessments of the rate of change in lung volume), the measurement of static lung volumes illustrates some critical concepts of lung physiology that are otherwise lost to undergraduate students. The measurement of static lung volumes clearly allows for a demonstration of the extent of ventilatory (lung) reserves that healthy individual have available to them. These reserves may be demonstrated through the measurement of maximal inspiratory (inspiratory capacity) and expiratory volumes and the calculation of INSPIRATORY and EXPIRATORY RESERVE VOLUMES (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Static lung volumes that can be recorded using spirometry. Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) = Inspiratory capacity (IC) - Tidal volume (TV). Expiratory reserve volume (ERV) = Vital capacity (VC) – Inspiratory capacity (IC). The following practical will allow you to measure and observe the reserve volumes (inspiratory and expiratory) within your own lungs and hence to appreciate the capacity available to increase ventilation when this is required. 5 Figure 3: Experimental set-up for spirometry Scan the QR code below to watch a demonstrative video for this station. Equipment setup ➢ Connect the Spirometer Pod to Input 1 on the PowerLab. ➢ The Spirometer Pod is sensitive to temperature and tends to drift during warm-up. To prevent this, turn on the PowerLab at least 5 minutes before use. Then place the Spirometer Pod on a shelf or beside the PowerLab, away from the PowerLab power supply. ➢ Connect the two plastic tubes from the flow head to the short pipes on the back of the Spirometer Pod. ➢ Attach clean-bore tubing, a filter, and a mouthpiece to the flow head. ➢ Make sure you have extra mouthpieces and disposable air filters for each volunteer. Also, make sure to have a measuring tape to measure the volunteer's height. NB: As comparisons are to be made you should use the SAME participant for ALL the experiments. Part A: Lung volumes at rest NB: To calculate volume from the flow recording correctly it is crucial that recording be started prior to breathing through the flow head. It is difficult to breathe normally when you are consciously thinking about it. It is essential that the volunteer sits comfortably in a position from which the computer cannot be seen (have the participant face away from the computer screen). ➢ Leave the flow head apparatus undisturbed on the bench and select Zero Inputs. This will reset the offset of the Flow channel to zero. 6 Procedure: ➢ Measure the height (cm) of the participant without shoes using any of the stadiometers in the laboratory. You will also need the weight (kg). ➢ Ask the volunteer to put on the nose clip. If possible, leave the nose clip on for the entire demonstration to promote breathing through the mouth. This ensures that all air breathed passes through the mouthpiece, filter, and flow head. ➢ To calculate volume from the flow, start recording before breathing through the flow head. ➢ Type in the dialogue box “AT REST” and click START. The signal should show a downward deflection on expiration. ➢ Select Start to record. The mouthpiece can now be put into the volunteer's mouth. ➢ Hold the flow head with two hands with the plastic tubing pointed upwards. Caution: If the signal deflects upward stop recording and swap the tubular connections on either the back of the Spirometer Pod or the flow head. ➢ After 5-6 breathes ask the volunteer to inhale as deeply as possible at the end of tidal expiration and then to immediately exhale as deeply as possible. Then allow the volunteer to resume normal tidal breathing for a few seconds before you STOP the recording. ➢ Observe the data. Select Auto Scale if required. Expiration should be a downward deflection. ➢ When the volunteer has become accustomed to the apparatus, select Stop. ➢ Make sure the volunteer keeps the nose clip on and breathes through the mouth. To determine your colleague’s lung volumes and capacities complete the table below as follows: Table 1: Lung volumes at rest Lung volumes Sex (gender) Height Age (years) Predicted RV (L) Predicted CV (L) Predicted FRC (L) Predicted TLC (L) 7 PART B1: Dynamic lung volumes and capacities & The effects of exercise ➢ Move to the next page for “Dynamic lung volumes and capacities” Procedure ➢ Zero the Spirometer Pod using the Zero Inputs button. Remember that the flow head must be left undisturbed on the bench during the zeroing process. ➢ Key in the comment “LUNG CAPACITY PROCEDURE (LCP)” ➢ Select Start to record. Ask the volunteer to breathe normally for approximately 20 seconds. ➢ Prepare the comment \"FVC procedure\". ➢ Ask the volunteer to slowly inhale until no more air can be inspired and hold for 1 second. Then exhale forcefully and for as long as possible, until no more air can be expired. ➢ Enter the comment \"FVC procedure\" in the comment bar. ➢ Allow the volunteer's breathing to return to normal, then select Stop. ➢ Repeat these steps, so that you have three (3) separate FVC recordings. Part B2: Effect of exercise on lung volumes ➢ Remove the nose clip and ask the volunteer to perform some burpees exercise (moderately) for two minutes. While another member key the word “Exercise” in the dialogue box (Do not press Enter). ➢ Immediately after the exercise let the volunteer put on the nose clip and mouthpiece; click START to record the breathing and simultaneously add the comment “EXERCISE”. ➢ Record 5-6 breathes, ask the volunteer to inhale as deeply as possible at the end of tidal expiration and then to immediately exhale as deeply as possible. ➢ Ask the volunteer to slowly inhale until no more air can be inspired and hold for 1 second. Then exhale forcefully and for as long as possible, until no more air can be expired. ➢ Enter the comment \"Post exercise FVC procedure\" in the comment bar. ➢ Allow the volunteer's breathing to return to normal, then select Stop. ➢ Repeat these steps, so that you have three (3) separate FVC recordings. Analysis ➢ Use the scroll bar to locate the \"At Rest\" comment. ➢ Use the region selector to select a portion of normal tidal breathing. Do not select the areas with gaps at the beginning of the recording. ➢ Enter the respiratory rate from the value panel into the \"Normal Breathing\" column in the table. ➢ Place the Marker at the beginning (trough) of a normal tidal inspiration in the Volume channel. 8 ➢ Place the point selector on the peak. Enter the difference in volume (Δ Volume) from the value panel into the \"Tidal volume (VT)\" cell of the table. The expired minute volume will be calculated for you. Inspiratory reserve volume: ➢ Use the scroll bar to locate the \"lung capacity procedure\" comment. ➢ Place the Marker at the end of a normal tidal inspiration (peak). ➢ Place the point selector at the maximum point of inspiration (peak). ➢ Enter the value from the Volume value panel into the \"IRV\" cell of the table Expiratory reserve volume: ➢ Place the Marker at the maximum point of expiration (trough). ➢ Place the point selector at the beginning of a normal tidal inspiration (trough). ➢ Enter the value from the Volume value panel into the \"ERV\" cell of the table. Repeat the above analysis for post EXERCISE and complete the table below Note that volume should be a positive value! If not, check the positions of the Marker and point selector.

This will display the PIF in the Flow Value panel. ➢ Enter this value into the \"Normal Breathing\" column of the table. Peak expiratory flow: ➢ Place the point selector on the trough (minimum value) in the Flow channel. This is the PEF. That is, the most negative value. ➢ Enter this value into the \"Normal Breathing\" column of the table. Forced vital capacity: ➢ In the Volume channel, determine which of the 3 recordings shows the greatest or \"maximal\" FVC. ➢ In the Volume channel, place the point selector at the end of the plateau, directly before the steep decrease in volume. ➢ Place the Marker at the point of maximal expiration (trough). ➢ Enter the values from the Time and Volume value panels into the table. Forced expiratory volume in one second: ➢ Use the same recording that gave a maximal FVC. ➢ Leave the point selector where it is from the analysis of FVC. ➢ Place the Marker 1 second to the right of the point selector. ➢ Enter the value from the Volume value panel into the FEV1 cell of the table. ➢ The ratio of FEV1 to FVC expressed as a percentage will be calculated for you. 10 Table 3: Students’ pulmonary function analysis: Respiratory parameter Units Normal breathing Post Exercise Peak inspiratory flow (PIF) L/s Peak expiratory flow (PEF) L/s Time for forced vital capacity (FVC) S Forced vital capacity L Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) L % FVC expired (in 1second) % Questions 1.

Give physiological explanations for your answers, predict the changes in static lung volumes that may be noted in CASES A, B and C in the appendix to this practical. STATION B Peak expiratory flow rate and the effect of lung disease (USING A PEAK FLOW METER) The measurement of peak expiratory flow rate is simple, inexpensive, and extremely valuable with respect to detecting lung disease in the early stages or monitoring the effects of therapy in patients with underlying lung disease. It is performed using a simple device called a Wright’s peak flow meter (see below photograph and STATION B). Moreover, many patients are advised to obtain their own peak flow meter to monitor their therapy at home. This is particularly useful to asthmatic patients, whom may need to administer more or less of their therapy depending on their lung functions at the time. In addition, peak expiratory flow rate is an assessment of dynamic lung function in that it measures the maximal speed of expiration (the volume of air exhaled in a given period). This 11 measurement is important in the diagnosis of lung disease. Diseases that cause obstructive lung disease reduce peak expiratory flow rate because of the resistance in the airways to expiration. In contrast, diseases that cause restrictive lung disease reduce peak expiratory flow rate not because of an increased resistance to air flow on expiration, but because there is simply less air to exhale (reduced inspiration). You will be given the opportunity in the present practical to assess the effect of simulation of obstructive and restrictive lung disease on peak expiratory flow rate. Figure 3: Demonstration of the Peak expiratory flow volume Scan the QR code below to watch a demonstrative video for this station. To determine the peak expiratory flow rate and to assess the effect of simulated lung disease on peak expiratory flow rate at STATION B you should complete the following task. PART 1: NORMAL peak expiratory flow rate - Check that the marker on the Wright’s peak flow meter is at the minimal value on the scale and insert a clean mouthpiece. - Place a nose clip on your nose - During the following procedure ensure that you do not lean forward when exhaling and that the instrument is always held in a horizontal position. - Inhale to a maximal extent and place your lips around the mouthpiece of the meter before exhaling as hard as possible into the device. - Repeat the procedure 3 times and record the data. - To determine whether your value is normal use the recorded height (cm) and compare your value with the data (chart) provided in the figure 4 below. 1. Peak expiratory flow rate (first try) = vs expected value (figure 4): 2. Peak expiratory flow rate (second try) = vs expected value (figure 4): 3. Peak expiratory flow rate (third try) = vs expected value (figure 4): 12 PART 2: OBSTRUCTED peak expiratory flow rate (With a mouthpiece that obstructs air flow) - Using a mouthpiece which partially obstructs airway flow, repeat the above procedure, and record the values 1. Peak expiratory flow rate (first try) = 2. Peak expiratory flow rate (second try) = 3. Peak expiratory flow rate (third try) = PART 3: RESTRICTED peak expiratory flow rate (With a strap around the chest) - After placing a strap around the volunteer’s chest and other students holding the strap tight, repeat the above procedure and record the values 1. Peak expiratory flow rate (first try) = 2. Peak expiratory flow rate (second try) = 3. Peak expiratory flow rate (third try) = Questions 1. Give a physiological explanation for the changes in peak expiratory flow rate noted with a a) mouthpiece that obstructs air flow. b) strap held tightly around the chest. 2. Using the data provided in CASE A, B and C in the appendix to this practical to assist you with your answer, explain the peak expiratory flow rate in these patients. 3. Explain the changes in peak expiratory flow rate noted in response to the β-adrenergic receptor agonist and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor in CASE B of the appendix to this practical. 13 Figure 4: Normal values for peak expiratory flow according to age, sex, and height 14 STATION C Flow-volume loops Although peak expiratory flow rate is a simple and cheap clinical tool to assess dynamic lung function, it does not allow the discerning health professional the capacity to differentiate between obstructive and restrictive lung disease. Consequently, alternative more costly tools are required to allow for this assessment. Devices that assess the “flow-volume loop” are clinically relevant measurement systems that allow for the assessment of dynamic lung volumes. In addition to a number of other dynamic lung volume measurements, in the assessment of the flow-volume loop, important measures include the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (maximal volume of air breathed out in one second) and the forced vital capacity (FVC) (maximal volume of air breathed out irrespective of how rapid exhalation occurs) which is equivalent to the vital capacity (VC) and these two measures do allow for a diagnosis of obstructive or restrictive lung disease. A typical example of a flow-volume loop obtained from a normal adult is shown in Figure 4. You should note the start of inspiration and the end of expiration in the loop. You should also note that to obtain these recordings, inspiration and expiration should be at maximal volumes and conducted as fast as possible. Importantly, from the flow-volume loop, the observer is also able to determine the peak expiratory flow rate (the measurement obtained from the Wrights peak flow meter). The reason we can differentiate between obstructive and restrictive lung disease using the flow- volume loop is as follows: - In obstructive lung disease, the total lung volume exhaled may be normal, but the capacity to exhale this volume in one second is markedly diminished. Thus, the FEV1/FVC ratio is reduced. - In contrast, in restrictive lung disease, the total lung volume exhaled is reduced, and consequently the capacity to exhale this volume in one second is also diminished. However, because both FEV1 and FVC are reduced to the same extent, the patient with restrictive lung disease will have a normal FEV1/FVC ratio - In addition to the measurements of FEV1 and FVC, the flow-volume loop also offers a quick assessment of characteristic patterns observed in different respiratory ailments. These typical effects may be noted in CASES A, B and C in the appendix to the present practical. 15 A: Adult respiratory flow volume loop B: Different flow volume loops under different lung diseases Figure 5 A & B. A typical respiratory flow-volume loop obtained in a normal adult. You should note the start of inspiration on the right side and the end of expiration also on the right side. The arrows indicate the direction of the recording. The data obtained during inspiration is in the lower half of the figure and that for expiration is in the upper half of the figure. FVC is the forced vital capacity (or vital capacity) and FEV1 is the forced expiratory volume in one second. 16 STATION C Flow-volume loops PERFORMED ON WINSPIRO PRO Software Scan the QR code below to watch a demonstrative video for this station To determine your dynamic lung functions from a flow-volume loop and to assess the effect of simulated lung disease on the flow-volume loop you should complete the following task. - Open Winspiro PRO on the desktop. Select the head icon and select ‘new’ to add new patient. - Fill in the following details: ID (student number), name, DoB, and location. Select relevant gender (leave out other details); select ‘save’ - On the next pop-up, fill in the height and weight and select ‘OK’ - On the next pop-up, fill in smoking history and select ‘OK’ - Close the ‘Clinical file’ window. Check that the correct patient is selected before proceeding. - Click on ‘FVC’ to begin recording your flow volume loop. - Part 1 (Normal breathing): With your mouth away from the mouthpiece + SPIROBANK II, perform a DEEP INSPIRATION (not into the mouthpiece) and then EXHALE INTO the mouthpiece attached to the SPIROBANK II as deeply as possible until you form a loop. - Observe the recording to ensure that it appears similar to that shown in Figure 5; you can repeat this 2 times. Note colour of the volume loop with each attempt, to ensure you analyse the correct data. - Part 2: Obstructed breathing: Use a mouthpiece that partially obstructs airflow (use the provided tape to obstruct the end of your mouthpiece. Pierce small holes and put over the filter). Repeat the above exercise by performing a deep inspiration (not into the mouthpiece) and then forcefully exhaling INTO the restricted mouthpiece. - NB: repeating the procedure too many times creates too many flow volume loops and thus makes analysis challenging. Thus, ensure you are ready before you continue with the Obstructive and restrictive parts, as they will be superimposed on the first (normal breathing volume loop). - Part 3: Restricted breathing: Remove the restrictive simulation (obstructive tape). Using the original mouthpiece place a strap around the volunteer’s chest and with other students holding the strap as tightly as possible around the volunteer’s (or have it tied around the volunteer’s chest very tightly). - Repeat the above exercise by performing a deep inspiration (not into the mouthpiece) and then forcefully exhaling INTO the obstructed mouthpiece. 17 Analyse the given results and determine the below values. 1) Without simulating lung disease a. Forced vital capacity (FVC) = b. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) = c. FEV1/FVC ratio = d. Peak expiratory flow rate = 2) Simulation of obstructive lung disease a.
