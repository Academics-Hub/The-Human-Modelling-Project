This causes a large conformational shift in the ‘lever arm’ of myosin that bends the myosin head into a position further along the filament. The ‘Power Stroke’of myosin •Step 4: The myosin head makes weak contact with the actin filament and a slight conformational change occurs on myosin that promotes the release of the inorganic phosphate. •Step 5: The release of inorganic phosphate reinforces the binding interaction between myosin and actin and subsequently triggers the ‘power stroke’. The power stroke is the key force-generating step used by myosin motor proteins. Forces are generated on the actin filament as the myosin protein reverts back to its original conformation. •Step 6: As myosin regains its original conformation, the ADP is released, but the myosin head remains tightly bound to the filament at a new position from where it started, thereby bringing the cycle back to the beginning. Release of Pi + ATP: ‘rigor’ position Before ATP cleavage: bent and flexed The ‘Power Stroke’ of myosinCytoskeletal motor proteins •Myosin –muscle contraction –intracellular cargo transport Myosin uses ATP to “power”our muscles •part of actomyosin-driven contractile molecular motors, wherein the thin (actin) filaments serve as tensile platforms for myosin's ATP-dependent pulling action in muscle contraction. Cytoskeletal motor proteinsCytoskeletal motor proteins Myosin uses ATP to “power”our muscles •Each myosin performs only a tiny molecular motion. •It takes about 2 trillion myosin molecules to provide the force to hold up a baseball. •Our biceps have a million times this many, so only a fraction of the myosin molecules need to be exerting themselves at any given time. •About 300 myosin molecules bind together, with all of the long tails bound tightly together into a large \"thick filament”. •By working together, the tiny individual power stroke of each myosin is summed to provide macroscopic power in our familiar world. Cytoskeletal motor proteins •Kinesin –ATP-dependent motor proteins –Kinesins move along microtubules –“walk” towards the positive end of a microtubule: transports cargo from the centre of the cell towards the periphery (away form the nucleus) –Cargo: vesicles (containing protein and membrane components) and organelles such as mitochondria Cytoskeletal motor proteins microtubule •Kinesin •Two mechanisms proposed for “walking”: –\"hand-over-hand\" mechanism: kinesin heads step past one another, alternating the lead position (more likely mechanism) –\"inchworm\" mechanism, one kinesin head always leads, moving forward a step before the trailing head catches up. Cytoskeletal motor proteins •Kinesin •“hand-over-hand” –At each step, one motor domain holds on tightly while the other one releases its hold, flips up to the next step on the microtubule, and grabs on there. Thus, ATP binding and hydrolysis cause kinesin to travel via a seesaw mechanism about a pivot point. –binding of ATP to the microtubule-bound leading head results in a tilting of the domains relative to the microtubule. –ATP cleavage = detachment of rear head from microtubule Cytoskeletal motor proteins •Dynein Cytoplasmic dynein: • Transports various cellular cargo along cytoskeletal microtubules towards the minus-end of the microtubule (towards cell centre) Cytoskeletal motor proteins •Dynein Axonemal dynein: • sliding of microtubules in the axonemes of eukaryotic cilia and flagella Cytoskeletal motor proteins •FOF1-ATP synthase –Convert the electrochemical potential energy of a proton gradient across a membrane to chemical energy in ATP –ATP synthesis in the mitochondria and chloroplasts Rotary motor proteinsRotary motor proteins Electron transport chain of cellular respiration Rotary motor proteinsRotary motor proteins FOF1-ATP synthase •FO motor uses the power from a proton gradient to force the F1 motor to generate ATP –In our cells, food is broken down and used to pump hydrogen ions across the mitochondrial membrane. –The FO portion of ATP synthase allows these ions to flow back, turning the rotor in the process. –As the rotor turns, it turns the axle/shaft and the F1 motor becomes a generator, creating ATP as parts turns inside it.
