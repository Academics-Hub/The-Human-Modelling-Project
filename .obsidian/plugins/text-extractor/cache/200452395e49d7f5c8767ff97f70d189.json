GLUCAGON • Secretion: stimulated by low blood glucose concentration. • Stimulates: breakdown of glucose stores (glycogen). • de novo synthesis of glucose (gluconeogenesis). • use of fat for energy (lipolysis) • Inhibits: the use of glucose for energy (glycolysis). • increases blood glucose concentration. • Other hormones that affect glucose metabolism: Adrenaline, Cortisol and Thyroid Hormone When glucose is abundant (i.e. post-meal) – glucose is taken up and stored in liver as glycogen Between meals, when blood glucose is low, glycogen in liver is broken down to return glucose to blood. Breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis) * * = Need to know * n = a large number of glucose units Only liver has glucose-6- phosphatase (allows glucose release back into blood). Notes on glycogenolysis • Glycogen phosphorylase. - activated by glucagon & adrenaline which phosphorylate it. Stimulated by glucagon or adrenaline in liver and by adrenaline in muscle • Activated by Ca2+ in working muscle. • Inhibited by insulin which dephosphorylates it. • Glycogen phosphorylase uses Pi to cleave the terminal α1-4 bonded glucose from glycogen to give glucose-1P. • When the α1-4 bonded glucose chain gets too short, debranching enzyme moves glucose chains from the branches to the end of the α1-4 bonded glucose chain. • Glucose-1-P is converted to glucose-6-P by phosphoglucomutase. • Glucose-6-P muscle cannot leave the muscle cells and enters glycolysis -> energy production. • In liver, glucose-6-phosphatase dephosphorylates glucose-6P to glucose, which is released into the blood. -> maintain blood glucose concentration. • G6Pase is inhibited by insulin.

REVIEW ARTICLE Hormonal regulation of glycogen synthesis and glycogenolysis + = stimulates - = inhibits Glycogen synthesis Glycogen breakdown • Insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis in liver and muscle via activation of glycogen synthase (dephosphorylation) and increased activity of glucokinase in LIVER, which increases production of glucose-6-phosphate. • Glucagon and adrenaline inhibit glycogen synthesis in LIVER and adrenaline inhibits synthesis in MUSCLE by inhibiting glycogen synthase (by phosphorylation). • Adrenaline and glucagon stimulate glycogenolysis in LIVER, via activation of liver glycogen phosphorylase (phosphorylation). • Ca2+ and adrenaline stimulate glycogenolysis in MUSCLE, via activation of muscle glycogen phosphorylase. • Insulin inhibits glycogenolysis by inhibiting glycogen phosphorylase (by dephosphorylation). Hormonal regulation of glycogen stores Glycogen storage diseases • Type 1 - Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency. hypoglycaemia, hepatomegaly. Cannot maintain plasma glucose • Type III – Glycogen debranching enzyme deficiency. hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, muscle weakness. Cannot breakdown glycogen. • Type V - Muscle glycogen phosphorylase deficiency. no hypoglycemia or hepatomegaly, exercise-induced cramps and rabdomyolisis. Muscles only More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_storage_disease Non-carbohydrate sources in the liver (and kidneys) include: • Amino acids (most important are alanine and aspartic acid) • Pyruvate • Lactate • Glycerol And energy/ATP is consumed N.B.

The means by which substances produced in the periphery, lactate (anaerobic waste) and amino acids (i.e. alanine) are transported to liver for further energy production or for gluconeogenesis when blood glucose is low The Cori Cycle Skin cells Skeletal muscle 2 Pyruvate The Cori cycle Amino acid + pyruvate keto acid + alanine alanine alanine pyruvate + glutamate glucose glucose glucose Transamination (ALT) GlycolysisGluconeogenesis LIVER MUSCLE Urea cycle Cortisol stimulates breakdown of muscle protein The alanine/glucose-alanine cycle Summary Cori and glucose-alanine cycles Cori cycle. • Lactate produced by red blood cells and anaerobic glycolysis in muscles is released into the blood and transported to the liver, • converted back to pyruvate and used for gluconeogenesis. The newly synthesised glucose is released into the blood and used again as a substrate for anaerobic glycolysis. Glucose-alanine cycle. • When blood glucose is low, muscle protein is broken into amino acids. Amino groups from the amino acids are combined with pyruvate from glycolysis to form alanine, which is released into the blood. • In the liver alanine is converted back to pyruvate and used for gluconeogenesis. The new glucose is released into the blood and used again as a substrate for glycolysis. Gluconeogenesis: Note 1 • Gluconeogenesis occurs when blood glucose is low, i.e. when insulin is low and glucagon is high. • Under these conditions most cells metabolise fatty acids for energy, producing acetyl-CoA. • Gluconeogenesis is reversal of glycolysis, 3 steps of glycolysis are irreversible, so different reactions are needed to bypass them/overcome the energy barriers. • synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate molecules, • lactate and pyruvate from cells undergoing anaerobic glycolysis • amino acids from breakdown of proteins (muscle) or • glycerol (NOT FATTY ACIDS) from breakdown of triacylglycerol (fats). • occurs only in the liver and to a small degree in the kidneys. • consumes more ATP equivalents than glycolysis provides. • occurs when blood glucose is low, i.e. when insulin is low and glucagon is high. Under these conditions, most tissues (especially liver) depend on catabolism of fatty acids to ketones, rather than glucose, for production of ATP (energy). • catabolism of fatty acids produces acetyl-CoA which can be used in the liver for energy from ketones but not in the gluconeogenic pathway.
