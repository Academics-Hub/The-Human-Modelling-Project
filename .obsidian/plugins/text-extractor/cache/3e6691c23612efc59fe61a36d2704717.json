LEE BALDWIN* Metabolic Laboratory, Animal Science Department, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523 and *Department of Animal Science, university of California, Davis, CA 95616 ABSTRACT Liverand gastrointestinal tract weights (ingesta- and adipose-free) appear to increase or de crease in direct proportionto dietary intake withinand across physiological stages of maintenance, growth, fattening or lactation. Liverand gut mass increase -15 and 30 g per unit of liveweight raised to the 0.75 power (Wt075)for each multipleof 500 kJ/WtÂ°75[-1 x main tenance (M)] increase in metabolizable energy (ME) intake, with linearity indicated up to the highest re corded level (4.5 x M). Extrapolation from in vivo arteriovenous O,^measurements across splanchnic tissues and from the previously cited weight informa tion indicates that liverandgut tissue oxidize -3.5 and 1.0 kJ of ME/g of fresh tissue daily, in contrast to whole-animal rates of 0.1 kJ/g. Thus, energy use by the relatively small amount of liver and gut accounts for 45 to 50% of whole-animal heat energy. On a differential basis, increases in energy use by these tissues appear to account for up to 70% of the heat increment of ME use above maintenance. J. Nutr. 120:649-655, 1990. INDEXINGKEYWORDS: â€¢energy â€¢visceral organ â€¢ruminants This paper characterizes changes in visceral organ mass and parallel changes in energy use by these tissues in sheep and cattle in response to changing diet intake. The functional workload concept, simplified largely as metabolizable energy intake, is considered as an expla nation of the changes in mass, function and resulting energy consumption by these tissues. Related reviews concerning the importance of visceral organ mass in animal energetics (1-3) and in gastrointestinal tract adaptation and growth (4,5)have also recently appeared. GASTROINTESTINAL HYPERTROPHY The presence of food in the gut evokes a host of responses, including peptide hormonal stimulation, in duction of specific amino acid and sugar transporters and generalized increases in the mass of mucosal and related gut tissue. The ability of the gastrointestinal tract to change is dramatically illustrated in the new born (6).Sections of the baby pig small intestine increase in weight by 41 to 72% in just 24 h and continue to an approximately fourfold increase in weight after 10 d of suckling (Table 1).Length of the baby pig small intestine increases -80% during this 10-d period. Mucosal mass nearly doubles the first day, with only small increases during the following 9 d. The adaptability of gut mucosa is also evident following gut resection. If the upper half of the small intestine is removed, the remaining half can double its glucose transport per unit length of intestine (7)by increasing villus height and functional absorptive surface (8). The concept that tissues in the body expand or regress in response to their functional workload has been con sidered for many body organs and has been described as an economy of nature (9).An interesting illustration of this concept has been developed in a comparison of gut adaptations in mammals compared to reptiles (10). Mammals the same size as reptiles require 5 to 10times more feed for maintenance and move food through the gut 10 times faster, and yet they digest nutrients with equal efficiency. Mammals also have a sevenfold higher 'Presented as part of the 30th Annual Ruminant Nutrition Con ference: Influence of Gut Metabolism on Nutrient Supply, given at the 73rd Annual Meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, New Orleans, LA, March 19, 1989, and sup ported by grants from American Cyanamid Company; Cargill, Nutrena Feed Division; Carl S.

Values for ileum and gastrointesti nal tract (GIT) are expressed as grams per empty body weight (EBW) (measured in kilograms) raised to the 0.75 power. capacity for glucose and proline uptake in the small intestine, and yet each functional unit, the enterocyte, appear to function remarkably similarly in the two types of animals. The evolution of the mammal produced a sixfold increase in gastrointestinal surface area through an amplification of mucosal mass roughly proportional to food requirements. The mechanism(s) by which food or nutrient com plexes in the gut induce intestinal mucosal hypertrophy is not known. In the small intestine, however, responses relate to absorption rather than metabolism. When ac tively absorbed but nonmetabolized nutrients (e.g., lac tose, methylglucoside and sodium chloride) were infused into isolated intestinal sacs from rats, they stimulated hypertrophy similarly to glucose (11). How ever, when a nutrient that was not actively absorbed but that was metabolized (e.g., marinÃ³se) was infused, no hypertrophy occurred. Hydrolysis of disaccharides also stimulates intestinal hypertrophy (12). Disaccharide in fusions stimulated hypertrophy more than monosac- charides did, but not if hydrolysis was blocked. Thus, disaccharidase function appears to add to functional workload stimulation. INTAKE-INDUCED CHANGES IN ORGAN WEIGHTS To investigate the relationship between visceral organ hypertrophy and diet, we examined data from four sheep and three cattle experiments in which nonadipose organ mass was measured at varying but surmisable metabolizable energy (ME) intakes, which stabilized for at least 21 d before slaughter (Table 2). For comparison purposes, organ weights and intakes were expressed in ratio to empty body weight in kilograms raised to the 3/4 power (EBW075).Moderate to high concentrate diets (10 to 45% roughage) were generally fed at low and high planes of nutrition [~1 and 2 x maintenance (M)] in the seven growing-fattening trials, but diets were fed at up to 4.5 x M in the lactation trial. Lambs and steers fed at levels near maintenance had liver weights of -30 and 40 g/EBW075. High planes of nutrition increased these to 50 or 60 g/EBWÂ°75for the growing animals. The livers in the lactating Holsteins were about twice as large when expressed on this scale. The total weight of empty and largely fat-free gastroin testinal tract (GIT) averaged about 120 g/EBW075 in steers and lambs fed near maintenance whereas weights in lactating Holstein cows started at more than double this level. Although most of this high GIT weight in lactating cows appears related to their much higher ME intake, it is not clear whether this accounts for all of the difference from growing animals. Prior measurements with dry cows (ME intake not specified) indicated rela tively heavy GIT weights of -200 g/EBW0-75in Holstein and Jersey breeds (19). Less than half as much organ weight response to changing intake was found in the extensive plane of nutrition experiment with lambs by Ferrell et al. (15). Many factors are possibly involved such as gut dissec tion technique, animal age, diet, etc.; however, the 72-h fast before slaughter in their experiment probably caused a leveling effect across prior planes of nutrition. The 3-d fast may have depressed organ weights to a greater degree for those animals on high as compared to low planes of nutrition (15). In other research, a 50% decrease in intake from ad libitum levels reduced sheep liver and gut weights 25 and 12%, respectively, in just 5d(14). In spite of the heavier GIT noted for the one all-rough age diet (rÃ©f.14, pelleted dehydrated alfalfa) in the pres ent summary, varying forage levels at constant ME intake appears generally to have no effect on liver and GIT tissue weight. Varying diet grain equivalent from -15 to 85% had no effect on the empty, fat-free GIT weights of several bovine genotypes (20). Also, constant ME intake for 45 d of diets containing 10, 45 and 95% chopped alfalfa produced no changes in liver or GIT tissue weights of steers at slaughter (16) even though gut fill was markedly elevated. One forage treatment in this experiment (80% native grass) did elucidate GIT tissue weight by 20 to 25%. An attempt by our laboratory to repeat this observation with sheep fed another batch of native hay as compared to alfalfa was unsuccessful (unpublished data). Although errors and varied tech niques may be responsible for the discrepancies, the possibility of forage-associated GIT hypertrophie factors cannot be ruled out. The change in organ weight per unit of change in diet energy intake was similar across most of these experi ments with lambs, steers and lactating cows (Table 2; Fig. 1,2). Averaged across all experiments, liver weight increased 29 g and GIT weight increased 61 g for each dietary ME increase of 1 MJ. Because 500 kj (120 kcal)/EBWÂ°75approximates 1 x M, increasing consump tion by one multiple of maintenance is expected to increase liver and GIT weight by -14 and 28 g/Wt075.

ORGAN OXYGEN CONSUMPTION IN VITRO The development of biopsy procedures (21, 22) and the use of cell homogenates (23-25) to examine the response of liver and GIT in vitro to alterations in prior animal ME intake have provided important information about how the oxygen consumed by those tissues is partitioned to various productive functions (14, 21, 22, 26, 27). Despite differences in methodology or media composition, these data demonstrate the dynamic na ture of the gastrointestinal mucosa and liver tissue. The proportion of energy associated with nutrient and ion transport has paralleled energy intake (14,21,22,23,24, 25)in nearly all cases. Sheep switched from a fasted state to twice maintenance energy intakes showed a 2.5-fold increase in the proportion of respiration attributable to the Na*/K+-ATPasepump in duodenal biopsies (22).This same response has been seen in sheep hepatocytes, with 62% lower oxygen consumption from NaYK'-ATPase in fasted than in fed sheep (22). Despite these changes in the activity of Na*/K+-ATP- ase or in protein synthesis and degradation seen with alterations in physiological state or energy intake, few if any of these studies have shown a change in total respiration rate (Table 3). This is perhaps due to the specific techniques used. Krebs (29)demonstrated large differences in respiration rates with the same tissue incubated in different media. Levin and Syme (30)dem onstrated 60-fold differences in respiration rates from everted jejunal sacs in the presence of high or low oxygen tensions. Burrin et al. (28),using isolated hepa tocytes from fed and fasted rats, found higher total energy use levels in fed rats, but they were unable to show differences in total oxygen consumption when expressed per gram dry weight. When expressed per milligram DNA, however, the fasted rats had signifi- TABLE2 Liver and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) organ mass responses to changing plane of nutrition in sheep and cattle Ref Animal type Empty body wt Energy intake Liver wt GIT wt Organ wt/ME intake1 Liver GIT 13 Lamb un2 Lamb, ram 14 Lamb 15 Lamb, ram 16 Hereford steer 17 Angus steer 18 Holstein, lac tat mg kg 30 32 39 30 56 49 25 20 21 to 45 493 524 533 563 325 325 470 to 620 kJ/EBWÂ°7s 987 975 1192 456 1121 556 1016 506 326 to 1648 515 916 515 812 1067 473 1757 to 3138 g/EBWÂ°7s 39 39 50 29 48 35 59 39 29 to 45 41 55 39 47 60 43 85 to 133 g/EBWÂ°7S 150 154 162 124 149 119 223 183 99 to 133 111 138 116 142 162 140 283 to 395 Average3 g/MJ 25.8 52.1 23.1 39.4 14.3 33.5 28.6 26.3 29 53.1 78.9 21.7 71.0 53.9 56.9 61 'Calculated by regression across experimental group means except for rÃ©f.18, which examined the slope across 19 individual cows where r2 - 0.61 and 0.47 for liver and GTT mass related to ME intake, respectively.

Relating in vitro estimates of respiration to whole- organ in vivo measurements has proven successful for gut but not for liver tissue. Burrin et al. (13)found that in vitro ovine liver O2 uptake rates in vitro were only 9-13% of those measured with portal and hepatic cath eters in vivo. Also, as presented by McBride et al. (27), bovine liver in vitro Oi uptake equaled only -10% of in vivo rates. Daily energy use in vitro averages about 0.7 kj/g for liver and about 1.2 k}/g for gut mucosa. Huntington and McBride (3)related in vitro estimates of the relative proportion of Oi-consuming functions to in vivo whole-body Ozconsumption and concluded that Na*/K*-ATPaseactivity and protein synthesis in the gut and liver accounted for -17% of whole-body Oi con sumption. Twenty-nine percent of whole-body Oz con sumption could be accounted for when protein degradation and urea cycling were factored into their estimate. EVALUATINGSPLANCHNICTISSUE ENERGY USE FROM ARTERIOVENOÃœSO2 DIFFERENCE IN VIVO Portal blood flow increases acutely with an elevated workload of feeding (31, 32); it has also been shown to increase with a chronically raised workload (i.e., in creased ME intake). Webster (33)and Lomax and Baird (34) found a curvilinear increase in portal blood flow with increased ME intake, but Huntington (35) and Weighart et al. (36)found this relationship to be linear. Portal blood flow also increases with increasing concen trate intake (37) and is faster in lactating than in non- lactating cattle Â¡34,38-40).

The hepatic artery in dogs provides approximately one-third of the total liver blood flow but 50% of the O2 extracted (41). Oxygen extraction of uptake is well regulated in the liver (42), with maintenance of constant O2 uptake even with 50% reductions in hepatic flow (43). Amino acids and glucose infusion (44), gastrointestinal hor mones and glycogenolytic hormones all increase liver blood flow (45, 46). Energy use, calculated from O2 consumption of the portal-drained viscera (PDV) also increases with in creased ME intake (Table 4, Fig. 3). Changes with intake tend to parallel whole-body changes in energy use. Thus, the PDV energy use as a fraction of whole-body use remains remarkably constant, near 24% in several ex periments. Data with sheep (13, 31, 32), pigs (51) and lactating dairy cattle (52) on various levels of intake all fall within a range of 16 (49) to 29% (48). There may be important dietary factors that change the fraction, how ever. Reynolds and Tyrrell found a significant effect of diet on this percentage, with a high concentrate diet having a lower proportion of PDV energy cost than was found with a low concentrate diet (47). In vivo arteriovenous difference measurements show liver energy consumptions similar in magnitude to those by PDV (Table 4), averaging an additional 20% at 1 x M. Increasing the level of energy intake affected liver O2 consumption, blood flow and percentage liver O2 uptake/total body O2uptake (47). Liver O2 consumption as a percentage of whole-body O2 consumption has ranged from 18 (47) to 41% (13), with most estimates falling between 20 and 26% (13, 31, 47, 48, 52).

Oz to whole-body O2 consumption remains similar (53, 54). The differential increase in energy use by liver and PDV averaged 223 and 162 kj, respectively, per each megajoule of increased ME intake (Table 4). Within the limitations of measurement error, these differentials can be compared to a conventionally measured heat increment of ME use above maintenance. Some 45 to 70% of the heat increment of these diets appears to be accounted for by energy-consuming events in these two tissues. The in vivo energy consumption data of Table 4, in kJ/WtÂ°7S,can be divided by the tissue weights of Table 2, in g/WtÂ°75,after adjusting to common intake to yield estimates of energy use intensity and to allow compar ison to in vitro data (Table 5). At maintenance, liver and GIT use 2.4 and 0.9 kj/(g-d), in contrast to whole-animal rates of about 0.1 kj/(g-d). In vitro and in vivo O2 con sumption rates of mucosa are comparable for GIT, but in vitro incubations of liver have grossly underesti mated in vivo rates. It should be noted that the in vivo rates for GIT are likely biased high because O2 measures were for PDV, which includes visceral adipose and pan creas, which were not included in the GIT weights. The estimates compiled from the early in vitro and in vivo blood flow literature (19) are intended to apply to ani mals at maintenance. The values have been widely quoted to illustrate the high relative energetic intensity of splanchnic tissue; however, those values appear to still underestimate the tissue's joulic fury. The definition of factors that control or influence splanchnic energy or nutrient delivery to tissue may provide methods to understand and possibly control efficiency and composition of animal production.
