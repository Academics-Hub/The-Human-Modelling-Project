The absence of randomization of the label, seen when an equal oral load of 6-C-14-glucose is given, indicates that the glucose reaching the peripheral circulation has not been fragmented, then resynthesized into glucose. During the three-hour period, only 0.34 gm. per kilogram of new (un- labeled) glucose is released by liver instead of the 0.63 gm. per kilogram which would have been produced in the absence of oral glucose; the uptake of the glucose of peri- pheral circulating blood is 1.03 gm. per kilogram instead of 0.63 gm. per kilogram. Endogenous insulin secreted in response to the oral load exerts a somewhat larger effect to decrease hepatic glucose release (relative to the increase in glucose uptake from peripheral blood) than is the case when insulin is given by peripheral vein. DIABETES 17:415- 21, July, 1968. The glucose tolerance test, in which a glucose load is administered orally or intravenously, continues to serve as a useful indicator of abnormalities in glucose metabolism. The changes in blood glucose concentra- tion which form the basis for the interpretation of the test are influenced by several factors besides the rate of uptake of the glucose load by the tissues. The \"K value\" for the intravenous test, which ap- pears to represent the velocity constant of a first order disappearance process in which glucose concentration determines the rate of glucose uptake by the tissues, is most likely a hybrid number. The early fall in blood glucose concentration after intravenous glucose injection is hastened by the spreading of the injected load throughout the glucose space. This is evidenced From the Biology Department, Brookhaven National Lab- oratory, Upton, New York 11973, and the Department of Pharmacology, New York University Medical School, New York, New York 10016. by the mixing of injected C-14-glucose with the body glucose. This mixing process has a slow component and so becomes of negligible importance only after about forty-five minutes, at least in the dog. 1 While the above influence is losing its force, the influence of decreased glucose release by the liver is taking its place in hasten- ing the fall of the blood glucose concentration. This decrease in glucose release develops gradually 2 so that glucose release cannot reasonably be considered either 2ero or constant during the fall in blood glucose con- centration by which a \"K value\" is measured. The oral glucose tolerance test mimics more closely the situation met with in daily life. Moreover, it has been reported recently that the oral administration of glucose evokes the secretion of intestinal factors which secondarily stimulate insulin secretion above the level seen when glucose is given intravenously. 3' 4 It is con- ceivable that this greater amount of insulin, entering by way of the portal vein and so reaching the liver first, might shut off glucose release promptly and com- pletely. This might eliminate one of the variable factors which adds to the influence of increased glucose uptake in causing the fall of glucose concentration which is seen in the intravenous glucose tolerance test. For these reasons experiments were undertaken to measure in normal dogs the effect of an oral glucose load on endogenous glucose production and on glucose uptake from the blood by the tissues, along with measurements of plasma insulin concentration by im- munoassay. Simultaneous observations of the rate at which the administered glucose reached the circulation were made feasible by using U-C-14-glucose as the oral load and 6-C-i4-glucose to measure total glucose input (including endogenous glucose release) into the circulation. METHODS Trained dogs were kept on a standard diet which has been described. 2 A priming dose (30 JJLC) followed JULY, 1968 415Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article-pdf/17/7/415/343542/17-7-415.pdf by guest on 21 November 2023 GLUCOSE UPTAKE AND PRODUCTION DURING THE ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST by a continuous infusion (30 /-t.c/125 min.) of a trace amount (in saline) of 6-C-i4-glucose was administered to the eighteen-hour fasted dog by peripheral vein 2 for a three-hour period prior to stomach tube admin- istration of a bulk amount of an aqueous solution of U-C-14-glucose (1 gm. glucose kg. body weight; about 50 p.c total C-14; a total volume of about 100 ml.). Blood samples were collected (heparin) by way of an indwelling polyethylene catheter in the jugular vein, plasma was collected after centrifugation; the samples were taken at intervals prior to the oral glucose load, and for at least 180 minutes after administration of the load. The samples were analyzed for glucose content, 2 and for C-14 in the whole molecule (glucosotriazole derivative)2 and in carbon 6 only (dimedon derivative after periodate oxidation)5 by methods previously de- scribed. In one control experiment an unlabeled glucose load of the same size was given in the same way dur- ing intravenous 6-C-i4-glucose infusion in trace amount; in another control experiment no intravenous C-14- glucose was given, and the bulk oral glucose load contained 6-C-i4-glucose. Plasma insulin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay by a modification of the Yalow and Berson 6 technic. Correction for recycling of C-14 as determined during infusion of 6-C-14-glucose alone The C-14 activity in the dimedon derivative (carbon 6) of plasma glucose was expressed as /xc per gm. glucose carbon (includes weights of all carbon atoms, 1 through 6). Let this value be D. This value was less than the total C-14 content of the whole glucose molecule (also in jxc/gm. glucose carbon) as determined by the C-14 activity in the glucosotriazole derivative (carbons 1 through 6). Let the difference be E; this was the C-14 in carbons 1 through 5, which was due to resynthesis of glucose from three carbon fragments derived from plasma glucose taken up by the tissues. As is customarily done, 7 the assumption was made that the resynthesis of glucose puts an equal amount of C-14 back into carbons 1, 2, 5 and 6. Then D—1/3 E was the specific activity of the plasma glucose (in ju,c/gm. total glucose carbon) corrected for recycling of C-14. Separate contributions of 6-C-i4-glucose and U-C-14- glucose to plasma glucose specific activity The value of E was observed to increase moderately between sixty minutes and 180 minutes of 6-C-14- glucose infusion; it remained unchanged from its 120 to 180-minute value over the 180 to 360-minute period in an experiment in which an unlabeled oral glucose load was given (table 3). Consequently, the mean value of E observed in the 120 to 180-minute period of 6-C-14 glucose infusion (just prior to the U-C-14- glucose load) was used to remove the influence of the recycled C-14 from the counting data obtained during the absorption of the glucose load. The C-14 activity in the dimedon derivative (expressed as ju,c/gm. total glucose carbon) had 1/3 E subtracted from it; let the corrected value be G. The C-14 activity in the glu- cosotriazole derivative (expressed as ,/ic/gm. total glucose carbon) had 4/3 E subtracted from it; let the corrected value be H. Then H—G represented the activity in carbons 1 through 5 due to U-C-14 glucose; the total activity due to U-C-14-glucose in all carbons of plasma glucose was then 6/5 (H—G) in /AC per gm. total glucose carbon. The activity in carbon 6 (dimedon derivative) denoted as G, included contributions from U-C-14-glu- cose as well as from 6-C-i4-glucose. The value G-i/5(H—G) was then the activity in plasma glucose due to 6-C-i4-glucose, in/xcper gm. total glucose carbon. Calculation of the rate of inflow of the oral glucose load, and of the endogenous glucose production rate The glucose space was calculated from the corrected plasma glucose specific activities (D—1/3 E) observed during 6-C-i4-glucose infusion prior to administration of the oral glucose load; the calculation is described elsewhere. 2 Using this value to calculate Bt, the glucose half-pool size, at any given plasma glucose concentra- tion, the equations described elsewhere 8 were used to calculate glucose input and outflow rates between suc- cessive observed values of plasma glucose concentration and specific activity during the absorption of the oral glucose load. Specific activities due to 6-C-i4-glucose were used in equations (4a) and (5a) of the previous publication, 8 along with the known infusion rate (F fx,c C-14/min.) of 6-C-i4-glucose, to calculate total in- put and outflow of glucose. This included both en- dogenous and oral load glucose inputs to the circulating blood. Equation (4a) was then used a second time, inserting this time the specific activities due to U-C-14- glucose and the value for the total glucose input obtained by the first use of equation (4a). This allowed calculation between successive observation points of F' (fxc C-14/min.), the rate of input of C-14 due to absorption of the oral U-C-14-glucose load. Having found F for the interval, the oral load glucose input (in gm. C/min.) could be calculated, since the //.c per gm. C in the glucose load was known. This value sub- i tracted from total glucose input gave the endogenous glucose production rate, in gm. C/min.

RESULTS Figure i shows plasma glucose concentration, glucose release by liver, glucose transfer from gut to peripheral blood, and glucose uptake from blood as judged by observations on samples of peripheral blood in a typical oral glucose load experiment. The calculated values of plasma glucose specific activity due to 6-C-i4-glucose and due to U-C-14-glucose are given also. Table 1 gives the results of the four experiments in which load absorption and endogenous glucose release were measured simultaneously. The prompt increase in plasma insulin concentration when glucose is ab- sorbed is evident; also the prompt reversion of plasma insulin concentration to control levels when glucose load absorption tapers off. Enhanced glucose uptake by the tissues continues after the fall in plasma in- sulin concentration has occurred; this is in accord with findings in experiments done previously, in which the intravenous infusion of insulin was stopped ab- Mg/kg per hr.

A typical experiment in which U-C-14-glucose ( I gm./kg.; 11.83 /ic/gm. glucose C) was given by stom- ach tube during continuous intravenous infusion (0.241 /ic/min.) of 6-C-l4-glucose in trace amount.

However in these previous experiments the depression of unlabeled glucose release was terminated abruptly when insulin infusion was stopped, whereas in the present circumstances the depression of un- labeled glucose release continues for one-half hour to one hour after plasma insulin concentration has reverted to normal. I t is quite possible that continued extra insulin secretion, in amount insufficient to maintain an elevated peripheral blood insulin concentration, is responsible for the continued depression of unlabeled glucose release by the liver. Table 2 gives a summary of the findings for the four oral glucose load experiments, emphasizing the reductions in hepatic glucose release and the increases in glucose uptake as averaged over the period of active glucose absorption, usually three hours. It includes, for comparison, a row of figures which were obtained in previous experiments, 2 in which insulin was given by peripheral vein along with enough glucose to prevent changes in plasma glucose concentration. Table 3 records the amounts of C-14 found in carbon atoms other than carbon 6 of the circulating glucose, during the continuous intravenous infusion of glucose- 6-C-14 prior to oral U-C-14-glucose administration. The first line includes added observations made in a control experiment after an unlabeled glucose load was ad- ministered: this forms the basis for using C-14 recycling corrections based on the period prior to the oral load as described in the section on Methods. Figure 2 shows plasma glucose concentration, and plasma glucose C-14 content in a control experiment in which no intravenous C-14-glucose was given, but in which 6-C-i4-glucose was given as the oral glucose load. Total C-14 in plasma glucose and the C-14 re- introduced into plasma glucose (by glucose resynthesis from three carbon fragments) are shown separately. As shown by the earlier values (prior to seventy-five min- utes), less than 6 per cent of the C-14-glucose which was transferred from the gut contents to the peripheral blood arrived there by a pathway involving fragmenta- tion and resynthesis. DISCUSSION Over the three-hour period required for the absorp- tion of most of an oral glucose load of 1 gm. per kilo- gram body weight, the liver of the dog has been shown in the present work to release 0.34 gm. per kilogram of new (unlabeled) glucose instead of the 0.63 gm. per kilogram it would otherwise have released.

A control experiment in which 6-C-l4-glucose was given in bulk amount by stomach tube. The C-14 con- tent of plasma glucose is expressed as juc C-14 per gram of plasma glucose carbon. Calculation of the amount of C-14 re-introduced into glucose by resyn- thesis of glucose from C-14 fragments (i.e. 4/ 3 E) is described in the text. The absorbed C-14 lactate derived in small yield from the oral C-14 glucose on its passage through the gut wall into portal vein blood probably contributes to this resynthesis, but a large share of the C-14 is contributed by the same recycling processes which are evident when 6-C-l4-glucose is given by peripheral vein (see text and table 3) .

The use of the value E, which is a measure of the recycling of C-14 contained in metabolic fragments back into the glucose output of the liver, is described in the text. For the 120 to 180-minute period the mean total C-14 in plasma glucose was about 10 jitc/gm. carbon. For reasons given in the text, an E value of 0.45 /xc/gm.C at this time means that 6 per cent of the total C-14 in plasma glucose was recycled C-14. tin this experiment the 6-C-14-glucose infusion was con- tinued after an unlabeled oral glucose load was given at 180 minutes; the load was absorbed as usual during the 180 to 360-minute period as shown by a peak in plasma glucose • concentration, and by an increased total glucose input rate (decline in plasma glucose specific activity). gram instead of the 0.63 gm. per kilogram it would otherwise have been. Since glucose release was lessened by 0.29 gm. per kilogram and glucose uptake was in- creased by 0.40 gm. per kilogram, it may be said from these observations that roughly 42 per cent of the total force toward homeostasis was exerted on glucose pro- duction and about 58 per cent on glucose uptake. Endogenously secreted insulin may be somewhat more effective in decreasing glucose release (relative to in- creasing glucose uptake from peripheral blood) than is insulin administered by peripheral vein; this con- clusion was reached earlier by Madison et al. 9 from other evidence. The present evidence for this is com- plicated by the fact that in the present experiments the amount of insulin secreted was sufficient to decrease unlabeled glucose release by only 97 mg. per kilogram per hour whereas in previously reported experiments 2 we administered enough insulin (along with enough glucose to prevent hypoglycemia) to decrease glucose release by 125 mg. per kilogram per hour. Neverthe- less the increase in glucose uptake which occurred simultaneously was so much greater (table 2) when insulin was given by peripheral vein (393 mg./kg. per hour) than when insulin was endogenously secreted (132 mg./kg. per hour) that it seems quite likely that the conclusion is justified. Decreased glucose release accounted for 42 per cent of the homeostatic response in the present experiments whereas it accounted for 25 per cent of the response in the previous experiments in which insulin was given by peripheral vein (table 2). This difference may well be due to the fact that endogenous insulin passes first through the liver where some is extracted, leaving less for distribution to peripheral tissues. As has been reported by others, 3- 4 it has been found (unpublished experiments) in this laboratory also that more insulin secretion is evoked by an oral glucose load than is evoked when the same amount of glucose is given by way of a peripheral vein. Experiments in which hepatic blood flow and glucose concentration differences (between portal and hepatic vein blood) are measured 9- 10 emphasize the over-all role of the liver in glucose homeostasis. Such measure- ments sum together the decrease in hepatic glucose pro- duction brought about by insulin, and the increase in hepatic glucose uptake brought about by insulin and by the elevated blood glucose concentration. In the present experiments, some of the glucose absorbed from the gut failed to reach the peripheral circulation because it was removed on its first pass, in portal vein blood, JULY, 1968 419Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article-pdf/17/7/415/343542/17-7-415.pdf by guest on 21 November 2023 GLUCOSE UPTAKE AND PRODUCTION DURING THE ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST through the liver. Total glucose uptake (which in- cludes hepatic uptake) calculated as it was from the glucose disappearing from the peripheral blood, was thus somewhat underestimated, and at the same time not all of the absorption of the U-C-14-glucose load was measured by observing the influx of U-C-14-glucose into the peripheral blood. About 72 per cent (66 to 77 per cent) of the administered oral glucose was seen to enter the peripheral circulation; other evidence is called upon to assess the meaning of this observation. In the experiments of Kiyasu, Katz and Chaikoff, 11 about 88 per cent of the C-14 found in portal vein blood during the absorption of U-C-14-glucose was present as glucose; much of the other 12 per cent was lactate, formed from the glucose during its passage through the gut wall. In the present experiments, then, 16 per cent (88 less 72 per cent) of the load is un- accounted for; this is an amount which may have been taken up by liver as glucose on its first pass through via the portal vein. However, it is likely that at least some of this 16 per cent of the U-C-14-glucose load was unabsorbed or was converted to gut tissue con- stituents on passage of the glucose through the gut wall. Some years ago it was claimed by Hestrin-Lerner and Shapiro 12- 13 that an unidentified metabolite, rather than glucose, was transmitted to the blood from the gut during glucose absorption. However metabolites other than glucose were shown subsequently, by several groups, to be present in quite small amount, the major one being lactate. 11'14 Nevertheless, in a later com- munication, Tzur and Shapiro 15 questioned the sig- nificance of the findings of Taylor and Langdon 16 who found, after oral i-C-14-glucose administration, that 76 to 91 per cent of the C-14 deposited in liver glycogen was still in carbon 1 of the glucosyl residues. They did so on the ground that the pentose shunt in the gut tissue may have eliminated as CO2 most of the C-14 from a major portion of the incoming i-C-14-glucose. They felt then that this major portion might still have been fragmented and reconverted to glucose without the appearance of the expected amount of C-14 in glycogen in locations aside from carbon 1. The present findings speak against this argument. Glucose labeled in carbon 6 has been shown to give rise to circulating glucose labeled in carbon 6. The randomization was not much, if any, greater than was the case when 6-C-14 -glucose was given by way of a peripheral vein. Furthermore, nearly three quarters of the oral glucose load has been shown to reach the peripheral blood by way of this route, which does not involve randomization of the label of the oral glucose load. During the oral glucose tolerance test, just as in the intravenous test, the release of endogenously produced glucose is not zero and is not constant. Thus a possible advantage of the oral test in terms of ease of inter- pretation is not realized. As has been known for a long time, the results of the oral test can be influenced by delayed, interrupted, or slowed absorption of the glucose load. In the normal dog it has been observed in the presently reported and other experiments in this laboratory that prompt absorption of an oral load was obtained if the dog was unrestrained, or was kept stand- ing upright in a harness after administration of glucose, but not always if the dog was kept lying on its side during the absorption period. The glucose tolerance test is a useful empirical in- dicator of abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism. It may be the case that an impairment of the decrease in glucose release by the liver is always exactly paralleled by an impairment of the increase in glucose uptake which occurs during the test. Until this is established it is not safe to conclude that an impaired glucose tolerance always indicates an inadequate increase in glucose uptake, because a considerable part of the nor- mal response to the test consists of a decrease in the release of new glucose by the liver.
