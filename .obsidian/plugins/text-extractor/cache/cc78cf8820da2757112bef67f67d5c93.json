Calculate voltage, current, power and PF in a balanced 3-phase circuit with complex circuit parameters ii. Calculate the capacitances required to be connected in parallel in a circuit to change the PF from one value to another iii. Calculate the cost servings on utility electricity usage derived from power factor improvement Why AC electricity? Watch Youtube video about AC (Tesla) vs DC (Edison) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyQfrzBfnDU https://youtu.be/gJ1Mz7kGVf0 Also watch this more musical video AC vs DC AC DC • Relatively easy for voltage transformation through use of transformers • Though technically possible, not cost effective in transforming voltages from one level to another • Need bigger conductors than at DC for the same amount of power transfer due to skin effect • Use less and smaller size conductors than AC for the same power due to absence of skin effect and reactive power • Has reactive power that needs control through various PF correction techniques • Costly inverter and converter equipment Research and think of other differences (advantages and disadvantages) between AC and DC technologies F min conductor Effect increases with frequency Due to eddy currents occurring as a result of rapid changes in current Bty charges","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
