EPIDERMIS ❖Composed of mostly stratified squamous keratinized epithelium. Consisting of chiefly keratinocytes and some clear cells. ❖Irregular junctions occurs between the dermis and epidermis and projections called dermal papillae interdigitate with invaginating epidermal ridges to strengthen adhesion of the two layers. ❖These ridges are more prominent in the palmar and plantar surface and form distinctive patterns=fingerprints. Epidermal ridges Dermal papillae Epidermis Layers of the Epidermis The epidermis consists of 4 layers of keratinocytes (5 layers in thick skin) from superficial to deep ❖Stratum corneum ❖Stratum lucidum (thick skin only) ❖Stratum granulosum ❖Stratum spinosum ❖Stratum basale Stratum Basale ❖Single layer of cuboidal or columnar cells resting on the basement membrane. ❖Intense mitotic activity and contain progenitor cells that contributes to all other epidermal layers. ❖Large central nucleus with intensely basophilic staining cytoplasm. ❖Specialized stratum basale cells; melanocytes produce brown pigments; melanin. Stratum Spinosum ❖Normally the thickest layer ❖Consist of polyhedral cells with a central nuclei, nucleoli and cytoplasm. ❖Actively synthesizes keratin ❖Keratin filaments assemble and converge into radiating bundles and terminate at numerous desmosomes giving a prickle (spiky) appearance around the cells. http://www.vetmed.vt.edu/education/curriculum/vm8054/Labs/Lab14/Lab14.htm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_junction Stratum Granulosum ❖Consists of 1-5 layers of flattened cells. ❖Undergoing terminal process of keratinization, cytoplasm is filled with intensely basophilic keratohyaline granules. ❖Contains small ovoid membrane bound lamella granules. ❖Lamellar bodies undergo exocytosis and gives rise to a lipid impermeable layer around cells. Stratum Lucidum ❖Found only in thick skin ❖Very thin single layer of translucent flattened cells. ❖Highly refractile layer containing eosinophilic cells. ❖Cytoplasm of cells are devoid of nuclei and organelles and are packed with mostly keratin filaments. Stratum corneum Stratum lucidum Stratum spinosum Stratum granulosum Stratum basale Stratum Corneum ❖Consists of 15 to 20 layers of squamous keratinized cells. ❖By the end of keratinization, the cells contain only fibrillar proteins with plasma membranes surrounded by the lipid-rich layer. ❖Fully keratinized or cornified cells called squames are continuously shed at the epidermal surface as the desmosomes and lipid-rich cell envelopes break down. Thick skin Thin skin Cells of the Epidermis ❖Keratinocytes ❖Predominant cell type ❖Keratin formation ❖Cell proliferation ❖Epidermal water barrier ❖Pigmentation ❖Clear cells ❖Melanocytes ❖Langerhans cells ❖Merkel cells Melanocytes ❖Found in the stratum basale ❖Neural crest derivative ❖Pale-staining, rounded cell bodies attached to the basal lamina, but lacking attachments to the neighboring keratinocytes ❖Melanocyte produce melanin but melanin deposits are stored by neighboring keratinocytes in the basal and spinous layers. Merkel’s cells ❖Found in the stratum basale ❖Sensitive mechanoreceptors essential for touch sensation. ❖The basolateral surfaces of the cells contact expanded terminal discs of unmyelinated sensory fibers penetrating the basal lamina. ❖Abundant in sensitive skin such as the fingertips. Langerhans cells ❖Usually most clearly seen in the stratum spinosum. ❖Mesenchymal origin ❖Are antigen-presenting cells. ❖Cytoplasmic processes extend from these dendritic cells between keratinocytes of all the layers. ❖Functions as a major component of the skin’s adaptive immunity.

DERMIS ❖Layer of connective tissue derived from mesoderm. ❖Supports the overlying epidermis and anchors it to the hypodermis. ❖The surface is irregular with many projections; dermal papillae that interdigitates projections of the epidermis; epidermal pegs. ❖The dermis contains microvascular plexus and lymphatic vessels. ❖The papillary dermis also contains sensory afferent nerve fibres network. Epidermal ridges Dermal papillae DERMIS ❖Papillary layer- thin layer of loose connective tissue with fibroblast, cell and fibres that anchor to the basal lamina and bind the epidermis to the dermis. ❖Reticular layer- thicker layer of dense irregular connective tissue.
